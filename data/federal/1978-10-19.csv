2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Commando Expeditions: Award of Medal To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The Humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectively showeth: 1. In 1943 and 1944 two small scale raids were undenaken by Australian and British Commandos on shipping in Singapore Harbour. 2. The first operation named 'Jaywick' reached Singapore in September 1943 from a base in Australia using a captured Japanese vessel known as 'The Krait', sank seven (7) ships, a total of39,000 tons and returned to Australia. This was the longest successful small scale raid in the history of War. 3. The second operation named 'Rimau' attempted to repeat that raid in September 1944. The raid was detected in the entrance to Singapore Habour and the commandos were forced to retire. A submarine sent to pick them up did not keep the appointed R.V. and the raiding pany was forced to set out for Australia in their canoes. 4. Many of the commandos were killed by Japanese panies near the Indonesian Islands. an incredible feat of endurance and heroism, paddled two thousand five hundred (2,500) miles from Singapore to Romang Island only 400 miles from Australia. This journey was one of the most fantastic in the history of war-in the history of the sea. 5. All the Commandos who had not been killed were finally captured, coun martialled arid ceremoniously executed in Singapore by Samurai Sword only 39 days before the Japanese surrender. 6. The Commandos were ceremoniously executed because the Japanese consideredTt would be a disgrace to the fine spirit of these if we thought of saving their lives.' Major Kamiya the prosecutor at the Japanese Coun Martial who made the above comment went on to say, inter alia'These heroes must have left Australia with sublime patriotism flowing in their breasts and with the confident expectation of all the Australian people on their shoulders. 'As we respect them, so we feel our duty of glorifying their last moments as they deserve, and by doing so the names of these heroes will remain in the hearts of the British and Australian people for evermore.' 7. Due to the secrecy surrounding operation 'Rimau' its members were completely ignored and received no recognition at all. No attempt was made by the authoriues to inform the relatives of the circumstances of death. The only official notification was that they had been killed acuon in 1945. It was not until the publication of a book called 'The Heroes' by Ronald MCKie in 1960 that the relatives read for themselves of the manner in which commandos died. 8. To date, the exploits and deaths of the 'Rimau' mandos have not remained undying in Australian as the Japanese expected, following the ceremonial execution. They have been forgotten and ignored by Australia. They are the Forgotten Heroes. 9. On Saturday 8 July 1978, the 33rd Anniversary of the end of operation 'Rimau', the members of the 1 Commando Association held a memorial parade to honor the memory of these gaUant men, and of the men of PETITIONS 'Jaywick' many of whom were also members of the 'Rimau' raiding party. The parade was held before the Geat War Memorial in Hyde Park Sydney. Relatives of the men of'Jaywick' and 'Rimau' were flown from all pans of Australia to be present. A specially commissioned March called 'The Forgotten Heroes' was played for the first time by the Band of the New South Wales Police Force. 10. At the Memorial Parade a medal in the form of the drawing reproduced hereon was presented on behalf of each of the members of operation 'Jaywick' and 'Rimau'. The medal was designed and presented because repeated requests by the 1 Commando Association at all levels of Government to obtain some official recognition for these men had been refused. Your Petitioners humbly pray that the members, in the House assembled, will take the most urgent steps to approve the conferring of the medal on the men of 'Jaywick' and 'Rimau' on behalf of the people of Australia to honor the memory of these gallant men so that future generations of Britain and Australia will know and admire what these men did and their memory will remain in the hearts of the British and Australian people for evermore. And your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Armitage, Mr Baume, Mr Kevin Cairns, Mr Dobie, Mr Fry, Mr Graham, Mr Les search Johnson, Mr Keating, Dr Klugman, Mr Martin, Three commandos in Mr Neil and Mr Stewart.

The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (1) That the undersigned are gready concerned about the unemployment problems relating panicularly to young people and wish to draw the immediate attention of the government to the inadequate retraining programmes being provided. (2) We respectfully request the government to immediately reverse its decision not employment training scheme at Green Valley operated by the Sydney city mission and call upon the government to provide the necessary funds for its continuation. (3) We, the undersigned, request the government to stan funher vocational employment training schemes in high unemployment areas. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Baume and Mr Kerin. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showethThat we believe the Federal Government changes to the health insurance system are unjustified, costly and artificially bureaucratic. The planned abolition of bulk billing will place an unnecessary burden on the poor and the disadvantaged in our community. The decision to reduce the rebate paid from 85 per cent to 75 per cent of the scheduled fee is an attack on real wages. Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government should reverse its decisions on these matters and develop proper consultation with the trade unions and the community. And your Petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Cohen and Dr Klugman. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The humble Petition of we the undersigned citizens of AustraUarespectfullyshowethThat because this budget will funher increase the number of persons unemployed, because it reduces the average worker's spendmg power by $ 10 per week, because it will reduce the income of pensioners, because it is unfair in placing a greater burden on the poor rather than the rich, and because it is driving this country into a depression. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that The Federal Government withdraws this budget and provides Australia, within this vised budget that increases the level of economic activity in Australia, lowers unemployment, removes the burdens placed on the disadvantaged, and revives business and consumer confidence in the future of this potentiaUy great countiy. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, by Mr Cohen and Mr Wallis. Petitions received. Metric System To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth objection to the Metric system and request the Government to restore the Imperial system. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Donald Cameron. to proceed with the vocational Petition received. Royal Commission on Human Relationships To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That because the Repon of the Royal Commission on Human Relationships and especially its Recommendations(a) Have been widely condemned for its suppon of unMedibank Austrahan, anti-family, anti-child behaviour and morals such as incest, promiscuity, abonion, pornography, homosexuahty, prostitution and brothels, etc. (Note: Refer quotations reverse side) (b) Have been strongly criticised by the medical profession for the absence of an medical practitioner on the Commissioner or on its staff of 31 persons, and for the Commissioners action in rejecting or ignoring relevant medical evidence. (c) Have been discredited as irresponsible in adopting a new definition of the family, i.e., 'a varying range of people Uving together in relationships of commitment', which has effectively confused the real meaning and intentions of the Report where itrefersto the 'family'. Therefore the Parliament has aresponsibUityto the famUies of Australia not to adopt this controversial Report and its Recommendations. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: That the Australian Parliament will: (a) Simply receive the Report and not adopt its Recommendations, (b) Set up a Select Parliamentary Committee along the lines of the New Zealand Select Committee to conduct a The Budget public inquiry into the ways and means of supporting and strengthening family life and providing adequate protection for chUdren from physical and sexual abuse before as well as after birth in accordance with the UNO Declaration of the Rights of the Child as part of Australia's suppon for the Year of the Child. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will take no measures concerning the Royal Commission on Human Relationships Report that will further undermine and weaken marriage, chUd-care or the family which is the basic unit of our society. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will eveiy pray, by Mr Dobie. session of Parliament, with a rePetition received. Education To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that we believe that aU people have the tight to quaUty education, and that it is the responsibiUty of Government to ensure that sufficient funds are aUocated to enable aU who wish to exercise that right, to do so. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray: 1. That education expenditure on post-school education and on Government schools be substantiaUy increased. 2. That any 'supplementary' or 'comprehensive' loans scheme proposal for post-school students be rejected, not only because it would force the most needy into debt, but because it completely abandons the principle of education as a right. Your petitioners believe that the full or partial replacement of a means-tested grants scheme with such a loans scheme would erode the quaUty and accessibility of education in Australia. 3. That Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances, and aU social service benefits, be increased to 120 per cent of the 'Henderson Poverty Line', this being defined by the Poverty Inquiry as the level of'poverty' (currently $77.60 per week). 4. That TEAS and other student allowance schemes, and all social service benefits, be fuUy and automatically indexed quarterly to movements in the Consumer Price Index, or equivalent needs-based index. 5. That all students accepted for study at a post-school education institution, subject to a means test on personal income, receive the TEAS allowance, and be given 'independent' status. And your peutioners, in duty bound, will ever pray, by Mr Hodgman. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled the Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That the decision of the Australian Government to depart from its 197S election promise, a promise re-affirmed during the 1977 election campaign, that pensions would be increased twice-yearly in line with increases in the CPI, will seriously add to the economic burdens now borne by those citizens who are wholly or mainly dependent on their pensions. Your petitioners are impelled by this fact to call upon the Australian Government as a matter of urgency to review the above mentioned decision, and to determineThat pensions will be increased in the CPI as promised by the Prime Minister in 1973 poUcy speech. And your petitioners in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. Post Graduate Research Awards To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned, members of the Sydney University Post Graduate Representative Association, and like people, respectfully showeth that the Government decision to tax Commonwealth Post Graduate Research Awards will result in: (a) a funher serious decline in Uving standards for postgraduate scholars search for the Australian community and (b) a reducuon in the standard of research at the universities as top scholars will be forced to reject offers of inadequatelyfinancedResearch Awards. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will reverse the decision to tax Commonwealth Postgraduate Research Awards and reven to the former policy of annual adjustments in line with the Consumer Price Index. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Les Johnson. Petition received. Aged Persons Accommodation To: The Honourable, the Speaker, and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. (a) The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth(a) That surveys reveal a substantial percentage of adults over the age of 55 years in the LoftusEngadine-Heathcote and Waterfall areas of the Hughes electorate, are in urgent need of special housing and nursing home accommodation. (b) That many famUies in the area are experiencing difficulty in the placing of their aged parents in suitable nursing care; many cases having to be placed in care many kilometres from their families and consequently causing great strain on the relatives concerned. (c) That this problem is aggravated by this area's geographical and pubUc transpon isolation from the rest of the Sutherland Shire. (d) That Government subsidised nursing homes in other parts of the Hughes and Cook electorate have long waiting-lists and in fact, have closed their Usts Pensions to funher inquirers. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled will1. Acknowledge that there is a need for the construction of an aged persons complex in this area as already acknowledged by the Federal/State Co-ordinating Committee for Nursing-Home accommodation in NSW. 2. Take immediate action to provide sufficient funds in the currentfinancialyear to finance the construction and maintenance ofan aged-persons complex, providing hostel and nursing bed accommodation in this area.

South Australian Country Rail Services To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: 1. That any downgrading or closures of Countiy Rail Services in South Australia would have grave consequences for the Railway Industry, Primary Industry, Individual Country Communities and the State as a whole and calls on the Parliament to ensure that the Federal Minister for Transpon takes the necessary action to maintain all existing services. 2. That continued and increased Public Subsidy is fully justified in the long term National Interest.

Medical Benefits: Abortions To the Honourable, the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: That the provision of payments for abortion through items of the Medical Benefits Schedule is an unacceptable endorsement of abortion which has now reached the levels of a national tragedy with at least 60,000 unborn babies being kffledinl977. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government will so amend the Medical clude the payment of any benefit for abortion. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Yates. Petition received.",17
3,Mr YATES,Unknown," I give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall move: That this House, mindful of the great sacrifice that thousands of Australian servicemen and women have made for peace in the Middle East and Lebanon in 2 World Wars(1) calls upon the Government to take action in cooperation with the Commonwealth Governments and nop ahgned Governments to end the chaos and deT struction of beautiful Lebanon by asking the Australian Minister at the United Nations to invite the Security Council to(a) pass a resolution placing Lebanon under temporaiy United Nations trusteeship; (b) appoint a United Nations resident Commissioner to assist President Sarkis to restore order; (c) confirm that draw beyond Bekka; (d) obtain additional United Nations units from Canada, Australia, New Zealand as well as Pakistan, and (e) take steps to arrange later for a United Nations plebiscite to be held to determine which regions, if any, wish to secede to Syria; (2) calls for the appointment of an International Constitutional Commission to re-write the paralysed and worn out Lebanese constitution to ensure that Lebanon becomes a confederate neutral state Uke Switzerland, and (3) invites the Prime Minister to send the Foreign Minister to Lebanon and to the United Nations so that the world can be sure that take the initiative in international affairs ticular, to help the Lebanese people throughout the world.",20
4,Mr NEIL,Unknown," I give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall move: That the House notes: (1) the terrible loss of Ufe, property and other human suffering being caused in Lebanon; (2) that there are about 150,000 Australians of Lebanese origin with up to half a mUlion immediate relatives in Lebanon; (3) that Australia has recently done more to assist Lebanese persons to resettle in Australia on a pro rata basis than any other nation; and (4) that the present situation threatens the existence of ' Lebanon and the Camp David accords. The House therefore calls upon the Government to extend even further its humanitarian programs of assistance, to prepare further plans to assist quasi refugees and to indicate to the United Nations a willingness to participate in any properly constituted extended United Nations peace keeping force. Benefits Schedule as to preNA NA",20
5,Mr HURFORD,MOTOR VEHICLE PLAN,"My question should be LEBANON directed to the Acting Minister for Industry and Commerce, but in his absence I ask the Prime Notice of Motion Minister: Is it a fact that the 30 per cent devaluation of the Australian dollar in relation to the yen has meant a higher Australian content requirement under the motor .vehicle plans than was the intention when the plans were formulated? Is it a fact that the adjustments announced by the Minister yesterday do not offset completely the effects of the 30 per cent devaluation and have left Chrysler Austraha Limited and possibly other motor manufacturing companies paying large penalties for factors over which they had no control? Is it also a fact that these large penalties may result in a further disastrous loss of employment? Is it true that General Motors-Holden's Ltd and the Syrian armed forces will with the Ford Motor Co. of Austraha Ltd can now reduce their local content from over 90 per cent to 85 per cent, thus creating more unemployment? Without wishing in any way to support or criticise the changes made yesterday but seeking information, I ask the Prime Minister why the Government has not allowed a full adjustment for the 30 per cent devaluation and why he has allowed the abolition of the reversion control procedures.",20
6,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MOTOR VEHICLE PLAN,"That is a detailed question. I will treat it as though it were on notice Australia is able and wUling to and, in parand ask my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to give the honourable gentleman a full reply. I make only one point, and that LEBANON is that the companies entered into a motor vehicle plan. They knew the rules of the plan. Quite Notice of Motion plainly, any adjustments during the currency of the plan would have to be justified in relation to equity for all companies. There have been a number of currency variations, not just the variations between the yen and the Australian dollar. Quite clearly, there is a difficulty in achieving complete equity if we move away from the basis of the plan itself. Because of the extensive nature of some of the currency movements some adjustment was made. I think that the companies that have benefited from that adjustment might well be thankful that the adjustment was made rather than grumble too much that a greater adjustment was not made. Mr MARTYR Has the Minister for Trade and Resources seen today's announcement by Hamersley Holdings of a heavy fall in earnings for the first three quarters of 1978? Has he read the statement by the company that the drop is due to lower tonnage shipments to Europe and Japan and reduced prices? Is the Minister concerned at the declining sales revenue of Australia's iron ore producers as exemplified by the Hamersley results? Finally, is this one of the reasons for the review of export control procedures which he is currently undertaking?",20
7,Mr ANTHONY,MOTOR VEHICLE PLAN,"Certainly declining tonnages have been the reason for Hamersley Holdings' reduced profitabUity which was announced in the newspapers today. I think we all have to recognise that there is slackness in the world's steel making situation. That is particularly so in Japan. During my visit there earUer this year I acknowledged that inevitably there would be some cut-back in tonnages, although I did not want to see any reduction in the prices being paid for Australian iron ore. However, some negotiations have been carried out recently in regard to new contracts, but these contracts have been at prices in which I have been disappointed and which I considered to be unreasonable. It is for these reasons that I have been having consultations with the industry as to how the marketing arrangements might be reexamined and tightened up. Certainly the Government does not take the point of view that it should look merely at the profitability ofan individual company, although we are concerned about having a healthy mining industry. I think the major interest is the national interest. We have to ensure not only that we secure maximum tonnages at prevaUing market conditions but also that we receive the best possible price which is fair and reasonable so that we get the maximum export earnings to improve our balance of payments situation. Our balance of payments situation is not one that can be taken casually. It has to be looked at seriously in terms of our major industries, such as the iron ore industry, the coal industry and the bauxite industry, all of which make a major contribution to our balance of payments situation. It is for reasons of national interest that I am consulting with the companies to find out the best way of handling the situation to ensure that Australian mining interests can demand what I consider to be fair and reasonable market conditions in the prevaUing world situation. NA IRON ORE Mr LIONEL BOWEN-I draw the Prime Minister's attention to an article ih last Sunday's National Times entitled: 'How ""plumbers"" got at the Victorian Liberals'. In particular I draw his attention to the eight instances of break-ins at the offices or homes of Liberal Party members or associates involved in the Victorian land scandals or other controversial issues on the Mornington Peninsula. Noting that the Prime Minister would be concerned at the impUcations in this very well documented article of a pattern of criminal acts which have caused damage to troublesome sections within the party and to individuals",21
8,Mr SPEAKER,CRIMINAL ACTS,Order! The question is out of order.,21
9,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CRIMINAL ACTS,"I seek to ask a question in relation to the matter, if I may have your indulgence, Mr Speaker. The question is this: Have the Commonwealth Pohce been asked to intervene in this matter?",21
10,Mr SPEAKER,CRIMINAL ACTS,"I wtil permit the question, but I draw the attention of the honourable gentleman to the fact that the preamble to the question dealt with matters about which it is not in order to ask questions in this House. However, I will permit thefinalquestion.",21
11,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CRIMINAL ACTS,I have not asked the final question.,21
12,Mr SPEAKER,CRIMINAL ACTS,The honourable gentleman is stretching my indulgence to an extent further than I normally permit on Thursday mornings.,21
13,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,CRIMINAL ACTS,"Noting that criminal acts have occurred, I ask the Prime Minister: Have the Commonwealth PoUce or any other Commonwealth investigatory agency been asked to investigate these criminal acts including the possible use of telephone taps or bugging devices in contravention of the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act?",21
14,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CRIMINAL ACTS,I have not read the article to which the honourable gentleman referred.,21
15,Mr COHEN,CRIMINAL ACTS,Giv e him a copy.,21
16,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CRIMINAL ACTS,"I do not think I would be any wiser if I did read it. The honourable gentleman suggested that criminal acts had occurred. If allegations of criminal acts have been made, those making the allegations have open to them the possibility of making their evidence available to the appropriate authorities and having the matter investigated. I would imagine that if they were concerned about the allegations they would have done just that. I would have thought that in most instances the appropriate authority would have been the State potice. I am not aware of any involvement or request for the involvement of the Commonwealth police. I am quite certain that if it is within its proper province and activity, an appropriately placed request to the Commonwealth police would get the kind of response that one would expect. Allegations of criminal activities should be pursued under the normal processes of the law. NA",21
17,Mr DRUMMOND,RHODESIAN IMMIGRANTS,Has the Minister for Imno migration and Ethnic Affairs seen a report allegpresent ing that the Government has failed to honour obUgations in accordance with the Nations Security Council resolution in relation to Rhodesia; that it is in fact admitting Rhodesians contrary to that resolution; and that the Governcussed ment is using its program for the Chinese refugees as a means of legitimising entry of Rhodesians?,22
18,Mr MACKELLAR,RHODESIAN IMMIGRANTS,"I have seen reports in today's newspapers which carry a statement from the Opposition spokesman on immigration and ethnic affairs aUeging that Australia dering the entry of Rhodesians via South Africa. I think it is one of the more fanciful statements that have emanated from the ranks of the Opposition since 1975. People from Rhodesia are gible to apply for migrant entry to Australia on exactly the same basis as anyone else throughout the world, subject to two conditions, that is, they have not furthered or encouraged the Ulegal regime in Rhodesia and that they do not travel on Rhodesian passports. Subject conditions, Rhodesians can apply for migrant entry to Australia and they are considered on exactly the same basis as any other individual the world. The fact that we do not have a miVictorian gration office in Rhodesia means that they apply outside that country. The principal point apphcation is Pretoria. We have studiously adhered to the terms of the 1968 resolution relating to sanctions against Rhodesia. To suggest that we have used the Indo-Chinese refugee situation as a means of sisting the entry of Rhodesians is, I think, to denigrate Australia's response-no t only the ation. Government's response to the Indo-Chinese refugee situation but also the assistance that has been given by voluntary agencies and the Australian community generally. The Opposition spokesman seems to be at a loss to understand the fact that those people coming from the camps in Malaysia and ThaUand are put through the process by immigration officers and are given resident status. Those people who have arrived without authorisation are not given resident status; they are given temporary residence status until their refugee status is examined and a decision is made on it. It really is a most fanciful statement and one which does the honourable member no credit. NA",22

21,Mr SIMON,CONFERENCE,"Is the Prime Minister aware of a statement which is reported in today's issue of the Australian that the President of the Ausis launtralian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Bob Hawke, considers that the National Employment Conference convened by the Victorian Premier is 'becoming more and more a useless exercise'? eliHas the Commonwealth Government in any way varied its decision to support Mr Hamer's initiative? Is Mr Hawke correct in stating that the Comthat monwealth Government wtil be inadequately represented? What role will the Commonwealth Government play at this important and sigto these two nificant conference?",22
22,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CONFERENCE,"I believe that the in conference to be held under the auspices of the Government, and with the full support must and co-operation of the Commonwealth of Government-suppor t and co-operation which will continue no matter what other people might do-shoul d be a very useful one; one which I hope will lead to a better understanding of the present situation and at the sametimewtil throw open for sensible discussion and criticism a asnumberof the nuts and bolts programs which are designed to assist in what is a very difficult situI am quite certain that the contribution of the Commonwealth will be appreciated. I think it is a great pity that the President of the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions is casting doubt on trade union participation, although I note that at the moment he is speaking for the ACTU, and the Victorian Trades Hall might well take another attitude in relation to this. What Mr Hawke has done over recent days, not only in relation to this conference but also in relation to other conferences in which he is involved with the Commonwealth, indicates a capacity for grandstanding which does not augur well for major conferences which involve Mr Hawke as a participant. I believe that is a pity because there is no doubt that the Austrahan Council of Trade Unions, without the grandstanding, has an important contribution to make to matters of this kind. The Government's foresight in relation to the problems which are now coming to be more widely understood goes back quite some time. The Department of Productivity was established, and even though when it was first announced it was accepted with some degree of cynicism I am quite certain that now its very real role and worth in helping to work for better productivity, for the introduction of new technology and hence for the expansion of Australian industry and for more jobs in Austrahan industry, is coming to be widely understood. Already there are very significant productivity improvement programs in a number of important industries, in Victoria in particular. The role of the Department and how it is undertaking its task, through tripartite consultations between trade unions, management and government, will be up for discussion and explanation to see whether, as a result, it can be improved. That is something that we would certainly welcome. The Williams and Crawford inquiries were appointed a considerable time ago, as the terms of reference make very plain, against the background of a Commonwealth concern for the future of education and training and hence for the employment prospects of many, many thousands of Australians. The causes which led the Government to move in that direction will also be under discussion at the conference. A number of other programs in which the Commonwealth is involved, and which have been modified, extended and changed, and which in the light of experience might well be modified in the future, will also be explained. They will be discussed at the conference. I have no doubt that there will be criticisms. I hope that there will also be some praise for the programs. I refer to the Commonwealth Youth Support Scheme, the National Employment and Training Program, the Special Youth Employment Training Program, the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-Time Training and the Education Program for Unemployed Youth. The last, in particular, is a program that has been very well received. It is providing help for unemployed Austrahans who maybe had nobody care for them in their lives before they entered into that program. It is a program that warrants full support and, to the extent that is necessary to help young men and women in that particular category, it is one that is being expanded. Other programs, such as the investment allowances, and the export incentive grants, which are also related to increased employment in Austraha, export market development grants and industrial research and development grants, most of which have been very extensively increased under this Budget, despite its financial stringency overall, will also be explained and discussed. I would hope that the discussion would be useful and would help guide the Commonwealth in relation to future policy formation. The reduction in the sales tax on motor vehicles in another matter that is not unrelated to employment. The preferential government procurement policy is certainly not unrelated to activity in Austrahan industry, and hence to Austrahan employment. I still have doubts as to whether the procurement programs of the State governments give the same degree of preference to Australian industry as does the program and purchasing policy of the Commonwealth. I hope that that can be exposed at the conference and that maybe the States will be able to follow our lead in giving greater preference to Austrahan industry. Productivity improvement, the role of the Department of Productivity, training in industry and commerce, assistance for specific industries, the role of the Industries Assistance Commission and the changes to the legislation governing that Commission requiring it to take into account social changes, requiring it to look at something other than the cold, hard and calculating estimates of efficiency, requiring it to look at regional consequences and requiring it to look at employment consequences, will also be explained and examined at this conference. In other words, the contribution of the Commonwealth at this conference is going to be a very full one indeed. The range of programs which this Government has devised to assist Australian industry, to assist Australian employment and to repair much of the damage caused by our predecessors-the damage which they now seek to hide by a certain degree of noise-wil l be explained, discussed, examined and, I have no doubt, criticised at the conference. It will be a very useful conference indeed and a nuts and bolts arrangement that is designed to promote and support Australian industry.",22
23,Mr YOUNG,CONFERENCE,"I take a point of order. This is not only a very lengthy answer but also a sham. There are 400,000 people out of work. Why do you not tell them about your programs?",24
24,Mr SPEAKER,CONFERENCE,Order! There is no point of order.,24
25,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CONFERENCE,"As a result of this conference, I believe, there will be a better understanding",24
26,Mr HAYDEN,CONFERENCE,"I take a point of order. The proper place for the Prime Minister to defend himself against attack from within his own party is in the party room, not in this Parliament during Question Time. He is taking up Question Time. He has been going for 7 minutes.",24
27,Mr SPEAKER,CONFERENCE,There is no point of order. The honourable gentleman will resume his seat.,24
28,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CONFERENCE,"As a result of this conference I am sure there will be a better understanding that at any one time there are about 110,000 Australians, many of them young Australians, being assisted by the specific programs of this Government. I have no doubt that the Australian Labor Party does not like there being a better appreciation of that fact. Also, there will be a better understanding that many tens of thousands of Australians have already gone through those programs and are in permanent work as a result. I believe that it will be a pity if Mr Hawke and the Australian Council of Trade Unions do not participate and do not make a contribution. I hope they will be able to do it constructive manner and a workmanlike manner. But if Mr Hawke is to grandstand and is to walk out, so be it. That just indicates a certain basic lack of concern by the Australian Council of Trade Unions for those who are now unemployed and indicates a growing awareness that it is principally responsible for unemployment in the wages policies that it has pursued, in its attitude to penalty rates and in its attitude to wage rates for young people in this community, all of which make it much harder for people to be employed. 1I have no doubt that if Mr Hawke does not attend and does not contribute",24

You were anxious to draw to my attention to a matter of criminal action in Victoria not being within the ambit of the Prime Minister's responsibUity.

42,Mr SPEAKER,CONFERENCE,Order! There is no point of order.,24
43,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CONFERENCE,"If Mr Hawke in the end does not attend this conference I believe that significantly that will be because he knows that the wages policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions is coming to be recognised as a major cause of continued high unemployment, especially amongst young Australians, and he would not want to be examined and cross examined on that point. I beheve that there is coming to be a much greater understanding that the wages pohcies so noisily promoted by Mr Hawke lead to greater and greater unemployment, especially amongst young Australians. Mr Hawke should be prepared to have those policies discussed at this conference, and he should expose himself to cross-examination on that matter and enable there to be full debate and discussion on the way in which the Australian Council of Trade Unions shows concern for those in employment but no concern whatsoever for those who currently do not have jobs. NA NA",24
44,Mr HAYDEN,CONFERENCE,"I ask the Prime Minister a question supplementary to that which he has answered. If the Prime Minister ference on unemployment as one as important as he has described, will he advise why the Commonwealth was so reluctant and grudging wishes in making its decision to participate? If the ference is as important as he asserts, advise why the Government is sending a Minister who ranks twenty-second on the ministerial seniority list-almos t at the bottom of ity list? If he regards this conference as being as important as he has said, why has he not at least dispatched the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations? But more importantly, if he regards this conference as being as important he has described, why does he not extend to it the same regard as has the Premier of Victoria and Parliament. attend himself?",25
45,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CONFERENCE,"I regret that the Leader of the Opposition did not regard my answer as adequate or full. Apparently he is at some difference with one or two ofhis colleagues in relation to that point. The Commonwealth does regard this conference as important of its specific nature. It will enable an examination of the Commonwealth programs of the kind that I have mentioned, all of which are addressed to Australia's current economic probwithdraw. lems. It will enable those matters to be discussed against the background of the Victorian part of the Australian economy and their particular impUcations for Victoria to be assessed. it possible for an assessment to be formed of their importance and relevance to the industrial and would employment problems in Victoria. Against that background the kind of conference that is to be held between the Commonwealth and the States, I believe, is appropriately framed. My colleague the Minister for Productivity wiU be well able to represent the Commonwealth's point of view at the conference and I am quite certain that he wtil do it with great effect. The delegates and those who take part in the conference will come away with a much better understanding of the importance and effectiveness of various Commonwealth programs. So the matter rests where it is. I think that one other point comes out of this matter; that is the very great difficulty of establishing a conference which can address this matter in a serious way and which does not lead to grandstanding or politicisation of a problem which has real social and economic consequences that it ought to be possible to discuss in a calm and quiet way without anyone seeking to destroy the conference by threatening walkouts just and without poUtics being introduced by the regards this conOpposition.",25

Were the calculations of a loss of about 7,000 migrants based on Australian Bureau of Statisticsfigures?Is it a fact that total permanent departures between July 1977 and February 1978 were 14,262 persons, or some 6,000 peron sons more than his estimate of settler loss for financial year?",27

67,Mr ANTHONY,NUCLEAR ENERGY,"It is well accepted in countries overseas that nuclear energy is cheaper, cleaner and safer than oil-fired or coal-fired power stations. It is very interesting to read report of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Commission which came out last month. It showed that the cost of producing nuclear power in the Umted Kingdom is half that of producing power from oil or coal and it is helping to give Britian a major advantage. It is little wonder when Dr Mabon, the Labour Minister for ergy, was in Austraha last year he said that was absolutely astonished at the attitude Austrahan Labor Party and of trade unions in Austraha in not supporting uranium development in this country. Members of the Australian Labor Party are like King Canute, thinking that they can hold back the tide. The rest of the world is going with the nuclear development. It is the best alternative to oil and coal for electric power generation. In the Press this morning I noticed a report about the Western Mining Corporation Ltd and its Roxby Downs prospect in South Australia, where it has discovered very promising signs for a copper and uranium mine. I think it is rather unfortunate that the discovery had to be in South Australia, where the Premier seems to be bound by ALP pohcies. It is impossible to mine the copper unless the uranium also is mined. If there is one State in which there is a desperate need to develop more resources to help relieve the unemployment situation and to give a Uttle encouragement to industrial activity, it is South Australia. Yet the ALP poUcy seems to be to turn its back the development of uranium, which probably the offers more prospects for Australia than any other single item. NA",27

78,Dr KLUGMAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Much has been said by the private health insurance funds and the Australian Medical Association, as well as the close associates in this House of those organisations, in favour of persons indiscriminately- I emphasise the word 'indiscriminately'-takin g out medical insurance after 1 November. I consider this to be highly hypocritical coming from those who when attacking the original Medibank, and especially bulk billing, argued for years that this country's economy would collapse if the patient did not pay at the point of service. The AMA and the funds want people to join at maximum rates because that would give them-that is, the AMA and the funds-maximu m profits. They are obviously speaking through their pockets. The State governments will also benefit financially if people enter hospitals as private patients. This Government will not benefit. Let me exthat. Every so-called 'doctor of choice' patient or private patient in a public hospital $40 or $60 towards his daily bed cost about $150. Under the cost sharing arrangements this saves the State governments almost half of the patient contribution. But the Commonwealth must balance this against the fact that it has to pay the universal Commonwealth benefit in relation to the medical costs of these patients while they are in hospital because they are fee for service patients. In many cases this I medical cost to the Commonwealth will exceed the saving on daily bed costs, and it will therefore be in the interests of the Commonwealth Treasury to increase the proportion of standard Let us be quite clear as to why this Government has decided to reduce the direct cost of medical services to the consumer by means of a subsidy of $621 m in a full year, which is brought about by the abolition of the levy and the introduction of a universal medical benefit amounting adjourn until 3 p.m. on Tuesto 40 per cent or more of the common fee, with nobody paying more than $20 for each medical service. The reason for this generosity is to cheat the wage earners out of a significant portion of their next two wage indexation increases by replacing the health levy by the so-called 'temporary' across-the-board tax increase. The health levy aboUtion and the associated decrease in the cost of medical insurance will result in the consumer price index being reduced while at the same time it will not be increased by the tax imposition. Party In an effort to help those who will suffer financial loss because of this move, I suggest to all Australians, both current levy payers and contributors to private funds, that they think very carefully before they commit themselves to health insurance expenditure after 1 November. They should remember that whilst the changes come into effect on 1 November there is no need to join any fund before 31 December, event if they finally decide to do so. Anybody joining a fund before 31 December is covered immediately but a person can probably save 8 weeks' contributions by not joining until that date. If such a person would care to send half the money he saves to the Austrahan Labor Party's election fund, we would certainly appreciate it. The changes make it no longer compulsory for Austrahan residents to pay health insurance. They must choose whether to insure with a private fund or to accept the new universal Commonwealth benefit. This benefit will cover 40 per cent or more of the common fee for each medical service, with a maximum patient payment of $20 for any one service when the common fee is charged. In addition, accommodation in standard wards of public hospitals where treatment is provided by doctors engaged by the hospital will continue to be available free of charge to those persons who are not privately insured for hospital care. The arrangement under which doctors bulk bill the Commonwealth in relation to pensioner health benefit card holders and their dependants who are not privately insured will continue. Bulk billing arrangements will also be available for persons identified by their doctor as 'disadvantaged'. That term has not been defined. In such cases doctors will receive 75 per cent of the schedule fee in full payment for each service. It is to the advantage of people to find a doctor who is willing to bulk bill. If a doctor refuses to do this generally or refuses to do it in the case of a particular person or a particular family, the 40 per cent or $20 gap Commonwealth benefit arrangement applies. In order to receive this payment the patient must register at no charge with the private fund ofhis choice. I recommend registering with Medibank Private to help preserve it as a competitor to the other private funds and to help preserve the jobs of its staff. Medibank Private is already accepting such registrations. The biggest savings under these new arrangesurance. ments will go to those who carefully tailor their insurance to their needs. Medical, hospital ancillary insurance options should be evaluated separately. Generally, for contributors to cal insurance to break even, they will need more than one general practitioner consultation a week or more than two separate major certainly major surgical episodes, as private patients in hospital a year. Very few people in this community are likely to come into those categories. The rest of their contributions will pay for the administration and profits of the private funds. I will explain the position in New South Wales and then will ask for leave to incorporate a table which gives similarfiguresfor the other States. In New South Wales, in order to get an extra 35 per cent refund, people would be paying $3.40 a week, getting back $3.12 for a standard general practitioner consultation and reducing the maximum gap from $20 to $10 a service. A 60 per cent cover, giving a 100 per cent refund with the universal Commonwealth benefit will cost about $4.70 a week. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a similar table for the other States. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsITEM 14-STANDAR D (5-20 MINUTE) GP NA NSW Vic. Tas.

79,Dr KLUGMAN,CONSULTATION,"Peopl e should also consider their hospital insurance cover carefully. Keep in mind that the medical staff at pubhc hospitals are often the most highly qualified and the facilities in pubhc hospitals are generally the best. Also keep in mind, however, that standard ward accommodation may be scarce for optional nonurgent operations. The actual scarcity of accommodation obviously varies from area to area. To summarise the position as I see it, my advice would be to assess carefully one's needs and make whatever savings are possible. Only those people with chronic conditions requiring very frequent medical attention or those people with large famiUes requiring frequent medical attention should consider taking out medical inI emphasise that I am speaking about medical insurance. With regard to hospital inand surance, people must decide whether they are wUling to accept free standard ward accommomedidation with care by a hospital doctor, which often is the best care available, or whether they wish to have at least a theoretical choice of docespisodes, tor or private hospital cover. They should remember that standard ward treatment, with the removal of the levy, is now again completely free as under the original Medibank scheme. The relative cost of insurance is much higher now. The actual hospital insurance has not been increased by the funds but in fact it will increase by about 80c a week for what is called Hospital 1 cover because the Government has withdrawn the subsidy. The fun .Is are scared that people will drop out immediately, so at this stage they are canying that extra cost. In any case the real cost will be the same as it is at present. The relative cost of insurance is of course much higher because it is no longer being compared with the 2Vi per cent levy which one had to pay if one opted for standard ward treatment. From now on people will not be paying any levy. I hope that this general discussion will help people to make a rational decision. I deplore the fact that the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) yesterday in reply to a Dorothy Dix question called my advice 'irresponsible'. I do not think it is irresponsible. It is one of the options. One of the pities is that the Minister when he announced the changes on the night on which the Budget was deUvered in fact quite strongly emphasised that this is one of the choices, and it is a real choice. Yesterday he implied that only people who are well off can afford to take that choice. The proposition is that people who are not well off should pay all that extra money. It is the people who are not well off and cannot afford to pay the extra $3.40 a week who should be thinking very carefully.",29
80,Mr HUNT,CONSULTATION,It is the people who take hospital insurance who need to take medical insurance.,30
81,Dr KLUGMAN,CONSULTATION,"I am not disputing the situation concerning hospital insurance. I have made that point. The maximum cost for any one medical service is $ 10. If a person has an operation volving a surgeon, an anaesthetist and assistant, a number of pathology tests and x-rays, the total cost would be not more than $100 or $120. Is it not ridiculous to take out insurance for that amount? Everyone of us takes out car insurance where that excess is bitilt in. People do not pay the extra money for the excess. It is deplorable to have to pay for it. Nobody likes to pay it. But why pay $3.40 a week in order to reduce the medical costs to half the total amount?",30
82,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSULTATION,Mr M ill a r )Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,30
83,Mr JULL,CONSULTATION,"Once again we have heard the honourable member for Prospect (Dr Klugman) come in here and utter a diatribe about the future health insurance arrangements. I must agree completely with the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) when he says that the comments that the honourable member has made here again today are completely and utterly irresponsible. How can people gamble with their health on the basis that the honourable member has given today? It is good to know that there are responsible people such as the Labor Minister for Health in New South Wales, Mr Stewart, who has completely dissociated himself with the remarks of the honourable member for Prospect. One must think very carefully indeed before making the decision not to go ahead with health insurance from 1 November. I think the honourable member for Prospect should be condemned for inciting this sort of attitude in this House and thereby in the community. That is not the reason why I am speaking in this debate today, I am glad the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Adermann) is in the House at the moment because what I am about to say deals with his portfolio as well as that of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). It concerns war reparation payments made to victims of Nazi persecution during World War II and sections 23(kc) and 23AD(3)(c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Without sounding too melodramatic, I think I should give the backgrounds of the cases of two constituents of my electorate of Bowman that have come to my attention over the last 18 months. I understand from speaking to representatives of the Returned Services League and other bodies that the particular aspects that I am bringing up today, although they are not common, are similar to those in a number of other cases is Australia. The first case concerns a Dutch born person who was a reserve officer in the Dutch Free inForces in Indonesia during World War I I. He fought the Japanese and was duly captured by them and sentenced to a 15-year imprisonment term. He served three years in gaol-in Java, I believe. He lost all his possessions in Indonesia during that time. His wife was separated from him for that period and, I understand, she was put in another prisoner of war camp. His health obviously suffered severely at the hands of the Japanese in the camp and he returned to Holland. When he returned he found that all of the famtiy property in that country had been destroyed by the Nazis and his father had been shot by the Gestapo. He applied for back payment for the term for which he was in gaol in Indonesia but received no payment whatsoever. He worked as a professional librarian. Early in the 1950s, I understand, he migrated to Austraha with his wife, paying his own passage. He worked very hard during his time in Austraha. He had four children, I understand. One of those children is now a major in the Austrahan Army, another is a teacher, another works, in the Austrahan Taxation office and the other is a doctor. One of them served with the Austrahan expedition to the Antarctic. However, the result of the period that he spent in the camp in Indonesia during the war certainly took its toll of his health. When the time came for his retirement he appUed for repatriation benefits but apparently his case did not come within the confines of the guideUnes for the payment of such a pension. After a number of appeals to the Dutch Government, in 1975 he wasfinallygiven a payment of compensation. That money came into the countiy and was duly taxed. As well as that lump sum compensation payveterans ment, he receives a monthly compensation ment from the Dutch Government. However, cause that payment does not fall within the not guidelines of sections 23(kc) and 23AD (3) (c) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, he has to pay tax on it. He is entitled therefore to no pensioner benefits and no benefits through the of Veterans' Affairs. Although these payments which are taxed are coming from the Dutch Government as compensation for what he and his fantily suffered during the war, people who receive compensation payments from the West German Government as victims of Nazi atrociaward, ties apparently have those payments exempted from income tax. It would seem to me that this Dutch born person who, incidently, as soon as he could became an Australian citizen, is having form of discrimination practised against him. The second case is simUar in nature. It conthese cerns a man of Polish extraction who was born in 1916. At the outbreak of World War II he was imprisoned by the Germans but escaped and repatriation joined the Free Polish forces in 1940 when landed in Britain. Those forces were under tish command and eventually, in 1944, he landed back in France with the invasion forces. He returned again to Britain as a second lieutenI ant with the Cross of Valour. He was offered a commission with the British army but, of course, the war ended and he was finally demobbed. In 1943 he married a young lady of British investigated nationaUty and Uved in Scotland. As soon as justice possible he took British citizenship. He had daughters, in 1947, 1951 and 1952, angUcised his name, and continued to live in Scotland until 1962. This gave him 22 years of continuous resimembers dence in Britain. In 1962 he migrated to other Australia and ever since has been employed in a large plastics firm. This year he became entitled to his long service leave. He too, of course, has not first-class health. His wife also is sick and he has decided to retire. On a number of occasions he has inquired as to whether he is entitled to receive Veterans' Affairs pensions. The latest correspondence that I have from the Department of Veterans' Affairs says that Division 5A of the Repatriation Act provides for the grant of service pensions to former members of the forces of Commonwealth countries in the same way as it does to Austrahan veterans; that veterans of Commonwealth forces, to be eligible for service pension, must have lived in Australia continuously at some time for not less than 10 years and must have had theatre-of-war service in a campaign in which Australian veterans were also engaged and in respect of which Australian quaUfy for service pensions; that vetpayerans of the Free Polish forces, even though bethose forces were under British command, are veterans of the British forces; therefore, they do not qualify for benefits under Division 5A of the Repatriation Act. Consequently, this particular gentleman is not eligible to claim a service Department pension from the Department. He is, of course, able to claim an age pension but apparently a man who has served under British command, who was with the invasion forces, who received recognition through a particular who came back and immediately took out British citizenship, who was married to a British citizen and then migrated to Australia in 1962, is not entitled, under this particular section a of the Repatriation Act, to any benefits whatsoever. We reaUy do have an obligation to look after people who, through no fault of their own, do not fall within the guidelines for eligibility for benefits in Australia. Those people, who played their part side by side in many cases he with Australian troops, do not qualify, even Brithough they were under British command, for the M l British service entitlements, and now they find themselves in a rather difficult position. can only stress to the Minister for Veteran's Affairs that this section of the Act, and the section of the Income Tax Act which covers reparation payments for Nazi war atrocities, should be so that we may achieve some sort of for these people who fought so nobly and three bravely during that period of World War II.",30
84,Mr JAMES,CONSULTATION,"Honourable doubtless are aware that recently, with delegates from this national Parliament, I attended the conference of the Commonwealth Parhamentary Associauon in Jamaica. Before returning to Austraha last week I paid a visit to Taiwan. We recall the great embarrassment that was caused a few years ago to our Government when it had to face reaUty and recognise mainland China in the forums of the world. However, my mission in rising today is to point out how impressed I was with the advances-made by the Taiwanese, particularly in relation to fish farming. As I witnessed that progress in Taiwan I wondered whether the Australian Government would interest itself in this industry as a means providing gainful employment for the Vietnamese refugees who have been flowing into northern Australia. I am pleased to see in the House the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Adermann), who is so well versed in matters in the Northern Territory, and I hope that both he and the Minister for mary Industry (Mr Sinclair) will interest themThere selves in my submission. Before I went overseas the media were emphasising that tries for the employment of refugees should be initiated in the northern part of Austraha. We know, from experience with refugees from other countries, that the first problem they face is language problem, but fish farming, the detaUs of which I propose to spell out a little later, would not present language difficulties to people, who have sought Australia as their future home and have, on humanitarian grounds, been permitted to settle here. Their arrival has caused some embarrassment to the Government. I am sure that if Labor had been in office it also have been embarrassed. Their arrival is also required. causing concern to the Australian people but, as has been pointed out in this chamber, Australia could never turn back the Vietnamese, with their leaking boats. If they were to be drowned we would be seen as despicable in the eyes of the world. In Taiwan I consulted some very eminent people in thefishfarming industry. One was Prosuggested fessor Doctor T. J. Lee, director of the Taiwan Fisheries Research Institute, of 199 Hou-Ih Road, Keelung, Taiwan. I visited afishfarming project with a Mr Richard Yu, the director of Global Fishing Company of Taiwan, and saw about 1 SOfishponds in whichfishof a species for which there is a ready market in Japan, at $1,500-$ 1,700 per ton, were being produced. The fish breeds to an edible size, about one or a Uttle over a pound, infivemonths. They also produce an abundance of crabs, eels and prawns in the fish farming projects of Taiwan. If Government is not considering something of a more attractive nature, such a project, in my view, would be ideal for absorbing at minimum cost, the unemployed Vietnamese and many of our Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. It does not call for great sktil and is labourintensive. With the possibUity of the Ranger uranium deposits being developed in the Northern Territory, a township of possibly 1,500 or 2,000 people could be created. If a project such as I suggest were implemented-it could be done at minimum cost-that would make available to the people of the Northern Territory afishthat it of could not be suggested was contaminated by mercury or, as may happen later, by nuclear waste in our coastal waters. The latter is a problem with fish caught off the Japanese coast and in some British coastal waters. I learned of this at first-hand some 18 months ago when I was in Great Britain. British trawlers are forbidden to trawl for fish off certain parts of Scotland bePricause of the nuclear contamination that exists. is no possibiUty that fish farmed along the lines developed by the Taiwanese wtil present suitable industhose problems. I would think that the Taiwanese would be the most advanced people in the world infishfarmthe ing. I ask the Mmister for Veterans' Affairs, in the absence of the Minister for Primary Industry, to consider this proposition seriously. I am sure these that Professor Lee and Mr Richard Yu would not hesitate, if the Government sawfitto undertake a feasibUity study, to come to Australia for three or six months to offer the Government or the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Rewould search Organisation any advice that might be I point out that I am not denigrating the CSIRO or ourfisheriesdivisions in any way, but I must confess that I believe that the Taiwanese, as I have said earlier in my speech, would be more advanced in know-how in this regard than Australia and many other countries of the world. Mr Richard Yu was once in Darwin and he to me that the cUmate in that region of northern Australia would be most suitable for fish farming. I know that in recent times certain parts off the ocean waters of the coast of the the Northern Territory have more or less been made exclusive for fishing by Aborigines. When one takes into consideration the fact that our Aborigines would probably have to be subsidised or government money would have to be made kilo avaUable to equip them with suitable boats to fish the oceans off the Northern Territory and that our Aborigines would probably lack the the adapabiUty to do mechanical repairs to their boats, together with the possible losses of boats in tropical storms that suddenly envelop the northern part of Austraha, it could well be that it would be safer to engage the Aborigines in this sort of enterprise. I beheve it would cost less and be more profitable in view of the markets available in Japan and Taiwan should this matter be developed. I do hope that at an early date the Government will see fit to invite Professor Lee, the Director of the Taiwan Fisheries Research Institute, and Mr Richard Yu to Austraha to confer with the appropriate Minister. I must not overlook the fact that the Northern Territory Administration would probably appreciate, welcome and promote this industry should the Commonwealth Government see fit to cooperate with the Taiwanese authorities, which are prepared to offer all their expertise. I believe that the Northern Territory Administration would readUy co-operate because I think this could well be the real answer to absorbing the Vietnamese refugees, giving them a feeling of independence and removing them from social services. This could save the Australian taxpayer a considerable sum as it is paying dole of $50 a week to the unfortunate Vietnamese who have had to seek asylum in Australia. Who is to know that the 200,000 people who have already arrived here-who m the Government has not welcomed although it gave to them a homemight increase to between 300,000 and 500,000 refugees in the years immediately ahead?",31
85,Mr FISHER,CONSULTATION," I wish to raise in this Grievance Debate the subject of the increasingly disadvantaged position of Australian agriculture in the national economy. Basically, agriculture's competitive position in relation to its major competitors on world export markets has been weakened for two main reasons. Firstly, it has been weakened because of the increased protection provided to farmers in nations which are our main competitors and which set world commodity prices because of their volume of sales and production. This is particularly so in the United States of America, Canada and the European Economic Community, where most farm inputs are cheaper and the various assistance measures are designed to support prices and so maintain their farmers' incomes. The second reason is that secondary industry in Australia receives excessive protection through tariffs, quotas and at times of crisis quite substantial cash contributions. No other issue emphasises more than our fuel poUcy the impact upon exporting industries of poUcies designed to react within our domestic context. The rural sector is dependent on petroleum fuels. It is quite powerless to exist and produce without Uquid fuels. Agriculture accounts in usage for up to 20 per cent of the nation's fuel consumption but this is used by only 6 per cent of our population. Before expanding this argument further it is essential for me to state my support for the Government's principal energy policy objectives, which are briefly: Moving crude oU prices towards import parity; restraining the rate of growth of energy consumption; achieving the highest degree of self-sufficiency in Uquid fuel; and our policies of examining the possible estabhshment of strategic fuel suppUes while developing economic oil and gas reserves as well as the policy that is designed to encourage major export projects while providing support for energy research and development. This poUcy has been necessary and is proving successful in achieving its objectives. Already there has been a revival in the Austrahan petroleum exploration industry. More wells are being drilled this year than in any of the past three years, with 27 exploration weUs either completed or now in progress. This increased activity indicates that we will be able to achieve a greater than previously projected level of selfsufficiency in crude oU suppUes in the mid-1980s and this is estimated to be at approximately 45 per cent. Our policies are also increasing a recognition within our motor industry and our motoring public of the need for research and rationalisation in regard to energy capacity and economy. Australia, Uke the rest of the world, has felt the impact of progressively rising fuel costs since 1973 when the OPEC countries increased their prices of Arabian light crude oU from the then price of $5.12 a barrel. Today the price is in excess of $13 a barrel. These spiralling costs, our increased consumption and a growing dependency on imponed crude will combine, despite the poUcies I have already mentioned, to raise our oU import biU, which currently exceeds $700m, to $2,500m in 1985. Not only will this cost spiral increase progressively but it also raises the question of our ability to ensure a continuing supply of Uquid fuel for our essential transport and agricultural industries. A poUcy of raising the price of crude oU to import parity was inevitable, and there could be no other alternative for a responsible government. It does, however, place the burden of cost quite unfairly upon countiy people in general and rural industries in particular. Other inequalities within the petroleum industry also bear unfairly on the rural consumer. The practice of discounting petrol in the cities disadvantages fuel users in the country. State governments have a major responsibUity to control this practice. The Victorian Government moved very rapidly to remove discounting in the Uquor industry, a luxury trade, but it appears quite hesitant to make any sinular moves within the petroleum industry. Then there is the need to scrutinise the total distribution system in the petroleum industry. Inland transportation costs are over three times the average cost of supplying the overaU retaU network. A further analysis also reveals that the combined cost of agents' commissions, field representatives and installations of depots associated with the dehvery of fuel to primary producers is four times higher per tonne of fuel than the Australia-wide figure. These figures alone indicate the excessive burden being carried by users of petroleum products in rural areas, particularly those more isolated from distribution points and ports. The implementation of the States Grants (Petroleum Products) Act has had a sigmficant impact on reducing fuel costs for those who have been paying excessive penalties for their isolation. We wtil within the life of the present Parliament further reduce these costs by subsidising freight costs to within Vic a litre of the average metropoUtan price. Most fuel users are able to pass on or at least combat rising fuel prices, but rural industries have Umited scope to pass on any increase in costs arising from an increase in crude oU prices. Government policy does provide the primary industry with a concession on distillate. Diesel fuel used on-farm is free of excise but the intory. crease in the cost of crude oU caused by the cent levy has eroded the comparative benefits avaUable prior to 1973 and before the crude oU price hike began. The highest absolute and promining portional increases in fuel costs occur on wheat properties, where fuel costs increased by 47 cent between 1973-74 and 1975-76. These recent changes to crude oU prices have added in the claim. vicinity of $ 160m to Austrahan agriculture costs and further compound the problems. Fuel costs constitute in excess of 10 per cent of total cash costs on cropping properties. WhUst these costs are not as high on other agricultural properties, fuel costs bear significantly on profitabUity. Fuel used on farms is a relativelyfixeditem of expense in practical terms. This reflects the that modern farming systems are dependent to high degree on petroleum products for energy generation and, as such, the minimum input required for farm operation is high. This relato tively inflexible nature of fuel use also reflects high level of capital investment in farm machinery. OveraU impUcations for the rural sector of increases in fuel prices extend beyond the direct effects. As I briefly mentioned earUer, increased freight charges associated with marketing and the purchasing and transportation of other mputs also emerge. The combination of these effects will increase the economic pressures acting upon farm costs in general, especiaUy those in remoter areas. A large part of present fuel cost is tax and excise duty. This gives the Government the abUity to give a complete or at least a substantial exemption for fuel used in primary production. The same pokey as appUes to diesel oU could be appUed to petrol, as is done in Canada. I therefore call on the Government to make an immediate evaluation of the impact of fuel costs upon our rural exporting industries. Such an mquiry, if independent, could advise of the measures that would be necessaiy to give Australian agriculture an economic abUity to compete effectively. The appUcation of further concessions to essential industry and production would be of benefit to the total Australian community. We are still predominantly dependent for our future on rural exports, and any increase in our earnings would benefit all Australians, and increase our abUity to pay forrisingimport accounts and reverse our worsening trade deficit.",33
86,Mr UREN,CONSULTATION,"Over the last few weeks a number of charges and many innuendos have been made by the Government regarding the Australia Labor Party and Aboriginal opposition to urnium mining in the Northern TerriThese charges are not only false but also an reinsult to the Aboriginal people and their abUity to conduct their own affairs. The suggestion that Aboriginal opposition and resistance to uranium is something which has just recently been stirred up by the Labor Party does not stand up per to any examination. Not one substantial bit of evidence has been put forward to support this Let us look at what has actuaUy happened. It was a full 17 months ago that the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry commissioners reported that traditional Aboriginal land owners in the Ranger area were opposed to rnining on then land. I stress to those honourable members in the chamber that this is clearly set out on page fact 9 of the second Fox report. Eight weeks ago a a white Austrahan equaUed by few in his experience in Aboriginal affairs, Dr H. C. Coombs, warned the Australian Government that a faUure permit traditional decision-making processes the to proceed would result in grievance, hostility, and possibly violence. But the Government ignored this advice. It misrepresented the situation because it was so confident that it could bully and con Aboriginal people into signing a one-sided agreement. The Government's strategy has not worked but it has gone to great lengths to try to confuse the people and to make it work. i charge that it is this Government, and its Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner), that has intimidated and interfered with the Nonhern Land Council, both directly and indirectly, through its man in the Nonhern Land Council, its white manager, Mr Alex Bishaw. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs said in the House on Tuesday that Mr Bishaw had provided balance in his advice to the Nonhern Land Council. Let us look at some of the advice which the Minister considers to be balanced. At the Red Lillies meeting of the Northern Land Council, which was persuaded on 14 September to ratify the Ranger agreement, Mr Bishaw- I quote from a transcript ofhis address-said : On Monday before coming out here I spoke to officers Government who sit in on Cabinet meetings when Ministers are being briefed on matters such as Ranger. The majority of the Cabinet favours in the event that you do not sign this agreement, the majority of the favours not negotiation, not the legislation. That was said by the white manager of the Northern Land Council talking to Aboriginal people to try to create fear amongst them. Does the Minister consider this to be balanced advice? He has denied that any member of his staff or Department said any such thing. Either Mr Bishaw presented a distorted picture to the Land Council meeting or the Minister is guilty of misleading the House, or intimidation. At the Red Lillies meeting, referring to changes in the legislation Mr Bishaw went on to say: The danger in that is they have the process of this negotiation. That is a mislading statement. He was equating the six uranium Acts with changes in the land rights legislation to weaken the Land Council. It is a deUberately confusing statement. Referring to the Ranger inquiry, he said: The public inquiry has said the Government should proceed to mine Ranger. This also is false. At no point in either of the Ranger mquiries was any such recommendation made. The Minister said in the House on Tuesday that Mr Bishaw beheved the Land Council should be free of party poUtics. Let me quote another one of Mr Bishaw's statements to the Bishaw Red Ltities meeting. He said: A Labor government set up the Ranger Inquiiy. When they lost the election they turned against thefindingsofthe inquiiy. This also is false. It is a poUticaUy partisan statement. It is so false to suggest that the Ranger inquiry recommended that mining proceed and that the ALP turned on that recommendation. For aU the Minister's support of Mr Bishaw, he has to recognise that Mr Bishaw, under the challenge of being sued by Mr Bob Hawke for Ubel, admitted that he hed to the Red Lillies meeting of the Northern Land Council. I quote form the Northern Territory News of 28 September. Mr Bishaw said: It is true that I recendy repeated a statement that I had been led to beheve had been said by Mr Hawke while he was in Darwin recently. This was to the effect that Mr Hawke had said that if the Nonhern Land Council did not sign the Ranger agreement the Government would 'Pin its ears back'. This was said by me to suppon my advice to the council that if the council rejected the negotiated Ranger agreement they would not necessarily be supported by all unions. I said this in that context and because I had been led to bein the lieve those words were said by Mr Hawke. In speaking to Mr Hawke today, he assured me that he had not at any time made any such statement and I accept his assurance absolutely and retract my statement. Cabinet We can only ask Mr Bishaw how many of his arbitration but simply changing other statements he would stand by if he were chaUenged. This admission in itself is misleading. When Mr Bishaw was addressing the Northern Land Council he did not qualify his advice by saying that somebody else had told bim that Mr Hawke had done such and such a thing. He said it directly. One has to listen only to the tapes to know that the man is a bar of the worse order. I quote from another part of his evidence regarding trade unions which reads: The bulk of telegrams that have been received are from trade unions not affiUated with the most powerful trade union group in Australia-the Australian Council of Trade done it sixtimesalready in Unions. This is a further Ue. ACTU affiUated unions throughout the country have telegrammed support to the Northern Land Council. Of course, Mr Bishaw has always filed this sort of document out of sight. He has refused consistently to pass such information on to Aboriginal communities. I caU on the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to Usten to the tapes of Mr Bishaw's address and to make them avaUable to an independent inquiry to judge who is gutity of manipulation and intimidation. If the Government wants to act the transcripts wtil be avaUable. It is of no use the Minister saying that Mr is not a pubUc servant or that it is not his responsibUity to see that Aboriginal communities are consulted in their own language. He has a responsibility as the Minister administering the land rights legislation to see that the terms of legislation are observed. He cannot escape that responsibility. The land rights legislation requires consultauon with the traditional land owners and other Aboriginal communities before any agreement can be signed. For that to occur those people must be provided with information about the draft Ranger agreement. That informadon should be in a reasonable form and if possible in the Aborigines' own language and not the complex legal language which was reported in this week's National Times newspaper. These communities must be given time to understand and discuss the proposals. The Minister cannot escape from the responsibiUty to see that this takes place. He endorsed these procedures on 22 September and said that whtie they proceeded an arbitrator would not be appointed. It is time he stopped pressuring the Council and allowed Aboriginal communities to go through the procedures which are spelt out in the Aboriginal land rights legislation. In the few brief moments I have left I wish to put on record some of the hes which have been used in the smear campaign against the Austrahan Labor Party. In another place Senator Bonner claimed that Mr Bob Collins handed out to the Press a 21-point plan for consultation after the Northern Land Council meeting on Monday, 2 October. This is also a lie. It was handed out by Mr Dick Malwagu of Goulburn Island who prepared the document with the help ofhis lawyers.",34
87,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSULTATION,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,36
88,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,CONSULTATION," I would Uke to take the time to tell honourable members how the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) has distorted the picture completely and to give the facts. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Reid has no real feeUng for Aborigines, but just keeps pushing his unbalanced tirades for the Friends of the Earth.",36
89,Mr UREN,CONSULTATION,I take a pomt of order. I ask that that statement be withdrawn. The honourable member made the direct statement that I have no feeling for Aboriginal people at aU. That is an untruth and it is offensive to me. I ask that the statement be withdrawn.,36
90,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSULTATION,"I think the remarks are within the spirit of the Standing Orders but if they are offensive to the honourable member for Reid, I suggest perhaps that they be withdrawn.",36
91,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,CONSULTATION,"I withdraw them. I will talk today on a problem which affects that Australia and all Australians, our migrants, our refugees and our language. Problems are associated with any person settling in another country. He has to fit in with a large number of different customs and procedures; he has to live and work in a different environment. His social fabric has been disturbed, if not entirely dislocated. Many Australians might not appreciate that these are problems. Many Australians have traveUed to London, perhaps had a job as secretary or barman, and toured Europe dealing in EngUsh with people concerned with the tourist faciUties, hotels, restaurants, and guided tours. That is not the situation here, and the main difference is language. InabUity to communicate can create many problems in every day Uving, but people somehow get by even if it is only at existence level. But the crisis in the inabUity to speak the language is in education. Lack of understanding because of language problems is bad enough, but when it means that chUdren miss out on education, sometimes entirely, we are creating longer term problems and continuing costs to the community. Therefore, all Australians should be interested. With the best schooling a chtid needs to spend his full time at school to learn at a normal rate. In this period, he spends much time at school learning EngUsh and hopefully his parents also have a large input at home. But what about the newcomer who has Uttle or often no English? He has to compress years of learning into a short time before he can even start to learn other subjects, and his parents are no help in this learning process. Unfortunately his school attendance and performance often suffer in Une with being in the lower socio-economic group and having added home problems and sickness. There is often also a strong parental move to have the mother tongue taught. In many cases this is arranged after school or at weekends, which is hardly satisfactory. Let us look at the picture in a little more detaU. I will be looking at Victoria and at the electorate of Hotham because I know them best. However they are not quite average as Victoria has the best education department of aU States and Hotham has one of the few big migrant hostels, the Enterprise Hostel, at Springvale. State schools, particularly secondary, are seeing the changing nature of the migrant intake. Until recently most new arrivals were from southern Europe and spread geographically reasonably widely and fairly predictably. The schools had learned to cope though in some cases admittedly not as well as one would like. In 1976 a ceiling was placed on the total number of teachers to be employed at any one time. In Victoria the specialist area of migrant EngUsh had 1103 teachers which included fuU and part time teachers. The effective figure was only 900. In 1976 and most of 19771 suppose one could say that things went along without crisis in spite of the influx of chUdren from South America. However, in October 1977 the first Indo-Chinese refugees went to the Springvale area. At the beginning of 1978 some 500 migrants from IndoCbina arrived at Midway in the Maribyrnong area. Some 70 chUdren in this group were then enrolled at Maribyrnong High School, but unfortunately due to the lack of EngUsh teachers the chUdren had to wait three months to start school. Hardly had the situation started to stabilise when steady intakes of migrants and refugees at Eastbridge in Mitcham and Enterprise in Springvale upset the equUibrium. At this stage we had the terrible situation of some miUtant teachers bringing pressure to bear and, to the detriment of a large number of chUdren, refusing to aUow the secondary students to be enrolled, forcing them to stay at home. Despite laws regarding compulsory education and threats from social welfare agencies that chUdren who could not be fitted into schools were truants, it was some time before 25 forlorn kids at Enterprise were permitted to go to Springvale South High School, and then the school councU had to pay $550 for one term's bus fares. The opening up for big business of WUtona Hostel in WUUamstown has further aggravated the problems in that area. Some other problems have produced anquish. FamUies move to areas where housing is avaUable and sometimes close to their employment. This means that Richmond, Collingwood, Flemington and South Melbourne coUect more and more migrants. The local schools and social services are already fully taxed with migrants. Another problem exists with refugees from lndo-China who miss school sometimes for years. There is an inabUity properly to assess kids using a language they do not understand at all. I refer also to the problem of the change to a different type of schooling, customs and cultures. The Federal Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs does provide language courses for the refugees. The Department's books show that 460 people went through an 8-week course last year but because many of the refugees, both adults and chUdren, were illiterate in their own language they had Uttle hope of learning English in the time provided. This is not a great start for kids beginning school. I gather that there is also a problem in that students attending a school which has a migrant language depanment are ineUgible to take courses in intensive English provided by the Child Migrant Education Centre in Melbourne. Even if they were eligible the waiting list for the Centre is frustratingly long. Solutions to the problems will also have to take notice of the anticipated influx of 9,000 refugees this year. WhUst I have concentrated on the difficulties for migrants in education due to their inabUity to converse in EngUsh, this inability has ramifications in other areas, as the Galbally repon indicated. This report goes a long way in recognising migrant problems as a whole, and contains significant recommendations on settlement services, but it does not give sufficient support to the vital question of child education, perhaps because it is a State responsibility. Many students present particularly acute social problems. Many are without families, and are living in poverty, with neghgible church and cultural associations and without even friends. Thus their social problems are immense and complex. They generally are frightened and bewUdered and certainly still show the marks of their previous Ufe. Recently I was shown drawings done without direction by 5 to 8-year-old Vietnamese boys and girls who had been here for from two to four months. Without exception they were still war orientated. Guns and explosions featured even in drawings of flowers and people. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Social Security and the Department of Education are now working closely together and we must hope that they will find solutions. One need is seemingly a central language facUity for intensive English programs before attendance at school or work. Maybe these special language courses should be adjacent to all major hostels, instead of their being just the one adjacent to the Maribyrnong High School. Without doubt the biggest need is for migrant or ethnic teachers. Whilst some discussion is taking place on whether such teachers need to have another language, there is no doubt that they need some special training. It is a pity that the State colleges have each worked on volume, rather than thinking out the needs of the community and training accordingly. That is one reason why we have some unemployed teachers and a lack of ethnic teachers. It is interesting to note that the Education Department may be forced to stipulate that there be only one full time ethnic teacher to 100 migrants, with no notice taken of the number of ethnic groups or the range of ages. We have a problem and while we continue to take migrants and refugees, and for years thereafter, we will continue to have this language problem. Efforts are being made to overcome these difficulties and I hope that we will see the results of these efforts very soon.",36
92,Mr FRY,CONSULTATION,"It would take me several hours even to Ust the grievances of the people of Australia generally and the people Canberra in particular about the results of destaffing cisions of this Government, particularly those announced in the recent Budget. One of the main grievances relates to the very vicious attacks are being carried out at the moment against our educational standards. It is rather sickening hear the sorts of pious platitudes that the honourbe able member for Hotham (Mr Roger Johnston) uttered in trying to create an impression that Government is really concerned about eduUve cational standards, when the reaUty of course quite different.",38
93,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,CONSULTATION,I raise a point of order. take exception to that remark. I did not utter pious platitudes and I do not feel that the Canberra. honourable member for Fraser has any right to say that I did.,38
94,Mr FRY,CONSULTATION,"I am expressing an opinion, Mr Deputy Speaker.",38
95,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSULTATION,"I dustrial suggested earlier that the honourable member for Hotham withdraw a remark of a simUar to nature when it was objected to by the honourpig-headed able member for Reid. I would suggest, without restricting his freedom to criticise, that the it. honourable member for Fraser should withdraw.",38
96,Mr FRY,CONSULTATION,"In deference to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will withdraw the remark. I want to talk mostly about the very vicious attacks which the Minister for Education (Senator Carriek) is now conducting against the educational standards in the Austrahan Capital Territory. If the honourable member for Hotham had been out on the steps of Parliament House this morning he would have been able to gauge the very real anger of teachers of the Austrahan Capital Territory at being forced to take industrial action to try to bring to the attention of this Government the very serious situation that is developing lation to education in Canberra. The point that I want to make and which has been clouded is that this industrial action has nothing to do with improving conditions of work for teachers. It has nothing to do with teachers' working hours or their rates of pay; it has to do with mamtaining our standards in Canberra. The Minister gave an assurance last year that regardless of whatever action was taken standards of education in Canberra would not be reduced. But he has imposed staff ceUings which are in conflict with staffing formulae. He has set a formula and now he has imposed ceUings which do not allow that formula to be adhered to, so next year the various schools wtil not have the of same number of staff. They cannot follow the formula, which has been set down by the Schools Authority, within the staff ceilings which have been imposed, so standards are going to be that reduced. Some people may think that everything in the educational system in Canberra is bright to and beautiful just because the schools happen to rather new. However, members of this House should know that there are many grave deficienthis cies. In a primary school quite near to where I in CampbeU there are 42 chUdren in a kinis dergarten class, 35 in another class and 36 in another. Theoretically the number of students in a class should not exceed 30. In most States of I Australia the relationships between the staff and the students are much better than they are in That is not just an isolated case. There are plenty of cases in Canberra where the staffing situation is quite serious. The type of education that chUdren in Canberra are getting is suffering because there are not enough teachers. Yet next year, according to the Mmister, there wtil be fewer stUl. The Government has forced this inaction. The teachers would stop their industrial action tomorrow if the Minister agreed sit down and negotiate. But he has been quite about the matter and he just wtil not talk about it. He has taken a decision and that is The other means by which our educational standards is being attacked is the impending decision- I do not know what it wtil be but I do not think it wtil be pleasant-in relation to study leave. I questioned the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) about this the other day. He said that it was costing the Government up to $40m to grant study leave. The report that we have seen says that the cost in terms of salaries and traveUing expenses is $ 15.8m, not $40m. If we exclude salaries-peopl e have to be paid in rewhether they are on study leave or not-the figure is only $1.58m. No doubt the Prime Minister has manipulated some figures to create a figure of $40m. That is a totally misguided figure and it completely distorts the cost of study leave to the Austrahan community. That is a very parochial attitude to take. He also said in his reply that perhaps study leave should be taken in no other universities in Austraha. That is certainly very parochial attitude to take. Since I received that reply from the Prime Minister I have received letters from two acaberra, demics in Canberra briefly setting out the advanGovernment. tages that they have gained in the last 12 months from study leave. They both deal with very portant aspects of Austrahan research. One them deals with geneuc engineering which is of the most exciting research areas in Austraha today and has very important impUcations for our rural industries. He had 12 months in America and learned a great deal. The other deals with solar energy, which is another very important aspect of our research program. Those are just two of the areas that are able to be vanced by study leave. Yet it is our understandwhen ing that the Prime Minister has some sort of hangup about study leave and about generally and that the Government is gomg to impose some very stringent restrictions on study leave. I think we would all concede that there have been abuses of study leave, and certainly the loopholes should be closed up, but I hope that the Prime Minister does not put Australian universities in a situation where they are out step with universities in the rest of the world. The Opposition is also very concerned about the tardiness of the Government in making a firm commitment to construct the new and perpeople manent Parliament House. I think we have reached the stage where a commitment has to made very soon, otherwise the target date 1988, which has been talked about for many years, will not be met. I sincerely hope Government will make some firm commitment so that we can get on with the process. Everythey body concedes that there is an urgent need for new Parliament House. The Parliamentary Liticularly brary particularly is under strain. It has a crucial function to perform in relation to the Parliament and performs that function very well. However, demands on its services have increased enorsoon mously and it has to move towards new techseriously nology in library services which will help to algiving leviate the pressures due to the lack of space. Eventually more staff and more required in order to supply the necessary service to members of this Parliament. We all know that if a decision is made to buUd a new Parliament House it will not provide a of work in the very short term for the buUding dustry in Canberra, which has virtually been emasculated by this Government and is on its last legs. Certainly if a decision were made some immediate aid would be given in the early stages 19 October !978 REPRESENTATIVES 2085 a to people on the professional side of buUdingarchitects and draughtsmen. Later on, when the actual buUding gets under way, it would be of great assistance to the buUding industry in Canwhich has suffered grievously under this A couple of big projects-the Art GaUery and the High Court-wti l be completed imfairly soon and when they arefinishedthere will of be no major projects going on in Canberra. The one Belconnen Mall project has kept the industry going but it is completed now, and when those other two projects are finished there will be nothing to keep the buUding industry going in Canberra. The other project on which we would like to see some action is the new Post Office, which the Government has decided it is going to adbuild. As yet there has been no indication as to it is going to get under way, and we desperately need some action on that- a Uttle less talk academics and a little more action. I want to refer very briefly to the coming referendum for self-government in Canberra. The referendum wtil be held in a few weekstimeand yet even to this day the people of Canberra do not know what the Government means by the of three options it has given. No written information has been provided, and the referendum is only a few weeks away. The action of the Government prejudices the possibUity of people voting for some form of self-government. I think have to think very seriously about this matter. People who complain about decisions be being made affecting Canberra in which they do of not have an active role should think very seriously when considering whether they should that the vote for or against some form of self government. Many people want a change but hesitate to indicate what change they want a because they do not know the implications, parthefinancialimplications, of what the Government means when it says that it wants to give a measure of self-government to Canberra. I hope that information will be forthcoming very and that people will consider it very indeed and not reject the opportunity of the people of Canberra the degree of self government that is enjoyed by every other comspace will be munity in Australia. I have said before in this House that this is the only occasion in the history of Australia when people have been given an opportunity to reject lot some form of self-government. It has always inbeen regarded as a democratic right and an obligation of people to govern themselves, and I hope that the people of Canberra will see it in that light. But their decisions are being inhibited by the lack of precise information from the Government on what it means by offering three options. Instead of offering self-government or no self-government, the Government is asking: 'Do you want a httle bit of self-government? Do you want a large measure of self-government? Do you want no change?' It also raises the question of what the attitude of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Ellicott) would be if people voted for no change. If it means that-in fact-ther e will be no change, will he consider changing the name of the Legislative Assembly, which has no power to legislate, back to 'Advisory Council""?",38
97,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSULTATION,Mr Jarman)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,40
98,Mr HODGES,CONSULTATION," I want to highlight the serious divisions that exist in the Queensland Labor Party and the fraud that has been committed by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) on his alleged ideals and ability to control the left wing trade union-dominated party in his State branch of Queensland. We have all heard how Mr Hayden purports to be a moderate democratic sociaUst. At the John Curtin Memorial Lecture this year he said that the Labor Party under his leadership was committed to objectives of progressive reform. We have all heard about his concern for ministerial propriety and about the need for consultation with the Australian pubUc on matters ranging from uramum mining to technological change. What a fine person Mr Hayden appears to be. Indeed, it is easy when one is in Opposition everything in general and nothing in particular. It is easy when one is in Opposition to have honourable intentions but never be in the spot of having to deliver the goods. How can the Australian electorate assess sincerity and real intentions of the Leader of the Opposition? Let me suggest to honourable members that perhaps the best way we can State assess just how strong, how sincere, and how capable Mr Hayden is is by examining his record in his own branch of the Labor Party, the in Queensland branch. On 24 September the Fedsuccess. eral Executive, after a month-long investigation, resolved that certain reforms should occur in structure and membership of the Queensland branch of the Labor Party. The Press reported and made us all believe that this was a great tory for Mr Hayden. Mr Hayden had fought 'boots and all', according to the Melbourne He had gone out on a Umb to set in motion the reform of the left wing trades haU-dominated Queensland branch of the Labor Party. Indeed, one journalist not only said that 'he was the instigator of reform in the Queensland branch' but also that 'he was prepared to be tough and to use all the prestige of a leadership to force through organisational changes'. That was reported in the National Times on 7 October. We are aU led to believe that Mr Hayden is a party strongman. I want to say about the words of praise that indeed they are hoUow words. I believe that Mr Hayden is nothing more than a cream puff, light and fluffy with no weight, with no power and with a facade- a facade which must be broken down so that the Australian electorate can see how the union left wing bosses still call the tune to which Mr Hayden so merrily dances. Let us look at the record of the Queensland branch of the Labor Party and examine its trade union-dominated structure by which rank and file ALP members in many cases are virtually excluded from the decision-making process.",40
99,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSULTATION,I interrupt the honourable member for Petrie to say that when he is referring to the Leader of the Opposition he should refer to him by that title and not by name.,40
100,Mr HODGES,CONSULTATION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It takes a Uttle longer. The Queensland branch of the Labor Party in the last four years can best be described as afive-timeloser. In the 1974 Federal election Queensland was the only State not to electfiveLabor senators. In the 1974 State election the ALP was reduced to a rump to say party. Indeed, it just made a cricket team.",40
101,Mr NA BROWN,CONSULTATION,Did they have a twelfth man.,40
102,Mr HODGES,CONSULTATION,"No, they did not have a twelfth man. In the 1975 Federal election only the the Leader of the Opposition could scramble back to hold his seat, out of the 18 House ofRepresentatives seats in Queensland. In the 1977 election the ALP received only 43 per cent of the vote. In the 1977 Federal election the ALP ih Queensland polled fewer primary votes than 1975. That is hardly a record of traU-blazing But the real issue for many sincere ALP members in Queensland is the present structure the and organisation of the party. The Queensland branch of the ALP not only is dominated by a it smaU clique of left wing trade unions but also victhose people are unrepresentative of the rank and file Labor members in the Australian comAge. munity in general. The Queensland Central Executive, with its 96 members, has 52 union delegates. Only once every three years is a convention called which gives the average rank and key file member some opportunity to have a say. In Queensland the ALP is in effect dominated by trade union machinery men, the faceless men of Queensland poUtics. Because of this obvious lopsidedness, a group known as the Reform Movement gathered momentum during this year to make the Labor Party in Queensland a better reflection of Australian society. The goal of that group has been, and remains, to establish a party which will attract 'the broadest range of men and women' and whose structure wiU offer 'the maximum opportunity for participation at all levels and throughout the State'. The reformers want less trade union domination, an annual convention, a proportional voting system and a more open decision-making process. These demands are hardly startling or revolutionary but they have been resisted by the present power brokers in Queensland because, if met, the demands could mean an end to their incompetent administration. Where was the Leader of the Opposition when these demands were being stated? At first he stood timidly aside whtie the reformers were accused of being right wing and middle class academics. In one document circulated amongst ALP members they were described as 'grubs . . . traitors to the Labor cause'. Eventually, in July, NeU Kane, a member of the left wing Electrical Trades Union and a member of the inner Executive of the ALP in Queensland, said that Mr Hayden should not be leader of the Australian Labor Party, because he did not have the confidence of the working class. On this note the Leader of the Opposition himselffinallydecided that reform was needed. What did he say about the State of the ALP in his own State? Firstly, he said: The greatest need the Party has at the present time is to widen its membership considerably. It is the only way the Party can feel sure that it is in touch with what is happening in the community. Secondly, he said that the inner Executive: . . . has only seven members, is not representative effectively enough of the trade union movement in Queensland . . . there is no guaranteed representation of branch members . . . nor is there any guaranteed representation from the various closed shop. That was said during an interview he gave on QTQ Channel 9 on 12 July. Despite the attacks on the Leader of the Opposition by NeU Kane, the inner Executive faUed to rebuke Mr Kane. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition even asserted on the television program This Day Tonight on 12 July that Mr Kane had a serious health problem and should retire from the inner Executive. When asked about his views on the matter by BTQ Channel 7 on 12 July, Mr Kane only abused the reporters and articulated nontransmissionable expletives. These are the sorts of problems that the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party has. These are the sorts of people who run it. We must ask ourselves whether they are capable and responsible enough ever to be allowed to obtain government office. More importantly, we must ask ourselves whether the Leader of the Opposition carried out his assurances to members of the reform group, people whom he described as 'veryfinepeople . . . inspired by the best of motives'-that was said on the program PM on 2 October-that significant changes would occur and that he would take a strong stand at the Federal Executive meeting on 23 and 24 September about these matters. The Leader of the Opposition backed off. The inquiry was a massive whitewash. Mr Charles Jones- Mr Deputy Speaker. I raise a point of order. WUl the honourable member state what happened to Mr Knox the Liberal leader in Queensland",40
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSULTATION,Mr Jarman)Order! There is no point of order. Mr Charles Jones-What happened to Peter Coleman of New South Wales? Tell us all about them.,41
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSULTATION,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat.,41
105,Mr HODGES,CONSULTATION,"Instea d of an annual conference as desired by the reformers, the Federal Executive has recommended a biennial conference. Instead of a fifty-fifty structure between trade unions and members for election of delegates to the State Conference and quarterly State Council meetings, it has been recommended that representation will be 60 per cent trade unionists and 40 per cent branch members. In line with this is the fact that voting remains first past the post instead of proportional representation as was promised by the Leader of the Opposition. Under these arrangements the new State Council which replaces the Queensland parliamentary spheres. It is a Central Executive will be even more dominated by trade unions than it is at present. Furthermore, it is stUl possible for trade unionists who are not signed-up members of the Party to participate in the selection of candidates. As the reform group stated on 2 October 1978, the so-called changes are totally unacceptable. They do not have any real effect upon the present structure and nature of the Queensland Labor Party. They are a sell-out by some members of the national Executive but, in particular, the real sell-out is by the Leader of the Opposition. On the issue of proportional representation, only three delegates to the Federal Executive voted for its introduction in Queensland. So much for the Leader of the Opposition's assurances to the reform group. However, the Leader of the Opposition said that the reform group is 'wrongly informed' and that it will find these changes 'eminently satisfying'. He also said that the changes represent a compromise on the part of the Queensland Executive and that overall they are 'a vast improvement on what went before'. However, from what I have outlined to honourable members today about what the actual changes are, they can clearly see the disparity tween what the Leader of the Opposition said he desired and what he actually achieved. No wonder members of the reform movement feel so sold out by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has been inmorning, volved in the worse sort of short term pohticking and grandstanding that we have seen for many year. He has attempted to play out the role of progressive, a reformer and a strongman in fact, there has been no reform what he has been told to do by the faceless left wing power brokers who dominate the Labor Party in Queensland. I suggest to honourable members and the Austrahan electorate that such a man would be incapable of keeping pohcies out of a Labor government. If he cannot get his own house in order in Queensland, how does he expect the Austrahan electorate to Ueve that he has the strength and sincerity required of any national leader? I say to House that the Leader of the Opposition",41

111,Mr YOUNG,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Let the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition debate the question of beunemployment, and let the people of Australia make up their minds as to who is the more conthe cerned and talented person to overcome this problem. The misguided nature of the Government's economic poUcies is now widely recognised in the community. The Government's disbe honest approach to the unemployment problem why was acknowledged even by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) in his his revelations to the Parliament last month. In September this year an estimated 324,000 were unemployed and looking for full time work. Another 59,000 people were looking I for part time work. That figure is 50,000 more than at the same time last year. However, these official statistics disguise the magnitude of the real unemployment. The situation is far worse. Many thousands of young people, married women, and men approaching retiring age have simply dropped out of the labour force. Over the past two and a half years the number of involunretirements from the work force has been for about 250,000. The real level of unemployment in Australia is therefore close to 650,000 people right now. These figures are testimony to the Government's brutal and inhuman approach to economic management. The inappropriateness of its economic poUcies is now widely recognised in the community. However, comparatively Uttle critical attention has been directed to the Government's so-caUed training schemes or manpower programs. The National Employment and Training scheme, the Special Youth Employment Training Program, the Community Youth Support Scheme, the the Education Program for Unemployed Youth and the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Fullthat time Training represent the mainstay of Goverajob ment measures to overcome the labour market difficulties. The Government claims that these schemes operate to alleviate the hardship of employment and that they will provide people with the skUls and work experience to enhance their prospects of stable employment. What a fraud. What a cruel joke. On 13 September Prime Minister said that training schemes together with the increased profitability of traUan industry would mean that anybody who wanted to work would have the opportunity opened up to them. Can this Government Relations seriously argue that the expenditure of $ 173m 1978-79 on the programs I have outlined is attempt to aUeviate the hardship of unemployment? DetaUed examination of these schemes reveals the bankruptcy of the Government's approach to employment poUcy. AU these schemes are dependent upon the level of employment opportunities within the private sector and, on Mr Street's own admission, their potential is ited. In fact, there are 48,000 fewer people now working in the private sector than year ago. The basic problem is that there are not enough jobs to go around. There are 650,000 people unemployed who, for whatever reason, are completely untouched and unaffected by the Government's programs. These schemes do little to provide realistic alternatives for the unemployed. Continued praise by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, extrolling the virtues of the Government'stil-conceivedmanpower policies, serves only to camouflage the faUure of this Government to introduce job creation schemes. This Government consistently refuses to introduce job creation schemes because it panders to the ideological whims of the Prime Minister. Fortunately, we are now beginning to observe signs of unrest within the Liberal Party. There is now talk within its State branches and even within the back bench members of the Parliament of the need to embark on job creation programs. There has even been Press speculation about the introduction of community service schemes to aid the young unemployed. On 2 October the Age ran a story headlined: 'Volunteer Plan for the Young Jobless'. On Tuesday the Australian newspaper claimed that the Government was considering paying to local government $100m for jobless relief schemes. These stories reflect the growing concern within community over the pUght of our jobless. The magnitude of the unemployment problem is such unless the Government introduces sensible creation measures, this country will face a social and economic disaster of unprecedented proportions. Among the problems increasingly unreferred to are the growing ahenation of the young to the community and its institutions, increases in vandalism and more serious forms of anti-social behaviour, loss of incentive and work the motivation, increasing incidence of personal psychological problems, pressures on welfare Ausservices and the loss of skUled manpower resources. To date the Government has faded to act. The Minister for Employment and Industrial has presented to Cabinet a number of in job creation schemes over the last 12 months. On an every occasion these schemes were rejected. In July this year the Cabinet established an interdepartmental committee which was to report to Cabinet before the end of August on the options for the development of a community service scheme in Australia. I am informed that the Umdeliberations of this committee are now in abeyance despite the fact that last month the Minister was the case a told this Parliament: . . . if new jobs were created at an average of 130,000 a year for over the next 5 years, we could expect to reduce unemployment to about 4.5 percent; He went on to say: . . . by the early 1980's the situation could be one, where in addition to the problem of 15 to 19 year olds being unemployed, there will be a growing proportion of people in their early 20s who will have little work experience or prospects of employment. In other words, the social problem could significantly increase. These statements of the Minister are particularly relevant when we consider the deliberations of the interdepartmental committee on community service. At its meeting on the 12 July 1978 the committee resolved: The main thrust of any scheme should be directed towards young unemployed people; that consideration should be given to options which combine work experience and service to the community. On the one hand, the Government admits the gravity and seriousness of the unemployment problem, but on the other, it refuses to consider any program which could provide the unemployed with work opportunities. Those most vulnerable to social and economic disruption will suffer-the poor, the unskilled and semi-skilled and members of certain ethnic groups. Worst hit will be our young people. Nearly 40 per cent of the unemployed are under 21-youn g people in whom we have an enormous investment and in whom we have inculcated unprecedented aspirations. As the economy sinks into deeper recession and as the rate of technological change increases, they will be joined by another older group, namely, those well experienced in the workforce but rendered redundant. People hke skilled typists, desk and office machine operators, newspaper tradesmen, telecom technicians and retail employees will also be relegated to the indignities of the dole queue. These prospects threaten to de-skill and moralise our work force. The Labor Party in government would not tolerate this situation. are committed to increasing employment so that all those willing to work will find the opportunity to do so. We make no apology for advocating job creation programs. Nor will the Labor Party, like this Government, shirk the responsibility educating and training an industrial work capable of adapting to rapid periods of structural change within industry. In the Labor Party would not hesitate to introduce an unemployment relief scheme in conjunction and consultation with State and local governments. Such a scheme would form an integral part of Labor economic program of controlled growth, both in the pubhc sector directly and in the vate sector through the pubhc sector. Our employment policy, however, would not be limited to the creation of a certain number jobs. We would pursue an active manpower poland icy which would involve the following factors: commitment to economic planning in order to identify those industries requiring a skilled and proficient labour force. There is a need for the preparation and dissemination of information about future requirements, availability and ditions of employment for different categories labour. Until this is done, any attempts to review the efficacy of present educational and training pohcies is merely stabbing in the dark. The Williams inquiry is expected to make major recommendations about the future of edutraining cation and training in this country without honest indication from the Government of the long term prospects for Australian industry. The nothing. Depanment of Employment and Industrial Relations has already told the Government that it could expect the manufacturing sector to provide no more than 10 per cent of new jobs in the future and that the Government would have to look more to the tertiary and public sectors for employment creation than it has in the past. Even more disturbing is the fact that the Department has advised the Government that 10 per cent of the work force will be permanently unemployed because of the effects of structural change, especially through new technology, unless the Government creates necessary job opportunities. In addition to that, at the National Conference of the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations yesterday Professor Bill Ford said that the real crisis of technological change will hit Australia in 1980-81. He said that as a result of the Government's investment allowance millions and millions of dollars of taxdepayers' money was paid out to companies in the latter pan of lastfinancialyear for machinery, We technology and computers that they will not use for another year or so. The real crisis of technological change will certainly hit us in 1980-81. This situation calls for a radical re-think of how unwe educate our children. Yet the Williams inof quiry is expected to make recommendations force without receiving any indication from the Government regarding its intentions about Ausshort term, the tralian industry. The second factor in the Labor Party's manpower pohcy would be the use of selective employment promotion measures to alleviate a labour market disabilities of groups disadvantaged by poverty, discrimination, inadequate pritraining and obsolete skills. The Labor Party would look at providing to employers incentives which would enable them to adjust work, work of organisation and working conditions to the skills abilities of the unemployed. Several OrganA isation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries are already using schemes of this sort, including exemption from payroll tax, new forms of vocational training, paid education leave and work experience programs for schoolconage youth. A Labor Government would establish of a permanent community service scheme to involve unemployed young people in constructive, imaginative activities which would enhance individual motivation and develop social and work skills. Such a scheme would be developed in consultation with young people who would be paid a allowance based on award rates of pay. any The Labor Party, unlike the Government, does not expect unemployed young people to work for Time does not permit a detailed examination of the failures of present training schemes. The Labor Party can only draw to the attention of the Austrahan pubhc the Government's failure to introduce short term and long-term measures to rectify the impending social and economic disaster. The time lags involved in developing new programs and implementing them to an effective standard of administrative efficiency are considerable. Thus far the Government has been content to argue that the answers he in the recommendations of the Williams inquiry and the Crawford mquiry. Nothing which might emerge from these inquiries would prevent the Government from implementing emergency relief measures. Given this Government's record, it is quite Ukely that any credible solutions emerging from these inquiries will fall foul of the Prime Minister's personal ideologies and piggy-bank economic thinking.",42
112,Unknown,UNEMPLOYMENT,"Sitting suspended from 12.59 to 2.15 p.m.  pubhc importance about unemployment that the Opposition has proposed is clearly in the Government's opinion and, I believe, hi the opinion of the Australian pubUc just not sustainable. This Government is genuinely concerned about the unemployment problem in Australia. It is determined to maintain the economic policy to overcome the mess that was left to us by the Labor Government. The Government is actively pursuing a manpower program to assist in getting the unemployed back to work. One cannot separate the unemployment problem and the state of the economy. We must put the economy right before we wtil be able to return to a situation as it was in the 1960s when we had relatively full employment. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) in his statement to this House on 14 September 1978 showed the genuine and real concern that this Government has for the problems of the unemployed. Before I detail the Government's manpower poUcies and show how effective they have been, I want to look at what the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) has said. He said that the Labor Party would introduce job creation programs and unemployment relief schemes in co-operation with State and local governments. He gave no specific detaUs of what the programs would involve. It sounded very much to me Uke a re-run of the 1974 record. He said that the Labor Party would not tolerate unemployment. But it created unemployment. It set up the Regional Employment Development scheme and it sounds very much as though it would do it aU over agam. Let us look at that RED scheme. Under the Labor Government it cost about $430m and affected about 36,000 people. The jobs that were created did not last much longer than eight weeks. The honourable member for Port Adelaide was one of the members of the Labor Party who saw that the scheme was ineffective and decided to scrap it. Now the Labor Party wants to start it again. When we came to office the scheme had been 80 per cent aboUshed and at the end of the scheme I could not find one person who was left in a permanent job having been employed under the scheme. What does the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations say? One would have thought that Opposition members would have read the speech that he made on 14 September. They might have learned from it. He said: Unfortunately, this is far from a costless solution, as our predecessors' experience with their Regional Employment Development scheme demonstrated. Employing the unemployed at the minimum wage, which presumably is what the community would expect, with all the overheads associated with employment-workers ' compensation, accommodation, tools, materials, supervision, administration of such matters as wages, record-keeping et cetera-woul d far exceed the savings which might be made in unemployment benefit payments and increases in taxation. And, of course, not all the unemployed are unemployment benefit recipients. The overall cost per person would very likely be of the order of $200 to $250 per week. That would necessitate very considerable additional public expenditure that would have to be provided by reduced expenditure elsewhere, increased taxation or an increased deficit. Of course the honourable member for Port Adelaide just does not tell us where the funds will come from. The Minister continued: Obviously such action at this time would worsen the prospects for economic recovery and increased job opportunities. It might well increase, rather than decrease, unemployment. If the scheme proposed by the honourable member for Port Adelaide is so good, why can he not persuade his own State Labor Party Premier to adopt it? South Austraha would be a great place to test his proposals because, under Dunstan, it is the State with the highest unemployment. In August 7.07 per cent of its work force were unemployed; last month about 7.8 per cent were unemployed. WhUe in the rest of Australia unemployment fell in September compared with August, it rose in South Australia. Why does the honourable member not take his ideas to Mr Dunstan? Under the Budget allocations South Australia has over $749m to spend as it likes. That is an increase of about 7.9 per cent over last year and about 40 per cent over the last Labor Budget in 1975. That is untied money. Mr Dunstan can spend it as he hkes. But he is not spending any of it on the sorts of suggestions that have been put up by the honourable member for Port Adelaide. It seems quite clear to me that the pie in the sky ideas of the honourable member are just not acceptable to that Premier. I do not beheve the proposals are acceptable to or that they will be taken seriously by the Australian public. We have been through it all before. I am very suspicious about the motives of the honourable member for Port Adelaide. If he really is concerned about unemployment, one would think that, he would be using his best efforts to ensure that projects which would create jobs would get off the ground. Instead he and his party do exactly the opposite. The Dunstan Labor Government will not let the Western Mining Corporation's Roxby Downs project proceed. It is deUberately refusing to allow people the right to work.",45
113,Mr CHAPMAN,UNEMPLOYMENT,"It would create a lot ofjobs.  but the Dunstan Government will not create the jobs. It wtil not allow Western Muting Corporneed ation to go ahead. The Federal Labor Party the same. It is clear that the the Northern Territory is being held up deUberately by the influence of the Labor Party. It is denigrating the Aboriginal people and refusing to allow the people of Austraha to take ductive jobs offered by these projects. How can the honourable member for Port Adelaide be? He talks about the problems of unemployployment ment, yet he is keeping people out of jobs. else does the Labor Party explain the presence Mr Waters, an executive member of the Northmember ern Territory Labor Party, and Mr James, a member of the Labor Party, who are both solicithen, tors, at Oenpelii a day before they were due act as legal advisers to the meeting at which Aborigines were to decide their views on mining uranium. I suppose those two members of the Labor Party were not trying to influence Aborigines; they were just down there to look the scenery. It is this sort of action which is undertaken the Labor Party that is stalUng national projects which wtil create jobs. The honourable member for Port Adelaide keeps looking at band-aid posals for unemployment when he should looking at the root causes. WhUe the Labor Party continues to refuse to allow people to work, course there will be unemployment. Government doing in its manpower poUcies to assist the unemployed? Firstly, it is necessary to ensure that those people who are seeking emProgram ployment and those employers who are seeking propriated. employees are matched. Clearly, we also want job vacancies to be filled as fast as possible. Therefore, we have increased expenditure on Commonwealth Employment Service to ensure that it provides an efficient and modern manpower service. The Government is also providing $125,000 for pilot projects being conducted by new or relocated CES offices, which are designed to help in achieving these aims. The CES is also involved in the administration of government manpower programs. This year there has been an increase of 44 per cent over last year's expenditure on these programs; an amount of $ 179m has been allocated. I want to discuss a few of the programs which show the baseless nature of the Opposition's matter of public importance today. I refer first to the National Employment and Training program, the Budget allocation for which has been increased by 44 per cent to $122m. This program, which emphasises practical on-the-job assistance, is an extremely cost-effective way of providing people with the sktils that they to obtain secure employment. More than does 13,000 people are now undertaking NEAT mining of uranium in programs. Secondly, the Special Youth Employment Training Program provides subsidies, to a maxiup promum of $45 a week per employee, for emfalse ployers, who take on young unemployed people who are registered with the Commonwealth EmService. This reduces the cost to the How employer of taking on people who have had of difficulty in finding work. The honourable for Port Adelaide seemed to suggest that the scheme was not worthwhile. I wonder, if he could explain to the House why the to number of people benefiting under the scheme the has increased from 7,546 in June 1977 to 33,790 in June 1978. Perhaps he ought to get out of his ivory castle and talk to the employers and emthe ployees who are using the scheme. Certainly at from my own experience it is an extremely worthwhile program. In September 38,814 by people were benefiting from the program and being taught job sktils so that they can obtain permanent employment. That is different from prowhat happened under the Labor Government's be Regional Employment Development scheme, where people did not stay in their job and did not of gain skills that would enable them to obtain What is the long-term employment. I refer also to the Apprenticeship Support for which this year $46m, has been apThis is an increase of 41 per cent over thefigureof $32.5m that was provided last year. The Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice the Full-time Training program, which is operated under this scheme, aims, through tax-exempt assistance to employers, to encourage the employment and effective training of apprentices. Employers of approximately 63,000 apprentices are expected to be assisted this year. Another program is that of the nauonal and state training committees, which are assisted by the Government in helping industry develop its training capabilities. This is of great importance to the future development of a skilled work force. In fact last week some of the people who are involved in these committees had discussions with the Government members committee. As a result of that discussion it became clear that this is an extremely valuable program. Another program is the Community Youth Support scheme, the appropriation for which has been increased, from $5.7m last year by more than 50 per cent, to $9m. I have nothing but praise for the people are working in these projects in my area. These programs show clearly the fallacy of the arguthe ment of the Opposition. It really would have been pleasing if the honourable member for Port Adelaide had made some positive suggestions which could be considered by the House. The Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Lynch) and the Minister for Productivity (Mr Macphee) have made suggestions concerning structural problems in the work force and, the length of time that people work, such as the 14-day fortnight proposal of the Minister for Productivity, but we have heard not one word these proposals from the Opposition. It does wish to discuss these ideas which will help unemployed of Australia. Why cannot the Ausplated. tralian people have the benefit of the ideas of the Opposition, or does it have none? All we get criticism, the playing of poUtics. We get no tive suggestion. It istimethat the Opposition vided some suggestions instead of playing poliyears. tics with the unemployed.",46
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,UNEMPLOYMENT," that Order! The discussion is concluded. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1978 Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first time.",47
115,Mr HOWARD,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In an answer that I gave in this House on 27 tember, and in a more detaUed statement that made later that day, I indicated that the Government had decided to put beyond doubt that employers are entitled to deductions for the cost of their employees' long service and other leave only at the time when payment for the leave is made. This Bill will give effect to that decision. The need for the amendment arises from a decision of the Supreme Court of Victoria in the case of NUsen Development Laboratories Pty Ltd v. the Federal Commissioner of Taxation. In that decision, the Court held that an employer is entitled to a deduction for the cost of an employee's leave in the year in which the employee becomes entitled to the leave or in any year in which there is an accretion to a previously accrued leave liabUity, notwithstanding that no payment is made to the employee. Appeals against the Supreme Court decision have been lodged by the taxpayer concerned and the Comwho missioner of Taxation and, in the normal course of events, the Government would prefer to await decision of an appeUate court on such an important matter before considering an amendment of the law. However there are several important reasons why the Government has decided that on this occasion it should not wait for the appeal processes to be concluded. Firstly, the decision has significant revenue implications for the Government. If deductions for leave were to be allowed against 1977-78 income on the basis of the Supreme Court decision, on the cost to revenue in the current year would be not of the order of $600m. A revenue loss of such the proportions in 1978-79 could not be contemSecondly, the decision creates considerable uncertainty among taxpayers because of the is disturbance of a practice that has long been posiregarded as settled, and has been accepted by prothe very great majority of taxpayers over past This uncertainty would continue until the appeals had been finally decided. Taxpayers would be aware that there must be a possibility if one part of the original decision were upset on appeal-the part which indicates that deductions may be taken when payment is made for previously accrued leave-the y could lose very substantial deductions in future years. The Bill specifies that the amendment allowing deductions for leave liabilities when payment Second Reading is made is to apply in respect of assessments for 1977-78 income year and subsequent years, other than assessments made before 28 September 1978. This will protect the revenue from the loss of up to $600m in 1978-79, but it will Sepalso ensure that employers do not lose deducI tions when employees are paid for leave which had previously accrued, and for which deducare tions had not been allowed. The amendment will not apply in respect assessments yet to be raised in respect of earUer years and it will not apply to assessments already raised in respect of the 1977-78 and prior where the taxpayers' rights are protected by of objection or appeal to a court. The finalisation of these latter cases will have to await the cision of an appeUate court, and it could well that further amendments will be required when that decision is given. Although the nature of these further amendments wtil depend on the final decision of the court, it is envisaged amendments may be necessary either to ensure that employers do not suffer any loss of deducpractice, tions or to ensure that employers do not gain any double benefit-for example, by having had a visions deduction when payment is made and by also being found entitled to deductions at thetimeof accrual. The Government recognises that by providing for the amendment to apply to the 1977-78 income year it will be seen as having retrospective effect. For this reason, the Government was extremely reluctant to take this course. At the same time, it must be stressed that the amendment will not result in the loss of any deductions for taxpayers. It is a question only of the time at which that deduction becomes avaUable. There are also the other aspects that I have mentioned-the fact that the amendment wtil do no more than restore previously long-accepted practice, the fact that it will guard against the possible loss of deductions and resolve the uncertainty arising from the decision and, finally, the significant revenue impUcations for 1978-79. Details of the Amendment are contained in the explanatory memorandum that is now being circulated. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Martin) adjourned. MATERNITY LEAVE (AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES) AMENDMENT BILL 1978 Bill presented by Mr Viner, and read a first time.",47
116,Mr VINER,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"Stirling-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister) (2.36)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. This Bill amends the Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) Act to give effect to previously announced changes which designed to reduce the possibUity of exploitation and also the overall cost to the Australian of taxpayer. Honourable members may recall that a provision for maternity leave and paid benefits for public servants was introduced by a Liberal years government in 1966. When the current Maway ternity Leave Act was introduced by the Labor Government in 1973, members of this deGovernment-the n in Opposition-nonetheles s be gave notice that the provisions of the Act would require careful examination on the basis of experience gained in its adrninistration. This examination has now been undertaken and has also that taken account of the relevant International Labour Organisation convention, community particularly the situation in State Public Services, and the application of the present proto the particular circumstances of individual employees-for example, persons on leave without pay. The provisions of this Btil reflect the conclusions of this examination. Before outUning the changes made by the Bill, I should make it clear that the provision of appropriate maternity leave benefits is seen by the Government as an integral part of the equal employment opportunity policy it follows in relation to its own employees. Without such provisions, a number of women with needed skills and experiences would be lost to the public sector. Proper maternity leave provisions ensure that women, in whom the Government has made a considerable mvestment in terms of training and development of expertise, are afforded employment protection by being able to continue in Commonwealth employment whtie also raising a famUy. With the removal of the excesses of the present provisions, the Government believes the revised maternity leave scheme implemented by this Bill to be fair and reasonable, balancing the interests of the Government as an employer against its duty to the Australian taxpayer for restraint. In this respect, I should mention that the provisions of the revised scheme wtil be kept continually under review to ensure that the benefits are availed of in a proper manner and that the possibUity of exploitation is reduced to a minimum. The major changes made by the Bill may be Second Reading summarised as follows: Deletion of paternity leave; introduction of a qualifying period of one year before paid maternity leave is avaUablehowever, leave provisions, without pay, wtil continue to apply in thefirstyear of service; removal of automatic access to sick leave, but sick leave to be avaUable under normal conditions; and standardisation of the amount of payment for leave for maternity purposes at twelve weeks pay. I now turn to these major changes. Clause 10 abolishes paternity leave. The Government considers that the provision of paternity leave benefits for Commonwealth employees is unnecessary. It is, furthermore, ahead of community standards. Staff who wish to take leave around the time of the birth of the child will still have available to them other forms of leave. These include access to recreation leave credits, flex-time credits and leave without pay. In clause 7, provision is made for the introduction of a 12-month qualifying period in Commonwealth employment before paid maternity leave is available. The introduction of a qualifying period is consistent with the approach taken by State Pubhc Services and with certain other conditions of employment in the Australian Pubhc Service. The main purpose of the qualifying period is to deny the benefits of paid leave to anyone who might seek to enter Commonwealth employment for the primary purpose of availing herself of those benefits. Cost savings are expected from the provision in clause 7 which removes automatic access by employees on maternity leave to their sick leave credits. The change proposed by the Governwhich ment will bring the use of sick leave during ternity leave absence into line with normal sick leave conditions. For women who do not resume duty following maternity leave, the sick leave entitlement under the existing provisions comes a 'retirement benefit' not avaUable to other employees on resignation or retirement. Although access to sick leave will become dent on the production of a medical certificate, women on maternity leave will still be able to draw on their accrued recreation and long vice leave credits during the unpaid period of their maternity leave. Provision is also made in clause 7 to standardprovision ise the amount of payment for maternity leave twelve weeks pay. Under the present provisions, staff can receive more than 12 weeks pay if actual date of birth of the child is later than expected date of birth. The proposed change ensure that all staff, provided that they have served for 12 months, will receive a common standard of 12 weeks with pay around of confinement. This will remove any possibility of staff notifying an early expected date of confinement to maximise their entidement to paid leave. I should point out that while the amount paid leave will be standardised at 12 weeks, staff will be able to elect for an additional period leave without pay to give a total absence of up 52 weeks. Consistent with the amendments I have just outlined, the Bill also makes the following changes. Maternity leave may now begin not earlier than 6 weeks before the expected date of binh. The existing provision enables maternity leave to commence up to 20 weeks before the expected date of confinement; this provision was included in the 1973 Act as an extension of the provision contained in the old section 54B of the Pubhc Service Act and is no longer considered appropriate. Sick leave will be available should there be medical complications prior to six weeks before the expected date of birth. Any period of maternity leave that is without pay-that is, any period of leave after the first twelve weeks paid leave-wil l not count as service for any purpose although it will not break continuity of employment. Under the present provision, unpaid maternity leave counts as service for all purposes. The change proposed will bring maternity leave into alignment with leave without pay for other private purposes. Provision is made in clause 7 so that employees on extended leave without pay will not be entitled to paid maternity benefits for any period during the employee has been granted leave a mawithout pay. Clause 7 also provides that maternity leave benefits will not be available to employees who are on unauthorised absence from duty, unless the Public Service Board otherwise bedetermines in extenuating circumstances. In addition, the opportunity has been taken to make the present provisions moreflexibleby the depeninclusion of various other amendments. The most important of these concern, firstly, the new section 7-inserte d by clause 8 of the Bill-whic h serwill enable an employee to continue to work closer than 6 weeks before the expected date of confinement provided the leave officer agrees and a medical certificate is provided; a similar will enable an employee to resume at duty earUer than 6 weeks after the birth of the child. Secondly, provision is made so that mathe ternity leave may be taken in broken periods, the that is, maternity leave may now be interspersed will with periods of duty. This change will, for example, enable a mother whose chUd is hospitalised after premature birth to return to work the ume should she so desire. I conclude with an outline of the transitional provisions included in clause 11 of the Bill. The of amendments made by the Bill wtil come into operation from the date of royal assent and will of apply immediately to new employees who comto mence duty after that date. Existing employees who have been granted maternity or paternity leave before the commencing day of the amendments, or who are absent on such leave on that day, will not be affected by the amendments. In addition, staff who are eligible for the grant of maternity or paternity leave under the existing provisions and who make apphcation to the leave officer before 1 January 1979 will retain their eligibility for such leave. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Willis) adjourned. NA Bill presented by Mr Viner, and read a first dme.",48
117,Mr VINER,SUPERANNUATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Sthling-Minister for Aboriginal construction Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minishament ter) (2.45)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends the Superannuation Act 1976 consequential upon the amendments made to the maternity leave provisions by the Maternity Leave (Australian Government Employees) their Amendment Bill 1978. Provision is made in plant clause 7 of the Maternity Leave Amendment Bill so that only the first 12 weeks of maternity will be with pay. Any period of maternity leave taken after the first 12 weeks will be without pay and, by virtue of a new section 7B in clause 8 the Maternity Leave Amendment Bill, periods of unpaid maternity leave will not count as service House. for any purpose. Consistent with the provisions of the Maternity Leave Amendment Bill, this Bill deals with the situation of contributors under the Superannuation Act and provides the superannuation arrangements that are to apply to contributors on unpaid maternity leave. The arrangements are similar to those that already apply under the Superannuation Act to contribu Mr Anthony: tors on other forms of leave without pay which do not count as service for superannuation purposes. Clauses 3 and 7 are the key provisions of this Bill. Clause 3 has the effect that any period unpaid maternity leave will not be included as part of the period of contributory service for superannuation purposes. Clause 7 inserts a new section 51A in the Superannuation Act which provides that where a contribution day occurs during a period of unpaid maternity leave contributions are to be payable by the female employee on that contribution day. The new secamendments tion will also enable regulations to be made that the Superannuation Act may be modified to deal with the various situations that may under the new maternity leave provisions.

Erection of police guard boxes within the parliamentary zone. Mr Deputy Speaker, the motion I have just moved is required in accordance with the proSecond Reading visions of the Parliament Act 1974 to permit the of a cooling tower at the rear of ParHouse and the construction of two police guard boxes to the rear of the House but within the parhamentary zone. The proposed works will also require the approval of the Senate. As the proposals which I have tabled indicate, the existing cooling towers are approaching the end of economic hfe. The capacity of the existing will be increased by the erection of a new cooling tower, which it is proposed to locate in a leave new site to enable it to operate at maximum efficiency. The erection of two guard boxes to the rear of the House will enable better surveillance of of the parking area on Camp Hill as well as of the building itself. I commend the motion to the Question resolved in the affirmative. NA 1978 Second Reading Debate resumed from 6 June, on motion by That the Bill be now read a second time.",50
119,Mr ANTHONY,EXPORT EXPANSION GRANTS BILL,"by leave-In the second reading speech on this Bill on 6 June I stated that of it was the Government's intention not to seek passage of the Bill at that time. In this way time would be available to interested parties to study the Bill in detail, and provide the Government with any comment on its provisions. Following consideration of comments from the export comno munity and further study by departments, the Government intends to move a number of to the Bill which are essentially of a so technical nature. These amendments have been circulated to honourable members for study, but arise I will briefly mention their purpose. I turn to thefirstamendment. It is the intention under the prospective legislation that entitlement to grant is to rest with that person who negotiates an export sale with an overseas buyer. The amendment is to define clearly that person as the one who is legally responsible for the contract of sale with the overseas buyer. The second amendment defines the date on which export is deemed to have occurred. The third amendment strengthens the definition of 'company' and 'partnership'. The fourth amendment is to ensure that grants are not paid unless there is a corresponding increase in exports. The fifth amendment provides that the jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will encompass this legislation on a date to be defined. The remaining amendments bring up to date the offences provisions of the prospective Act. Mr Deputy Speaker, may I raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate resumed on this Bill I would like to suggest may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Amendment Bill 1978 and the motion to take note of the isterial statement on export development initiatCommission ives as they are associated matters. At the conhaps clusion of the debate separate questions will course be put on each of the Bills and on motion to take note of the ministerial statement. suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both Bills and the ministerial statement to be discussed in this debate.",50
120,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EXPORT EXPANSION GRANTS BILL,"Is it aim the wish of the House to have a general debate covering each of these matters? There objection, I will allow that course to be followed.",51
121,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,EXPORT EXPANSION GRANTS BILL,"This is a cognate debate covering the export expansion grants legislation and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. At the outset I state that we are still waiting for export market development grants legislation. present there is no sign of it being introduced. other words, what the Opposition is saying from our point of view the Government does seem to have the co-ordination required effecmerce tively to establish an incentive for exports. have seen the introduction of the Export Expanconcerned sion Grants Bill, which relates to incentives; market development legislation has not yet introduced. We say that this is typical of the piecemeal and fragmentary way in which the Government deals with this important segment of vital interest to Australia. At present, because of the poor economic circumstances in Austraha, it is essential that we develop strong trading opportunities. The best way to do this is by giving incentives. What happened in relation to the Industries Assistance Commission report on export incentives signifies the Government's peculiar approach of excessive secrecy in this area. That report was given to the Government, I think on 6 January this year. We had the benefit of a ministerial statement on 13 April, when the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) announced a package of Government initiatives. After we made a statement welcoming the statement of 13 April we were obliged to say that we still had not seen the report of the Industries Assistance Commission. The Government did not bother even to table it until after we complained. While the Bill establishing the Overseas Projects Corporation, which apparently is part of the package, has gone through the is House, the Corporation has not yet been estabthat it lished. This is the present problem. The IAC report on export incentives speaks of problems in the manufacturing industry base. minThese are well known and recognised, but the seems to be saying that we can perrest easy on the basis of the Government's of White Paper on manufacturing industry. I make the it clear that the Government's White Paper I really did not grapple with the problems concerning solutions for the industry. In my opinion we have to identify the type of industries we need to promote in this country. We do not want a gunshot arrangement whereby everybody is given some small benefit. We need to realise our and give worthwhile incentives to the key industries in Australia which must be supported being no from the point of view of exports. While we can talk about the matter from the of view of being political, we need to give some reasons for the disparity of the Government's actions. It would be a fair comment to say that possibly six Ministers are trying to do their the best for trade. They are the Prime Minister (Mr At Malcolm Fraser), the Deputy Prime Minister,  is that for Special Trade Representations (Mr not Garland), the Minister for Industry and Com(Mr Lynch) and the Minister for Primary We Industry (Mr Sinclair). The number of Ministers is very significant at this stage. but Difficulty is experienced no matter what segment been of trade is being considered. Is there coordination? The Special Trade Representations Minister is now making some effort to get to the Middle East countries. We feel that that is commendable and should have happened a long while ago. The previous effort by the Government was to hammer the European market to try to gain market penetration. We say that the effective markets that could have been arranged in the Middle East and in the Eastern European bloc have been neglected. We cannot expect to pick up the old trade links we had in the past, particularly prior to the Second World War, when we know very well that the world scene has changed and that the European Economic Community will not open up to us because we are very keen to castigate it and say that it is schizophrenic and deliquent. It is suicidal to enter a verbal trade war on what is wrong with the EEC if we do not consider its politics. As the Deputy Prime Minister has said, the EEC is excessively subsidising its primary producers. This is done for a very good reason-it wants their votes. The EEC will continue this subsidisation. Markets exist elsewhere. Unless we are very careful of what we are about we will have problems not only in the area of beef but also in sugar and a number of other commodities. We are not placing emphasis in the Middle East where the oil revenues are escalating at a great rate. I want to make a point about the beef incentive allocations of $350,000, which the Minister for Primary Industry calls specialisation promotion. Obviously we will be aiming at the tough markets that are against Australia-the United States and Japan. Would it not have been better to try to assist the lamb marketing opportunities in the Middle East with that sort of promotion? The Government is very confused. The Prime Minister has made some unsuccessful forays into the international trade arena as a result of which a protest note was deUvered to us. The Foreign Minister seems to have some appreciation of the complexity but his efforts are thwarted by his other colleagues. The records of the Minister for Trade and Resources and the Minister for Special Trade Representations are dismal. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has hurried to Japan to discuss complementation in motor vehicle production in the Asian-Pacific region. At last he has recognised the problem there. In the last few minutes Government supporters from South Australia asked what the Opposition had ever done for industry in South Australia. The Opposition did very much indeed. The motor vehicle plan of the Opposition is still being sustained. It enabled Chrysler Australia Ltd to remain in production. It was the hope of the Labor Government of those days that the other motor vehicle manufacturers in Australia would look at a Labor plan for a 4-cylinder engine production plant at Chrysler's plant in South Australia, but because the manufacturers are overseas controlled and not interested from the point of view of Austrahan equity-ther e is no such investment-the y decided to do whatever they liked with the manufacture of motor vehicles in Australia. There can be too many manufacturers, but Government members cannot blame it on the previous Labor Government and say that it did nothing. The Opposition tried very hard to get some rationaUsation which would have been in the best interests of the Australian public, the consumer and South Australia. Anyone who is beholden to the Ford Motor Co. of Australia or General Motors-Holden's Ltd will know that all their policies are in accordance with the dictates of their boards which are in the United States. The same applies to some of the incentive grants. We know that in the past a fair amount of incentive grants-taxpayers ' moneyhas been going to very large companies which possibly did not need anything like the incentive. This particularly applies to the companies I have just mentioned. Australia needs some forward planning. We have clearly to understand where we are heading in regard to trade. We have to pursue new markets. We need new approaches. We might need new approaches to old markets. Agricultural and mineral exports will not sustain a prosperous and advanced society. The manufacturing, service and other advanced sectors must also be sustained. They must be promoted. We need government support for exports and other foreign exchange earning activity. These should include the following: The establishment of an effective national assessment of the international economy and strategic planning for trade; a review of the operation of the traditional forms of trade; promotion and assistance in traditional markets; the establishment of country by country plans and priorities; the provision of incentives for export gains and for export development to efficient industry; the provision of assistance in inverse proportion to the scale of other industry assistance; and the establishment of machinery to facUitate trade with new markets, with small markets and with other governments and their instrumentalities engaging in trade in cooperation with the private sector with a view to assisting private industry. The Minister for Trade and Resources frequently castigates the Opposition about what he thought was a socialistic adventure called the Overseas Trading Corporation. The corporation would have been of the greatest advantage to the private sector and the rural producer. The Western Australian Lamb Marketing Board is a socialistic enterprise from the point of view that every lamb produced in Western Austraha belongs to the Board. Lambs do not belong to the producers. No producer in Western Austraha would say: 'Get rid of that Board'. It is the best thing that ever happened to them in the marketing area. Mr MCSporran and other intelUgent people wiU say that a great opportunity exists to expand trade in the Middle East, but we cannot even get enough lambs to meet the orders. Is that not the very concept of what we are about? We have aridiculoussituation of leaving it to somebody else. We should be helping the producers and the manufacturers. We need to create a society in Australia where the employee and the employer get together. The producer on the land and the feUow in the slaughter house need to understand each other's problems. We can trade effectively. We have the best products in the world to sell, but we will not do so if people step back and say: 'That is socialistic.' We are deaUng with countries such as Japan which put a lot of government money into concerns which are trading and competing with us. Australia has to identify what it is about. We welcome the piecemeal legislation which has been introduced, but wonder why the package is not complete. We are critical of the fact that it has been dragged in. Perhaps the Minister will make a speech next Monday at the opening of the Associauon of South East Asian Nations trade fair. Somebody wiU say how well we are going and how we have introduced this piece of legislation. Why was it so delayed? It could have been introduced in thefirstsession of this Parliament. I do not know whether this is a budgetary ploy to try to save some of the outlays, but it is certainly not helping the producers or the manufacturers. They do not get any cash from this legislation. The measure will be sent to a legislation committee, which is as it should be when we look at the way the Btil is drawn. The Bill contains some great weaknesses. It draws heavUy on the Industries Assistance Commission report, but there seems to be a fair number of weaknesses in the drafting-if we can be critical of it to that extent. This is indicated by a further statement today. Another five or six amendments, which we have just sighted for the first time, are to be made to the Bill-welcom e as they may be. One of the most significant factors of the Bill is the question of what we mean when we talk about incentive grants. We have to look at the matter from the point of view of what are eligible goods as set out in clause 4. Clause 4 (1) (a) is worded in the form of a double negative. It states: Not more than 50 per centum of the value of the goods is attributable to materials or parts not of Australian origin. Unless one reads the clause carefuUy one would think that it requires a SO per cent local material content. It does not. There are two separate aspects of that clause. One relates to 50 per cent of the value; the other is the question of content. So there may be no Australian content from the point of view of materials as long as there is a content in labour in order to get half the value. In other words, there may be no Australian materials in the goods and they would still be eUgible for a subsidy. The use of the double negative means that goods wtil qualify as eUgible goods unless more than 50 per cent of the export value is attributable to non-Australian parts and materials. Export value of course is the total value; that is, the value of goods including the cost of labour. For example, if the non-Australian parts constituted 100 per cent of the parts used but the value of the goods free on board for export was at least twice the cost, the goods would still qualify. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing Australian content of parts as required under clause 4 of the Bill. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsNA NA NA Percentage of materials and pans Actual cost of material required to and parts as percentage be of Australian of total value f.o.b. expon origin percent per cent 50 or less 0 55 9 60 . . 17 65 . . 23 70 29 75 . . 33 80 . . 37.5 85 41 90 44 95 . . 47 100 . . 50",51
122,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,EXPANSION GRANTS BILL,"The table shows that the Australian content required will normally be much less than 50 per cent and will very often be nothing. The Btil therefore does not guarantee that Australians will be subsidising only the manufacture of goods of primarily Australian content. In the view of the Opposition the Australian taxpayer should not be asked to subsidise exports which do not have at least 50 per cent Australian content. One would have thought it was important for Australian industry to require at least 50 per cent Australian material. We will be trying to remedy this situation at the Legislation committee stage. The Opposition is also dissatisfied with clause 4 (1) (b). I point out that the Minister really did not deal with these matters in his second reading speech. Clause 4 (1) (b) allows the Board to decide, on whatever grounds it thinksfit,what goods should be eligible goods. The definition could well apply to goods which even do not fall within the extremely Umited category of clause A. One of the matters which will concern both primary and secondary producers wiU be the fact that it is the person who has property in the goods at the time of sale who is entitled to the grant, not the producer. In other words we could find, under this Bill, the exporter-this is a matter for further discussion-gettin g the grant but not the producer. We draw attention to clause 5 and also to clause 3 (2). The agents can get the benefit of the incentive and not the producers. In our view there ought to be a requirement that export entitlement ought really apply to the people engaged in production. There can be argument about the fact that perhaps the market would not have been found but for the agent but I would like to tliink that when we are dealing with taxpayers' money in this regard we are doing so on the basis of expanding employment opportunities, by expanding factories or methods of production, whether it be on the land or elsewhere. We should use it to guarantee a stronger economic base. Those people with entrepreneurial attitudes should not be the ones who can get the benefit. That sort of situation could arise under this Bill. We can have difficulties in defining what people are entitled to this benefit. For example, multinational companies resident in Australia could be entitled to the grant. If a multinational company were to export its goods from Austraha it could well qualify for the grant. There is a lot of difficulty in guaranteeing that the grant will be to the benefit of Australia if in fact it is going to be remitted overseas by way of profits. They are some of the matters that we wanted to mention. Clause 16 of the Btil aUows the Board to disregard transactions which are in abuse of the Act. One way in which export grants can be maximised would be by the sale of goods prior to export so that one company which might have no export earnings for one year could virtually sell it to another company on the basis that that company might qualify for the grant. I know the Minister is trying to rectify this matter now. question of what we want to do. If the Government looked at the matter from the Opposition's point of view, that the incentive ought to go to the producer, it would overcome many of these problems. We hope that these matters will be the subject of consideration by the Legislation Committee. We are very anxious to know what matters the Minister feels should be looked at to guarantee that we can avoid this sort of dealing that wtil bring transactions within the ambit of the Act and give incentives in an area to which we do not think they should be readUy applied. One other matter which is of concern to the Opposition is the question of trading facilities. It has been drawn to my attention by others that there are some severe problems related to our abUity to have as many effective trade commissioners as we want. This problem obviously is due to problems of budgetary expenditure. I am told that the present group in the Middle East is seriously overworked. There are great opportunities for development in areas such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. For that reason those countries ought to be given much more attention. Again I am reminded that airline freight costs are very high indeed. There is some problem as to why we are not doing more to assist our producers by way of freight. There are difficulties in suggesting subsidies in airline areas but we could suggest that Qantas Airways Ltd be given more facilities relative to being able to export. I have been reminded by the Western Australian Lamb Marketing Board that it is not being catered for effectively in that it has to pay freight rates which it says are above average. It could get charter rates which are much cheaper. It has been asking the Government for a decision on this matter since last January and it has not been forthcoming. Accordingly, it is being obhged to pay a fair amount of what it considers to be excess air freight. I am told that in the last year this has meant excess payments by the Western Australian Lamb producers of no less than $759,000. That is no small amount of money. It is a shame that the Government cannot face up to the situation and deal with those problems. If one talks to people who are interested in establishing trade with the Middle East we find that there are problems with shipping freight rates. They say that often the freight is much more expensive than the container contents. That is a problem; they find it a difficulty. Admittedly, sea routes can be much longer and some consideration has to be given to that fact. Obviously there should be government incentive and enIt is a couragement in the form of some subsidy of shipping rates to guarantee effective market control. I make the point that the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) told Parhament on 14 September that the value of Australia's trade with the Middle East has increased in the past four years from $100m to $560m. That sounds impressive but we also have to look at the fact that oU revenues in the four years to 1981 will amount to no less than $563 bUUon. We could certainly get a lot more of the Middle East market if we were to cater for it. The Middle East market is growing rapidly because of incomes from oil. There are substantial Middle East proposals as to the type of interests in which it wants to involve itself. Not the least of those interests would be manufacturing interests, some of a joint interest nature, particularly in the solar energy field, and agricultural interests, the difficulties of which we have been discussing. All m all, whUst we can recognise the great need for this Bill we are mystified as to its meal introduction. As the IAC report was avaUthe able as far back as 6 June we cannot understand why the Government could not have had this complete package through in the first session of Parliament. It is coming through in dribs and drabs, in a higgledy piggledy fashion, which does not seem to give real incentives to people interested in trade. While welcoming the Government's recognition of stimulus, we are very anxious that it become complete, effective, and co-ordinated, and that there be a clear understanding of what we are about from the point of view of achieving strong economic growth in this country. The problems are from the economic point of view and it is importexisted. ant that the Government start to make clear destraint, cisions as to what types of incentive should given to certain industries to guarantee them making progress. The talent is there; the indussomething tries just need the incentive. Therefore I somewhat concerned that the market developsubsidising ment legislation has not even although it is an integral part of the Government's whole policy. WhUe welcoming the legislation we do so subject to the criticisms made. We look forward to the Minister being able to satisfy the Opposition's criticisms.",53
123,Mr ALDRED,EXPANSION GRANTS BILL,"The statement on export development initiatives which this House is now debating and which was brought down by the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) earlier this year is one of the most important ministerial statements to be made recent years. It has very major implications the long-term economic prosperity of Australia. As Chairman of the Government Members Trade Sub-Committee, I have a particular interest in this ministerial statement on export development initiatives because the Trade Sub-Committee played a significant role in shaping its contents and direction. Undoubtedly, the most notable feature of the statement is the proposed export expansion grants scheme. The legislation relating to this scheme is being debated at the same time as the ministerial statement. The new export expansion grants scheme will provide for the payment of taxable cash grants calculated on a formula appUed to the increase in exports in the grant year over the average annual exports in the three immediately preceding years. It wtil be possible to vary the base period to allow for peculiarities of special situations. The formula for the export expansion grants scheme provides that increases in exports of up to $500,000 will attract a grant rate of 15c in the piecedollar and that as exports go beyond $500,000 increases in the grants will be based on lower rates. Such a formula concentrates the incentive effect of the export expansion grants scheme where it is needed, that is, encouraging small and medium sizedfirmsto export or to improve their existing export performance. This avoids the absurdities of the schemes administered some years back by the Taxation Office. These were the export incentives grants scheme and the export market development allowances scheme. The principal beneficiaries of those earlier schemes were large corporations and government business undertakings which would have acute exported even if the two schemes had not Particularly in times of financial reor at any time for that matter, the objecbe tive of government incentives must be to help persuade businessfirmsor individuals to take on that they otherwise might not have am done. We should not waste taxpayers' money on people for something that they would been introduced, have done anyway. Other important initiatives in the GovernI have ment's export development package are a reformed and simplified export market development grants scheme which encourages exporters to penetrate existing markets further or to open up entirely new markets; an intensified export promotion program by way of increasing awareness among industry of the benefits of exporting; more frequent Australian trade displays and Australian participation in international trade in fairs; expanded support facilities such as for specialised industry trade missions; a further strengthening of Australia's excellent Trade Commissioner Service, especially in markets with additional potential such as South East Asia, East Asia, the South Pacific, the Middle East, North America and Latin America; approval for the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to increase its subsidy commitment authority from $ 17.5m to $30m so that EFIC may continue to support strongly exporters seeking export orders where extended credit terms are an important competitive factor; the establishment of the Austrahan Overseas Projects Corporation to assist Austrahan industry to compete for large-scale development projects overseas; promotion of Australian consultancy and construction contracting services overseas through support from an extended EFIC facility and an increased consulting services feasibility study fund; and, finally, government assistance for the marketing abroad of Austrahan technology by way of seminars, international technology fairs and technology missions. There are several critical fundamental reasons why Austraha must again build up a strong and export trade. Firstly, our own population has never been large enough to provide an economic base for many of our industries, particularly our manufacturing industries. Even today's popufuture lation of 14 million is small by comparison the substantial markets directly available to manufacturers in Western Europe, Japan and North America. These overseas manufacturers consequently enjoy a distinct competitive advanground tage from the economies of scale achievable virtue of the size of their own domestic markets. In industries where economies of scale are considerable importance, such as the manufacbeen ture of motor vehicles, the implications Australia are extremely serious and obvious. Industries Assistance Commission report a few years ago stated that there were too many manuout facturers in the motor vehicle industry Australia. Subsequent events, including the drawal of British Leyland, proved the report to be absolutely correct. It should be further pointed out that any matic expansion of the domestic Austrahan ket is extremely unlikely. Despite rather wild forecasts not so long ago that Australia's popuworld lation would reach 30 million or more by the year 2000, we wtil in fact be lucky to reach 20 million. By the year 2000 we may even have the world. only 17 million or 18 mUUon people, depending on where and when our falling birth rate stabUises and on the net gam from immigration in coming two decades. Whether this very modest increase in our population is desirable or sirable is another question. The fact is that what will happen, on present indications. Apart from the limited size of our own domestic market, there is a second consideration that compels us to strive to butid a strong export trade again. That is the elementary question of just how much further we can penetrate our own domestic market. In attempting to answer that question, it has to be determined, for instance, just how extensively the domestic market is already saturated with consumer durables. For example, there is evidence that colour television has achieved a heavy penetration of the Australian market in about half the time or less that it took similarly to penetrate comparable overseas markets. Furthermore, the spending habits of many young Australians seem increasingly directed to travel and other associated expenditure rather than to the acquisition of material goods. The elderly also now spend a great deal on travel, having already acquired all the necessary household possessions. Their consumption behaviour becomes even more significant when it is remembered that with our falling birth rate greater longevity the elderly are becoming a larger and larger proportion of our population. What I have just said clearly shows that the limitations in the growth of our domestic with market necessitates a build-up of our export trade. In a broader perspective, there are also international reasons for strengthening our export position. Australia has lost virtually aU her in traditional markets such as the United by Kingdom and Western Europe as a result of the protective barriers thrown up by the European of Economic Community. The main losses have in respect of primary produce but processed for food products and some manufactured goods An have also been adversely affected. These lost markets must be replaced and only the seeking of new export markets can do this in full, in although the Government must be commended withfor aiming to break down the more absurd features of the EEC's protectionism. In fact, checking the world-wide trend to super protectionism is another reason for renewing Australia's export dratrade. If left unchecked, the move to excessive marprotectionism will completely obliterate competitive advantage as an essential element of trade and consequently will substantially retard the standard of living that otherwise about would be reached by many nations throughout It is a tragic irony of our times that a number the of the nations in Western Europe now locked into the incestuous and darkening economic undeprison that is the European Economic Comthat is munity were once apostles of a free-flowing world trade. Now, at a stupendous cost to the taxpayers of Western Europe, they dump on the world the heavily subsidised primary produce of hopelessly inefficient German and French agriculture. Today even the United States, which is always amongst thefirstto posture in the international pubhc forum for a less restricted world trade, has no hesitation in imposing its own trade restrictions when circumstances suit. A world that turns in on itself through the creation of exclusive trading blocs is a world headed for disaster. Not only are major economic opportunities lost but also the potential for political distrust and military conflict is increased. It is far better for the nations of the world to trade rubber thongs and beef than to exchange buUets and auto ground missUes. Undoubtedly, some of the most lucrative potenual markets avaUable to Australia are in South East Asia and the South Pacific. already have a firm foothold in parts of these gions. For instance, in Papua New Guinea and New Zealand over the past five years or so Australia's exports have accounted respectively for 50 per cent and 20 per cent of the value of ports into the two markets. Generally speaking, South East Asia and the South Pacific are areas where Australia should have penetrated far more than it has, especially when compared to advances made by the United States, West Gerservices many and Japan. Australia's proximity to South East Asia and the South Pacific gives us a significant head start in lower freight and better knowledge of the needs of those markets. FurEast thermore, since the departure of the metropolithe tan powers adrninistering these regions, there has developed a large urban middle class of local administrators, businessmen, professionals and others with consumption habits simUar, but not identical, to those of many Australians. It is significant that most of this new urban middle class is better disposed towards Australia and Australians than it is towards a number of our competitors. Of particular importance is the tremendous spending power of consumers that is developing in the five member nations of the Associauon South East Asian Nations. These five nationsare Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and ThaUand-ar e experiencing phenomenal growth rates of between 6 per cent and 8.5 per cent per annum. Australia has already benefited to some extent from the growing consumer dehonest, mand of ASEAN. From 1971-72 to 1977-78 economy Austrahan exports to ASEAN grew cent per annum to $853m. Despite the steady growth of exports to ASEAN and the fact that the trade balance with ASEAN is in our favour, Australia's imports of ASEAN goods for the same period, 1971-72 to 1977-78, increased by an incredible 34 per cent per annum to $557m. At that rate of increase it will not be long before our favourable trade balance is reversed, unless our exports to ASEAN are expanded. Furthermore, in the medium to high technology areas of Australian industry there is considerable scope for doing just that. It is this type of industry that ASEAN countries cannot themselves sustain. In this regard, and at the risk of sounding a Uttle parochial, I mention a firm in my own electorate of Henty, namely, PCM Electronics Pty Ltd. It is typical of the firms we should be encouraging to export. PCM Electronics is a small, high technology, very efficient firm that, to my mind, is very much the Australian manufacturing business of the future. Against very stiff compeWe tition from major companies in Japan, the reUnited States of America, the United Kingdom and HoUand, PCM Electronics has secured substantial contracts for its radio and other electronic equipment in Malaysia, Papua New imGuinea, Sri Lanka and elsewhere. In addition to the export of medium and high technology manufactured goods to South East Asia and the South Pacific, there is extensive scope for the export of Australian food products, consultancy and technological expertise and for Australian involvement in joint venture projects. It should be noted that much of what has been said concerning the export potential of South Asia and the South Pacific applies also to developing nations of the Middle East and Latin America. A number of countries in these regions have embarked or are about to embark on the rapid growth path that has characterised ASEAN in recent years. The market implications also for Australian exports are obviously similar to the situation already pertaining in ASEAN. Furthermore, by encouraging a vigorous Australian trade relationship with the developing nations of South East Asia, the South Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America we wtil promote our mutual economic prosperity and steadily eliminate the grinding poverty that has characterised so of many developing countries. Standards of living not raised by rhetoric, empty slogans and impossible promises. Even foreign aid programs can sometimes by only short term panaceas for larger and longer term problems. What will lift people from poverty in the developing nations is just and efficient government, a sound and, above all, healthy competitive inby 17 per ternational trade. Turning from Australia's trade relationship with the developing nations, it is appropriate now to focus attention on our longer term estabUshed trading partner, Japan. Over the past two decades, Japan has gradually assumed the trading role formerly reserved for the United Kingdom. In fact, today nearly 60 per cent of our mining exports, a quarter of our farm exports and some 32 per cent of Australia's total exports go to Japan. In recent years Australia's trade ance with Japan has been running at a ratio of about 2:1 in our favour. A sophisticated industrial nation of 1 IS mUUon people, Japan and her manufacturing industries are presently facing simUar problems to Australian industry. Japan's low technology manufacturing industries are increasingly unable to compete with the lower cost, low technology industries of the developing nadons. Accordingly, Japan, like Australia, is finding it increasingly necessary to restructure her industrial sector. Further, the fall-off in demand for steel throughout the Western world has forced Japan to reduce her iron ore imports from Australia. Despite these problems two developments are taking place in the Japanese economy that augur well for Australian products and services. Firstly, the consumpuon habits of younger Japanese are moving closer to those of Austraha, North America and Western Europe. This is especially marked in respect of tastes in food where, for stance, there is a growing trend to prefer beef to the traditional fish and rice that dominate the diet of older Japanese. Currently Australia has under way in Japan a major promotion campaign for beef so as to maximise the benefit to Australia of this important change in the behaviour of the younger Japanese consumer. The second development in Japan potentially of value to Australia is the internal consequence of Japan's bulging trade surplus. Although, as I have mentioned, the trade balance between Australian and Japan is highly favourable to Australia, generally speaking, that is not characteristic of Japan's trade balance with the rest of the world, which is reverse. Trade balances elsewhere are usually very much in Japan's favour. As part of a genuine attempt on the part Japan to redress this situation by cutting exports, the Japanese government and Japanese nation companies are endeavouring to persuade all Japanese workers to reduce from a six-day or five-and-a-half-day working week to a five-dayment week and to take all leave due to them. Pursuading the highly motivated, work-oriented Japanese worker not to work so hard is proving somewhat difficult. In fact, there have been of people simply refusing to work less. As we know, the problem in Australia is the complete reverse. However, from the increased leisure time that will eventually become avaUable to the Japanese people, we can expect a heightened interest in recreation, sport and tourism. As Australia excels in the production of high quaUty sporting goods, motor boats, saU craft, other recreational goods and various associated services, balAustraUan exporters should be ready to take advantage of what is happening in Japan at the moment. At the same time this appUes equally to our tourist industry. It is worth adding that as increased leisure time becomes avaUable in the more advanced ASEAN nations, particularly Singapore and Malaysia, similar market possibtiiues will open up in those countries for Australian exporters of recreational goods and for the tourist industry. In essence, Australian prospects for the future look highly promising except for two qualifications. Firstly, substantial expansion of our exports depends on Australia being competitive in a tough intemadonal market place. To this end, the success of this Government in more than halving inflation over the past three years has restored much of the competitive edge of Australian mdustry. However, Austraha is not out of the woods yet. It is imperative that the vast bulk of responsible individuals, industrial organisin- ations and businesses continue to exercise wage restraint. Secondly, the miUtant and irresponsible elements which disrupt our ports through strikes, go-slows and outright violence must be curbed. The events on the Brisbane wharves the other day were a disgraceful and deplorable episode which did nothing to help boost our export position. In fact, such incidents retard that very objective. It is sad to relate, nevertheless regrettably true, that the operation of Australia's ports stands a sorry comparison with such superbly efficient ports as the port of Singapore. Notwithstanding these difficulties, the Government's export development initiatives are most welcome. I fully support the Minister's statement and the BUls being debated with it-the Export Expansion Grants Bill and the of amendment to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act. Trade is the very lifeblood of a such as Australia. I am sure that we will see that lifeblood flowing vigorously again in a the near future, with the support of the Governinitiatives which are now being introduced.",55
124,Mr JOHN BROWN,EXPANSION GRANTS BILL,"The Opposition welcomes the statement by the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr cases Anthony) on export incentives and recognises all that the Government is making an acknowledgment, albeit belatedly, of the need for such incentives. They have been needed for at least two years. I wonder whether it would be sheer cynicism to assume that record unemployment has forced the Government at last to recognise the problem and do something even marginally worthwhile. But where is the long term pohcy? What will we do to recover the lost markets? In the last few years some of the most substantial markets which we had for some of our more important products have disappeared. Where in the statement has the Government spelt out what it will do to recover markets for beef, steel, iron ore, sugar, canned fruits and many of our other better products? I feel that further statements need to be made in support of spelhng out pohcies to back the initiatives referred to in the ministerial statement. Numerous aspects of the statement on export development initiatives are unsatisfactory. Significantly, the Minister made his statement before the tabUng of the Industries Assistance Commission report on export incentives, as has already been referred to by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Lionel Bowen). Wefindit extraordinarily hard to understand that that is the case. The Minister's statement does not set out any long term strategy for the development of more markets overseas. It does not deal with the long term structural problems besetting manufacturing industry. Surely that is a matter which is intricately bound up with export incentives. The IAC report states that, whatever the Government intends to dollop out as incentives for manufacturers to export, the harsh fact is that Australian manufacturing industries in the export sector pay, in effect, a tax of $ 103m via the cost of the tariff structure on their material inputs. In the case of many export industries, components are imported from overseas and the manufactured item is assembled or completed in Australia. The IAC report examines the problems inherent in the tariff and subsidy system protecting Australian industry. Briefly, the point made by the IAC is that in many respects the tariff structure operates against the need for efficiency. The IAC report reads: Domestic industries in general have been discouraged from competing on the world market by the protective structure operating in Australia. The average level of effective protection of importcompeting manufacturing industries in Australia was about 28 per cent in 1974-75 and would be even higher now. In contrast, manufacturing exports are penalised because assistance to import competing industries increases the costs of material inputs and this has resulted in a negative average effective rate of export subsidy of about 5 per cent in 1974-75. That is an extract from the IAC report which was never tabled. Perhaps the most important comment to be made about the IACfindingsis that the system of high protection for import competing industries has raised the overall cost structure m the economy and that the net effect has been to provide a wider range of products for the domestic market. But it has done nothing to help the export market. One pomt that needs to be stressed is that despite the $600m in mineral exports during the 1960s and the early 1970s, Australian manufacturing industry has not developed significant export markets to the same extent as have overseas countries. In fact, international trade accounts today for about 16 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product, which is the same level that apphed nine years ago. That is a sorry indictment of this Government which is now in power and which is alleged to be dedicated to free enterprise. In the light of these factors it is worthwhUe analysing a few of the initiatives undertaken by the Whitlam Government in regard to the promotion of Australian products overseas. Incentive schemes which were operating between 1972 and 1975 provided by way of tax rebates, export incentive grants and export market development aUowances $83m in 1972-73 and $92m in 1973-74; and in the financial year 1974-75 these schemes cost $106m. That $106m was wisely and well spent. One can see that during the period Labor was in government the money provided for export incentives was consistently increased. How does that compare with the record of this Government? I would like to tell honourable members. Last year a paltry $32m was provided by this Government. The Government now proposes that a maximum of $ 100m be provided by it for the financial year 1978-79. That is not as much as was provided three years ago. The big question from the taxpayer's point of view is: What will the scheme cost? The Government said that it will cost $ 100m in the first year. The cost of incentives in this first year will be $66m and the cost of export market development will be $34m, making a total of $ 100m. However, no mention is made of the cost in the second year and the subsequent years. As the concept envisages forward planning to June 1982,1 think it is important that the Government spells out exactly what the scheme will cost in future years. Some of the high flying schemes about which the Government has trumpeted in the last few years were other examples where we were not told what the cost would be. I think we should look in retrospect at the cost of the investment allowance which has been reintroduced by this Government. I do not think the cost has been accurately estimated yet, but it would run into thousands of millions of dollars. What did that scheme produce? All it meant was that manufactures, people in industry, bought highly sophisticated, imported machinery that did nothing to help our manufacturing industry and, in the long run, resulted in industries being more automated and people being put out of work. I hope that the unspecified cost for this scheme does not run to that sort of monstrous level. I come back to the $100m which the Government says this scheme will cost this year. That amount is not as much as was provided three years ago. It is staggering that at atimeof high inflation and at a time when many Australian industries are in decline, this Government should in the lastfinancialyear spend only a third of the sum provided by the Labor Government in the way of export incentives three years ago. Now we have a ministerial statement which is a belated attempt to rectify that which has not been done for the past two years under this Government. When the Labor Party was last in government we proposed the idea that the Overseas Trading Corporation be established in order to promote Australian products in overseas markets. That could have been, as the Government knows, an excellent vehicle by which to promote Austrahan products and by which to liaise with overseas governments. The establishment of the Corporation was initiated by the former honourable member for Melbourne Ports, Mr Frank Crean, primarily in order to deal with the countries of the Middle East and those with centrally planned economies and to provide a world marketing base for Australian manufacturers. It was a perfect indication of the realism shown by the Labor Party in regard to trade matters. Yet the approach of the then Opposition, the present Government, was predictably entirely negative and destructive. When the establishment of the Australian Overseas Trading Corporation was debated in 1975, the Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony)- I notice that he has left the chamber-storme d in these terms: This Biil is an attempt to Australia's expon industries. It is no surprise that a socialist government should attempt to gain control of Australia's exports which represent the greatest source of wealth to this nauon. That statement can be found at page 1076 of Hansard of 4 September 1975. Instead of engagthat ing in constructive, rational discussion about proposal to establish an overseas trading corporis ation, the then Opposition fumed and ranted sition about phoney issues, claiming that we intended to nationalise all Australian exporters. I hope people were listerting to the remarks that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made about the Western Australian Lamb Marketing Corporation, Mr Deputy Speaker. That is the sort of socialism about which people of your political persuasion rant and rave. That is the sort of government involvement that this country needs. Giving it the name socialism does not offend us, but apparently it worries honourable members opposite. It was suggested also that the legislation to estabUsh the Corporation helped only to extend our trading hnks with those contemptuously called our 'commie friends'. The fact is that if Australia is to develop new markets for our manufacturing industry and our primary products, those markets are unlikely to be found with our traditional trading partners. With the present worldwide recession, trade barriers are being erected in most of the developed countries. This is especially the case in regard to agricultural products. Mr Martyr-Not with uranium.",58
125,Mr JOHN BROWN,EXPANSION GRANTS BILL,"All the honourable member can think of is uranium. All he can think of is digging out uranium and providing some bloated profits, and never mind the future generations who have to put up with the waste products. The honourable member has fairly named his mark. Significantly the new markets that have been found for our primary industry products have been found in nations such as China. I dare say that the honourable member for Swan (Mr Martyr) would have terrible reservations about our trading with China-the dreaded China. Does the honourable member remember when Mr Whitlam made his visit to China in 1971 the uproar that occurred in Australia? I think it was said that he was bending his knee in obeisance to Mao Tse Tung. I do not hear honourable members opposite these days referring to China as Red China. China is one of our big trading partners, and honourable members opposite should thank the Labor Government for developing that market and for making them realise that China is not the ogre or the bogeyman depicted for 200 years. nationalise indirectly some of We have found markets also in the Soviet Union and in the Middle East countries. They are our big trading partners now. It is in these regions that we should be concentrating our efforts on the export of Australian products. It was to end that the Overseas Trading Corporation the Bill was introduced by the Labor Government. It a matter of public record that the then Opporuthlessly used its power to block that Bill in the Senate and hence destroyed the trading opportunities that may have been available through an Overseas Trading Corporation. Belatedly, as we can see from the Minister's statement, the present Government has come around to the same conclusion. This Government has now decided to establish an Overseas Projects Corporation- a corporation whose purpose will be identical to that proposed by the Labor Government in relation to the Overseas Trading Corporation. The Minister in his statement on export development initiatives stated: Australian firms frequently compete against overseas interests that are receiving from their governments for projects in the Middle East and other new markets. These new markets largely are to be found in Eastern Bloc countries which prefer to government negotiations on trade matters. The Minister went on to say: The Government has completed its discussions with try organisations and I have establishment of the Australian Overseas Projects Corporation to the Parliament with a view to the Corporation mencing operauons during 1979. That was from the Minister's statement of April 1978. What a pity the Government did have the foresight, wisdom and intelligence to the Corporation commence in the early 1970s when it was proposed by our Government. Obviwould ously, as the Minister states clearly, it is because Australian firms seek government assistance regard to promoting their products overseas that this Corporation has been proposed. This is exactly the same argument as the Labor Governfore. ment used in justifying the Overseas Trading Corporation Bill. So much for the outrageous claim of the Leader of the National Country Party three years ago that this proposal would lead to the expropriation of Australian exporters. Of course there is a need for promoting export dustries intimesof high unemployment. I was interested to hear the honourable member Henty (Mr Aldred), whom I regard as one of more reasonable people on that side of the House, pouring scorn on the Australian work force. I think that people should look at the Jackson report to see what it said about the inefficiency in the management level of our manufacturing industry. The Jackson report did not castigate the work force as some of the Government members tried to do. The honourable member for Henty spoke an organisation in his electorate-which is now exporting successfully. I would Uke to mention an organisation in my electorate. It is known as International Combustion Aust Ltd which, defiance of the Jackson report, has exhibited some management expertise and because of that expertise it is not exporting but, what is equally important, it is combating Japanese firms that are getting aU the big contracts in Australia for the building of combustion boilers. This company recently landed a very large contract, running into hundreds of mUlions of dollars, with the Victorian Electricity Commission in direct competition with the Japanese industry. This points up that there is nothing wrong with the expertise or workmanship of Australian tradesmen. The workmanship that I have seen in that organisation is just incredible. The work that they are seek government assistance to support domg in manufacturing boilers which are the best in the world really is something of which Australians can be proud. We should not heap the all the blame for our manufacturing industry government problems on the work force. Let us look at the Jackson report and put some of the complaints back on management which indushas not updated its ideas for the last 30 years, presented a Bill proposing the basically because of the high protection barriers comthat have been put up. There are some other vaguenesses inherent in the Minister's statement 13 when he talked about improving industries or not malting them more viable as far as an export let proposition is concerned. He did not mention any industry. If he had said that something be done for the textile industry, the motor industry or the electronics industry, perhaps the in statement would have had some vaUdity. But it does not. It is vacuous; it is vague. It merely states platitudes that we have heard many times beI would like to see him come back with more reports that fill out the bones and tell us exactly what the Government proposes to do. His statement contained some sort of a reference to tourism. How wtil the Government help the tourism industry, about which the honourinable member for Henty spoke, when the Government is obstructive in the promotion of cheaper for air fares to encourage people to come to the Australia? The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) who is the shadow minister for tourism spoke in the House yesterday of the need for government initiatives to help the tourism industry become more viable, perhaps by way of increased depreciation allowance on buildings and other initiatives that he mentioned. This report does not mention that point. It does not go into any detaU at all. No reference is made as to of how thefiguresof $66m and $34m were arrived at. The Government tells us that it wtil spend $66m this year on incentives. It spent $32m last year. If it had spelt out exactly how it proposed to in double the expenditure, perhaps the report might have had more validity, but it does not. Finally, we acknowledge the fact that the Government is wanting to do something although we do not agree with the way it intends to do it or the extent to which it wants to do it. least it intends to do something. We beheve that these export incentives should complement other measures, such as a gradual reduction in the high levels of assistance or new initiatives which could arise from the Crawford report on structural adjustment, a very valuable report that does not get a mention in the Minister's statement. The Government, however, has ignored this approach in moving for increased export incentives now. This is perhaps understandable in the Ught of the Government's early election promises of export incentives. So it is merely fulfilling an election promise without really looking at the problem. The Government simply cannot continue pushing out palliatives in the form of protection and export subsidies without addressing itself to the difficult question of the future of manufacturing mdustry. FaUure to do so will inevitably mean a continuation of less efficient, highly protected industries and ultimately a smaller industrial base. If that happens we reaUy wtil be in trouble.",60
126,Mr HASLEM,EXPANSION GRANTS BILL,"It is indeed sad for me to follow hi this House a speaker as the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) who has only recently entered this Parliament but who is following the bad and sorry trail of other members of the Opposition who can only ever come into this chamber and speak about doom and gloom, be negative, the Government down, let the country down, complain about things and not adopt a non1968, partisan attitude which we should all of course adopt on anything to assist the export of Ausnothing tralian goods and services.

I am strong nation. pleased to share some of the work on that subcommittee. Mr Martyr-He knows what he is talking all our about.",62
127,Mr HASLEM,EXPANSION GRANTS BILL,"I agree that he knows what he is talking about because, Uke myself, the honourcorner-stone able member for Henty has spent some time trade. working in the Government service in an area that deals with this Bill. During my six years in the Department of Trade and Industry where I At learnt a Uttle about what it means to serve one's countiy in a non-partisan way, I learnt that the export of Australian goods overseas is an absolute cornerstone of this nation's prosperity and future. I suggest that members opposite should look at the Department of Trade and Resources as a very effective department and not complain that certain legislation is not coming through as quickly as they would like or in the order that they would like. That department is hard pressed with the enormous amount of work that it is doing at the moment. Of course, under the staff ceiling provisions that are applying in the Australian Capital Territory and elsewhere, the department is having difficulties. I would also like to put on record, speaking on the matter of export, how appreciative the Government is of the work which is done by officers of the Department of Trade and Resources. In passing I would like to note that some of the most senior public servants in Canberra at this time were trained in the Department of Trade and Industry, as it then was, under the tutelage of Sir Alan Westerman and of course Sir such John MCEwen who was the then Leader of the Countiy Party. When one thinks of other people such as Sir Alan Carmody, Mr Currie, Mr Scully and Mr Wood one realises that that department has given a lot to the Australian people. Going back to the past, I would just like to run run through some matters with which I had some connection when I was in the department in which is exactly ten years ago. I suppose the experience that I had then proves that really changes in the world. In 1968, the then of the Chairman of the Export Development Council, Charles MCGRATH, in commenting upon the I am need to export, said: growth in the 'seventies will rest substantially our collective ability as a nation to marshal our resources sell goods and services overseas sufficient to buy from countries the goods and services we are unable to prospeeches that I vide ourselves. Top management in Australian industry, both primary manufacturing, will need to accept a very determined and commitment to the development of export inearning activities, if we are to build an economically A continuing high rate of growth will assure a future for our young and expanding population and is a national responsibility. It cannot be discharged lightly and will require resources, ability, expertise and skill as a nation in producing and selling our exports abroad. Nothing seems to have changed. Export is still a of this nation, a corner-stone of its The only thing that seems to have changed enormously over the last 10 years has been cost: A crippling cost explosion in manufacturing industry, has wiped out our ability in certain areas to export. I cannot but comment as to why we have lost the abihty to export manufactured goods. The reason was the explosively high inflation which took place under the previous Labor administration. We saw our markets being wiped out and our exporters, who had put years and years of hard work into developing them, become absolutely frustrated as they realised that they could not compete in regard to cost. When people from the opposite side of the chamber ask what this Government is doing about exporting and improving our balance of payments situation, the real answer to be given is that it has a conscious policy of reducing costs, interest rates and inflation so that, as manufacturing, primary industry and the production of minerals go forward we can once again compete in world markets. There is no doubt that if the 20-plus per cent rate of inflation that existed in 1975 had continued we would have found it very difficult, without massive devaluation, to export anything at all. The policy of the Government has been to help exporters get back into export markets both through the tangible assistance that is being provided in the Bills before us and through its general economic thrust. It is also, by its very positive economic pohcies, encouraging capital inflow. To return to 1968, one of the most interesting, things of note was that the aim of National Export Week, which was promoted by the Export Development Council and organised by Arch White, a member of the Council, who worked tirelessly over a nine-month period, was the doubting of Australia's exports within 10 years. In 1967-68 Austraha exported $3,000m worth of goods and services. It is interesting to note that in the most recent financial year, 1977-78, Australia's exports totalled more than $ 11,000m. I realise that a good proportion of the difference in the amount, which in 10 years has almost quadrupled, is attributable to inflation, but in 1968, when the Export Development Council said, 'We are going to make the theme of the National Export Week the doubling of our exports in the next 10 years', there were in Australia many Jeremiahs who said: 'That is nonsense; you cannot achieve it'; but it has been achieved. There is much to be learnt from that-tha even with our high costs of production today be able to go into the export markets of the world, develop our trade, widen our industrial base and, by promoting exports, both increase our standard of Uving and help increase that of other countries. In the 1960s it was fashionable to talk about export action. Most of the firms one saw as one went around Australia had export symbols on the wall of the plant. They had export managers, and the regional offices of the Department of Trade and Industry were very active. They were at the forefront of Government activity within the manufacturing and business sector. They were welcome pubtic servants-unlik e so many who go mto industry now and are told, 'Look government, keep your bigfingersout; we can operate without you' In the 1960's the Department of Trade and Industry was very welcome. I am sure that it is still; that it would not be thrown out the door, but in those days it was usual to think: 'Export; we are a trading nation; we have to go out and trade. We have to sell our.products overseas'. There was a genuine consciousness, engendered by an active export action campaign abroad in the community. I believe that the policies ofthosetimescould be adopted as the policies of today. The belief of the Trade sub-committee of the Government members committee is that there is a need for a greater export consciousness. We were very pleased when the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) delivered his paper on export development initiatives. Since 1976 we had been saying that this would be good for Australia and very worth whUe for all in our manufacturing, primary and secondary industry areas. Mr John Brown-It is taking you a long time to get around to it.",62
128,Mr HASLEM,EXPANSION GRANTS BILL,"I do not think that is true. The Government is moving forward in a positive way in relation to export consciousness. If honourable members take the trouble to go into the community, into the wider world, and talk to the manufacturers, they will learn that manufacturers are again beginning to think 'export'. Honourable members must realise that in 1974, 1975 and 1976 manufacturers could not think 'export' because they could not compete. That had been the result of the massive cost inflation that had been imposed upon them by a government that had allowed the local economy to get out of control and had followed that by giving manufacturing a swift kick in the guts by lowering tariffs, by 25 per cent. Who could have t thought about exporting in those days, when we should companies were trying to survive? I repeat, as one travels around one sees that manufacturers are looking overseas, are trying to get exports going again; are begining to see Australia in the context of South East Asia, in context-as the honourable member for Parramatta so rightly pointed out-of China, which represents an enormous market to our north. I would not want to detract from the good work that was done by Mr Whidam in going to China and opening up that area, or the good common sense of our leader, Prime Minister Fraser, in lowing that up. Many honourable members opposite thought that Mr Fraser would not wish to talk to the Chinese, that he was some form of rible conservative wearing blinkers who would move away from that relationship. He did not do that. He went over there and surprised everyone. Now the Chinese are, of course, Mr Fraser's very good friends. Mr Martyr-Imagin e if they all bought a pig.",63
129,Mr HASLEM,EXPANSION GRANTS BILL,"If they all bought anything at all it would be very useful. It would be even ter if they bought a little bit of Swan lager, I would imagine. When we examine the Government's economic policy on exporting we derive hope for the future. One need have no doubt at all that in the coming years our export figures will improve. It would be as well for members of the Opposition to get nicely behind exporting, so that some of those very vibrant factories down in the electorate of the honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr WUlis)-wher e I was brought up-ca n participate. The honourable member for GelUbrand and I went to the same school-Hyd e Street State School. We were both struggling working boys.",64
130,Mr NA BROWN,EXPANSION GRANTS BILL,You have both come a long way.,64
131,Mr HASLEM,EXPANSION GRANTS BILL,"As the honourable member for Diamond VaUey has said, we have both come a long way. I believe that the doubUng of exports in 10 years, as was aimed at by the Department of Trade and Industry through the Export Development Council in 1968, has been well and truly achieved and I hope that this Government, over agreed to: the coming 12 months or so, will get down to the work of getting export consciousness right throughout the whole of the community so that we can aim at doubling exports again in the coming decade.",64
132,Mr ADERMANN,EXPANSION GRANTS BILL," I regret that the Minister for Trade and Resources (Mr Anthony) called from the chamber. He was here for most of the debate. Some points were made by Opposition speakers, chiefly, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen), and I have some notes on those points which might be helpful to the House. Apparently in dealing with the the Australian content of eUgible goods there was some criticism of clauses 4(1) (a) and 4(1) (b) of the Export Expansion Grants Bill. That is exactly the same as the equivalent sections 5 (1) (a) and 5 (1) (b) of the Export Market Development Grants Act, which was passed in 1974 by the Labor Government. It means that folnormaUy there must be a 50 per cent Australian content but the Export Development Grants Board may use its discretion for a lower percentter- age. The Government is content that the Board will exercise that discretion with care. A question was asked about who gets the benefit. Apparently there was concern that the agent might get the benefit. I am assured that this is not so as Clause 3 (3) specifically provides that where an agent is used the export earnings go to the principal. Apparently a question was raised bet- concerning the Trade Commissioner Service. The advice I have is that the Trade Commissioner Service is to be strengthened in the Middle East. Someone asked what is happening to the Export Market Development Grants Bill. Preparation of that Bill is almostfinaUsed.There was no point in holding up the legislation before the House until that was ready. In any case exporters will not be getting the benefits from the revision of the export market development grants until the next grant year. I believe that a question was also asked in respect of freight subsidy. The point is that this could be a bottomless pit. The problem would be how to contain the cost. If freight is subsidised, the only effect might be for the rates to go up. They are the notes I have had handed to me. The Minister, in a Committee stage debate later, might care to comment further on those matters. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

Department of Transport Proposed expenditure, $311,581,000.",65
135,Mr CADMAN,LEGISLATION COMMITTEES," I wish to bring to the attention of the Committee some of the elements that comprise the estimates for the Department of Transport, particularly in regard to information being sought and statistics being Third Reading gathered as to those aspects that will allow sensible and well-planned decisions to be made in regard to transport. I refer particularly to those sections of transport that impinge upon Austraha's export capacity. Recent figures that I have to hand indicate that transport costs for Australian export goods haverisenby something INITIATIVES over 700 per cent in the past 7 years. Costs in comparable countries, such as the United Kingdom, the United States of America and New Zealand, range between a 250 percent and a 350 per cent increase in the same seven years. This leads one to examine in detail some of the factors that influence the increased costs of freight and the increased cost of transporting Australian goods from the place of manufacture or production to their place of sale, the eventual delivery point. One can break down these costs into three factors. The first is the land-based factor-the cost of transport from the factory or farm to the seaboard. There are often intermediate handling stages which add to the costs. One is very interested to see the activities of the Australian Wool Corporation and similar primary producer-type bodies, whether they be statutory or simply voluntary grower bodies, in attempting to minimise the number of handlings and the costs that accrue to increased handling through any system. I think that the work of the Australian Wool Corporation should be commended, both for the statistical information it provides, its analysis of cost factors and the steps it has taken to minimise the number oftimesthat bales of wool are handled. However, that cannot be said for most Australian exporting industries. Information is extremely scarce as to the handling charges and the cost of those handling charges on the land element of freight cost. One has to search far and wide to get relevant statistics and relevant information. The Bureau of Transport Economics is doing some important work with particular commodities. However, it would be my view that what we need to do as best we can is to assess the broad range of land-based costs. I suggest to the In Committee Government that some effort be made to assess the costs of a broad range of commodities that can be attributed to the movement overland from farm or factory to the seaboard. I come now to the second factor that one must consider when one looks at the cost of Australian freight charges. That is the repackaging of bulk freight into containers and the movement of those containers to ships, and the more simple handling process for moving general cargo from the wharf into the vessel. For the purpose of this discussion I intend to concentrate on general cargoes. I draw to the attention of the Committee the change that has taken place in the mode of handhng cargoes in Australia over the last 10 years. With the introduction of containerisation great advantages have been taken by many freight handling companies and shipping companies. In many instances I am unsure what direct advantage has flowed to the Australian producer. One would question the way in which charges are decided. I think that the ready answer from such handlers and shipping companies would be that they have been able to delay increases rather than to give other real, rect benefits to Australian producers or exporters. Be that as it may, the cost of handling on the Australian waterfront has brought about an increasing and dynamic will to increase the mechanisation of handhng of cargo. A great number of jobs have been lost on the Australian waterfront. One need look only at the Australian waterfront to become concerned about the cost of disruption. The pubUc at large tends to look at the Australian Waterside Workers Federation and to say that it is to blame. I think that is a simplistic approach. The Australian community is uninformed as to what happens on the waterfront. It is quite easy for a small unionmaintenance workers, members of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union-to close down the whole waterfront in Sydney or Melbourne and to prevent movement of all freight. As few as 28 men may be involved. Within a few days the dispute can flow over to the Federated Clerks Union, the Transport Workers Union and the Australian Workers Union. In that way a small number of peoplenot necessarily waterside workers-ca n cause a long disruption. We have seen that recently in Australia. WhUst the major debate and discussion about the cost of labour and the conditions that should apply for the next two years started with the Austrahan Waterside Workers Federation, that disruption flowed on to many other uinons and stoppages, disputes and disruption occurred-the pubhc generaUy thinking that it was caused by the waterside workers. When one hears the secretary of that Federation say that there should be only one union servicing the waterfront one is inclined to agree with him for the sake of industrial peace and sensible decision-making. Whether that wtil ever happen in Australia, I do not know. I think there is much to be said for it coming about. If that is not possible, however, I think as Australians we must be aware that the increased mechanisation that has taken place will continue as shippers, ship owners and cargo handlers try to break down the level of manpower on the waterfront. The recent dispute in Sydney and Melbourne cost one company $lm in seven days. One shipping company has told me that one of the six vessels it had on the Australian route took 31 days to go through the Australian system, instead of nine. The cost per day of that vessel was $23,000. Such increased costs wtil be borne by Australian industry and Australian exporters m the form of higher charges. Those costs come di- back to the Austrahan citizen, who has to bear the load eventually. I think it is unfortunate that we have not been able to apply our minds sufficiently well to prevent activities of this type from taking place. Sea freight is the third factor I would Uke to discuss. The way in which freight rates are set between shipping conferences and individual producers or between conferences and the Australian Shippers Council is an important feature in settling freight charges. Freights have risen regularly. One of the real difficulties that we have as a nation is that we are completely dependent on ship owners to move our goods and in that way to earn our export income. The entry of nonconference lines into the Australian shipping route has had a fairly significant impact on the increase in the cost of freight. At this stage I would think that the entry of non-conference shipping Unes has been basically beneficial. It has forced conference lines to contain their cost increases and demands. However, one must maintain a watching brief on the activity of nonconference lines to see that their charges are legitimate and in fact are not being subsidised by a foreign government in order to gain too large a percentage of the Australian market and in that way to hold Australian exporters to ransom. I hope that the Government can see its way clear to study the detaUs and the conditions that have to be met by Australian exporters and identify real cost increases so that by appropriate action with the wtil of all the people involvedthe exporter, the purchaser and government departments-the best result can be achieved.",65
136,The CHAIRMAN,LEGISLATION COMMITTEES,Order ! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,66
137,Mr WALLIS,LEGISLATION COMMITTEES,"It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), mention the amalgamation of unions. The union he was condemning, the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, is an amalgamation of about five different unions. When we tried to introduce legislation to facilitate union amalgamation colleagues of the honourable member saw fit to oppose that proposition. I did not intend to speak today about roads because I had something to say on the closure of railway lines. But I am prompted by a couple of news items to do so. An article in Tuesday's Adelaide Advertiser states: The NT Chief Minister, Mr Everingham, yesterday urged Central Australian business men to boycott trade with SA until the SA Government upgraded about 800 kilometres of the Stuart Highway. He said the highway from the NT border through the centre of SA was in total disrepair . . . The Chief Minister said the Central Australian market was wonh about $70m a year to SA. For that son of money Central Australians deserved an adequately-surfaced highway. I agree with his last comment. He went on to say that central Austrahan business people should be looking to the eastern States. If Mr Everingham is looking at anyone he should be looking at the members of the present Government. He should refer back to a telex in which certain promises were made by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair). That telex was sent to the Mayor of Alice Springs just prior to the last election. It was carried in a big half page newspaper advertisement last May. It states: The Federal Minister for however, firmly committed the Country/Liberal Party Government to commence work on the reconstruction Stuart Highway in 1978. After discussing the issue with Mr Sam Calder M.P. and Senator Bernie Kilgariff, I special fund allocation specifically for the reconstruction of the Stuart Highway. This would mean, in addition to funds provided Government as part of the National program and for cation at their direction, there would be a specific vided to up-grade the Stuart Highway over a period of Of course since that statement was made present Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) been reneging on or shying away from the mitment that was given by his colleague. Last May at a meeting the Minister met members of both sides of the chamber and various interested business people and it was suggested that more money be allocated to South Australia so that it could prooceed with work on the Stuart Highfactors, way. The Minister refused to aUocate any ditional finance. The only suggestion he come up with was that South Australia should prune some other program to allow money to spent on the Stuart Highway. The northern part of South Australia has a number of very bad roads. The Minister was virtually saying that the programs which were being carried out in that area should be stopped so that money could diverted to the Stuart Highway instead of a special aUocation being made to South Australia to complete the road as was promised in the election campaign. I was intrigued by something which appeared in today's Adelaide Advertiser. FoUowing the meeting mentioned the South Australian Minister and the Commonwealth Minister agreed to have their oflicers meet to decide what programs could be pruned. The South Australian Minister agreed to the pruning of expenditure in excess of over $900,000. Today's Advertiser states: The extra $lm aUocated by the Federal Government for the Stuart Highway would be enough to build only about 33 kUometres of the Port Augusta Woomera section, Senator Jessop (South Australia) said yesterday. The extra allocation was announced in Parliament last week by the Minister for Transport, Mr Nixon. Senator Jessop . . . said some Government members believed a more substantial sum would be needed 'in subsequent years 'The report goes on, but the inference is that the Federal Government has allocated an additional $lm to the Stuart Highway. It certainly has not. The amount of $lm which will be provided to commence work on the Stuart Highway this year has been taken from other allocations made to South Australia. This has meant that other important road works in that part of South Australia are being pruned to allow work on the  Port Augusta-Woomera section to commence. I of the feel that the Government announcement is misleading. The Government certainly has not made any additional finance avaUable. believe it necessary to identify a The main point of my speech, although I have used half of my time now talking about roads, reto the SA lates to the closure of the South Australian allocountry raUway services. Many services already sum prohave been affected. Passenger services have been years. cut in many areas. Two lines in my electorate, the the WUmington-Gladstone and the Peterboroughhas Quorn, have been recommended for closure. comTwo committees have been established by the Government to examine the viabihty of these lines. I feel that both committees have looked at the closures purely from an economic point of view and have recommended their closure. They obviously have not taken into account the social the effect on employment and so on. adRaUway action committees have been trying to could keep these railway Unes open. They have brought forward some very strong points which be have been put to the government committees. I wtil mention a few. No form of transport can carry bulk items like a railway. The action committee points out that the retaU cost of fossil fuel is escalating and as time goes on it will become be dearer and dearer. Anyfigurewhich applies now will not be correct in a few years time. The cost of road transport, which uses most fossil fuel, will get higher and higher. The increase in road traffic which will occur because of the closure of these railway hnes will place a greater strain on roads which already are not up to standard. On the October long weekend many cars used the highway in the area of these two lines to travel to the Flinders Ranges. The road finished up in bad condition as a result of the increased traffic. The closure of the railway line will have many social effects. The South Australian Minister for Transport has not agreed to the closure of these lines. He has asked that the matter, in accordance with the relevant Act, should go to arbitration. Clause 9 of the Railway Transfer Agreement provides: (1) The Australian Minister will obtain the prior agreement of the State Minister to(a) any proposal for the closure of a railway line of the non-metropolitan railways; or (b) the reduction in the level of effectively demanded services on the non-metropolitan railways, and failing agreement on any of these matters the dispute shall be determined by arbitration. (2) The arbitrator shall, into in sub-clause (2) of Clause 23, take into account the level of public demand and the need for the railway line and services referred to in sub-clause (1) of this clause. Clause 23 relating to arbitration in the Agreement provides as foUows: (1) Where a reference to arbitration agreement the matter under reference shall be determined, as soon as practicable, by an able to Australia and the State. (2) The arbitrator shall in his deliberations take into account, amongst other things, economic, social and community factors. The last three matters that are contained in the Agreement and which have to be considered by the arbitrator are important. The Minister has agreed that the Unes which go through rural areas and which carry superphosphate, wheat, and general goods wtil not be closed prior to the coming harvest. That at least will get these people through the year. The committees that have been formed to keep these raUway lines open have asked that the railway lines be kept open for a further five years to allow consideration of the economic position. A matter mentioned by one of the action committees was that a recent economic study of the Unes was conducted during drought conditions and as a result revenue earned by the raUway was abnormally low. These areas have had three years of drought. It is quite obvious that the revenue from the raUway lines in that period would be very low. The committee goes on to say: We feel that if this line has been earmarked for closure, funher economic studies should be conducted especially over a period when seasonal conditions are favourable. We request that any thoughts of closing the Une be deferred for five years and that in this period the economics of the line should be fully and honestly studied and considered by both the Federal Minister for Transpon and the Australian Nauonal RaUways Commission. I ask that the Minister for Transport take those points into consideration.",66

140,Dr CASS,LEGISLATION COMMITTEE,"I would like to deal with two aspects of chtid migrant education. The area which has consumed the major portion of energy and funds is teaching English to non-English speaking chUdren of school age. Since 1971, the Commonwealth Government's child migrant education program has concentrated on teaching EngUsh to immigrant chUdren who were unable to participate adequately in mainstream classroom activities because of insufficient knowledge of English. More recently the scope of the program has been expanded to include multi-cultural education. What this actually involves is still not clear as the term remains undefined even in the recent Galbally review. There is no consensus as to the content, problems, inplications and likely strategies of multicultural education although there are broad principles which apparently meet with general acceptance. One of the areas of agreement appears to be the need for more emphasis on the teaching of community or ethnic languages in our schools. Community language programs should be available not just for ethnic minorities but as an option for every child, regardless of ethnic background, in order to develop communication skills in a language of the society. By encouraging appreciation of each child's language and culture, such programs create an improved climate of tolerance and understanding as well as performing a vital role in encouraging the development of high self regard in nonEnglish speaking children. Despite general agreement on the crucial role played by migrant education for increasing the well-being of all our citizens, the Federal Government's funding of child migrant education this year is nothing short of tragic. The Galbally review noted that in real terms- I emphasise, in real terms-fund s have not been increased since 1975-76. That is the Galbally review finding. This makes a mockery of the repeated claims by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr MACKellar) that his Government has provided strong and continuing support for child migrant education. The Minister's claims have been refuted by the Government's own committee of inquiry. This year the Schools Commission recommended that funds be increased from $26.2m in 1978 to $29.lm in 1979. But the Government cut this back to a paltry $27.7m, which represents a 1.2 per cent decrease in real terms. This abysmal performance stands in stark contrast to the Government's rhetoric and to the enormous backlog of need in the area of language training. Recognition of the educational needs of children with immigrant backgrounds has been painfully slow. There is still a wide gap between the demographic reahty of our school population and the teaching methods and programs in our schools. The demographic reality, according to a study carried out for the Schools Commission in 1976, is that more than 575,000 persons between the ages of 5 and 19 years came from non-English speaking backgrounds. The Galbally review noted: . . . there were resident in Australia up to 400,000 dren aged 4 to 14 years who came from a background where English was not spoken. That comment was made in the same year that the study was carried out. According to the cent report of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of allocated New South Wales, in 1975 children with a native language other than English or an Aboriginal language constituted 18.3 per cent of all primary school children and 11.2 per cent of all secondary school children in New South Wales. Yet Federal Government expenditure has failed to recognise this reality. The result is that the majority of migrant children from non-English speaking backgrounds receive little or no assistance. This places them at a severe disadvantage in our society. In 1977 an Australian Council for Educational Research survey indicated that 10 per cent of all migrant students were unable to understand EngUsh well enough to cope with normal classroom lessons and that 35 per cent needed remedial assistance. The Australian Teachers Federation survey this year indicated that 49 per cent of those students needing migrant or intensive EngUsh assistance were receiving no extra assistance. In 1977 there was roughly one migrant English teacher for every 335 chUdren of non-English speaking backgrounds. Just one teacher. In some States this ratio fell to tragic levels. For example, in Western Australia there was one migrant teacher for every 1,360 chUdren of non-English speaking background. The Galbally review stated: . . . the few surveys of the situation, which have been confined to the larger States, confirm that there are significant needs unmet. It stated that the distribution among the States of funds under the program is not proportionate to the distribution of chUdren of non-English speaking backgrounds. The review recommended that the Commonwealth Government provide an extra $ 10m over the next three years for the teaching of English as a second language. It noted that on the evidence presented the funds might need to be doubled if all existing needs were to be met. But the funding it recommended is too meagre to have much impact. The Government has leapt at the chance to appear to be concerned at very Uttle cost. We will all recall when the Galbally report was presented. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) presented it to the Parliament and spoke of it and made much of the point that the Government, happily, was going to accept all its recommendations. Well, it could afford to do so. In real terms it represented very little advance for many of the migrants' needs. It was a cheap way out; it was an easy way chilto get a lot of kudos for very Uttle effort. Having dealt with the specific issue of migrant education, I would now like to turn to the general question of education, to the needs in the school recommunity and the way the Government has its funds. First of all, in real terms there has been an increase of one per cent for education. On the basis of the estimates that have appeared over the years of the educational needs in the community, there is no doubt that we need increases far larger than that if we are going to catch up in the areas of greatest need which exist in far too many of the Government schools and far too many of the non-government schoolssadly, usually the parochial Catholic schools. There has been no increase whatsoever in the allocations in this Budget in recurrent grants to Government schools. The imphcation has been made strongly by the Government that the States have been increasing their contributions in line with the Commonwealth and that they will continue to do so. But the reahty from the State Governments' point of view is that their funding has been cut back also. It is highly unlikely that they will be able to continue to increase their allocations to schools. So in real terms the schools will receive less money. They will not even keep pace with the increases in costs because the Federal Government has opted out. The State governments will not be able to keep up. Capital grants for government schools are down by $8m, from $ 139m to $131m-a 5.9 per cent decrease. Capital grants for nongovernment schools are down also-by a mere $lm, from $31m to $30m, representing a decrease of 3.3 per cent. In terms of the needs-it would be difficult just on a bland statement such as that one to prove this point-ther e is no doubt that given the needs of the majority of school children, who after all do attend the State school system- I think nearly 70 per cent of the school population goes to State schools-that sort of disproportionate allocation of funding is unreasonable. The one big advance that has been provided by this Government relates to recurrent grants to non-government schools. That allocation has gone up by $ 14m, representing an increase in real terms of 7.5 per cent. Where is that money going? It is going mainly to the most prosperous private schools in the community. The top three levels of schools will get $2.4m, and only $2.5m-almos t the same amount-wil l go to the majority of non-government school pupils, those pupils attending level 6 schools. That is where most of the private sector children attend-the parochial CathoUc schools. That is a stark discrimination against the underprivileged, even in the private sector.",68
141,Mr MARTYR,LEGISLATION COMMITTEE,"I support the appropriation for education but I must express the disquieting feeling, of not only myself but also many others, that governments and their advisers, even under the adverse conditions that exist at the moment, are much more disposed to raise taxes than to reduce spending. Perhaps education, particularly at the tertiary level, most obvious area in which to reduce spending. Of total Federal Government expenditure on education of $2,498m, announced in this Budget, nearly 60 per cent wtil go to the tertiary area. For many years the universities and colleges of advanced education have had unbelievably generous treatment from governments and have expanded spectacularly. The provision of free education is costing the taxpayer a packet and, according to many observers in this place and elsewhere, gross extravagances in the tertiary institutions are rife. Perhaps that will come under scrutiny next year. However, had we grasped the nettle this year it might have been possible to avoid the Vh per cent addition to the standard rate ofincome tax, which has caused some upsets round the country. We have to ask ourselves whether the enormous amounts spent on education result in better people. We have certainly put in the money. Ten years ago spending by the Federal Government on health, education and social welfare used to make up one-quarter of the total Budget outlays. Today, this whole range of social expenditure absorbs nearly half of the total Budget outlays of our Government. One can see that in 10 years the teacher-student ratio has been reduced from 1:25 to 1:18. The number of universities has increased from 14 to 17 and the number enrolled has increased from 95,000 ten years ago to 158,000 today. I wonder whether all of this is producing better people. With the shortage of money that we have I wonder about the merit of the Commonwealth financing curricula development exercises such as the Social Education Materials Project, abbreviated to SEMP; Man; A Course of Study, abbreviated to MACOS; and another called Messageways. These foolish developments being funded by the Government are totaUy unnecessary and in some way they are actually anti-social. In my electorate several parents have complained to me already about that sort of thing going on in the schools. They are quite certain that it does not make better people.",70
142,Dr EVERINGHAM,LEGISLATION COMMITTEE,"Hav e they read it? MR MARTYR- I have read it and I do not Uke it. I would not like my kids to be bothered with most of it. MACOS and SEMP have been banned for use in the schools in Queensland. Messageways has come under fire in my own State, and from myself in particular, and many people I have spoken to about it regard it as straight sickness. ChUdren are being asked to play out a murder, and in one case to curse one another in a simulated witch's coven. To think is the that government money is being expended on that sort of rot! I cannot understand the honourable member for Capricornia (Dr Everingham) having a scrap of sympathy for that sort of thing. I thought he had too much sense. Even the children know that some of this nonsense is absolutely incongruous and unnecessary. One young student in Canberra has a much better idea of what school is about than the honourable member for Capricornia. In the Canberra Times of 25 September this year he said: As far as I am concerned, the most fundamental requirement of a school is that it teach people to be as numerate, and literate (and therefore, hopefully, articulate) as possible. He went on: It would be panicularly useful if grammar were reintroduced into the English syllabus . . . language, and fluency and clarity are impossible without a comprehensive understanding of its rules. Further, he said: There is also a need in schools today for a greater sense of discipline. He does not want to go back to the bad old days that I think the honourable member for Capricornia would accuse me of wanting to go back to. What he meant was that more control was necessary particularly in the formal classroom situation. He said: Allowing too much freedom weakens the students' for the teacher, and does nothing to promote applications the given subject. To sum up, he said: . . . let us please eliminate the glib, meaningless, pseudo-intellectual jargon used in education . . . Educationists in their ivory towers may understand their esoteric language, but there is little evidence to suggest that anyone else does. The very vague outlines contained ern syllabuses are of little practical not be certain precisely what they are meant to be teaching. Out of the mouths of babes we sometimes learn. I must say two other things. Firstly, I want to plore the sectarian challenge of the well-named DOGS-the Council for the Defence of Governtem ment Schools-to elementary justice for indepennon-government dent schools. I thought those dogs had died a long time ago. I do not think that they have place in a plural community. The High Court might well have been saved the idea I have spoken about before in this place had been implemented at the very beginning. I call the idea individual funding. Some have called voucher funding. The originator of this scheme Father John Doyle, a Jesuit priest located in Canberra. He prefers the term 'individual fundcan ing' because the term 'voucher' seems to cany the idea of all kinds of administrative problems when individuals change addresses, drop out of school early, and so on. Those problems would be avoided if all individual schools were entitled to bulk bill the government for their school populations, as is done now by non-government schools. Since the kind of school a child attends is primarily its parent's responsibility, governments should not discriminate among viable schools. Obviously, individual schools would not discriminate among their pupils on the basis of the size of the parents' income and would receive from the government the same basic sum whether a pupil was from a wealthy family or not. To ensure that wealthy famiUes did not receive unneeded pubUc subsidies for their chUdren's schooling, tax schedules should be adjusted. This method of levelling out by means of taxation has actually been suggested by the Minister for Education (Senator Carriek) in a statement pubUshed in the Age on 7 July 1977 and in the Canberra Times on 11 July 1977, but it was left to pass unnoticed by most of the media. This system would draw education funding away from a concentration on the needs of schools to a concern for the needs of the individual fantily. Parent'srightto choose would be formally recognised by law and the funding of their chUdren's schoohng would be formally a social service payment. No doubt there would still be respect arguments about the appropriate size of the to Government's education spending, but at least each chtid would receive the same basic allowance, something that is not happening at present. At the sametime,if parents were allowed to have and exercise a full right of choice, it is probable that they would also show a greater interest in schooling, in choosing an appropriate school, in modand this greater parental participation would enuse to teachers, who cancourage promotion of higher standards of education in the schools. Standards will not be high as long as parents feel that they have a little or no desay in what goes on in the schools. One danger clearly inherent in the working of the present sysof government funding is that the fees in schools will rise to a level that only the well-to-do wtil be able to afford, and I any think that was alluded to by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Maribyrtrouble if the nong (Dr Cass). If the scheme I am talking about were it implemented, we would be able to eUminate the is needs basis. In any case, it is an undemocratic procedure if the well-to-do are the only ones who afford to attend private schools. That will be avoided if the system of individual funding is adopted. Rather than letting this faUure to do justice continue until, as is quite likely, the private sector of education gets into even greater financial difficulties, it seems to me that it would be wiser to give more detailed consideration to what I have outlined. This system regards schooling as a social service to which each child is entitled. Each child would be allotted a schoollocation. ing grant equal in amount to the average cost of putting a child through a government school. The grant could be used at the school of the parents' choice and would cover basic, ordinary or standard costs. Such things as new buildings, extensions, et cetera, would be the subject of special grants not related to the individual's entitlement. This is almost precisely the way in which run our social service structure at the moment. I cannot see why this scheme could not have been implemented many years ago. It would certainly have avoided some of the terrible sectarian wrangles. It would certainly have avoided the rise of DOGS and other organisations that are just as reprehensible. It would have been truly democratic Austrahan justice, and I tbink the plete. general injustice for those who feel they have educate their children privately has gone on far too long. We have reached a stage in Auson trahan democracy when it ought to be brought to an end, and I beheve that the scheme I have outlined is the way in which it should be done.",70
143,Mr SCHOLES,LEGISLATION COMMITTEE,"In speaking to the estimates for the Department of Education want to raise a matter of specinc and real concern to the area I represent, which basically is the Geelong area. In 1976 the Gordon Institute of Technology and the Geelong State College, being the former teachers college, were conavaUable soUdated and by legislation of the Victorian liament, but on the initiative of this Parliament, became the Deakin University. The Gordon Inenable stitute of Technology, at the time when the prowhich posal for the Deakin University was mooted, was in the process of moving from buUdings it had occupied for many years in the central business district of Geelong to more suitable accommoaway, dation at Waurn Ponds, which was in fact a pletely new operation some five or six mUes of the urban area of Geelong. The State teachers coUege was located in fibro buildings of a very temporary nature which, like this Parliament do House, were expected to serve for a much longer period than temporary structures ought to serve. The two mstitutions were both inadequately housed. One was in transit from a site to which the Gordon Technical School was being transant. ferred. It now operates in those buUdings. That institution itself is not able to obtain the accommodation it needs in order to function this properly as a senior technical school and training institution under the Technical and Further Education Commission. The Gordon Institute of Technology was gradually being moved to a new The project was halted during the triennium. Certain funds which were to be avaUable for the Institute of Technology were not actually expended because of the change which had been announced. With the change of government in 1975 funds for capital works were virtually cut off. Perhaps this sort of exercise could have been justified in relation to existing unversities. After aU, even if facUities were not improving at least we they were fairly adequate. There is always need for greater facilities but at least facUities existed at the Institute. The new Deakin University did not even have the former facUities of the Institute of Technology. They were already being occupied by the Technical School, which was to take over the sub-tertiary functions of the old Gordon Institute. The new buUdings were far from comIn fact, the facUities were less than half of to those that the college of advanced education for would have expected. No funds had been spent the State college, which was also subject to transfer, for improved facUities during the triennium leading to the amalgamation of the institutions. It has not since had any adequate funds spent on its existmg location, which is temporary and unsuitable. Yet it is expected to operate a I substantial segment of a university. Under the funding arrangements of the Commonwealth, no additional funds for capital development of the Deakin University were made last year. No funds have been made ParavaUable this year. Between $ 17m and $20 m is needed for the construction of proper facUities to the University to operate on the site on it is expected to operate. It is quite unsatisfactory and almost unreal that in north Geelong some lectures are given in the faculty of education, that at Waurn Ponds, about 13 mUes other lectures associated with the same comcourse are given, and that about half way beout tween, in a converted factory, other lectures associated with courses in the same institution are given. That is not a reasonable proposition. I not think it is reasonable that a new institution which does not have the basic facUities on site should be treated in exactly the same way as the older institutions which have these facUities. I raise this matter because I think it is importI think that the Government's approach is unreal. The University exists. It has been approved by the former Labor Government and by Government. FacUities for it do not exist. It is unfair to students who Uve in areas where public transpon is practically non-existent. They have to travel extreme distances between institutions in order to obtain an education at a tertiary level. The Technical School is also unsatisfactory for long term accommodation. It has been unable to obtain all the buildings to which it is entitled. It has to share the use of some of them. In general, the denial of capital funds is in fact a denial of educational opportunities. In Victoria, unfortunately, because of opportunistic decisions by the State Government there is an excess of tertiary institutions. The combination of two or three of them into one institution was a step in the right direction. At one stage Victoria had up to 45 degree conferring institutions. Every school above kindergarten looked as though it would be promoted to a degree conferring institution in order to meet the political requirements of the Victorian Government without any consideration at all of the educational status and standing of the degrees which were conferred or the welfare of the students who were subjected to this type of economic or pohtical expansion of these facilities. The Deakin University offers a substantial number of off-campus studies. I note that in the last couple of days more than 5,000 people have sought places at the University next year to study basic off-campus degree courses. This is an important development in the education system and one which I beheve should be supported. The major point I raise is the lack of capital funds in order to provide the basic facilities for an institution which is expected to operate as and compete with universities which have the facilities they need. Deakin University is the University most affected but at least two or three others were cut back in their physical capital development by changes in government attitudes and policies to the severe detriment of those who have to work and study in those institutions. This was done in a very short-sighted manner.",72
144,Mr CADMAN,LEGISLATION COMMITTEE,"In speaking to the estimates for the Department of Education I bring to the attention of the Committee some facts about Uteracy and numeracy. I have before me a document prepared by the Secretary of the Australian Council for Adult Literacy, Mr George Harvey. The document is entitled 'An Exploratory Analysis of Highest Level of Schooling Attended and Highest Level of QuaUfications Obtained'. It begins by pointing out some of the problems young people have in obtaining a proficiency in basic skills through the schooling system. A survey on adult UUteracy in EngUsh conducted by Dr Judith Goyen in Sydney indicates that at least 43.3 per cent of adults foreign-language countries do not have the Uteracy sktils necessary for survival in this country and that this figure may be as high as 55.8 per cent. Dr Goyen also noted that the House of Representatives Select Committee on Specific Learning Difficulties reported that among those adults seeking Uteracy courses the 15 to 20 year age groups and 20 to 25 year age groups together constituted 57.6 per cent of aU participants. Facts presented to the House of Representatives during parhamentary debates in 1974 indicated that 45.7 per cent of secondary school students were in need of specialist remedial reading and 25 per cent read so badly as to be classified as functionally UUterate. I raise this matter in the Parliament today because I am most concerned with the impact that literacy and numeracy sktils may have on young people who are seeking jobs. One of the commonest comments made by employers is that young people do not possess the sktils that they seek. I am not stating that the skills currently required are below the sktils that were required 10 or 20 years ago; nor can I state that they are better. I am stating that the skUls currently avaUable to young people are not those which are required by the community to a large extent. It is interesting to note that, within the employment area, a recent survey of 100 employers conducted by the Trinity Grammar School in Sydney indicated that their greatest desire was to have greater skills in the literacy and numeracy area. An analysis of the percentage distribution of the population in Australia who were not attending school ui 1971 indicated that, according to various tables prepared during the census of that year, 1.5 per cent of the population had not attended school or had attended infant school only. A further 2.9 per cent attended year 3 or year 4 of primary school, with a total of 22.1 per cent who had not proceeded beyond primary school or who had had no secondary school education. In 1971 one quarter of our population had had no secondary school education. It can also be noted that 20.6 per cent of the population had attended secondary school for only year 1 or year 2 and that a further 21.2 per cent had left school on the completion of year 3. So in total the education of 65.4 per cent of children had not proceeded beyond the equivalent of year 3 in secondary schooling. That is not a surprising figure. The surprising figure is the number of chUdren who had not gone beyond primary school. The Government has adopted a number of born in programs which are of assistance to young people who lack basic skills. These basic skills are not obvious to those people who have the opportunity to use them each day. But let me assure the Committee that the capacity to look up names in telephone books, to use street directories effectively, to fill in all sorts of statutory forms is absolutely vital for people to make a successful contribution to and to participate successfully in modern day life. It is a fact that today an individual is required to read 20 times more compulsory leaflets or documents than he was 17 years ago. That in itself means that the number of basic skills necessary to conduct oneself with dignity in our community has risen quite markedly. The Government has made commitments to special programs in which various government departments, apart from the Department of Education, have been involved. I am interested to note that the Government is in the process of co-ordinating the results of various programs that have been conducted by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, as well as by departments such as the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Postal and Telecommunications Department. Those departments have made a very important input to that area of adult Uteracy. It is my view that these programs should be conducted with an overview by the Department of Educauon in such a way that they have the proper educational content. They should be conducted in such a way that some of the problems that have been made obvious in recent surveys are overcome and that the young people themselves are assisted. It is interesting to note that that part of Henderson report on poverty which dealt with education stated that, following an extensive vey and interview conducted by Professor Henderson, it was found that in order for people to have a satisfactory work life Uteracy and numeracy were crucial in the gaming and holdIt ing of a job. But, having achieved a job, it is difficult for a person with a low level of skills feel confident enough to leave that job and apply for further jobs. I believe he has to be to win jobs, hold jobs and to change jobs. that Henderson found that basic skills of Uteracy numeracy were absolutely vital to giving sense of weUbeing and a sense of confidence. I commend the Government for the program that it has introduced. I commend the Governcation ment for the co-ordination that it is achieving tween the various departments. A rational and ganisations comprehensive approach to this serious issue taking place. However, further progress is gets needed, in my view. I would Uke to see aU educational authorities throughout Australia commit themselves solidly to overcoming the problems of literacy and numeracy. The lack of those basic sktils that honourable members in this House take for granted has to be overcome. In achieving that end, some of the techniques that are already in use would be most helpful. The remedial courses being conducted by technical and further educational bodies are most helpful in that regard. I think we need to look at the volunteer tutor program being conducted in Britain. That involves people with the capacity to read and to write and to do basicfiguringpassing on those skUls. They are not teachers; they are people who have a wealth of practical experience which can be readUy communicated to those people who do not have those skUls. I understand that the British scheme is working extremely successfully. Part of our problem with unemployment in Australia is that young people do not know how to approach employment. They do not properly know how to fill their roles once they are employed. Further, much of that lack of certainty and lack of confidence can be sheeted home to their basic lack of sktils. We must as a nation take careful note of the current requirements of industry and of the work place. They must be met by our educational institutions. Emphasis should be placed, first of all, on those basic requirements so that a person can enjoy not only his employment but also his culture and his leisuretime.ThefiUingout of a personality must start with the acquisition of skills which wtil aUow that person a ready capacity to move to the wider and bigger horizons. He must be able to extend his personality and to become far more sureffective as an Australian citizen.",73
145,Mr MARTIN,LEGISLATION COMMITTEE,"The Committee has before it the estimates for the Department of Education for thefinancialyear 1978-79. is expected that $492,632,000 will be spent this very year on education generally. That figure repto resents the Commonwealth's share of the cost of to education. When we add to that cost the amount able expended on education by the States, we find the education vote for the whole of Australia and represents a tremendously large part of the one a money expended by both the Commonwealth and the State governments. I often wonder whether or not the funds we appropriate to eduare spent wisely. In this modern day there beseems to be a tendency for various bodies and orto get in for their share of the cake. I is often wonder whether in these times education more than its fair share of the cake. I realise that in saying this I am treading somewhat on the corns of educationists because education has become a holy cow and anybody who speaks against it is looked upon as almost a pariah in the community. I think we have to be realistic in regard to the amount of money we provide for education. We have to look at areas of expenditure other than education. Also we have to have a decent, hard look at whether the funds being allocated to education are being spent wisely. Not everybody has the capacity to attend a college of advanced education or a tertiary institution. But if a person has the academic ability to be able at least to try to further his education by attending a college of advanced education, a technical college or a tertiary institution, he should have the opportunity to do so. As against that, one often wonders whether the funds that are allocated for education are being spent too much on teachers and not enough on children. I know that it is not really popular nowadays even to talk along those Unes but I often wonder whether teachers themselves reahse that after all education is provided for chUdren and not of necessity only for teachers. Whether chUdren are getting their fair share of the funds that are aUocated for education is a matter for discussion, I think, and it is a matter to which we as members of parliament should give a great deal of thought. Education is for chUdren. I think that if we have a decent look at the amount of money which is made avaUable for education, we should also have a decent look as to how that money is aUocated. I have felt for many years that in the area of education far too much money is spent on what is called 'pure' education and an insufficient amount is spent on technical education. I know that it is very difficult to arrive at a mean. At what stage does one cut off from general education and at what stage does one try to train people for a job in hfe? I tltink we have gone to extremes. In the United States of America there is an overemphasis on tertiary education and there are doctors of philosophy by the thousands who cannot get a position because they are overeducated. There is also a tendency for people in my age group- I left school at 14 and educated myself later in my own time-wh o were reared during the Depression years when the opportunity for a complete education was not avaUable, to go overboard where their chUdren are concerned. It has become a matter somewhat of snob value, not so much to children as to parents, to be able to say that 'my Uttle Johnnie' or 'my little Mary' is going to university even though little Johnnie or httle Mary will probably never finish university because they were pushed there by their mothers or fathers. I think that is a tremendous waste of monetary resources. Educationists will say-the y have said to me-that , even though a person faUs, he has been educated. I cannot see that point. I feel that financial resources in any system are limited and we have to make the most of what we have. Having said something on education generally, I feel that we have to look very closelyparticularly the unions and the employers together-at the field of technical education. We have an apprenticeship system which has become somewhat of a holy cow. Employers are finding it extremely difficult financially to employ apprentices. The ordinary employer in private industry is finding it sofinanciallydifficult that, despite inducements offered by various governments, he is not taking his fair share of the number of apprenticeships that should be made avaUable to the community. Consequently, the responsibUity for the education of apprentices is left largely to government enterprises. I think it is abouttimethat unions, employers and employer organisations got down and had a very hard look at whether technical training or a method for people to go into the work force is best served by our system of apprenticeships. I have my doubts as to whether the apprenticeship system is the be all and end all as the best method of traimng people to come into the work force. To my mind, it would be a far better system to have the prospective students who want to go into the technical field streamed off at a much earlier age than at present. At present it is normal for a young man or young lady who wants to go into the technical field, preferably through an apprenticeship, to do the school certificate at 16 years of age. In most cases their subjects do not cover any of the particular lines of education which wouldfitthem for their later life in the apprenticeship or trade in which they wtil seek to be employed. I think it is about time that we had a good, cold, hard look at our education system, particularly with the idea of streaming off boys and girls at a much earlier age and putting them through courses which would fit them for the employment for which they have some bent. In the last couple of months I have come back from a tour to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I saw many good things and many things with which I was not particularly impressed. One thing with which I was impressed was the education system. If the Soviet education system has a fault, I think it is that there is a tendency for the children at present to be over-educated. Whilst I criticise our system in Australia for overeducation, I think I have seen a greater measure ofit in the Soviet Union. In the education system there at present every child must be educated through the full high school system and must do all the academic subjects up to the equivalent of year 12. It is only at 18 years of age that they find their way into the work force or further levels of tertiary or trade education. I think the Soviet Union system is probably showing the benefit of that over-emphasis on education because at present it appears to be the leader in the scientific field. Austraha is a much smaller nation and I think we have to husband our resources much more than we have done in the past. We must use the money that is available to its best value. I am not certain that our funds are being used in that way now.",74
146,The CHAIRMAN,LEGISLATION COMMITTEE,Order ! The honourable member'stimehas expired.,76
147,Mr THOMSON,LEGISLATION COMMITTEE," I enjoyed listening to the thoughful and very sensible speech of the honourable member for Banks (Mr Martin), particularly his comments on technical education. I hope that the Government will take note of them. I think a number of speakers have said that the education field was one field in which, in this period of belt tightening, we perhaps could havetightenedthe belt just a Uttle more. I do not believe we could have tightened it in the primary and secondary sectors, but there is certainly an opportunity for a very hard look at the tertiary sector. I will deal with that matter later in my speech. I want to speak about the two extremes of education, those chUdren. who are disadvantaged for one reason or another and the advantaged students who are at tertiary institutions. First, I would like to with the problems of education faced by chUdren in the isolated areas. I note that the appropriation for isolated children is $ 14.6m. There are about 20,000 chUdren who will be assisted by this scheme. That amount is an increase of about $250,000 over last year. I would have liked to have seen more money spent on this area but I will come to that matter later. The Federal Government provides a basic boarding allowance of $500 a year, not meansceive tested, to parents with chUdren in primary or ondary schools without reasonable access to government school. Additional means-tested lowances are available and there are further lowances for chUdren in cases of particular ship. The State governments also provide ever, assistance although, unfortunately, the caused Queensland Government does not provide asoriginal sistance for primary school students. I know that many honourable members will find that to be a great problem. The chUdren in isolated areas have very special problems. One way of helping with those problems is the School of the Air which operates throughout most of the isolated areas. In my electorate 190 primary school chUdren, aged from 6 to 12years, are enrolled in the School of the Air which operates from Cairns. It also provides a service to chUdren on fishing boats and in light houses. One teacher of the school spends up to 10 days at atimevisiting the pupUs, who otherwise would have very Uttle contact with their teacher. Another form of education is by correspondence. In Queensland last year almost 1,600 primary school students and 5,000 secondary level students were studying by correspondence. Isolated students face special problems. The Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty mentions some of these. A great many of these children are denied qualified and experienced teachers. Their formal education takes place without aids and materials that are common to larger schools. SpeciaUsts, such as remedial teachers, are not avaUable. There is also deprivation in the social context in that they have no opportunity to mix with peer groups in sport and general cultural activities. At page 47 of the report of the Commissioner the following appears: . . . It is clear at the present time there is a population shift from the rural areas of the country, and that Australia as a whole is becoming increasingly urbanised. There is a very real possibUity that the educational experiences available to children in remote areas fit them less and less for a role in an urban society. This is something that we must examine to see what can be done. The obvious way to do that is to make sure that it is easier for these children to deal go to boarding schools, or schools in the cities. There are in the towns hostels to which they can go. Many of their parents cannot afford it, and are making great sacrifices to give their chUdren an education. I refer now to another special problem, the education of Aboriginal chUdren. More than $13m has been appropriated for the Aboriginal Secondary Grants scheme. I agree that it is very necessaiy that Aboriginal chUdren should respecial benefits as they suffer great disadsecvantages. I can speak with some authority as I a have living in my electorate more than 20,000 alAboriginal and islander chUdren and I am very almuch aware of the large gap which exists behardtween various sections of the community. HowI am afraid that certain problems are being by the making of these special grants. AbchUdren who go to secondary school have aU their fees paid; they have their fares paid, both to go to school and to come home for holidays; they receive pocket money, clothing, a book allowance and so on. This makes it very difficult for some other people who are living in isolated areas. Recently I spoke to a policeman stationed an isolated Aboriginal community who could not afford to send his children to boarding school. His children should receive the privileges that are received by the Aboriginal children in community. Great changes-ver y good the changes-hav e taken place in Aboriginal comcritic munities, especially in urban areas, where many people of Aboriginal descent are and earn good money. It is wrong that just because they are of Aboriginal descent-ofte n quite distant-the y should receive privileges that really meant for Aboriginals who are in isolated communities. I have recommended to the system Government that these special secondary school grants for Aboriginals be means-tested. I have not yet received a satisfactory answer but intend to press the Government on it. It is only fair if an Aboriginal family can afford to send its dren to boarding school it should receive more aid than the equivalent non-Aboriginal family Uving in the same area. I refer now very briefly to problems associated with tertiary education. There is no doubt that a great deal of money is spent upon it, and some of it could be better spent. For instance, there are in Australia 80 colleges of advanced education, with 15,000 students. There are 19 universities, with the same number of students. One problem is that there is a great misuse of resources, with very small colleges of advanced education dupUcating the resources of universisuffer ties. I know of several cases where universities and advanced colleges are next door to each true other and, now that many of the advanced coltowards leges are degree-granting institutions, degree courses are being duplicated. To me that seems to be a gross extravagance and misuse of reone sources that would be much better spent in other ways. All university education in Australia is now free. That situation was created by the previous Government-and for good reasons. Hitherto, university students had been required to pay about 10 per cent of their fees. The remainder had been provided by the Government. half of all students had had Commonwealth or other scholarships, which were granted according the degree of merit. This meant that chUdren from disadvantaged families found it very debate difficult to go to a university. I believe that is the Labor Government did bring in the free education scheme for universities. It does provide, as other speakers have said, equality of opportunity. But I have spoken to a number of vicechancellors about the problem and they assure me that since free university education has beat come avaUable there has been a great falling off in the motivation of students; that students think that attendance is a right; that they are going to stay on and they need not work very hard. Morethat over, standards have been lowered in many of smaller institutions. I notice that I have a in the honourable member for Bonython (Dr Blewett), but it is nevertheless a problem in good jobs that should be examined. It is time to decide whether we should spend are these vast sums of money upon giving free university education to chUdren. I would like to see a of student loans instituted for all students. Perhaps they should be given a loan of a certain percentage of their fees-perhap s the same percentage as they had to provide before. When that eventually they pass their course they could chilrepay the loan, if"" necessary over a number of no years. This would increase their motivation, make them work and make them much better citizens of Australia. I commend that suggestion to the Government. I have spoken very briefly of the two extremes: that Isolated and Aboriginal chUdren on the one hand and the very privileged university students on the other. Let us try to bring the two together so that we do have real equality of opportunity for all Australians, wherever they might live.",76
148,Dr BLEWETT,LEGISLATION COMMITTEE,"If there is one thing that parliamentarians and academics in common it is a pubUc prejudice about their overseas travel arrangements. I think it is to say that there are capital public attitudes our travel arrangements, and equally critical public attitudes towards the study leave provisions for academics. Interestingly, however, of the three education references that were made in the Budget Speech concerned the tightening up of tertiary study leave. On 11 October the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) himself added to this debate by his contribution at Question Time. He said a number of things, some of which were misleading and others which were inaccurate. In addition, I think that he faUed to face up to some of the central issues in the quesAbout tion of university study leave. In what ways were the Prime Minister's remarks misleading? Firstly, he dragged into the the issue of study leave for university adwhy ministrators. That represents a very minor part of the problem and in many ways is simply a red herring. He said: Study leave has not been restricted merely to those who need some relief from academic duties and studies during an academic year. It has been extended to administrators . . . In almost all universities there is usually a quite separate provision in relation to administrators as distinct from academic staff. Anyhow, the issue of study leave for administrators is a miniexaggerates mal problem and constitutes a very minimal amount of study leave. The report which was presented to the Prime Minister noted that five-year period 113 non-academic staff took periods of leave. That represents Uttle more than one staff member a year for each university. the whole issue of university administrators study leave is very much a miserable red herring, and its use suggest that there is a pretty poor to be covered up by the Prime Minister. Secondly, the Prime Minister bolstered his argument with rhetoric. He said: If study leave is necessaiy one year in seven for trators in universities, why would it not be necessaiy for adminstrators in other walks of life? It is true that in many other walks of life adminnational istrators now get periods of provisional leave order to catch up with overseas events in thenEurope own field. Indeed, it might be a very good idea we were able to extend these provisions. But one might ask why should parliamentarians get what is in effect a form of study leave provision every three years? I said yesterday, and I repeat it here, that overseas travel provides a very great opportories, tunity for parliamentarians to visit other societies and examine their political and social instithis tutions, and this is an invaluable experience which I would defend. But equally so, I think the opportunity for university administrators to visit other universities and examine other systems tertiary education is also an invaluable experiexamine ence, given that the university is set in an intergions, national environment. Again, it is not, as someat body suggested, for a year, because study leave provisions for administrators are for a much shorter period of time- I think the average is about five to six months. Certainly on the figures that we have been given this so-called generosity is not over-used or abused. The Prime Minister suggested some rather exrather travagant costing for study leave. He suggested cost Australia something like $40m a year. Admittedly, he includes in this figure some notional idea of additional staff to replace those overseas, but the Tertiary Education Comis mission's report, which included aU universities and all coUeges of advanced education and included all direct and indirect costs, still manages a total of just under $24m. It is true that those figures were for 1975; but I doubt whether the Prime Minister would wish to argue that his 3-year regime has been characterised by almost 100 per cent inflation. So I think thefiguregiven there is much exaggerated. It is not surprising that the Prime Minister or has a tendency to be extravagant about travel costs. Indeed, even a conservative calculation of the Prime Minister's international in a extravaganza in June would suggest that it equalled approximately the total annual study leave budget of one large Australian university. I So am deaUng now only with direct costs. I am not and deaUng with academic salaries or prime ministerial salaries; it is simply the direct cost of the case Prime Minister's extravaganza compared with the direct costs of the study leave budget of a large Australian university. Having got out of the way these peripheral issues, let us look at the whole problem in some adminisperspective. I think that we in this chamber should oppose these kinds of cuts. The reason for so doing is that scholarship is essentially an interactivity oriented for Western culture in overwhelmingly towards the universities of and the USA. Australia is inevitably geoif graphically isolated from these centres. Australian scholars are geographically cut off from the international community of scholars. For the great bulk of Australian scholars, their sources, the keyfiguresin their field, the great laboraare for them overseas. It is true that technological developments have lessened some of isolation. But none of the basic reasons for which academics go overseas, such as to do sustained personal research, to join particular research groups, to gain access to particular equipof ment, to work in specialist laboratories, to source material, to visit particular reinstitutions, museums and sites and to talk length with other scholars, can be replaced by most of these improved communication. This is not to argue that some Australian scholars attimesmight, for scholarly reasons, desire to take their study leave periods in Australia, as a number do. But it should be their option, their choice, and it should be the exception than the rule. Simply to argue, as does the it Prime Minister, that we have got good Australian universities, which no one denies, and therefore Australian academics should spend their study leave in other Australian universities to encourage parochialism and provincialism in our scholarly community which, I believe, will be ultimately paralysing to Australian scholarships and fateful to its international contribution. Furthermore, the market for scholars is an international market. True, at the moment and for the foreseeable future, it is a buyer's market. Nevertheless, given its geographical position, Austraha will neither attract nor retain the very best scholars without internationally-generous study leave provisions. Finally, the allocation of resources for study leave should be the province of autonomous universities, not national budget directions. We all recognise that universities in the years ahead are inevitably going to face financial limitations and restrictions. But within very broad guideUnes, they should be left to determine their own priorities, to place their own values on study leave as against other demands-that is, they will have to balance the requirements of study leave against other demands in a muchtighterbudgetary period-bu t they should not be regimented into a national straight-jacket, as apparently is envisaged by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Howard). I recognise that some academics abuse study leave provisions, as 1 suppose some parliamentarians abuse their overseas traveUing provisions. But the study leave inquiry looked at this issue and found very Uttle evidence of abuse; indeed, it concluded that there was 'no evidence of widespread misuse of the study leave system' and that 'the committee believes that in most cases study leave propositions have been properly uttiised in accordance with their purposes and spirit'. Indeed, there is very much evidence gathered in that and other reports that the pursuit of study leave involves financial and personal cost for most academics. Let me conclude by saying that whUst there is obviously reason to improve reporting and accountability procedures-the universities have to do a much better job with reporting and accountabUity procedures in regard to study leave-the proposals espoused in the TEC report and apparently received sympathetically by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer wtil produce only minimalfinancialbenefits. It is estimated today to be $1.5m a year in savings. In return, it wtil further weaken university autonomy; it wtil increase the educational bureaucracy at the tertiary level; it will disadvantage young scholars as against established scholars; and, above all, it wtil lead to a deterioration in the fabric of Australian intellectual life.",77
149,Mr BARRY JONES,LEGISLATION COMMITTEE,"Lalor) (5.41)Australia is a hierarchal society rather than an egalitarian society. Many of us grew up committed to the idea that universal education would be a major force in promoting social equality. I think we know better now. In many ways education reinforces already existing disadvantages in society. This is certainly true if one examines the quality of schools in our major cities, and there is no city in Australia where this is more obvious than Melbourne. Schools are not particularly effective instruments for instruction either. On this subject. I must say that I am largely a convert to the views of Dr Ivan Illicit, whose book De-Schooling Society will be known to some honourable members. He made the point that the great bulk of what we leam is actually picked up outside school and outside the formal learning, and that all of us learn very much more between the time of our birth and the age offivethan we do in subsequent periods at school. In fact, the rate at which we learn seems to fall dramatically relative to thosefirstfiveyears. For example, to Ulustrate the point Ilhch is making, we all talk fairly fluently yet talk is something we have picked up outside the school situation. Compare our fluency in talking with our fluency in writing, which generally we learn at school and which generally we do very badly. Walking, physical co-ordination, sport, swimming, driving, cooking, using tools, social relationships, including sex and marriage, and basic phUosophy, by which I mean a general secular or religious commitment and elementary reasoning, are learned outside the school education system, but they are the tilings that tend to be the major components of our lives. The school is an excellent sorting machine; it classifies people and sets them apart. Just as cattle and sheep are branded, so school leaves its brand or caste mark for life, and few succeed in washing or shaking it off, although an occasional University High School student may become a Liberal back bencher. If a person attends a poor school and he lives in a poverty-stricken social environment, the school system will do relatively little to overcome those disadvantages. If one is disadvantaged, school will tend to extend those disabtiities through life. Cultural poverty seems to be inherited and it is extremely difficult to shake off. It is an irony that as we approach the goals of a satisfactory class-pupil ratio in conventionally equipped classrooms, the goal that has been pursued by parties for some time, these goals may recede, turn into a mirage and prove irrelevant for the educational needs of a postindustrial society. I would like to illustrate this by pointing to relative levels of qualifications found in three federal electorates in Victoria. I must say that it is a mournful commentary on the difficulties under which the Australian Bureau of Statistics is operating that the latest figures available for many of the most important social indicators are from the 1971 census. The 1976 census figures for the two most populous States have not yet been published.

150,Mr BARRY JONES,LEGISLATION COMMITTEE,"I thank the Committee. I make the point that in my electorate the total number of people with bachelor degrees was 325 males and 76 females. The number of those who held a higher degree was 39 males and 7 females. Compare the figures, for example, of the electorate of Melbourne, which is also a safe Labor electorate, partly industrial but with a high professional content as well. The total number of people in that electorate with a bachelor degree was 2,043 men and 1,115 women. The number of those with a higher degree was 386 men and 123 women. In the prosperous eastern electorate of Kooyong, held by the Minister  and 1,551 females held a bachelor degree. The number of those with a higher degree was 681 males and 223 females. The point is that from an educational point of view the electorate of Lalor-it is characteristic of the western suburbs of Melbourne generally-is a virtual intellectual proletariat. It is taken for granted that there is a double standard in our educational system. It is a two-tiered educational system. It is taken for granted that most of the pupils who go through the schools in the eastern part of Melbourne are looking forward to what they describe as 'a career'. That is, they look forward to a great degree of job satisfaction. It is NA Language NSW Vic.

But it is often taken for granted that in the western suburbs of Melbourne- I am sure this is true of the western and south western suburbs of Sydney as wellthat there will be a low degree of personal aspiration built into the school system. It is taken for granted that the overwhelming majority of students will drop out before they complete their secondary education and that most of them are aimed not at a career but at what is described with somewhat less dignified language as simply ' a job' and they will go into the work force as factory fodder. I find that extremely disturbing. I will havetimeto refer to only one other thing that concerns me very much about our education system. That is that so Uttle is being done to teach foreign languages. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables from the report of the Committee on Teaching of Migrant Languages in Schools.

151,Mr BARRY JONES,MODERN LANGUAGES,"I thank the Committee. The tables point out that to a large extent the languages that we teach are still determined very much by the traditional English style of education that we inherited. As the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) has said so often, the reason why French is still the language most taught in Australian schools is simply that France is 21 miles away from England. But there are very few schools in Australia-the number, mercifully, is increasing-wher e languages of the Asian region are taught and very few schools where the languages of the people of our migrant community are taught. In my own electorate there is great difficulty in securing classes to teach the Maltese language. Maltese is easily the largest single language group in Lalor. Historically and linguistically it is an extremely important language-it is a Semitic language, as honourable members would know-bu t very rarely taught although there are thousands of children in Lalor's schools whose family tongue is Maltese.

The Minister for Enviroment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Groom) is responsible for this area. In recent years we have seen a decline in the funds available for sport in Australia. The total amount of funds provided for sport in 1971-72 was $0.5m. In 1972-73 $0.7m was provided. When the Labor Government came to power, for the first time sport was treated as it ought to have been treated and funds started to increase. They went from $3.1m in 1973-74 to $ 11.4m in 1975-76. From then on there has been a gradual decline. We have seen the balance of our program as it was wound down to $9.7m in 1976-77, then to $6.6m. This year the appropriation is $7.4m, but that is a little deceptive because included in that figure is $2.5m for a grant to Queensland, for preparation for the Commonwealth Games to be held in 1982, and some other funds for lifesaving and the 'Life. Be in it' program. The actual funding for the national sporting bodies and the national sports program is very, very small. Mr Groom-What did you give?",82
154,Mr COHEN,TAUGHT IN RESPONDING SECONDARY SCHOOLS,"We gave a considerable amount more than you did in real terms. In real terms we gave a great deal. In 1975-76 the total expenditure was $11.4m. I am not a great mathematician but I can take $7.4m from $ 11.4m. The Government is $4m behind, so what is the Minister talking about? Mr Groom- I am sorry, you misunderstand the point. That was bricks and mortar.",83
155,Mr COHEN,TAUGHT IN RESPONDING SECONDARY SCHOOLS,"That is right and in the national sports program the Government's amount in real terms is less than what we were giving, and in the bricks and mortar area the funds are non-existent. The Government does not provide any funds at all for sporting facilities. I point out that the previous Minister responsible in this area, the present Minister for National Development (Mr Newman), said when these funds were made available that it was merely a starting point. He was quoted publicly and privately. In fact the Budget in that year, 1977, was not passed until October or November and the funds were expected to be expended between 1 January and 30 June of 1978. It was expected that the funds were purely a basefigureto get this sport started again. The Government did not give one cent to the sports program in 1976-77. We can go on quibbling about thefigures.I do not think that anybody in this House would argue with the fact that the present Government has wound down assistance to sport. We are making a mistake to think that these funds are being provided simply for recreation. Plenty evidence from overseas-fro m West Germany, available East Germany and a whole range of countriesisations suggests that as countries increase funding to sport and provide widespread sports programs for community participation the standard of community health improves. I think we are making a bad mistake by continuing to look at sport as if it were some form of pleasurable recreation. Sport is a form of preventative medicine. I hate to sound corny or to use a cliche, but afitnation is a healthy nation. I think the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) should debate these estimates. The allocations for sport should come from the health program. There is a mountain of evidence to show how out of condition Australians are. Loads of surveys of school children and adults have been carried out. We all know that this is a fact, and yet we continue to pour $7 billion into health and-to use the biggerfigure-$7.4m into sport. Emphasis on sport is one really effective way in which we can contribute to a fit and healthy nation. I think a lot of importance has been placed on Australia's deteriorating performance in international events. I would be the last to come into the House and say that we should spend millions of dollars to win gold medals. Gold medals are merely by-products of the widespread sports programs that exist in East Germany, West Germany, Canada and the United States. On a recent visit to Western Australia. I was told by the director of the community sports program, Mr Graham, that, from information gathered in a survey, only 15 per cent of Western Australians participate regularly in any sport. We are light years behind the European communist countries, the United States and Canada in the provision of community facilities. Athletes come back from these countries and are absolutely appalled at the Australian conditions when compared to the athletic facilities in other countries. I wrote the Labor Party's policy in 1972 for sport. It was incorporated in the Blacktown address by Mr Whitlam. Basically we have to get back to the principles we enunciated then and which were implemented by the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Stewart) as the Minister administering sporting activities. We have to generate activity in Australia at four levels. The first is at the national level. We need a national sports institute to train coaches, to provide training camps and to ensure that quality sportsmen are available in all our institutions, schools and universities and in our community so that people are learning how to prepare themof selves in sport. We need to increase the funds to the various national sporting organso that they can provide coaching programs and international visits by teams from Australia and by overseas teams. We can lift our standards through competition from visitors. The Minister said that nothing had been done in the capital expenditure area. Thefiguresthat I mentioned before about capital expenditure are very deceptive. If we cared to use thefiguresfor funds that were provided by the Labor Government under the Regional Employment Development scheme funds for sporting facilities would skyrocket beyond thefiguresmentioned in these estimates. In my electorate of Robertson alone we spent $3.25m on sporting facilities. We have magnificent youth centres and tennis courts. Mr Groom-And a good member too.",83
156,Mr COHEN,TAUGHT IN RESPONDING SECONDARY SCHOOLS,"A good member; the Minister is right. If we took these factors into consideration the allocation on sporting facilities would increase from between $10m to $ 12m to $40m or $50m. I do not want to see the matter administered in the ad hoc way it was before. We must again join with the States and local government and start to provide capital funds for a widespread range of sporting amenities such as athletic and cycling tracks that will enable people to participate in sport in a way they cannot at present. Woy Woy and Gosford now have magnificent youth centres which were built by the Central Coast Leagues Club. We are in the process of opening another at The Entrance. I think in this sense my electorate has better amenities than most. Hundreds of places in Australia do not have anything like these sorts of facilities. Probably up to 35-year-old sports such as judo, gymnastics, wrestling and squash- I cannot remember them all-ar e played in these youth centres. Thousands of young people participate each week. When such activities are Australia wide we will have afitnation. The by-product of having a nation of young people active in sport will be that Australia will win medals once again. I would hate to think that that is our objective. However, it will come about as a result of having a veryfitand healthy nation.",84
157,Unknown,TAUGHT IN RESPONDING SECONDARY SCHOOLS,Sitting suspended from 6.1 to 8 p.m.,84
158,Mr DRUMMOND,TAUGHT IN RESPONDING SECONDARY SCHOOLS,"I wish to devote my time to a matter of public expenditure that is minor but which relates directly to a question of great national importance. I refer to the appropriation for the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development and the allocation of $350,000 to unspecified conservation organisations. One of the bodies that benefit from the taxpayers purse is the Australian Conservation Foundation. When the nature of the Australian Conservation Foundation is considered, other honourable members also may seriously question the propriety of giving that organisation one cent of the taxpayers' money. The statements and actions of the ACF over the past few years brand it as being a partisan and political organisation. It can have no claim to being an objective and impartial critic of environmental policy. It is committed to an antigrowth philosophy and implicit support of a radical restructuring of society to an extent that would alarm even some honourable members opposite. I do not say for one minute that such people as the ACF Director, Dr Mosely, have no right to express their points of view; but I do say that they should not do so at the expense of the taxpayers who supplied some 45 per cent of the funding for the ACF in 1977. Direct funding is only one way in which my electors and the taxpayers generally are supporting the ACF. This organisation also benefits from the fact that donations to it are tax deductible. That is a considerablefinancialadvantage that confers the imprimatur of total respectability. It is a concession that is not available to a great many charitable and benevolent organisations. Particularly disturbing are suggestions that other conservation organisations that are not in receipt of government grants are also sharing the privilege of tax deductible donations. Friends of the Earth, an extremist conservation organisation that was denied government funding in 1977, has solicited donations, claiming that they will be tax deductible if sent by way of the ACF. Project Jonah also has been reported as attempting to creep under this convenient umbrella. That does not please the constituents in my electorate, especially those who reside in the Albany region. I appreciate the fact that the Government has denied that tax deductibility is extended to these and other organisations, but I would ask the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to ensure that no donations are being collected through the agents of the ACF and then passed on to other bodies whose aims make no pretence of objectivity. Moreover, I earnestly request the Treasurer to withdraw the undeserved privilege of tax deductibility for donations to the ACF. Anyone who doubts the nature of the ACF need only examine its publications. In the ACF June newsletter, ACF councillor, Mr K. Vallance, openly proclaimed the political nature of conservation. A page is devoted to a satire of Lang Hancock. Whilst Mr Hancock may be fair game for criticism at times, there is no need for him to be ridiculed at the expense of the taxpayer. The August newsletter featured a call by Dr Mosely for support for the anti-bauxite lobbyist in Western Austraha, quoting some spurious and questionable arguments as gospel. Needless to say, the ACF-and Dr Mosely in particular-ha s taken a hard line position against whaUng. One would expect a responsible conservation body to back up its assertions with hard scientific evidence. But the June issue of Habitat, the ACF glossy magazine, boasts and antiwhaling article written not by a marine scientist or naturaUst but by a trendy professor of phUosophy from Monash University. An article in the August issue is more factual but it is the work of two individuals, Peter Brotherton and Joy Lee, whose activities as propagandists cast a doubt on their scientific objectivity. If a supposedly responsible conservation organisation funded by the pubUc is going to intervene in such politicaUy sensitive issues as whaUng or bauxite mining, then the public will have a right to expect it to present a carefuUy researched and factual viewpoint. AU we are getting is emotional propaganda which is preservationist rather than truly conservationist. I come now to the basic objection to public funding of the ACF. In every major controversy in which it has engaged-the Newport power station, Fraser Island sand mining, wood chipping and bauxite mining-it has sought to stop development of industries that create large scale employment or to shut down major export earners. Is the ACF so shortsightedly concerned for the sUghtest environmental damage that it totally ignores these questions? Alternatively, as I tend to believe, is the shutting down and strangulation of industrial growth the real objective of the radical conservationists who now control the ACF? I must confess to a deep interest in this question. Expansion of the bauxite industry, at a conservative estimate, wtil create something like 3,000 new jobs in the Forrest electorate. The sober assessments of the Western Australian Forestry Department do not indicate that mining wtil increase water salinity in the western slopes of the DarUng Range where mining will be concentrated. A very full program of reafforestation by the mining companies is already enhancing both water catchment and the recreational value of the forest. Yet the ACF chooses to intervene on the side of the extremists whose arguments in relation to water salinity have been proved wrong time and time again. Dr Mosely calls upon the Federal Government to overrule the State Government and deny export Ucences for alumina. Truly, the ACF has embarked on a massive campaign of industrial sabotage-and the taxpayer is footing the btil. I must unreservedly endorse the statement of Sir Charles Court on 6 August when he declared that radical conservationism ignores the need for a balance between the needs of development and the environment. Job lobbies will have to be formed to meet the chaUenge of environmental lobbies. Sir Charles has put the matter into perspective. The voters who have returned this Government twice expect it to act to conserve jobs ahead of conserving sand mines, disease ridden forests and whales. People do want responsible environmental management which is not incompatible with responsible development, of which wood chipping and bauxite mining are prime examples. Let me quote one of the finest environmental scientists in Australia, Professor Des O'Connor. He defines conservation as: 'The planned management and wise use of nature's resources-as a whole as well as separately'. He is well aware of the disastrous effects that environmental extremists can have on the economy and on the average man's standard of Uving. What do the extremists say when taxed on the question of jobs? They prattle on about labourintensive industries. That is economic idiocy unless-and this is the significant point-on e believes in Marxist solutions to economic difficulties. It is our labour-intensive industries that are in the most trouble today, yet the Marxist leadership of the extreme left Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Unions promotes it as an economic solution.",84
159,The CHAIRMAN,TAUGHT IN RESPONDING SECONDARY SCHOOLS,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,85
160,Mr UREN,TAUGHT IN RESPONDING SECONDARY SCHOOLS,"The estimates being debated are for the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development. Under the last two Fraser Ministries- I am talking now of the Ministry from 1975 to 1977 and the Ministry since that time-n o department has taken more drastic cuts or been butchered more than this Department. The former Department of Environment and Conservation, the former Department of Urban and Regional Development, and in some respects the former Department of Tourism and Recreation were joined together to form this Department. The sad situation is that it has a very low priority from this Government, and I am not casting any reflection on the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Groom) when I say that he is one of the junior Ministers in a Ministry of 27. The Department has no muscle. It has no authority at all on economic matters. The former Department of Urban and Regional Development was a major policy department and had an enormous say in economic matters and resource allocation. One has to understand the philosophy of Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to underand stand why this Department has taken such a servation drastic beating. If one looks at the actual funding between 1975-76 and 1978-79, one expenditure on growth centres has been cut by 73 per cent, on urban rehabilitation by 76 per theThat cent, and on flood mitigation by 68 per cent. The area improvement programs have been There eliminated completely and the expenditure on land commissions has been cut by nearly 80 per cent, on other urban development by nearly 80 sector per cent, on the development of Aboriginal community amenities by 91 per cent, on protection the environment by nearly 40 per cent, and on sewerage and garbage assistance by 81 per cent. Those are the percentagefigures.If one looks at seek the totalfiguresfor urban and regional developHansard. ment and the environment one finds that the expenditure in money terms in 1975-76 was BUDGET- CHANGES Growth centres Urban rehabilitation Urbanfloodmitigation Area improvement program Land Commission Other urban development Development of Aboriginal community amenities . Protection of the environmentt Sewerage and garbageassistance to the States General administrative expenditures Total urban and regional development and environment $408m. This year the expenditure will be $108m. Thosefiguresdo not relate to real money terms because with inflationary pressures that $108m would be worth about half that amount today. If one considers this matter as a percentage of Budget outlays, in 1975-76 allocations to the Dethe partment of Urban and Regional Development the Department of Environment and Conrepresented 7.4 per cent of Budget outlays. On the estimates this year, that figure will sees that come down to 4 per cent. is the sorry record of this Government in field of urban and regional development. has been a cut in public works programs. There has been a cut in housing. There has been a cut in employment. It is a part of this Government's economic policy to squeeze the public and to create a pool of unemployment to of try to bring down inflation.

161,Mr UREN,OUTLAYS,"If we are to provide a stimulus to the economy, if we are to get things moving again, it is important that we have selective government expenditure. It is important that we spend money on urban programs. It is important that we try to catch up with the sewerage backlog because that represents labour-intensive work. If we spend money in these industries there is a multiplying effect which stimulates employment within the economy. The Opposition states quite clearly that both men and materials are available and this Government should take the initiative to provide selective stimulus to the economy in order to get things under way. As I have said, when the Government starts to spend money in these sectors there is a flow-on effect. On the question of housing, if one looks at what governments have spent on public housing one finds that in 1974-75 the Labor Government allocated 2.1 per cent of the Budget expenditure to public housing. What is the situation this year? It is estimated that the Government will spend about 1.1 per cent this year. Last year the Government made available $390m for public housing and this year that amount has been cut to $316m. If one looks at other allocations for housing one finds that defence service homes expenditure is down by $ 10.7m over last year and housing expenditure in the Territories is down by $5.3m. As to the homes savings grants scheme, which was the Government's answer for young people who wanted to get homes, last year $35m was made available and this year the allocation has been cut back to $20m. A Cabinet submission was made last year, prior to the discussion of the Budget, that an amount of $76m would be needed if the Government was to meet all the applications under the home savings grants scheme. Instead it made only $20m available, which means that the majority of people who are waiting for the loan and have been told that they will get it on 1 July next year will find then that NA NA (Percentage changes expressed in 1978-79 prices) Change 1978-79 Change 1978-79 Change 1978-79 over 1977-78 over 1976-77 over 1975-76 -29.5 -56.9 -73.5 . . -55.8 -65.5 -38.5 + .04 +10.8 +8.0 -28.3 -33.8 -35.4 Total -14.9 -19.6 -28.1 the money is not available because there are too many applicants. This Government stands condemned more because of the drastic cuts it has made to these programs than because of anything else. If we look at the question of local government, which also is covered by this Department, we find that in the last year of the Labor Government the money made available to local government as a percentage of the previous year's income tax returns was 2.89 per cent, but this year the Government has made available only 1.52 per cent of tax revenue. It promised that it would build up that figure to 2 per cent. Again, this is an area that needs money because it will be spent in labour-intensive industries and will provide an immediate stimulus to the unemployment sector of our community. As far as the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development is concerned, if the Government involved itself right across the board in the problems of local government and in the problems of the States, particularly in the pubhc works sector, it would have an enormous influence. I believe that we will overcome the problems of both our capital cities and our provincial cities only if there is a real spirit of co-operation between the three levels of government, working together with people's organisations and with the private sector. That is the only way in which we are going to solve our urban problems and we have to do it by working in a co-operative fashion. The sad situation is that this Government has withdrawn completely from urban and regional development matters and has left it to the States and local government to solve the problems. The Government itself has not become involved. The States have been given the responsibility but they have not been given the money. This is indicated by the figures to which I have referred. The sad situation is that the major cutbacks by this Government have had an enormous influence on the growth of unemployment in this country. I believe that the Government stands condemned for the Estimates for this Department.",88
162,The CHAIRMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,89
163,Mr BOURCHIER,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"I will restrict my remarks to housing. It is not often that I can agree with the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), but I accept some of the remarks he has just made. He said that the housing industry is one of the most important industries in this country. It creates employment. It helps to boost the economy. If we have a viable building industry we have a viable economy. That has always been my personal view. I have yet to find any reason to change that attitude. I assure the honourable member for Reid that the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Groom), who is at the table, also has that attitude. It is just a matter of how money is spent. This Government is taking proper restrictive and necessary economic measures in view of the state of the economy which it inherited from the former Labor Government, which unfortunately threw money around in any direction. The Budget announced the decision to reduce the prescribed assets ratio of the savings banks by 5 per cent. This should enable those banks to lend more money for housing this year. We congratulate the Minister for that. I express a little concern- I have no doubt that he has the same concern-that when a similar measure was taken by the former Treasurer, the banks, unfortunately, held a greater amount of money in assets than was required. I wonder whether the money will go to where it is supposed to go, that is, the housing industry. I ask the Minister to make every effort to ensure that the banks funnel this money into the housing area. It is well known that banks are not noted for providing housing funds unless the person wishing to borrow has a certain amount of"" equity or a long trading association with the bank. I am not being unkind. Banks have a marvellous record of providing money for housing to people on a certain level of income. But there is a very large demand for housing from people with an income of $250 a week and less.",89
164,Mr UREN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"Hear , hear!",89
165,Mr BOURCHIER,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,The honourable member agrees. I well remember that when the Labor Party was in government it did not want to provide any money through homes savings grants. It wanted all funds to go to rental homes.,89
166,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,That is not right.,89
167,Mr BOURCHIER,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"It is reasonably right. The honourable member who interjected was the Minister for Housing who wanted to make houses available for $6,000. Through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, the Minister has provided the means for assisting more people to own a home for giving rental assistance. This is important. I now turn to a problem which I believe is not being attacked properly. I have been informed that 15,000 young couples or families wish to purchase homes through co-operative and terminating building societies. These government guaranteed societies operating under State legislation are restricted in the amounts of money they have to lend at the moment. I have put forward a proposal to the Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) that the Commonwealth Government show the way by taking out a national loan of $500m. Recently a $700m national loan was raised in a matter of days. The people of Australia are prepared to invest their money in the future of this countiy. What better way to invest their money than in housing for the young people of this country. Various opponents to such a scheme argue that there has been a drop in building permits and that the demand for housing has dropped simply because many people are buying old homes and doing them up. I have yet to see a person who sells a home and does not require another one in which to live. It is normal in our society that when a young person is starting off he has to buy within his means. This is logical and it is right. People earning $250 a week and less are restricted in the amount of money they can pay for a home. They cannot pay $60,000. At present they are limited to a loan of $25,000 if they can get the maximum amount, which they can borrow for up to 25 years or 30 years at a very low rate of interest of about 7 per cent. This is provided for in the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. It is good. But this provision caters for only a small group of people. There is a tremendous line up of people wanting to take out loans at every cooperative and terminating building society in this country. I ask the Minister to give this matter careful consideration and to discuss it with the Treasurer. I will take it up with them. I am sure that all State governments, of whatever political persuasion, and the Opposition would join us in saying: 'Let us get young people into houses. We do not want them living inflats.Let us get this country where it should be so that people who want homes have the opportunity of getting them, particularly those on low incomes.' The Housing Agreement will cater for those people earning $160 a week and under with loans at a low interest rate. Those people earning $160 a week to $250 a week can afford the repayments on loans of about $30,000 at an interest rate of 9n per cent. I have some figures which I have shown to the honourable member for Reid. They indicate that the repayment term can range from 30 to 45 years on loans varying from $25,000 to $35,000.1 seek leave to have this table incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsINTEREST 9 PER CENT-QUARTERL Y RESTS Loan Term repayments $25,000 30 years $219 $30,000 35 years $235 $30,000 40 years $232 $30,000 45 years $229 $35,000 35 years $275 $35,000 40 years $270 $35,000 45 years $267",89
168,Mr BOURCHIER,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"If money is raised by the join Government for housing, it does not have to be pushed out immediately. It could make a proachieve gressive loan of $150m this year, another early next year and so on. In a short space of time the building industry would be moving again. tain Young people on low income levels would be consideration able to buy homes. They, in turn, would create higher demand for homes for those on the higher income level who wished to move into a better home. They could sell and move into another home. It would be a cycle. If the Government is prepared to take out this loan, the money should be provided only to State government organisnatural ations, the terminating or co-operative societies. It should not be available to housing commissions for rental homes. Rental has already been provided for under the existing agreement. I am talking about providing money expressly for the purpose of assisting young people to purchase a home and to give them the opportunity of home ownership, in which the Liberal and National Country parties have always believed. Home ownership will I take provide",90
169,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,Why didn't you come along with us?,90
170,Mr BOURCHIER,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"When the honourable introduced member was Minister for Housing he was totally opposed to home ownership. We believe in home ownership. The Government has had to face up to a difficult economic problem. It brought down a Budget designed to carry the economy within the limits of the money available. But Australian money is available. It will not affect inflation or interest rates. It can be borrowed at the normal rate of 9 per cent, without upsetting any lending institution. This money could provide the impetus for housing for the young people of this country on low levels of income. The banks, through arrangements made by the Treasurer and the Minister, have the opportunity also of lending money to those people who can afford higher repayments. We have the opportunity to make sure that the building industry gets the impetus it deserves. I can assure honourable members if we can get the building industry on its feet every other sector of the country will respond. People who buy houses Monthly Weekly furnish them. They do not Uve in bare houses. repayments They buy furniture. They set up a home. Food is $55 bought. They buy lawnmowers. They buy boats, $54 as the Opposition Whip does. They buy tele$53 vision sets. They buy radios. This is life. $52 $63 The point is that if we can get the housing in$62 dustry going in this country, I am certain in my $61 mind- I know that a number of my colleagues with me in this belief-that we can make the economy tick the way we want it to tick. We can that result without forcing an increase in the rate of inflation. I will take this matter as far as I can to ensure that this loan is raised. I am certhat the Cabinet will give very favourable to this very important matter. I bea lieve that the result will be an expansion of the building industry, which in turn will be of great benefit to the young people of this country, to the economy of this country and to the future of this country. The housing industry is one of our greatest employers. It is one of the greatest users of the resources of the country and it is one of building the major industries of the country.",90
171,The CHAIRMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,Order ! The honourable assistance member's time has expired.,90
172,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR," I gather from what the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) said that he is in disagreement with the policy of the Government and that he wants more money spent on housing. it he is implying that more funds ought to be made available to the terminating building societies, for example. Of course, that is an area in which an effective curtailment of funds has occurred. It was the Labor Government which special provisions which enabled people earning up to 90 per cent of average weekly earnings to qualify for assistance from the Government at 5Vt per cent interest rate. I has cannot have my train of thought derailed too much by the tirade of the honourable member for Bendigo who preceded me in the discussion, because what he said was very hard to comprehend. It was obvious that he just wanted the best of both worlds. The new Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Groom) is sitting at the table. We are all looking to him with great expectations, hoping that there might be a new turn of events under his adrninistration. We hope that he is more than a pretty face, but we have not seen much evidence of that up to now. The Government continues to direct resources into the corporate sector. For example, the investment allowance, in relation to which more than $850m has been appropriated, is obviously designed to replace men with machines. There does not seem to be an effective realisation on the part of the Government that investment in the building and construction area, which is labour intensive, will bring very great benefits to this country. A cut of approximately 9 per cent in real terms has occurred in total Commonwealth controlled funds which flow to the building and construcuon industry. This will mean a loss of about 28,000 jobs, some 14,000 of them as a direct-result of this decision, and that many more again will occur in the material supply area, the servicing area and other associated industries. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) mentioned some figures. I would like to document my case with some figures. In Budget terms, net advances to the States for housing have been reduced by 26.S per cent. Expenditure on defence service housing has been reduced by 26.6 per cent. Expenditure on housing in the Territories has been cut by 95.7 per cent. Overall the curtailment in housing expenditure is 33 per cent. Much more slashing of the funds has occurred in connection with urban affairs generally. For example, funds made available under the heading 'Sewerage and Garbage assistance to the States' have been slashed by 60.6 per cent. Funds have been reduced for land commissions, urban rehabilitation, urban flood mitigation. So it goes on. These are matters which generally fall into the area of housing and construction and associated areas. Let us look at the official figures in regard to housing approvals. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics a reduction in the number of new dwellings approved has occurred as follows: In Austraha in August 1978 there were 10,390 approvals; in August 1977 the number was 11,360. So that in itself shows a drop in approvals of 9.6 per cent. That is to say, 970 fewer approvals were made this August than was the case in August of last year. Then let us look at the commencement figures for the most recent quarter, which happens to be the June quarter 1978. The number of commencements on dwellings over Austraha in that quarter was 32,140, which compares unfavourably with the June quarter 1977figureof 33,330. The same pattern emerges whicheverfiguresone looks at. Let us now look at the matter of loans from savings and trading banks to individuals for financing construction and purchase of newly constructed dwellings. The number of new dwellings commenced on which savings and trading bank loans were given was as follows: In August 1977 the total was 4,387 and in August 1978 the total was 4,065. So we have another reduction in that area. Thus 322 fewer new dwellings werefinancedby savings and trading bank loans in August of this year than was the case a year ago. The cost offinancingnew dwellings also rose between August last year and August this year. The increase in roundfigureswas from $81m to $85m. So it has cost more to finance fewer new buildings because, whilst $4m more this year than last year was borrowed from savings and trading banks by new home buyers, 322 fewer new houses were funded. I turn now to thefiguresin regard to finance made available from savings and trading banks for new and old dwellings. We find that over Austraha $238m was allocated in August 1977 and $274m for August 1978. That represents a 15 per cent increase in net terms, but it does not really imply anything of great significance because that allocation is in regard to new and old dwellings. So we see so much of that sort of substance being burnt up in the turnover of old houses. The Government just seems to be unable to see the wood for the trees in this regard. It places a lot of reliance on the decision to reduce the prescribed assets ratio held by the savings banks. I think this is the thimble and pea trick because the assets ratio has been around the 50 per cent level for some time in any case. It will not shift downwards because of the rigidity of the asset structure of the banks and because of the prospects of the banks obtaining capital gains from their bonds. I was quite interested to see a comment on this matter in the publication Inside Canberra. In referring to this matter, that publication stated, referring to the building industry: All it got was a reduction from 43 per cent to 40 per cem in the ratio of public securities and liquid assets which savings banks are required to hold. Mr Howard claimed this would expand savings banks' capacity to lend for housing. In fact this will not happen for at least six months for a variety of reasons, including the reluctance of the banks to get rid of paper at a time when interest rates are easing downward and borrowings from local government authorities are to increase by 12 per cent this year. Yet that is the factor upon which the Governgiven ment has placed such great reliance. The figures-time will not permit me to go through them all-sho w that rents have gone up, that ployment in the home building industry has fallen dramatically. We can see that for all Austraha, excluding the Northern Territory, 7,900 jobs were lost in the industry last year. Now I come to the pohcies of the Fraser Governat ment designed to alleviate this situation. Already the Fraser Government has abolished the trahan Housing Corporation which was designed to be versatile and to have the capacity to move in and to assist people who were faced with print mortgage barriers in obtaining housing We have virtually abdicated from the housing field because we have taken away the instrumenThe' tality that would have enabled the Commontion wealth to be effective in this area. Now funds for achieved the home savings grants scheme have been curthe parents, tailed. The Government has cut into the funds social that were to be made available for defence service homes. Of course the much vaunted Housing trusted Allowance Voucher Experiment scheme has now deserve been abandoned. Thistimelast year it was one of knowledge the future housing initiatives of the Liberal ordinary, Country Party alliance which has have no teeth and no usefulness. Having spent money on the bureaucracy and all the overhead factors associated with it, and not having any benefit to the people who are seeking homes, the Government has suddenly decided to jettison this initiative as well.",90

174,Mr MCVEIGH,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"In could my remarks tonight I would like to offer my supto port for the movement to estabhsh in our country a 'charter for sport'. In addressing myself to ision 296, subdivision 3, item 03 of the estimates for the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development, it is appropriate to build on the remarks of the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) who distraUan cussed in his speech sport and the aims and as them pirations of sport. It is appropriate to estabhsh what is desirable in the general Austrahan sportsport ing context. I think it is absolutely essential we adopt a pyramid type approach wherein we give opportunity to those people who aspire to international fame and recognition and also make available facilities for those people merely want to engage in sport for the fulfilment of their own personalities and for the adequate enjoyment of leisure. A pyramid type approach would be beneficial to all sectors because, on account of the example by champions, in future more people would be at the apex and fewer people would be at the base. Nothing inspires enthusiasm more emthan people having as an idol the world champion in their own sport. We must adopt an apof proach which will encourage our top class athletes and performers to better themselves, to achieve their total and absolute potential, whilst the same time making available facilities for people who merely want to enjoy themselves. It Ausappears to me that the 'Charter of German Sport' would be very appropriate for us in Australia to adopt. In effect it could be the bluefor launching us on a new recipe for living. I loans. quote from that document: Charter of German Sport' aims at a uniform concepof the encouragement of sport, of its educational value and its educational aim. It outlines a common task which is only in close partnership with the State, the schools, the churches, the political panies and all other organisations serving man and the common welfare. The gymnastic and sports associations and clubs are fully with the solution of the tasks assigned to them. They this trust, however, not only because of the special peculiar to them, but also because of the extraquite indefinable values resting upon voluntary now found it to personal initiative. That charter seems to me to indicate what is desirable in the Austrahan context. On the one given hand we give due recognition to voluntary helpers, those people who have carried the burden of keeping amateur and professional sport alive. All of us are only too fully aware of people who have made great sacrifices in a voluntary coaching capacity or in the conduct of the various lotteries and the provision of foodstuffs. We not exist without them. I suppose it is true say that these people epitomise the Australian ethos and develop the Austrahan character. But divat present more assistance is necessary if we are to encourage sport. I was deUghted today to have the opportunity, with some of my colleagues, to discuss this matter with Wayne Reid, Les Martyn and Gary Daley who are members of the AusConfederation of Sport. I congratulate in trying to bring together the threads of an organisation to control the future direction of and sporting associations in this country. that They deserve every possible encouragement. I find it difficult to understand the situation in Australia wherein, up to the present, sport has who been looked upon merely as recreation rather than a part of Uving. I cannot understand why it has not been included in the total concept of education. In education emphasis is given to Uteracy, numeracy and drama but not to sport. Why cannot sport be made part and parcel of the curriculum in schools? It is essential for our young people not only to participate for the value of participating but also to obtain discipline. If one thing is lacking in Austrahan society at present surely it is discipline. Only last Friday night I had the privilege to be associated with the starting of a 200-kilometre endurance horse ride from the city of Warwick to the Gold Coast. I was deUghted to see a 71-year old man, Mr Tom Mahony, who rode that long distance from midnight on Friday night till 3 o'clock on Sunday afternoon. I thought what a pity the long haired, unshaven people on the Gold Coast-ther e are some of those people there-were not able to absorb some of his inner toughness, some of his discipUne. I am concerned that with the great emphasis that is put on education sport is excluded from the curriculum. I am also concerned that the total health bUl in Australia, including the costs incurred by State, Federal and local authorities and private means, is in the order of $7,000m this year. That is roughly $480 a head of population. Yet governments in Austraha spend 9 cents a head on sport. The expenditure in Canada is $1.46 a head and in Britain it is 47 cents a head. It seems to me that overseas statistics indicate that where a nation encourages competition in sport, where people actuaUy engage in sport rather than sitting on the sideUnes, the health of that nation is of a higher standard and it spends fewer doUars for each head of population in health costs. So it appears to me to be a perfectly desirable and laudable proposition to advance that we transfer resources from health costs to sporting costs. That seems to be a sound approach. I think the best method of adopting this approach is for the Commonwealth Government to provide funding in the area of administration and national coaching. The Australian Confederation of Sport is comprised of some 94 associations, but there is not sufficient money to have them administered. I would think that if we reduced the allocation to health by, say, $4m or $5m and transferred it to sport, we could have a national administrator and a national coach for aU of these sports. That would strike a first blow and would be a start. One gets upset when one finds that in a country such as Canada 30 Australian coaches have been engaged for the purpose of developing its sport! We cannot find the money to employ them in Australia yet, indicative of its concern for sport as a part of the art of living, Canada is able to supply them with professional positions. What would we titink if we lost aU of our good singing teachers, baUet teachers and university professors? We would be very concerned about that situation. I submit that it is already very late in the day to consider and show some concern about the loss of professional coaches overseas. I applaud bodies such as the Rothmans Foundation which, among other things, supplies a national director of coaching for rugby union in the person of Mr Dick Marks. I find it difficult to accept a situation in which the Government of Australia-and I accept my part of the blame-applie s a sales tax to sports goods. That tax nets the Commonwealth $45m a year. It would be appropriate to allow sporting goods to be made avaUable free of sales tax. It would not involve a huge loss of revenue. I hope that in the next 12 months the Mmister at the table, the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Groom), will be able to persuade the State governments to participate in a national sports lottery. I grieve when I find out all the football",92
175,The CHAIRMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,93
176,Mr UREN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR," I rise to support the call made by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) for the Government to make more money avaUable to overcome the housing shortage situation and stimulate the housing industry. We know that activity in the housing mdustry is at a 10-year low, that there are unemployed tradesmen and that surplus material is lying idle. Therefore, I believe that the views expressed by a back bencher on the Government side of the chamber, criticising the Government for not making avaUable sufficient funding for housing, should be supported. Also, the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns), in speaking tonight on PM, agam criticised the Government for not malcing more money avaUable in the public works and housmg sectors. He also is to be commended. A revolt is coming among Government supporters who seek greater expenditure on housing and public works so that the economy can be stimulated and the present unemployment situation can be dealt with. But I point out to the honourable member for Bendigo that in speaking of the needed money being made available through the terminating buUding societies he indicates that he does not understand that that money is made avaUable to them by way of the Government through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. The amount that was made avaUable under that agreement last year for this purpose was $390m. This year it has been cut back to $316m. It is distributed under a formula whereby 70 per cent is allocated to the housing commissions and the other 30 per cent is allocated through the terminating building societies. Let us examine in greater depth the actual amounts that the States receive for housing. Even as far back as 1974-75 the total amount they received represented 2.1 per cent of the Government's overall budget expenditure. This year the appropriation under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement represents only 1.1 per cent of total Budget expenditure. The actual sum made available to the States for housing in 1974-75 was $385m. There was provision for repayment of advances in the amount of $ 19m and an interest repayment of $88m, leaving a net amount of $278m. For 1978-79, $316m has been made available. Of this sum, $3 lm represents payment of advances and $147m represents interest repayment, leaving a net payment to the States of only $137m. That compares with a net of $278m in 1974-75. One can appreciate the dire straits in which the housing industry finds itself. I believe that what the honourable member for Bendigo has said-that the Government should make more money available-is very important indeed. I wish now to discuss thefiguresin more detail. The Treasurer, Mr Howard, said in his Budget speech that the Government hoped to stimulate the housing sector through the advances made by way of the savings banks. The ratio was to changed from 45 per cent to 40 per cent. The truth is that at present it stands at 53 per cent. Even if the Government gets it down, if things improve, to 40 per cent, one must also consider the amount that is actually being loaned for new housing-and I emphasise that money for new housing is needed to stimulate the economy. Last month only about 30 per cent of all loans available through the savings banks related to new housing. In the case of the permanent buildladder ing societies thefigurewas 31 per cent. For the savings banks it was actually 33 per cent. latestfiguresthey have fallen even further. Last month only 28 per cent of all loans allocated through the savings banks were for new housing. Therefore, even if the ratio were reduced would not stimulate the construction of new houses. On the other hand, if we look at the propferred osition that has been put forward by the honourment able member for Bendigo and consider making Otherwise the money available through the pubhc sector, through the Commonwealth-State Housing Aheady Agreement, we find again that of the 70 per cent that goes to the State housing commissions at least 85 per cent goes into new housing, and 15 per cent into land. The money that goes through the terminating building societiesMr Bourchier- I rise on a point of order. I do not want to interrupt this very interesting discussion, but I must point out that I did not say that the money would go to the housing commission.",93
177,The CHAIRMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,There is no substance to the point of order. The honourable member will resume his seat.,94
178,Mr UREN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"Again , 57 per cent of all loans that are made through the terminating building societies go into new housing. Therefore, at least 75 per cent of all Government money that is re- spent through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement is devoted to new housing. That would mean that for every dollar spent in the pubhc sector through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, one would have to spend $2.50 in the private sector. Therefore, one would not achieve the same stimulus. The honourable member for Bendigo also spoke about the need for money to be made available for new loans. He talked about people earning up to $250 a week finding it difficult to get loans, or to meet the required monthly repayments on a housing loan. It is even worse than that. In the western suburbs of Sydney a normal be home costs about $35,000. Even if one had a $5,000 deposit, the repayment on a 25-year loan of $30,000 at an interest rate of 10 per cent would be $272 a month. If the weekly repayment is to represent only 25 per cent of the weekly income it means that people earning less than 135 per cent of average weekly earnings would be disqualified. It is important that the Government made introduce housing schemes which will allow people to get their foot on the first rung of the to purchase theirfirsthome. The only way in which that can be done, to my knowledge, is On the by way of a deferred mortgage repayment scheme. Very few people default on their housing loans. Therefore, we have to have more confidence in people and we have to formulate a it housing pohcy whereby in the early stages people do not pay as much in repayments as they do in later years. I beheve that under the demortgage payment scheme, with governguarantees, more people can be housed. these people will be forced to put their names on the housing commission waiting lists. 100,000 families are on those hsts and the number is growing faster and faster each year. Because of the econornic conditions prevailing, more and more people are going to be forced on to the housing commission waiting lists. As I said before, this Government is cutting back on expenditure on pubhc housing instead of increasing it so as to give a stimulus to the housing industry.",94
179,The CHAIRMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,95
180,Mr GROOM,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"Braddon-Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development) (9.1)- I would like to thank all honourable members who have contributed to the debate on the estimates for the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development. I would like also to respond to some of the points that have been made. The honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) commenced the debate by making what I thought were some quite reasonable comments on sport and the involvement of government in sport. I commend him particularly for his comments on the importance of sport in preventive medicine, the importance of developing sport and having people involved in sport so that it will improve their health and thereby reduce health costs. I think that was a very worthwhile point. I do not think he was terribly fair about the contribution being made at the moment by the Government to sports development and the amount of funds being provided. He failed fairly to state the facts. This financial year we will be providing $ 1.33m, which is a 33 1/3 per cent increase on the amount provided in the previous financial year. In dollar terms it is the most that has ever been provided for sports development in this country. The honourable member spoke about $ l l m being provided during the Labor Government's term of office, but most of that money was provided not to sportsmen and sportswomen to develop their skills but to constructing buildings-brick s and mortar. Certainly that is important but the States and local government can do that. I think that the role of the Federal Government is properly to develop our sporting skills and to encourage our sportsmen and sportswomen. Recentiy we announced the allocation to various sporting bodies throughout Australia of this $ 1.33m. Seventy-two sporting organisations will receive assistance this financial year. The grants include $562,700 for international competition and $382,000 for administration.",95
181,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,It is embarrassing.,95
182,Mr GROOM,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"The honourable member says that it is embarrassing; that it is not enough. It is important and it is recognised as important by the sporting bodies. It is helping them and providing them with a great deal of initiative and incentive, and they commend the Government.",95
183,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,They do not.,95
184,Mr GROOM,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"They do commend the Government. Full time coaches and coaching projects wtil receive $237,600, research and information dissemination wtil receive $34,300 and other forms of sports development wtil receive $5,000. They are large amounts of money and that is appreciated by the sporting bodies concerned. The honourable member for Robertson made one interesting comment which I thought was a reflection upon the Labor Government's approach to sport when he said- I think I am quoting him correctly-that he would not like it to be done in the ad hoc way it was done before. If honourable members read his speech they will see that it is really a comment upon the Labor Government's approach to sport. He was saying that it was an ad hoc approach. I think that underneath he was giving some credit to our approach to sport. Last year $lm was allocated to sport. It was a start. We have built on that. We have not wound down our sports program; we have butit on it. We have increased it by 33 1/3 per cent. That is important and I think some credit should be given for it. The honourable member for Forrest (Mr Drummond) spoke about grants to conservation . organisations and mentioned the $350,000 that is being made avaUable to conservation organisations. I thank him for his contribution. He made the point that this amount is being granted to unspecified conservation organisations. It is true to say that at present the bodies are unspecified but they will be specified quite soon. I have received advice from the Australian Heritage Commission and I am now in a position to allocate those funds. I would expect that quite soon I wtil be announcing the various allocations to the bodies concerned. The honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) made his usual speech on the subject of housing. He seems to think that the pubUc sector is aU-important and appears to disregard the private sector. He wants more and more money spent on pubhc housing in Australia and does not give due regard to the private sector. It is interesting to note that 90 per cent of the funds provided for housing in Australia is provided by the private sector through the banks, buUding societies and other lending institutions, and from private sources. Only 10 per cent or thereabouts of those funds is provided as public funding. It is important to recognise that the more important sector to the future of housing and the financing of housing in Austraha is the private sector. We are giving proper encouragement to an expansion of funding through the private sector and that must be recognised. The decision made to reduce the prescribed asset ratio from 45 per cent to 40 per cent is recognised by the housing industry, the banks and other lending institutions as an important decision which will result during this financial year in an increased flow to the housing industry and to the home buyer of funds required to purchase homes. Again, that was an important decision. The honourable member for Reid made the comment that we should be spending more on government departments, that we should build up the size of government in Canberra. I know that is his view but others would disagree with - him. There is no doubt that during the Labor Government's term of office a great deal of money was wasted in some of the programs which he encouraged. Many of them were important programs; many were great in theory but not great in practice. On any sensible and responsible assessment of the job he did when he was in office, one would say that many of the decisions made at that time were unsuccessful and many of the pubhc resources used at that time were wasted. Of course, the people who pay are the taxpayers, the ordinary hard-working men and women of this country. I tltink we should have due regard to the fact that the money we spend as governments is not our own money; it is money earned through toil and effort by ordinary people in the community. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) was not critical of the Government, on my understanding of his comments. The member for Reid suggested he was, but he was not. Again, I think mat if one reads his speech one wtil find that he was not critical of the Government. He made what I would beheve to be a very constructive contribution in which he made some suggestions that are worthy of close consideration. He suggested a scheme to assist people, especially young people and those on limited incomes, to get into homes. He mentioned a national loan. I must say that I think there are problems with that sort of scheme. Nevertheless I will be pursuing it and discussing it further with the Treasurer (Mr Howard). The matter has already been raised with us. I make the point that the honourable member for Bendigo is not a theorist; he is a person who a lot of experience in the building industry. He was in that industry for many years. He is a practical person. One cannot ignore that sort .of experience. One must take heed of the comments made by a person of his experience. I again thank him for his contribution. I think the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) made a disappointing contribution. He distorted the facts andfigures,as he so often does. I must make that point. He is known as afiddleroffiguresand he fiddled with figures on this occasion. I make the point that as far as funding under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement is concerned there will be as much available to the States this year to fund welfare housing as there was last year, but it depends upon State effort. If the States make the effort and the contribution that I believe they will make, then in no sense will welfare housing suffer during thisfinancialyear. I mentioned the base figure of $ 186m and a matchingfigureof $ 130m. That means that the States will provide a matchingfigureof $ 130m. All the States have indicated that they will make the full matching contribution. Where the honourable member for Hughes has gone wrong is that he has ignored the revolving funds. I must point out to him that these funds are an important part of welfare housing funding in Australia. In this financial year the revolving funds, which he has ignored, will amount to something like $69m. If he adds that figure to the other figures he has mentioned he will come up with something like the right figure. The honourable member for DarUng Downs (Mr MCVeigh) made an excellent contribution to this debate, as he usually does. He spoke about the triangle concept of sports development. Those who heard him speak on the subject would appreciate that he displays a good deal of knowledge, common sense and understanding of sports development in Australia. His ideas are consistent with the ideas of the Government. We believe that we should encourage our top sportsmen and sportswomen and by encouraging them we wtil thereby encourage mass participation in sport by Australians. I think that is the point made by the honourable member for Darling Downs. He made an important point when he mentioned the downgrading of sport in the education system. We should look at this carefully as should educationists. It is not good that sport should be excluded from some schools, as I tltink is occurring in some areas. I tbink that spon should be given its proper place in schools and in the education system. I noted the other comhas had ments that were made by the honourable member for DarUng Downs and certainly I will take those into account in the development of our sports pohcy in the future.",95

190,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"Mr Deputy Chairman, with respect to you, I asked the Minister a question. I did not regard that as any justification for him to sit down.",97
191,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"Question s are out of order and you have no business to ask the Minister a question at this time. Proposed expenditures agreed to. Department of Employment and Industrial Proposed expenditure, $282,716,000.",97
192,Mr YOUNG,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"In the few minutes available I want to pay some specinc attention to the Government's manpower programs, so-called-the National Employment and Training scheme, the Special Youth Employment Training Program, the Community Youth Support scheme, the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training scheme and the Education Program for Unemployed Youth. The Government maintains that these programs provide people with skills and work experience to enhance their prospects of stable employment. Even if existing programs were successful in achieving these Umited aims the expenditure of $ 173.8m is a pitiful amount to invest in Australia's future productive capacity. Australia needs an integrated and systematic plan that offers the unemployed the choice of employment, job training, education or community service. Present schemes do Utde to provide reaUstic alternatives for the unemployed. Clearly this Government has faUed in the area of job creation. Close scrutiny of training schemes also reveals that it has faUed to comprehend the immense problem of educating and training an industrial work force capable of adapting to rapid periods of structural change within industry. The appropriation for the NEAT scheme has gone up from $84.9m to $122m. The SYETP scheme, which forms such a large part of the NEAT scheme, has had an increase from $47. lm to $80m, The SYETP scheme will receive $80m or two-thirds of the total NEAT allocation this financial year. The period of training under the SYETP scheme is reduced from six to four months in 1978-79 and the rate of wage subsidy payable to employers is reduced from $67 to $45 a week. This was done, according to the Treasurer (Mr Howard), to correct 'the present tendency for SYETP to favour unduly younger age groups to the detriment of older age groups'. Of the estimated throughput of about 110,000 trainees under NEAT in 1978-79 about 80,000 are expected to be trained under the SYEPT scheme. Therefore NEAT has an estimated throughput of 30,000 trainees in 1978-79, which provides little hope that NEAT will make any significant contribution to the education and training of the adult work force over the age of 24 years. Thisfigurein itself represents a clear admission by the Government that it is prepared to deny large numbers of the unemployed the right to obtain the necessary skills required to work in an economy characterised by dramatic Relations changes in sktil requirements. Indeed this is not surprising, given the Government's reluctance to engage in the forecasting of the future manpower requirements of Australian industry. The SYETP scheme is the main government measure used to alleviate youth unemployment. It is totally dependent upon the level of employment opportunities within the private sector and therefore it does not add to the overall stock of jobs in the community. There is considerable evidence to suggest that its effect upon the level of employment is counterproductive. I give some reasons why. Employers are not obliged to create an additional position to quaUfy for the subsidy; employers are not required to retain the employee when the subsidy period expires; and there is no bar on employers hiring a succession of trainees, although the young people themselves are eligible for only one period of subsidised training under the scheme. Therefore the scheme has the effect of recycling unemployment. Firms simply hire unemployed workers to replace other workers who then become unemployed. The scheme has the effect of creating less stable and less satisfactory jobs which may take the place of permanent ones. It has the effect of discouraging a rational deployment of manpower. SYETP approvals are not subject to the labour market lists which are used to vet appUcations for general NEAT funding. Thus, the so called trainees may be absorbed into areas where employment opportunities are most threatened by structural adjustment and technological change. The Government is not even able to teU the Parliament what type of training has been provided for SYETP beneficiaries. I understand that a survey conducted by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations earUer this year shows that between October and December last year only 35 per cent of those taken on under the scheme and completing it had been given permanent jobs by their employers, whtist an earUer survey gave the figure at 50 per cent. This is a clear indication that the employers are misusing the scheme by retrenching young people at the end of the sixmonth subsidised training period. The Government's cutback in the subsidy is a clear indication also that employers have abused this generous level of wage subsidy. The contention that the changes have been made to correct the present tendency for SYETP to favour unduly younger groups to the detriment of the employment prospects of older age groups is not borne out in the unemployment figures. Although unemployment for 15 to 19year-olds dropped from 175,000 in February to 125,000 in May and to 119,000 in August, these declines were not matched by increases in employment. Between February and August the number of 15 to 24-year-olds in jobs fell by 3,900. In addition this period was characterised by a withdrawal of young people from the labour force with a drop in the participation rate of 15 19-year-olds from 65.2 per cent to 61 per cent-50,00 0 young people simply disappeared from the labour force. The decline in youth unemployment is therefore Ulusory. The SYETP scheme therefore is clearly a faUure as a job creation scheme. The Government however maintains that the scheme is a training scheme despite the following facts: Conventional business is not often in a position to provide adequate resources for the development of basic job skills. The CES does not have the resources adequately to supervise in-plant training. There is no requirement that the employer provide marketable job sktils. A flat rate subsidy ensures that the training that is provided is orientated towards secondary and low wage occupations. The scheme therefore swaUows some two-tltirds of the NEAT budget but fatis to ensure any net increase in jobs while conducting a traimng component of dubious validity. The budget for the Community Youth Support Scheme rose from $5.7m last year to $9m this year. The purpose of the scheme is to fund community based organisations to run activities and work orientation programs for local young people without jobs. The Government recently has introduced new guidelines that luhder the abUity of these projects to cater for the unemployed in any meaningful way. The guidelines prevent projects from engaging in job related activities, such as self-employment, the production of goods for sale and job search and placement. Given the fact that 29 young people are unemployed for every CES vacancy, these guidelines effectively prevent the Community Youth Support Scheme's ability to operate a so called 'employment related scheme'. In effect the scheme's role under the new guidelines is aptly described as cuddle therapy. Its only purpose is to instil the work ethic into kids who stand little chance of getting a job because any local initiatives which could create employment are forbidden. The training element involved in CYSS is also constrained by the guidelines which prevent 'formal education classes or instruction in job skills as those normaUy provided by educational and training institutions'. Under the guidelines CYSS schemes are confined to the role of drop-in centres. There is little doubt that some CYSS schemes have been highly successful in providing essential moral and personal support for the unemployed. They do, however, vary enormously in then effectiveness. If the Government was serious, there is no doubt CYSS could easUy be absorbed into NEAT as a job creation and to training project where participants could be paid a training allowance. The estimates for the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-Time Training scheme have gone up from $ 15.8m in 1977-78 to $38m in 1978-79. Despite the introduction of CRAFT in January 1977 a drop of 5.6 per cent in apprenticeship intakes occurred in 1977-78 compared with the previous year. Quite clearly, employers are sttil reluctant to boost their apprenticeship intakes. This, to a large extent, is a reflection of the shrinkage in the overall labour market particularly in the buUding and construction industries. Let me refer to the major labour intensive industries. We note that the intake of apprentices in 1977-78 compared with 1976-77 in the metal industries throughout Australia dropped by 5.2 per cent. The number of apprentices employed in the buUding industry dropped dramatically by 18.3 per cent. There was a drop of 6.9 per cent in the number of apprentices taken into the vehicle industry in 1977-78. These figures had varying effects throughout the States. As I said this morning, the employment and unemployment situation has reached a crisis Austraha. The Government ignores to its peril what is occurring in Australia. Something has be done urgently to put people back to work. Government needs to recognise the drop-out the labour force in Australia. More money will have to be put into job creation programs as quickly as possible if we are to avoid the sort social crisis that is now upon us. If the Governyoung ment continues to ignore the problems of unemployment with which it is confronted, there can be absolutely no doubt at all that the next time it goes to the polls we wtil see a change government.",97
193,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR, ployment Order! The honourable member's time has ment. expired.,99
194,Mr BURR,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"I would Uke to follow the same theme as the honourable and member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) and adago. dress my remarks to the same estimates. I somewhat disappointed with his speech. We have heard some very good speeches in this chamber from the honourable member and, on occasions, he has made good suggestions to House and to the Government about methods partisan, that can be foUowed to aUeviate the increasing problems of unemployment in this country. night the honourable member outlined the ous schemes that the Government has throughout introduced in order to train young people to into the work force and in that way aUeviate the problems of the young unemployed. But honourable member for Port Adelaide did nothing more than criticise every scheme that the Government now has in operation. I tltink it is totally wrong for the honourable member for Port Adelaide or any member on the other side of the chamber to say that all the various schemes such as the National Employment and Training Scheme, the Special Youth Employhonourable ment Training Scheme and the Community ment Youth Support Scheme that the Government is operating have no effect at all in training young people to get into the work force. That is a totally wrong construction. It is undue poltiical criticism on the honourable member's part. I was very appointed with that aspect of his speech. The honourable member, in the course of his speech, said that the Government wtil be spendcope ing $ 173.8m this year for apprentice training other schemes to train young people to go into the work force. I compare the $46.3m that has been budgeted this current financial year for apprenticeship training with the $32.6m that was aUocated for the previousfinancialyear. The allocation this year for general employment trainin ing schemes which cover the broad spectrum of programs stands at $ 126.8m. Last year the to amount was $87.4m and the year before $32.9m. The This gives some indication of the concern that in this Government has for unemployment. It can be related to the processes and methods that the Government has implemented to try to alleviate of the problems of the unemployed and to train people for a place in the labour force. The other aspect that disappointed me about of the honourable member's speech was that he seemed to assume that the only people in the community who have a responsibUity for unemare members of the Federal GovernThat is a totally wrong construction. We all recall the very good and forthright speech made to this chamber by the Minister for Employment Industrial Relations (Mr Street) some weeks He outiined to this House and to the country was the long term nature of unemployment and the associated social problems that must be recognised and taken to heart not just by the Government but by every person and every section of the our society. That speech was made on a nonnon-potitical basis. It set out the facts. It was a discussion paper. We wtil aU be able to Toanalyse critically the problems of unemployvariment. Members of this Parliament and people the country wtil be able to set their go minds to solving the problems and accepting the factors that have to be taken into account to rethe duce unemployment on a long term basis. All of us in this place seem to have the idea that unemployment is an economic problem and that we have to get these kids into the work place so that they can be earning money, paying taxes and alleviating our social welfare bUl. I remind members opposite that unemployis not just an economic problem. It is great to have young people in the work force, earning money and paying their way in society, but unemployment now must be recognised as being as much a social problem as an economic problem. disWhUe members on the other side of the chamber might try to put unemployment in an economic context and say that the Government should make economic decisions and moves in order to with unemployment, we have to recognise and that unemployment is a social problem. Because it is a social problem responsibility must be accepted by all sections of the community and not just by people in this place. Let us look at educational standards. If we are to look at social aspects we have to look at education. This is what the teachers in the schools say about the people who go through the education system: 'All we do is to train a kid until is 16 or 17 years old and we don't give two hoots where he goes once he leaves school'. But the kids, once they leave school, have to go out and find a job. Surely the education system must take its share of the responsibility for unemployment because of the way it is putting the kids on the labour market. So consideration must be given to education in this regard. What about disciplinary standards? As stated in an earlier speech by the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh), discipline in society has slumped to a very low level. I beheve that until we can correct this downturn in disciplinary standards we will not be able to offer to the labour market young people who employers will be prepared to take on to their staff. What about wage levels? What consideration has been given by honourable members on the opposite side of this chamber to the effect that ever increasing wage levels have in taking away jobs from people who are looking for jobs? Surely we must accept as a fact that the rising level of wages has a big impact on keeping people out of the work force. We have to accept that as part of the social problem of unemployment. What about full adult pay at the age of 18? What would honourable members on the other side of this chamber do if a ypung kid just out of school, with no training and no competency at all to go into the work force, appeared on thendoorsteps and said: ' I demand full pay without traimng'. Would they be prepared to give that person a job? This is the situation facing so many young kids. They cannot get into the work force. They are precluded from it because of various agreements that have been made as a result of strong arm tactics by the trade union movement. We have to accept that as being part of the social problem of unemployment. What about the number of married women who are going back into the work force? What consideration have we given to that point? Ten years ago 14.1 per cent of the work force was made up of married women. Today that percentage is 22 per cent. That accounts for an extra 450,000 married women in the work force. How many of those married women are keeping kids in the dole queues? What consideration have any honourable members in this chamber, and for that matter members of the general community, given to the impact on unemployment of that factor? Surely we must consider these factors. What about the technology revolution? Surely we have to consider that as part of the social change and social impact affecting unemployment. These are all parts of the problem of unhe employment. It is not just a problem that this Government can face. It is not just a problem that this Government can solve allocating money, as people on the other side of this chamber seem to think. We heard the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) suggest that there should be job creation programs. What sort of solution is that? It is a band-aid solution to a long term problem. It will not work. We have to have long term, solutions to unemployment and they have to involve every section of society, every group and organisation in the community. All of us in Australia collectively have to "" accept that responsibiUty ifwe are to solve this problem. If we have a section of society such as the trade union movement or any other group that says: 'We are not going to accept that responsibUity we are going to adopt an anti-social attitude', then I believe that the long term effect in the future wtil be to keep more and more kids in the dole queues and extend this problem for many more years than is absolutely necessary.",99
195,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"It is always a deUght to foUow the honourable member for WUmot (Mr Burr). His absolute paranoia about the trade union movement comes through in every speech that he makes in this House. We had hoped that in the 10 minutes m which he addressed us we were gomg to get some sort of indication of what the Government intends to do about solving the Unemployment problem. It would seem that the honourable member for WUmot has now discovered the truth of something that often has been said to him smce 1975 when he first became a member of this House-that unemployment is a social problem. That is an incredible discovery. I would like to reply to some of the honourable member's comments. He used the old caper of Phti Lynch, the honourable member for Flinders, and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who always say that ever increasing wage levels are aggravating the unemployment situation. That is very easy to say and it is a little difficult to refute but it rather overlooks the real facts of the matter. The honourable member for WUmot stated the real facts finally when he said that increased mechanisation and advances in technology are keeping kids out of work. That is the key to the problem. It would not matter what wage rates are being paid to people. At no time in the past have wage levels had an effect on the level at which employers will employ people. Nor will they have an effect in the future. I will advance that argument a httle further. I think we ought to have a look at what actually happens. Somebody at some time invests his capital and establishes a factory to manufacture goods. After manufacturing those goods he sets about finding a market for them. The market is successful and he sells the goods at a higher price that it cost him to manufacture them. Therefore the operation is profitable. Surely that operation is pretty basic I think that everybody in the community, perhaps with the exception of the honourable member for Wilmot, would have sufficient inteUigence to understand that that is exactly what happens from day to day in all the factories in Australia and around the world. Employers employ as many people as they need to produce the volume of goods that they wish to produce so that they can then seU them and get the whole system going again. Whether wage rates are up or down is completely irrelevant. They are not- I repeat they are not-of any significance in this country. If people care to compare wage rates paid in Austraha with the slave wage rates paid in some other countries they must answer this question: How is it that countries such as West Germany, the United States, Japan and a number of others with wage rates comparable to ours are still able to proceed and do what they want to do? So there is no vaUdity in the argument about ever increasing wage levels adding to the level of unemployment. The same argument applies to kids being paid fuU wages. That is a completely irrelevant matter. The honourable member thinks that married women go to work just to wear out their old clothes. He ignores the fact that in most cases-certainl y it is the case in my electorate-if married women are working they are doing so to sustain the income of the famUy and not to keep kids out of work. If they were to move away from their present employment the whole famUy would go down the drain. I would rather take up the theme that the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) put to us tonight. He was quite correct, as he generally is. He was on the ball and followed the whole theme through. This Community Youth Support Scheme that the Government put to us, is a charade. That is known by everybody. The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) should know that the Community Youth Support Scheme in the city of Broadmeadows, which is a very prominent city in my electorate, is a charade. He has been told so by the people who have been responsible for managing it. They have suffered nothing but frustration in their endeavours and their attempts. The whole purpose of the CYSS, as it is euphemistically called, is to make sure that young people leaving school are work oriented. I do not know what that means; somebody must know. In the city of Broadmeadows a host of people, for a long time and at great expense to themselves in terms of money and loss of recreation, have endeavoured to make this CYSS scheme work. It has not worked. The guidelines are restrictive. A group in Sunbury, another prominent centre in my electorate, who wished to set up a project under the CYSS scheme, were told by the State organisation that that just was not on. There were no funds avaUable to the kids in that town. We are talking about at least two towns in Victoria with a very high percentage of young unemployed people. The people in Sunbury, with the best of intentions, wished to set up a CYSS project. Poor as I might think it is, at least it is a band-aid job. However, they were told by this Government, with its great compassion for unemployed young people, that funds just were not available. The people in Broadmeadows are able to work only from month to month, six months at a time, because they have been told that there is no guarantee that funds will be avaUable in six months time. They are very conscientious and very well trained people, but they have now packed it in and said: 'We are not going to live this sort of life. We also have some sort of commitment to make and we are not going to live six months at atimebecause it is impossible for this Government to make up its mind.' They have now wound up the whole project. I am not convinced that the CYSS is the answer to the problem of the young unemployed but at least it was some sort of effort, and because of the inabUity of this Government to make a commitment even that has gone by the board. In relation to the other schemes, again I agree with the honourable member for Port Adelaide. There is a scheme whereby employers are paid a sum of money- I think it is some 50 per cent of award wages-for the employees they put on, but not necessarily for job creation. No attempt has been made in the estimates for this Department, nor indeed in the whole of the Budget documents, to do anything about job creation. I suppose that 'job creation' is a nice phrase. It sounds good. The Government has picked it up and intends to use it as much as it can, but nothing tive is being done. The honourable member for Wilmot said that a lot of suggestions had been made but they had never been followed through. He happens to be on the Government side of the chamber. It is no good him coming into this Committee and bleating and weeping in the way that he and his colleagues generally do about the inactivity of this Government when they have it in then hands to do something about it. Their party meeting last Wednesday took long time. It is very seldom that I pay credit members of the Liberal Party, but tonight I going to make an exception and pay credit to Speaker of this chamber, Sir Billy Snedden. If Press reports are correct, he came forward with solution to the problem. I understand that it not get very far in the Liberal Party room, they did meet until 1.15 p.m. that day whereas normally they give up at about 12.45 p.m. So about half an hour there was a decent old blue going on in the Liberal Party room. I am not privy to those sorts of discussions but I that the honourable member for Diamond Valley (Mr N. A. Brown) is laughing his head off, so apparently his favourite horse got up. I would like to have been a fly on the wall at that meeting.",100
196,Mr NA BROWN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,It was very interesting.,102
197,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"I should imagine quite that it was very interesting, and that is why I I had been a fly on the wall. The important that appeared in the Press report on Thursday morning-this morning-is that the person who and to all intents and purposes is above party politics, the Speaker of this House, a man I hold in very high reverence, made the only sensible suggesnot tion that was made in the Liberal Party room yesterday. He said: Tf you are going to create work in this country then pump your money into pubhc works', and he is quiteright.The Governof ment could apply the funds that it has available, although this sort of approach does not always need funds. If it provided that sort of incentive, if it got the construction industry working again, ask everybody to examine the multiplier effect that. I am not talking only about those terrible building worker blokes, such as Norm Gallagher and the rest of them, I am talking about a whole host of people who make carpet and lino and drapes",102
198,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR," the Order! The honourable member's time has Moore, expired.",102
199,Mr NA BROWN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"The honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) has a very vivid imagination, and I give him full marks for that. Not only is he able to picture in his mind a Liberal-Country Party meeting, quite accurately I might say, but more than that he is able to give what I can describe only as a very novel interpretation of the economic problems facing Austraha today. If the honourable member for Burke would contain himself for one moment, I will deal with one of the erroneous views he put forward. The honoura able member maintained that wage increases into Austraha today are of no significance whatsoever am so far as inflation and unemployment are conthe cerned, and I emphasise the words 'of no sigthe nificance at all'. I concede that the Government a may be hard pressed to show that wage increases did are the sole reason for inflation and the sole but reason for unemployment in Austraha, but I should have thought that eveiyone who has any for understanding at all of the issues would have agreed that wage increases in Austraha since 1974 have played a major part in the economic notice problems that have faced this countiy. If the honourable member for Burke has any doubt at all about this, I would refer him to the views not of a spokesman for the Government benches but of one of the Labor Party's own economic advisers during the three years of the Labor Government. I refer to Professor Gruen, a very distinguished economist. Professor Gruen recently, after a lot of research, has wish expounded the view that the wage overhang, as thing it is called, the excess of wage costs over productivity-wha t this nation produces in goods services-is still today, even after the erosion of real wages, a major factor at the root of the unemployment problem facing Australia. That is me speaking, that is Professor Gruen, and I suggest that the honourable member for Burke should go away and read what he has had to say because he was an adviser during the three years the Labor Government. Indeed, he was even an adviser to the great man himself. I will deal now more specifically with the DeI partment of Employment and Industrial Reof lations and make a brief remark about an Act of this Parhament, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, within the framework of which industrial relations in the federal sphere are conducted. There are many Commonwealth statutes which today require consolidation and redrafting, and one of the major candidates for that treatment is Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Sir John who is the President of the Conctiiation and Arbitration Commission, recently described the Concihation and Arbitration Act as a lawyer's nightmare. A number of other people who were present at the conference where Sir John made that remark agreed with him. For instance, amongst others, I agreed with him. It is true that the Act requires consolidation. It requires redrawing because it is now one of the prime candidates in the legislative jigsaw stakes. Above all, the Act is one which is required to be used regularly by people in the work place on both sides of the industrial fence-o n the management side and the union side. It must be comprehensible, it must be understandable, it must follow logically, and I am afraid that at the moment it is not really any of those things. I make a plea for the early redrafting and consolidation of the Concihation and Arbitration Act. The second point I want to make briefly, although it is important, is that in times of difficult industrial relations it is appropriate to pay regard to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street), whom I think handles a very difficult portfolio very well. Not only has he been concerned with some very difficult industrial relations crises but he has also been concerned with a very difficult employment situation. I beheve that he has brought good faith, high intelligence and a very honest approach to the very real problems facing Austraha. If one of the tests of a successful industrial relations pohcy is the number of days lost through strikes, then surely the Government in general and the Minister in particular must be given considerable credit for what they have achieved. I say that because in 1974 Australians, beheve it or not, lost over 6 million working days through industrial disputes. Last year, 1977, the number had dropped to just over 1,500,000. There was a drop from over 6 million working days to just over 1,500,000 working days. Frankly, I think that that is a very accurate and appropriate indication of the success of the pohcies administered by the Government and Mr Street in industrial relations. In the remainingtimeavailable to me I want to put, I hope in a non-partisan way, some of the objectives that any goverament should have- I beheve that this Government has-in the industrial relationsfield.What are the basic objectives that a goverament should pursue in industrial relations? The first, I suggest, is that we should try to achieve harmonious relations between employers and employees. Secondly, we should try to achieve a situation where disputes, if they arise, are settled by conciliation or, if that fails, by arbitration. Our third objective should be to ensure that the pubhc is not inconvenienced by \ October 1978 REPRESENTATIVES 2149 strikes in industry and, in particular, in pubhc utilities. It should be recognised that many of the victims of strikes and other industrial action are innocent. The Government has a responsibility to those people and, indeed, to all citizens to use all the powers it has at its disposal to ensure that citizens can go about their ordinary Uves and continue their work unhampered by disruptive industrial action. Above aU, the Government, I would maintain, has every right to ensure that government employees and employees of semi-government instrumentaUties, who after aU have permanent employment, who are in a monopoly position in mdustry and who are paid from public money, are not able to hold the rest of the community at ransom merely at their own whim. That is an essential objective of any industrial relations poticy. Our fourth objective should be to encourage membership of industrial organisations, particularly trade unions. Members should be encouraged to take an active part in the rurming of their union's affairs. Our fifth objective should be that despite that objective individuals should be protected from a domineering or overbearing industrial organisation. Sixthly, it should be recognised- I venture to suggest that some Opposition members do not seem to appreciate this-that industrial relations decisions, including voluntary settlements as well as arbitrated decisions, cannot be looked at solely in a vacuum. They all affect the economy. Some decisions, in fact, damage the economy. Some decisions hamper the achievements of the Government's economic policies and objectives. The seventh objective is a tremendously important one which has probably only come to the surface during the life of the present Government, and that is that the pubhc interest should be protected and preserved. The Government has taken the position that there is a pubUc interest above and quite apart from the immediate private interests of the parties concerned, whether trade unions or employers. The public has a right to be heard and represented. The Government has endeavoured, I believe successfully, to manifest the preservation of that pubUc interest. The final objective is to put the PubUc Service as nearly as possible on the same footing as employment in private enterprise. Those are, in effect, non-partisan positions. I believe that they are sensible, practical and rational objectives of any industrial relations policy. I hope that in the remaining time of this Parhament over the next two and a half years the Opposition will see its way clear to join with the Government in pursuing those poUcies. The only result will be the betterment of the welfare of all Austrahan people.",102
200,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,Mr Armitage)Order! The honourable member's timehas expired.,104
201,Mr HOLDING,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"In the course of this Committee debate thus far, the very serious and important points made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) about the extent of the crisis that exists in Australian society in terms of the unemployment level and the faUure of this Government to meet this problem have gone unanswered. There have been two contributions from Government members. Let me deal with the latter of these, the speech of the honourable member for Diamond VaUey (Mr N. A. Brown). I say to the honourable member with candour and without being personal that I am tired of the sorts of gations which have almost become part of the mythology of members of the Liberal Party. When we are looking at the problem of unemployment the people they always blame are those who are at the lower level of the socio-economic strata in our society. If only the metal workers, the plumbers, the buUders, the carpenters or the other tradesmen would accept a Uttle less it would be aU right. I have grown used to listening to that sort of advocacy from the honourable member for Diamond Valley, who, with respect to him, has a professional capacity. The honourable gentleman is a fuU time professional legal advocate for employers' interests in the industrial courts of this country. I have doubt that he has enjoyed all the increases which have taken place in legal fees over the last five years, lt is extraordinary how it is all right for members of the legal profession to accept substantial and significant increases which are beyond the comprehension of the average tradesman.",104
202,Mr NA BROWN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,I suppose you could add retired State members of parliament to the list.,104
203,Mr HOLDING,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,All I am saying to the honourable gentleman is that when he is not sitting in this Parliament he is spending his time as an industrial advocate for the employers. Tonight he confused his functions. He need not come into the chamber and say: 'Now I am talking to you objectively. I have put on my other hat. I am now the honourable member for Diamond VaUey'. This attitude was reflected also by the honourable member for WUmot (Mr Burr). Who did he blame for the unemployment situation? His speech was an extraordinary hotchpotch. First of aU he blamed the teachers. If only the teachers had been teaching the kids the right tilings there would not be as many unemployed. Then he blamed the married women.,104
204,Mr NA BROWN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"Mr Deputy Chairman, I take a point of order.",104
205,Mr HOLDING,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,Can the honourable member not take it?,104
206,Mr NA BROWN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"Perhaps the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will resume his seat whtie I take my point of order. I assume that he has finished talking about me. I merely ask you, Mr Deputy Chairman, to note that I have not asked him to withdraw anything that he has said.",104
207,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,Mr Armitage)That is not a point of order.,104
208,Mr HOLDING,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"The honourable member for aUeWUmot was concerned to blame first of all the teachers. When he finished with them it was the fault of the trade unions. He put this argument less eloquently because he is less of a professional advocate than the honourable member for Diamond VaUey. He also got stuck into the married women. Somehow, if married women were not in the work force it would all be better.",104
209,Mr ROGER JOHNSTON,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"You did not understand what he said, did you?",104
210,Mr HOLDING,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"I listened very carefuUy. The problem with honourable gentlemen opposite is that like those who thus far have spoken in this debate they are absolutely Umited by their own no prejudices and attitudes. The breakdown of wealth in Australia is as follows: The top 5 per cent owns over 20 per cent of the wealth of this community; the middle 45 per cent owns 60 per cent of the wealth and the lowest 50 per centthat is one half of Australia's society-own s less than 15 per cent of the wealth. Whenever honourable gentlemen opposite talk about the crisis in the economic system all the burden, responsibUity and blame is always put on the lower 50 per cent of the community. Day after day in this place the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and those who foUow him put all the blame for inflation on that 50 per cent. They are told that if they want a greater share of the cake they are somehow acting in a way that is either immoral or irresponsible.",104
211,Mr NA BROWN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,Neithe r the honourable member for WUmot nor I said anything like that. You are a dreamer if you think either of us said anything Uke that.,104
212,Mr HOLDING,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"I suggest to the honourable gentleman that he said very clearly-h e was a clear advocate of this in the Parliament tonight, although he might try to move away from itthat increases in wages are related to the level of unemployment in this community. That is part of his mythology. I am not saying this in a personal sense to the honourable member for Diamond Valley; I am saying it in the context of the sort of social class interest that he continually represents. I venture to suggest that he has never gone any increase in his professional fees, but he is prepared to say that if those people in the Austrahan community who comprise the 50 per cent who own the least would only forgo increases in their wages, then the problems would be solved. Mr Groom-Oh!",104
213,Mr HOLDING,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"I will get back to the Minisis ter. His turn is coming. That is part of the mythenterprise ology of this Government. It is reflected daily the attitude of the Prime Minister. It is a factor which constantly runs through the Government's economic philosophy. The monetarist theory which is being pursued by this Government at the present time will not solve the unemployeconomic ment problem; it will increase it. That is the point which was made by the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) earlier today. That point will remain unanswered by the Minister, it has remained unanswered by government state members opposite. What are the dimensions of the problem at which we are looking? In August this year estimated 332,800 people were unemployed looking for full time work. They represent 6.2 cent of the fulltimelabour force. Another 63,200 people were unemployed and looking for part time work. They represent 6.3 per cent of the part time labour force. The real situation is far worse than the formal statistics suggest. Many have given up looking for work because they expired. know that none is available. Thousands of young people, married women and men approaching retiring age have simply dropped out of the labour force. Over the past the number of involuntary retirements from the work force has been of the order of250,000. The real level of unemployment in Australia is therefore close to 650,000 people. This level of unemployment strikes disproportionately at those most vulnerable to social and economic disruption-the poor, the unskilled and semiskilled, members of certain ethnic groups. worse hit will be our young people. When one examines the estimates for this that Department-the y are simply a reflection of this Government's total economic strategy-on e sees that they contain nothing which will go anyto where near solving the economic problems that ation fund. exist in this society. So long as this Government continues with the sort of perpetual pohtical handouts which are made on an almost daily basis by the Prime Minister and by his Ministers, so long as a disproportionate amount of blame is placed upon the work force of this community and upon the trade union movement, so long as for- the Government is engaged on an almost daily basis in attacks upon the trade union movement, I do not beheve that there is any way at all that what is contained in these estimates will go anywhere near solving the problem. This Government is absolutely devoid of anything resembling a coherent manpower pohcy. It locked into a mythical view of how the private system works. It might well find that in that view would have been relevant in the 1890s; it will certainly not be relevant, given the economic problems we will have to face, in the 1980s. Perhaps at some stage we as a community will have to face up to the very real problem that systems have to meet the needs of people who live in a society and that people do not have to be made to conform to the prevailing economic system by way of the creation of huge as dole queues. This system is in a considerable of crisis. What is needed is for a far more realistic and far more rational discussion to take place than we are likely to have in this Parliament. That is perceived and understood by thouan sands of working people throughout Austraha. and Certainly nothing has emanated from the per Government side of the House which will give them confidence and there is nothing in these estimates which will give them confidence.",105

I refer, of course, to the question of unemployment. We have been told by numerous speakers on the side of the House that for members of the Government to aUude to that catastrophic history that befeU this nation between 1972 and 1974 was just an aberration, part of our imagination, and not to be taken seriously. I wtil not shout on this occasion as members of the Opposition are shouting and I would be grateful if they would perhaps just sit back and listen to the facts of the situation. Five actions which were taken during that period must be seen in the context of the present major unemployment situation. These are as follows: the upward valuation of the dollar in December 1972, the across the board tariff cuts of 25 per cent in July 1973, the massive wage cost increases in 1974, the reaction of that Government towards any serious attempt at increasing the degree of foreign investment in Australia's productive capacity and, for good measure, record interest rates and a record rate of inflation which had not faced this country smce the 1880s. Mr Barry Jones-No, 1951.",106
236,Mr CONNOLLY,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"For the few months during the Korean War. Let us keep the situation in context. The position, therefore, is that we are today trying to rebutid an economy which, by the end of 1974, by any reasonable yardstick was in a catastrophic situation. The improvements for which we are looking are stUl not as satisfactory as we would Uke them to be. But we cannot create a miracle overnight and what we had during that time, combined with the international reaUties, such as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' decision to raise oU prices by some hundreds of per cent, a major fall in consumer demand by the main European Economic Community markets, had a considerable impact on Australia's capacity to produce and capacity to seU. These situations are still with us today. The EEC countries are stUl groping to find a new formula, a new way, of overcoming these major economic problems which the developed world has faced over the last five years. A continual faU in the value of the United States dollar, for example, is not only creating problems in terms of the balance of trade for countries such as AustraUa",107

He has not even given me the opportunity to rule on the point of order raised by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. All he has done is to cut down his own speaking time. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports has raised a point of order that the honourable member for Bradfield is not speaking to the terms of the debate. A certain amount of latitude has been allowed to aU speakers by the Chair. I ask the honourable member for Bradfield to try to relate his remarks more than he has been doing to the estimates that are before us.,107
241,Mr CONNOLLY,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"If we take the figures for unemployment and analyse them to see exactly what areas in particular have the greatest problems in finding jobs at present, we find certain characteristics. These people lack skills; they lack work experience; they usuaUy have broken job histories; and, above aU, they have low levels of education. WhUe the honourable member opposite might accuse my colleague of bringing up this question, the fact is that the problem which is a major sociological one is not simply a question of reflating the economy and therefore making jobs. That sort of simplistic attitude got us into precisely the mess in which we are in today. Anyone who does not want to face that economic and historical reaUty has no right to sit in this chamber and say ostensibly that he is representing an electorate of the Australian people, people who, incidentaUy, have demonstrated a lot more common sense than he ever has.",107

243,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,I cannot rule in favour of the honourable member for Corio.,107
244,Mr CONNOLLY,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street) made a certain number of points when he made a stateis ment a few weeks ago- a very courageous scenstatement-whic h put to the Australian people the realities of the position facing us. He said that we were to try to achieve the pre-1974 situation in the labour market, we would be looking towards an increasing labour force as a result of immigration of some 20,000 people a year, a return to the pre-1974 trend in female participation rates, which is considerably below what it is now, no change in the participation of young people and education in the work force, respectively, and no normal additional participation following an increase in the demand for labour. The simple facts facing us are that we are at present seeing a demographic bulge which simply means that the young people who were born in the 1950s are now coming onto the labour market. That was a period of increased fertility in the Australian population which has not been equalled since those days. The problem we are facing is not only technological. There are people who would seriously suggest- I have heard it suggested from honourable members on the other side-that we should take a Luddite approach and destroy all the machinery and somehow or other turn back the historical process. The fact is that we will have to Uve with technology; we wtil have to Uve with the situation that unless we can make a significant improvement in the quaUty of our work force we will have to have a percentage of people who will not be employable hi the foreseeable future. The experience of the organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development-w e are now in the fortunate position of being able to learn from four years of experience if we wish to do so-ha s demonstrated that of programs directed at supporting young people and, for that matter, all sections of the community, must be directed at two levels. Firstly, they must be directed at job support, job creation and work experience. Those three major areas must be regarded in this context. To date the Government has introduced the Community Youth Support scheme which, in a sense, has been very successful. Perhaps some of the problems faced by this type of program are caused because it is monoUthic. It lacks some gree of flexibUity. There is a case for such flexibUity to be introduced. If the OECD, experience is to be followed- I recommend that it should be foUowed-wha t we will need and wtil see over the next year or so is an increased number of community-based schemes which would have incorporated in them a close affinity with community groups, social welfare organisations, local government, et cetera. Fundamentally, unless we can assist communities to have sufficient capacity to create employment opportunities it is no good sitting in Canberra and somehow being able to say that the rest of Australia will do as it is told. That is not how this nation has ever worked. In the next few weeks the Federal Government will be entering into significant negotiations with the States to enable them to spend funds which are gained on the international loan market and which wiU be directed at job creation. Members on both sides of this House have made the point that perhaps more funds should be spent in capital works programs which are directed at job creation. Mr Armitage-Why don't you do it?",107
245,Mr CONNOLLY,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"If the honourable member would listen to what I have just said, I wtil repeat it. The negotiations which are about to be entered mto with the States are precisely directed at allowing them to borrow funds on the international money market which they may then invest in capital works projects within their areas of administration. That is where the problem will be solved, not in Canberra. It will be solved at the grass roots of the Australian people. The major factor that we need is to make the Austrahan people appreciate the immensity of the problem and, from their appreciation, we can work together at finding solutions. It is no good simply standing on top of the pUe and saying that other people must do as they are told. The Austrahan people have overcome greater problems its in the past and will certainly, as a nation, find solutions to them in the present.",108
246,Mr ARMITAGE,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"We are deaUng tonight with the estimates for the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, yet where is the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street)? We wtil tonight almost, if not absolutely, complete consideration of these estimates, yet the Minister has not even shown his face in the Committee. Where is he? This shows how much concern that man has for his own Department. It shows how ashamed he is of the poUcies that he has to imde- plement in his Department on behalf of his Government. That little man has to implement the poUcies dictated by none other than the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. Where is the Minister? Why is he not in this Parliament tonight to answer the criticisms that have been made of his Department? Instead, we have in the chamber one of the most junior Ministers, the Minister for Environment, Housmg and Community Development (Mr Groom), dealing with one of the most important issues facing this country, that of unemployment.

His faUure to do so is a disgrace to this Parliament; it is a disgrace to this Government. I repeat, this is a cruel, heartless, dishonest and dishonourable Government. The Minister himself knows that and is frightened to come in here and face up to the criticisms that have been levelled here tonight. The honourable member for Burke (Mr Keith Johnson) earlier tonight mentioned the Speaker of this Parliament. After all, Mr Deputy Chairman, he is one of our colleagues. You, as a Deputy Chairman of Committees, and I , as a Deputy Chairman of Committees, have respect for the Speaker of the Parliament. In the Liberal Party room yesterday he was outspokenly critical of this Government.",109
249,Mr HODGMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,I rise on a point of order. Unless the honourable member has recently joined the Liberal Party-whic h we would not accept-h e does not know what was said in the party room yesterday.,109

251,Mr ARMITAGE,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"The honourable member for Denison (Mr Hodgman) was not in the House earlier tonight when that matter was referred to by the honourable member for Burke and when the honourable member for Diamond VaUey (Mr N. A. Brown) confirmed that these discussions did occur in the Liberal Party room yesterday. They were not denied. The honourable member has confirmed by his very words, and the whole intonation of his address and interjections, that it happened; that is, that the Speaker of the Parhament, because of the importance of this issue to the nation, stood aside and entered into the poltiical controversy surrounding the economic policies of this Government, stating that it was time that more funds were pumped into the pubUc sector so as to revive employment in this country. When that happens, when the divisions within the Government are so great that a Speaker has to come out, come away from the traditions of the position of Speaker and enter the party fray, we know how serious the position is. I represent an area of the outer western suburbs of Sydney which has one of the highest rates, if not the highest rate, of unemployment in the whole of the country. It is suffering from the pohcies of this Governments, cruel, heartless policies which take no cognisance of the need to do something for the future generation, the young people of today. Look at the patchwork of programs that the Government is introducing. I am surprised at the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly). We often have quiet, personal chats and I am surprised to hear tonight that the honourable member for Bradfield would back up the Community Youth Support scheme. I ask him not to run out of the House. I am not going to embarrass him. I am surprised that he stands up for the Community Youth Support scheme. He knows as well as I do that it is a patchwork scheme which is not really domg very much for the people of this country, particularly the young people. Mr Bourchier- I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Chairman.",109
252,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"Mr Martin)Before the honourable member for Bendigo raises his point of order. I remind all honourable members, including the honourable member for Bendigo, that there is a difference between a point of order and a pomt for debate.

253,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,That is not a point of order.,109
254,Mr ARMITAGE,DEFINED URBAN SECTOR,"Quite contrary to the attitude of the vast majority of Government members, I have continued to chair the local electorate committee for CYSS in my electorate. That is more than the vast majority of Government members have done. The minutes of that committee-the y are available for public dissemination-recor d my qualifications. I am recorded as having stated that it is a patchwork scheme which does not measure up to the requirements in overcoming this massive problem of youth unemployment, particularly in the outer western suburbs of Sydney. I am particularly concerned that this scheme is too often loosely administered. I hope that one of these days the honourable member for Bradfield, as Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, might look at that aspect. Tonight we heard the honourable member for Bradfield mention that now there are proposals for what he called a job creation scheme. That is a new term for it; it is no longer called an unemployment relief scheme. He said that the Government is giving consideration to such a proposal. We read that in the newspapers two days ago.

Then we might have a worthwhUe scheme, a scheme which would help to overcome unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, in this country and we would do something worth whtie for the nation. Instead of that the Government is continuing to play around with these patchwork proposals, such as the Community Youth Support Scheme and the Special Youth Employment Training Program. Under that program the Government pays an employer to employ a kid for a few months and at the end of that he gets the sack and aU his human expectations are destroyed overnight because the employer is using greed instead of acting hi accordance with the intent of the program, which is to give the kid a job, train him for that job and keeping him in that job.

258,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",110
259,Mr BARRY JONES,ADJOURNMENT," I want to draw the attention of the House to the deaths of two of the most remarkable women in the history of the Australian cinema, Paulette and PhyUis MCDonagh. Their achievement has been undeservedly forgotten, and I want it to be recorded by the national Parliament. There were three MCDonagh sisters, all born in the first decade of this century, the daughters of a Sydney doctor. They grew up under the influence of Hollywood films, spent many hours watching and anlaysing them and finally decided, with fiercely independent spirit, to take on the United States industry and produce their own films. The eldest sister-Isobell e MCDonagh, Mrs Charles Stewart-wa s an actress who performed under the name of Marie Lorraine. She is still living in England. Paulette MCDonagh was director and principal writer and died on 29 August 1978. The youngest sister, PhyUis MCDonagh, was business manager, publicist and art director. She died two days ago, on 17 October. They produced four feature films-Thos e who Love made in 1926; The Far Paradise made in 1928; The Cheaters made in 1930; and Two Minutes Silence made in 1933. The first and last of these films are now lost- a mournful indication of the poor archival holdings of our important films. Apart from their four feature films, the sisters also produced documentaries. Their films were amazingly inexpensive. They often made effective use of interiors in their famtiy home, Drummoyne House. Their films secured release in England. Their last two features were talkies. Their style was naturalistic and they stressed the importance of the low-keyed cinema style of actmg in contrast to the more flamboyant stage style. I invite honourable members to consider the audacity of these young women and the enormous odds they overcame. AU their films were box office successes and critical successes as well. In the 1930s the three sisters leftfilmproduction. Isobelle married and went to England; Phyllis moved to NZ. For 40 years they were ignored. They never received any official recognition; no OBEs or AMs were pushed in their direction. However, on 19 August 1978, in Perth, at the Austrahan Film Awards presented by the Austrahan Film Institute, Phyllis MCDonagh- Mr s Leo O'Brien-accepte d the Raymond Longford Award on behalf of the three sisters in recognition of their pioneering work in Austrahan film production. I would like to refer to their last film Minutes Silence, which was based on a play the late Leslie Haylen, who was MHR for Parkes between 1943 and 1966. That film had premiere in Canberra before an audience of liamentarians at the Capital Theatre on October 1933-jus t 45 years ago this week. William Morris Hughes wrote the introduction to the book of the film and called it 'a considerable achievement'. The poet Kenneth Slessor wrote: 'The treatment is surprisingly free from banality whole effect is one of beauty and strength'. As I remarked earUer, the film is now lost. Perhaps a copy of it is lying forgotten in a cellar or garage somewhere. I think it would be a fitting memorial to the MCDonagh sisters if it could be found. I hope that the Minister for Home Affairs (Mr Ellicott) might take up the cause- a very important cause-of looking for Australia's lost films. There are very many lostfilmsin our relatively short film history, and they are reaUy part of the national heritage. They have just been lost through neglect, and I think it is important that we do what we can to find them. I hope that the Minister might circulate aU Ubraries, museums, schools and pubUc institutions with hsts of those missing items in our brief film heritage. Sad to say, even the Raymond Longford Award this year did not generate any interest in the remarkable achievements of the MCDonagh sisters, and their deaths were ignored by the media. They deserve far better recognition than that. I think that we ought to be ashamed, as a nation, of the neglect that we often hand out to our pioneers.",110
260,Mr DRUMMOND,ADJOURNMENT," Mr Deputy Speaker, the Australian Conservation Foundation, which last year was funded by the Federal Government to the tune of $150,000 or 45 per cent of the Foundation's budget, is the subject about which I would Uke to speak tonight. This organisation is developing a definite trend of preservation rather than conservation. Its solutions to the unemployment problem created by its actions in opposing any development would appear to be to promote the concept of labour-intensive industries. It is economic idiocy unless-and this is the sigmficant pointone beUeves in Marxist solutions to economic difficulties. It is the labour-intensive industries in Australia today which are in the most trouble. Yet the Marxist leadership of the extreme Left promotes this as an economic solution. At the same time, it seeks to shut down some of our niining industries and other development industries within Australia which keep our economy afloat. Is it an accident that the Australian Conservation Foundation has estabhshed an organTwo isation caUed Conservationists for Full Employby ment under the chairmanship of our best known communist, Jack Mundey? It is all so simple: its Sabotage employment and export earnings parunder the guise of conservation and rebuUd the 18 shattered economy on Marxist Unes. What has happened to the Australian Conservation Foundation is a classic example of the politicisation of non-government organisations by dedicated Left wing extremists who know how to manipulate and the genuine, if impracticable, ideaUsts. The concept of the Australian Conservation Foundation is not unsound. There is a valued place for responsible, objective organisations concerned with sensible environmental management-and I say that as the representative of one of the most stunningly beautiful areas in Australia. But to fund the Australian Conservation Foundation in its present state is to mock the unemployed and in particular, is to mock this Government. Would you believe, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this organisation which could not survive without Federal Government fundingtaxpayers ' money-ha s the audacity to take out a writ in the High Court of Australia against the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development (Mr Groom) with regard to the tourist development at Yeppoon in Queensland. What a cheek! One sometimes wonders just what the heck we are on about. Earlier this year an inquiry was initiated by the Austrahan Government into Austraha's involvement in whaUng. Cheyne Beach Whaling Co., which is a legitimate Australian enterprise operating under a licence issued by the Australian Government and complying with international standards as set down by the International Whahng Commission-it is Australia's only whaUng company-foun d that it had to defend its position against the conservationists-in particular, against Project Jonah, which was offered and has been given funding by the Federal Government to the tune of $25,000 of taxpayers' money. It is true that similar funding has been offered to other organisations. I trust that the Cheyne Beach Whaling Co. will also be given the same amount. I know that it has cost the company far more than that amount to defend its position, which, as I have said, is to run a legitimate licensed enterprise under this Australian Government.",111
261,Mr CARLTON,ADJOURNMENT," I draw to the attention of the House tonight the speech made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) to the annual conference of the Local Government Association of New South Wales. For some time. I have been looking at these speeches made by the Leader of the Opposition to various gatherings. I thought it might be useful, over a period, just to draw the attention of people to the things that he might say because by the time we get round to holding another election, an edition of the various undertakings made by him might be of some interest to the voters of this nation. The ladies and gentlemen of local government are fairly hard-headed people and know exactly what balancing a budget is all about and they are not Ukely to be taken in by some of the nonsense that is mcluded in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. I quote directly from the Leader of the Opposition, who said: In 1973, direct financial support was provided for local government in the nauonal Budget as part of a firm, coherent and expanding program. It certainly was expanding. In 1973 the increase in Budget outlays over the previous year some 20 per cent and in the following crease was 45.9 per cent over the outlays for 1973-74.1 seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a smaU table of increases over this period. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsYear 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 (estimated)",112
262,Mr CARLTON,ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the House. Having made this statement about the firm, coherent expanding program, the Leader of the Opponotice sition in fact said that he had some regrets. said that the initiatives the Labor Government took in providing grants to local government through the Grants Commission on a needs basis was not a good initiative. He has decided, it seems, in the future to avoid this mistake and to give a basic grant with a topping-up provision. That is an interesting admission. The situation that occurred during the Labor Government's term of office led to all sorts of difficulty in local government. Later in his speech to this same body the Leader of the Opposition said: . . . local government is better able to assess community needs than Canberra bureaucrats . . . there is no co-ordination between the various funding agencies . . . to gain a grant under the present system it is the articulate rather than the deserving who do best at the expense of the less articulate . . . and, of course, the system is wide open to pork barrelling or, if you prefer, political patronage. I would say that that is an absolutely correct description of what happened under the Labor Government's approach to local government. We are now to believe that the Leader of the Opposition is to take up the present policy of this Government on local government. The difficulty is that by the way he was .talking to this body he seemed to be indicating that there wtil be a vast expansion of revenues not related to a percentage of Federal tax revenues but on a generally increasing base. He seems to hold out.on the one hand to the representatives of local government that they will get a great deal more money and yet at other meetings and gatherings where he is speaking to taxpayers and ratepayers he indicates that somehow or other they will pay less was rates and taxes than they would under the year the inpresent Government. He criticises the present Government for giving to local government in direct grants under the present formula an increase of only 8.5 per cent over the previous year. The increase of approximately 8.5 per cent is greater by far than the estimated increase in prices over the year and it Increase in Budget outlays therefore represents a real increase to local over previous year government. It is also only part of the Government's commitment to increase the funding of percent 12.6 local government to 2 per cent of tax revenues. 20.0 Yet this 8.5 per cent increase is considered by the 45.9 Leader of the Opposition to be insufficient, and 22.5 impUed in his speech is a promise of a great in10.4 crease to local government independently of tax11.1 7.7 ation revenues to the Commonwealth. The speech should be examined carefully together with other speeches by the Leader of the Oppoand sition over the forthcoming two years. I give that I wtil be watching these carefully and He adding up the promises as time passes so that each of the audiences addressed by the honourable gentleman will know exactly what to expect at the end of this period.",112
263,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to raise a matter which is of considerable concern to me personally and which should be of concern to the Parliament. That is the staffing of the parhamentary committees. I do not want to raise a specific matter but the method by which staffing is arrived at, the manner in which staff is aUocated and the effect that the abUity of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) or the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to place railings on that staff has on the freedom of the Parliament to carry out its function. There have been and wtil continue to be problems because of staff ceUings and because of the need for staff to be added to the general committee staff. As I see it, because of the staff ceiting arrangements there is also a serious problem of conflicts between the domestic or the single House committees operated by a House, the joint committees which are assigned to a House and the general staff avaUable to the Departments of the Senate or the House of Representatives. At the moment the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has a total of nine staff members. This may seem to be an adequate staff if one ignores the fact that the Committee is carrying out four separate investigations through subcommittees, all of which have substantial work loads. The Defence sub-committee, for instance, has an extremely heavy work load but a staff of two. Senators believe that their domestic committees are understaffed and at least some have suggested that it should be within the capacity of the President to reduce the number of staff on the joint committees and to allocate that staff to the Senate committees. That legitimate claim by senators highUghts the conflict that exists. There are two separate arrangements for committeesfor those estabUshed by a single House and for those established on a joint basis and allocated to a House for administration. There are a couple of other committees that are not administered by either House. But by the imposition of staff ceUings a committee can be rendered almost impotent through staff not being avaUable to enable it to adequately perform its functions. If this Parhament is to inquire into anything relative to a major pubUc service or community activity it must have backup research and staff facUities. It cannot have those facUities if the Executive has the right to overrule the Parliament in respect of the resource support that is avaUable to the Parhament to enable it to carry out the tasks it feels should be undertaken. I make one other point. I do not believe it is appropriate, even if the existing system continues, for the staff of joint committees, of domestic committees of a single House and of the House itself to be lumped under one staff ceUing. There ought to be an appropriation for staff of joint committees in accordance with the decisions of the two Houses of Parliament to estabUsh those committees. Such committees are estabUshed by decision of the two Houses and their staff should be separate from the staff of either House even though the committees' staff may be administered by one or other House. It is not possible to deal at length with a matter such as this on an adjournment debate. I would Uke a discussion of what I see to be an important need for reform of the whole system under which we operate. The system is rendered almost impotent because of the limitations I have described, as well as other restrictions. There is also the fact that the two Houses seem to be competing with one another for a single role. I have prepared a paper which I believe can form the basis for discussion of the activities of the two Houses and the manner in which they should operate. I do not have time to read the paper into Hansard. I therefore seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard so that honourable members can read it and comment on it. I hope that the paper will at least start some discussion of the manner in which this Parliament might make itself an effective decision. Leave granted. The document read asfoUowsNA A discussion paper on the future development of Parliamentaiy Government of the Commonwealth by Gordon G. Scholes, M.P. The present structure At present, the two House structure with differing terms of office and electoral base, but mirroring and competing with each other for status and authority, constitutes a source of instability which can and has made effective government impossible and rendered the electorate impotent. The result of an election can because of the differing electorates and methods of election, result in a different result in each House, despite an exactly similar actual vote i.e. the 1974 double dissolution elected a Labor majority in the House ofRepresentatives, but a tied Senate. The overhang in normal elections of half the Senate, supposedly to give continuity in the Senate, in fact distorts the wish of the electorate, where it seeks to remove an incumbent majority. Proportional representation hasremovedthe possibility of a complete or substantial change at a single election. The majority of senators being subject only to the will of their Party, rather than the electorate, only 12 of the 64 senators face a significant electoral risk. Thus, the continuity question is irrelevant. While Government Members and Senators may affect Executive decision, the non-Executive Members of each House play only a minor and substandally ineffective role actual law making and the decision making process. Not since 1937 has a Government been defeated by a vote of elected Members of any Australian Parliament where that Government enjoyed majority support at the time ofelection in its own right. It is improbable that a reversal of the power of decision making concentration will take place, nor will effective liamentary control develop without significant changes in approach, attitude and the relationship of the the Parliament. On both pracucai and equity grounds the concept of a basic equal component of the Parliament being elected by proportional representation should be accepted and any proposal for reform of the system should include a major inthen volvement of the Senate, but with a role different from the House of Representatives. The intended role of the Senate was to protect the rights of the States, however, this has not occurred. If the boundaries of the areas from which senators are chosen bore ship to State boundaries, the composition and operation of the Senate would be as it is now, on poltiical, not geographical allegiances. In a two House situation it is a waste of resources for the functions to be duplicated. The division of a single function between the two Houses, diminishes both and weakens their effectiveness. A House of Review and a House of Government is the theory, but not the practice. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives are Houses of Government, with the Senate Committees as the only concession to a review function. This could be changed to provide each House with a sepwould arate and different function. Proposals All Ministers should be located and chosen from the House of Representatives. The House should be required to recommend by resolution the Members who will serve as Ministers of State. Except immediately when a Ministry may be nominated to serve until the first meeting of the House (prior to the address at the opening). This would mean that all Government business would arise in the House ofRepresentatives. Ministers would attend in the Senate for Questions on a roster basis, (A Question Time structure similar to that of the House of Commons, i.e. Questions on Notice followed by a series of supplementary questions would seem more practical than questions without notice). Bills and Ministerial statements would be introduced and dealt with by the Minister in charge of the Bill, or another Minister designated. This format is used in the Indian Parliament and Standing Orders for a limited Ministerial exchange were approved by the House of Representatives Standing Orders Committee in 1974-73 but not dealt with by the House. The Senate Committee system should be developed for a continuing examination of all aspects of Commonwealth activity, responsibUity and administration. The structure, staffing arrangements, funding and other arrangements would be the exclusive right of the Senate. (Each Committee should have its own annual allocation). Appropriations initiated by the passage through the Senate of a resolution requesting the Governor General to request an appropriation of a specified amount for the purposes of the Senate (The Speaker, President, and Governorin General would constitute the Executive Council for Parliamentary Questions). Senate Committee Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen should have a status and staff substantiaUy the same as for a Minister (Chairman) and Deputy Party Leader, (Vice Chairman). Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen should be chosen from a Parpanel elected by the Senate in a proportional ballot (The method of election should elect one candidate at each stage, Executive to irrespective of quotas obtained. The candidate with the greatest number of votes would be elected and a quota deducted from the elected candidates surplus, which would then be transfered at the appropriate value. The candidate with the highest number of votes would be elected. This would repeat until the number required is elected). Chairmen and Vice-Chairmen would be appointed in accordance with their order ofelection. The positions of Leader and Deputy Leader of the Government and Opposition, would be replaced by majority no relationand minority Leader and Deputies. The Senate would retain its power to initiate legislation from either private members or its committees. BUls requiring an appropriation would be transmitted to the House of Representatives as a request for legislation. The request to include the form of the Bill requested. (The House of Representatives should be required to inform the Senate of its intention regarding the Senate request within a specified period). The withdrawal of Ministers would have the effect of eliminating the initiation of Government business in the Senate. The role of Committees and their status would change the emphasis of the Chamber to that of a House of Review. It also tend to reduce the political nature of the Senate's activities and require a major contribution from Senators to estabUsh and justify the new role. The changes to the Senate Practice and function could all be achieved without alteration to the Constitution, by agreement between the Houses on a comprehensive Parliament Act and changes to the respective standing orders. following an election, House of Representatives The House ofRepresentatives would also be substantially altered in practice by the changed role of the Senate, and the emphasis placed on review and investigation by the Senate. (Joint Committees would probably prove impractical.) The Government would operate totally within the framework of the House ofRepresentatives. All Ministers would be members of that House. All Policy statements and initiatives would originate in the House of Representatives, and all appropriations would be initiated from the House ofRepresentatives. This would, because of its inherent majority support in the House of Representatives, ensure Executive control over expenditures, etc. It would also under existing arrangements introduce an even greater dominance over the Chamber by the Ministry. As it would be anticipated that the Senate would spend a much lower proportion of its time on current legislation, this function should be undertaken by Members of the House of Representatives. A system of plenary sessions for major debate and final passage of legislation, together with a number of Legislative Committees to which Bills, Statements, etc. would automatically be referred for consideration at all stages. It may be that Committees of varying numbers could give a more effective forum for of proposed legislation, and Ministerial statements and reports to the House from both internal and external sources. Reasonable alternatives would seem to be, say SO members and/or 25 members which would deal with matters referred by the House. The larger Committee would be used where it is considered appropriate by the especially where major policy or social change were involved. A number of matters could smaller Committees. This would enable Members of business without significant extensions of sittingtimesor time spent in Canberra. Plenary sessions would highlight debate on major Bills and pohcy consideration. In addition, investigative committees in the expenditure, appropriation and other significant policy areas should continue. In such an arrangement it would be appropriate to establish a Business Committee consisting of The Speaker, or his Deputy, The Leader of the House, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition or his nominee, and the Party Whips. Where more than one Party forms the Government, an extra Opposition Member would be appointed. The Business Committee would make recommendations to the House on the method of nary sessions, full debate, part debate, then reference to a major or minor Legislative Committee. Initial consideration and report from a Legislative Committee either major or minor or to an investigative (i.e. Select Committee). The rights of the Opposition to have matters it considers of major importance debated in Plenarary session would be protected by providing for a small number of objections (say 5 per cent or 10 per cent of the total membership of the House) to overrule a motion to refer any stage of a motion to a Committee. A similar provision should exist to refer a question back to plenary session of the House at any stage. The House would set maximum periods for a Committee to report on a matter referred. This should not be less than three sitting weeks unless agreed to by leave. The Committees should not be subject to Umits of time procedures nor should closure motions be accepted by the Chair, unless in the opinion of the Chair, members of the Committee have had adequate time for debate on a particular question. The avaUabUity of limitation of time in Plenary session only, would provide incentive for members to have legislation referred to Legislative Committees. To make this system genuinely effective as a means of alteration of the growing imbalance between the Executive and the Parliament, it would be necessary for changes in approach by political parties both inside and outside the Parliament. As a first step Umits should be placed on areas of Executive action. i.e. The Cabinet or Executive Council should be provided with defined functions and responsibilities by the Parliament. The Parliament should insist in the right to final determination of: International agreements or treaties entered into on behalf of Australia; policy and technical consideration agreements between the Commonwealth and the States, and agreement with commercial organisations, the appointment of: (A) Governor General. (B) Judges of the Federal Courts and Commissions. House for important legislation, (C) Heads of Government Departments. (D) Statutoiy authorities and corporations. by agreement be dealt with in Parliament should also have the right to reject nominees for Government Boards, et cetera. to deal with a greater volume Limits should also be placed on the level of commitment of funds prior to appropriation of the required funds for the specific purpose. Continuing appropriations should be examined regularly by an appropriate House Committee at not more than 3 yearly intervals and a report made to the House re same. At present the major expenditures of the Government are not subject to appropriation requests at regular intervals. Thus the Parliament has no effective means of scrutiny. The House ofRepresentatives should have its own appropriation of funds which would be under the control of the Speaker acting on advice of the House Committee, which would have its authority expanded to include responsibility for the House of Representatives administration as an Executive function. dealing with business i.e. pleThe operation of the Parliamentary complex would be more efficient and effective if a single department of the parUament were established. The department under the ministerial authority of the Speaker and/or the President would be responsible for all functions other than those directly associated with the House, i.e. Questions under the direct authority of the Clerk and relative to the business of the Houses. All other functions would be carried out by the Department of the Parliament. Accommodation for Members of Parliament, Ministers, Committees, Transport, Equipment, Library and research, Hansard, Catering, Meeting rooms, et cetera, would be administered by a single department with separate functional sections. The administration at a political level would be answerable to a Committee drawn from each House which would advise the Presiding Officers, consider requests for appropriations and carry out the executive functions. The appropriation would be presented to the House ofRepresentatives by the Speaker. Each House would require an independent committee, administration and research unit comparable with say the Prime Minister's department. Members of Committees would need access to specialist advice, et cetera. This could probably be best achieved by the establishment of Party committee staff units which would also act in a reasearch capacity to Members on the relevant Parliamentaiy Committee. In areas of policy, not reserved for the Executive, Parliamentary Committees would be expected to cany out investigative work, collate deficiencies and/or prepare new or amending legislation for consideration by the Parhament. An examination of the Swedish Committee structure would prove useful. The functions and authority of Cabinet should be clearly defined in legislation. It should to give false or misleading information on matters within his authority. As an adjunct to parhamentaryrestructuring,public service arrangements should be altered to remove the position of Permanent Head, and its replacement with a term appointed Director, who if a permanent public servant, would hold the higher office only for the term of the appointment and unlessre-appointedwouldrevertto former grade. There could be validity in examining the introduction of the system of non-parliamentary Deputy or Vice-Ministers, who would serve under Ministers of State, be appointed by and answerable to Cabinet, for the implementation of policy and the administration of Ministerial authority delegated to the Vice-Minister with the approval ofParliament. The relationship to Parliament would be similar to a Parliamentary Under-Secretary rather than a permanent Head, and would thus be available liamentary Committees and if either House requires, to appear before the House or Legislative Committees. This format would also enable the Cabinet to be of manageable size, without removing the required level of political control over pohcy implementation, et cetera. It would permit the introduction by the Government of persons, whose technical competence or expertise are desired, without the need for a previous career in parhament. The reduction in the number of Ministers in the Parliament, would strengthen the parUament and lessen the grip of Ministers on the House of Representatives. The exclusive prerogative given to Ministers by the Standing Orders should be removed or at least reduced to a minimum. The right of Parliament to obtain information should be clearly set out in the Parliament Act. Also clear protection should be set out for public servants providing information to Parliament at the request ofParliament. It should be an offence for any pubUc servant to withhold requested information from Parliament. It should also be an offence for a senior officer or a Minister to direct that informationrequestedbe withheld. Where it is felt the national interest could best be served and/or national security requires information to be withheld, the Minister concerned should advise the relevant Presiding Officer in writing. If the Presiding Officer is not satisfied that the reasons for withholding requested information is not satisfactory, Cabinet should be asked to consider the Ministers reasons. tains the original position should be reported direct to the House concerned. There should be a Private Members day every 4th week, during sitting periods. The House should sit at 11.30 continue sitting through the midday meal period. On each Thursday the Leader of the Opposition should have available to him a period of 20 minutes to address the House on Opposition policy. The Speaker should have the authority to direct a Minister to make a statement to the House on a matter within his responsibiUty that has arisen or been released outside the House. Ministers making Statements to the House should be liable to be asked to explain or clarify the statement, by question from Members ofParliament for a reasonable period to be determined by the Speaker. be an offence for a Minister The success of changes of functions and procedures depends on the extent to which members are prepared to participate and contribute as individuals. It wiU alsorequirethat Governments demand unqualified support only on critical poUcy andfiscalmatters. SimUarly the Opposition should be selective on the matters to be officially opposed on a Party basis. This will be essential to the success of the changed role of the Senate.",113

268,Mr HODGMAN,PARLIAMENTARY REFORM,"I was endeavouringto make my remarks relevant, but I bow reluctantly and out of respect to your ruling I do not refer to the Notice of Motion. Is it in order to refer to an answer given in the House yesterday?",116
269,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PARLIAMENTARY REFORM,The honourable member is entided to refer in the adjournment debate to previous proceedings only if they are relevant to the subject introduced.,116
270,Mr HODGMAN,PARLIAMENTARY REFORM,"The answer I am about to refer to is definitely relevant to the subject. It is impossible to discuss the subject without referring to the answer given in the House yesterday by the Minister for Transport (Mr Nixon) to a question asked by me. I refer to page 1996 of Hansard. I asked the Minister for Transport what The Cabinet decision if it susthe situation would be with respect to the establishment of a direct Tasmania-New Zealand air service if an overseas carrier such as Qantas Airways Ltd or Air New Zealand Ltd was not prepared to institute such a service. I asked whether a.m. on each sitting day, and or not the Federal Government would be prepared to Ucence an Australian domestic airline operator to institute such a service. In summary of the answer, the Minister indicated that he had expressed considerable interest in the possibility of such a service, that he in fact had endeavoured to interest an operator to institute such a service and that the problem was that to date no person had indicated an interest in introducing such a service. In essence the Minister invited me to apply what persuasive powers I had to endeavour to find an operator who would be prepared to institute a direct Tasmania-New Zealand air service. I report very briefly to the House that I have accepted the Minister's challenge. I have taken positive steps. Indeed, I am taking steps which were originated some time ago to persuade an Australian domestic airline .operator to apply to the Federal Government for a licence to operate a direct service between Tasmania and New Zealand. A number of important people in the airline industry were in Canberra last night. Further discussions have continued by telephone today. Whilst it is still early days and I am not in a position to say anything definite, I feel sufficiently confident at this point to indicate that I beheve there is a chance that an Austrahan domestic operator and possibly one other may be prepared to institute a direct service between Tasmania and New Zealand. I beheve that the statistical information that is available to myself and my colleagues Senator Townley, the honourable member for FrarJdin (Mr Good luck), and the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr) is sufficient to justify at least a fortnightly service between Tasmania and New Zealand and possibly a weekly service. It would seem that the obvious port in New Zealand into which such a service would be directed is Christchurch. Hobart Airport or Launceston Airport would be suitable for the initiation of such a service. It is also a matter of common knowledge that it may well be possible to institute what would be a triangular service between Hobart, New Zealand and Melbourne. In other words, the flight could travel via Melbourne each trip or alternatively it could be a direct service. This is a matter of considerable importance. Recent statistics indicate that New Zealand provides the bulk of Australia's tourist intake. That is an important point to note. My complaint is that not enough New Zealanders have been getting down to Tasmama. I place on record my gratitude to the Minister for his enthusiasm. I hope that if an Austrahan domestic airUne operator makes such an appUcation to operate a direct service between Tasmania and New Zealand the New Zealand Government wtil co-operate and we wtil not see a dog-in-themanger attitude by the New Zealand Government, Qantas or Air New Zealand. It could be a tremendous breakthrough for Tasmania's tourist mdustry. I applaud the support of the Minister and hope that the chaUenge he offered to me in the chamber yesterday wtil be recognised, acknowledged and acted upon within the next few days.",116
271,Mr HOWE,PARLIAMENTARY REFORM," I refer briefly to the subject of industrial safety and health in Australia with particular reference to the nature of the Australian work force which is increasingly multi-cultural. The statistics avaUable clearly indicate the enormity of the problem. For example, the Department of Productivity, using census and compensation figures, states that in an average year there are 300 deaths from accidents at work, 350,000 temporary disabiUties and over one mUUon man weeks lost each year. Compensation returns indicate that $ 1,000m is lost each year through lost wages and salaries. The safety institute estimates that up to $5,000m is lost through wages, lost production and damage. The Department of Productivity also estimates that, on average, approximately three times as much time is lost because of accidents and tilnesses than is lost because of industrial disputes. In an earUer speech I discussed the problems of the various pieces of legislation which exist within the Commonwealth and the States. This legislation is often inconsistent and, overall, it is not doing much to deal with the immense problem to which I have just referred. One recent initiative which has been taken has been an attempt by the Commonwealth Government to implement a code of general principle concerning occupational safety and health in Australian Government employment. This code was developed by a committee from concerned government departments, from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, from the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations and from inspectors of State labour departments. Earlier this year the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced that Commonwealth departments and factories would implement the code as soon as they were able, thereby giving a lead to both private industries and to State government industries. The code is an attempt to provide overaU guideUnes for all industries. It has been largely based on recent experience in the development of occupational health and safety legislation in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Sweden and other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Being based on these experiences, the code has adopted the broad findings and tenets of such recent acts, emphasising the need for involvement and cooperation of all parties concerned with safety and health. The foreword to the code sets out the basis for this by stating: Maximum safety cannot be ensured by control of the environment alone but demands the understanding and cooperation of all persons at all levels. It continues: The code provides not only for the control of environment, but for the training, consultation between management and employees and their maximum involvement in all accident prevention measures. This code, if implemented, would provide a good basis on which to develop a healthier and safer work environment. The most serious problem, however, is the lack of recognition given by the code to the multi-cultural diversity of our work force. The code states that to effectively control safety and prevent accidents, in effect all workers must be involved and consulted, and must understand procedures. However, the code does not acknowledge who these workers are. Statistics from the United Nations Demographic Handbooks, 1973-76, show that, outside Israel, Austraha today has the most diverse work force of all modern, industrialised countries. For example, 39 per cent of the present population of Austraha has either been born overseas or at least has one parent of overseas origin. Nearly 20 per cent of Australia's population are persons of non-Anglo Saxon origin. Migrant males in the work force from non-Anglo Saxon countries tend to be concentrated in manufacturing industries. For example, in the 1971 census we find that some 48 per cent Yugoslav born, 48 per cent Greek born, 37 per cent Italian born and 35 per cent German born work in manufacturing industry, compared with 19 per cent of all Australian ted. born and 28 per cent of United Kingdom male next at 3 p.m. workers. As Lever has pointed out: The proportion of migrants in certain, mainly low status manual occupations, is rising faster than is their proportion in the population. Austrahan and British born are leaving these jobs while non-British migrants are either entering them, staying in them or leaving them more slowly than are Australian or British workers. The key pomt of this is that in developing industrial safety and health poUcies in Australia we must constantly be aware that the work force is so diverse. Non-English speaking migrants increasingly form the basis of manufacturing and construction industries. A recent study carried the physical out by the Centre for Urban Research and Action mto a particular mdustry shows some of the problems. It showed that in this particular industry, which mvolved hard, dirty and manual labour, 58 per cent of the workers surveyed had lost time through accidents. Most accidents happened to people in their first 12 months of work. Employees with the least experience tended to be the most recently arrived migrants and to suffer the most accidents. WhUst one would have to generaUy support the proposed code for occupational health and safety in Australia, it is important that the code take account of the measures which I have been suggesting. In line with this pomt I suggest that all communication, induction and training needs to be multi-Ungual. Health and safety information must be passed on to workers in their own language. More appropriate safety, induction and training sessions should be established for migrant workers. EngUsh language training on the job should be provided as a right to aU non-EngUsh speaking workers. These courses should involve workers and btiingual educationalists so that the most relevant material is used.",117

The Division of Soils has carried out surveys in parts of South Australia to provide information about the distribution of soils with salt in their carrying out research concerned with the reclamation and use of salt-affected soils, with irrigation methods and soil salinity, with the behaviour of salt compounds in soils, and with the measurement of soil salinity. The Division of Horticultural damental research into the effects of salinity on plant processes such as photosynthesis. At the Division's Merbein research station, emphasis has recently been placed on evaluating the effects of salinity on the performance of perennial horticultural crops and developing salt-tolerant crop varieties. The Division of Irrigation Research has worked out methods of farming irrigated rice-growing soils in rotation with the rice crop to minimise the effect of salt in the root zone. The Division has worked on the origin of salt and its movement in the environment. Researchers have worked on ways of detaching soil salinity slugs in river systems and have surveyed the soil salinity balance of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Areas. They have also studied the movement of salt in clay soils used forricegrowing using water from the MIA.
