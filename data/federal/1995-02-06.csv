2,Mr MARTYN EVANS,DELEGATION REPORT,"I present the report of the, Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 15th ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisain tion-AIPO-Conference, incorporatipg visits bilateral visits to the Republic of Singapore and the Republic of Indonesia, 12 September to 1 October 1994. I was accompanied on trip by my colleague the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor), the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper). and Baden Teague, who served as the deputy leader of the delegation. I place on record appreciation of the cooperation which was extended to me and to all members of the able delegation by the delegation itself. i think group worked very well together and it a very constructive and positive delegation trip. I also place on record the delegation's thanks to the secretary, Mr Cleaver Elliott from the Senate, who performed his duties ciuring the whole of the trip in an excellent manner. The delegation was most grateful for the considerable work which Cleaver did in terms of the administrative details and the many complex arrangements which had to be undertaken. The delegation took in three countries on this visit, one before the AIPO Conference in Manila and one after. Our initial visit was Singapore. At the outset I indicate to House the very strong and warm relationship which exists between Singapore and Australia Our two countriesÂ·have a great deal in comthe mon in this region. We have many interests which relate well to one another in terms our further development of business and trade in the South-East Asian and broader Asian regions. With our combined interests in matters like APEC, AIPO and ASEAN, these areas can be of considerable benefit to both countries in terms of future developments. The delegation was received by the Speaker the Singapore parliament and other members of the parliament. The hospitality which was extended to members of the delegation was very well appreciated. We had an opportunity to visit any of Singapore's ministers of state whom we requested to meet. Extensive discussions took place not only with those but with members of parliament. A broad range of visits was also arranged to further business opportunities. For example, the computer sphere, we made a number of to industries and government agencies. The delegation visited harbour and port facilities-which are very extensive in Singathe pore and about which I will say more in a moment-transport, trade union and tourist facilities. Meetings with a wide range of Senator community groups were arranged by Australia's High Commissioner to Singapore my at a reception at his residence. I think that wide range of activities allowed us considerflexibility in that period not only to see the a broad range of Singapore's business and was community activity but also to come to a good understanding of the future relationship between our two countries and where that could be best developed. We should not underestimate the value of joint ventures with Singapore in relation to business activities or at a government to government level. It is a very similar society to ours in its development of technology and some of the cultural issues. I think our two nations can gain a lot by working together in opening up new ventures in China and throughout the ASEAN region. One aspect which I would particularly like to to touch on was our visit to the Changi the memorial. This being Australia Remembers year-50 years after Second World War-I . think it was very appropriate that we visited Changi memorial and that the delegation made some recommendations about it. Both of the Singapore government and voluntary groups in Singapore have maintained a very poignant and touching memorial at Changi to the episode of Japanese occupation during World War II. It was a very difficult time for many Australian and other servicemen imprisoned there, as well as for the Singapore population as a whole. The memorial is a well maintained and very appropriate memorial, but I believe the delegation felt there were some advantages to be gained by looking at what assistance the Australian government and people can provide to Singapore to ensure that that memorial is better maintained in the future and that opportunities for the display of material are taken advantage of. A lot has been done by those local groups, but perhaps they have been lacking assistance from the Australian connection, and more could be done in that regard. The delegation has written to our high commissioner in Singapore seeking assistance to work out ways in which we could work cooperatively with the voluntary groups that maintain the memorial and with the Singapore government to ensure that appropriate steps are taken in the future to give this memorial the proper attention which it deserves. Those who have been responsible for its care to date are to be congratulated on what they have done with the limited resources available. With some additional help, I think a lot more could be done in this very appropriate Australia Remembers year. I am sure other members of the delegation will want to touch on other areas of our Singapore visit. The delegation then moved to Manila. The purpose of this visit was to attend the AIPO-Asean Inter-Parliamentary Organisationannual conference, which is still particularly important to Australia. Although we are there as an observer delegation to the main meeting, there is still a very significant and important role for Australia in that regard. This has to be balanced against our attendance at the Pacific Forum which is now coming into line with the whole APEC question. Even so, the AIPO issue remains alive for us. It not only gives us the opportunity to attend a broadly ASEAN based parliamentary forum but also gives us the opportunity to mix, at an informal level, with the delegations from those countries. It also gives us the opportuniAsia ty to ensure that Australia's point of view is heard in those forums and to listen to the points of view of other countries in shaping our attitude towards Asia. I think it is very important in this context to understand the magnitude of that relationship. In economic terms alone, to ignore the social and cultural aspects, there has been an amazing growth in the ASEAN-Australian relationship. Twenty years ago Australia's exports to ASEAN were worth some $350 million, or under six per cent of our total exports. In 1992-93 they were valued at $8.7 billi?n, or 14 per cent of our total exports, makmg ASEAN our second largest regional market after north-east Asia displacing Europe and pushing North America into fourth place. Twenty years ago ASEAN exports to Australia were worth $108 million or 2.6 per cent of our total imports. In 1992-93 they were $4.7 billion or eight per cent of the total. This emphasises the importance of our growing relationship with ASEAN countries in trade terms. The importance of that relationship at an ASEAN and APEC level cannot be understated. We also took the opportunity to make a bilateral visit to the Philippines. We spoke with a number of Philippine ministers and also with a range of community people. We understood very strongly the message that Australian aid was well favoured by the Philippines. Indeed, when you talk to both the Philippine and Indonesian governments, you find that Australian aid is very high on their agendas because of the sensitive and appropriate way in which it is delivered with the minimal number of strings attached and because it concentrates on the growth and development of the local community, not principally on the benefits to Australia, although they are always present in people's minds. The reality is that our aid is looked upon favourably by those countries because of the way in which it is provided and because of the thoughtful and meaningful relationship which exists between our countries. I certainly think that the delegation was impressed by the opportunities of the east growth region, and the potential for visits by future delegations to the island of Mindanao and Davao city are also very much on the agenda. I think that the relationship between Australia and the Philippines will continue to grow and that these kinds of bilateral visits are very useful in strengthening that. That bilateral visit certainly strengthened the delegation's trip to the Philippines, as did the AIPO Conference. It is important that both activities are undertaken at once in order to get the maximum value from that kind of visit. The delegation concluded its stay in the ASEAN countries by visiting Indonesia. Again, we were very impressed by the warmth of that relationship. We had unfettered access to the senior ministers of the government. We spent a long time with President Suharto and had a most productive meeting with him. All members of the delegation were able to join in a discussion with the president about a wide range of sensitive matters, from economic development to what was then the forthcoming APEC meeting. Security issues and other matters of internal concern, such as East Timor, were also discussed. The delegation also had the opportunity to meet with parliamentary colleagues, business leaders and others in Jakarta, Surabaya and, later, East Timor, and for a short time in Denpassar. Because of the assistance of the ambassador there, we were .also able to take the opportunity in Jakarta to meet a wide range of community groups, so our activities were not limited in that way. Indeed, we were encouraged to meet the widest possible range of people. I think that our visit to Indonesia and, in particular, our visit to East Timor, were very good examples of the benefits of the bipartisan policy of constructive engagement. I commend the report to the House. (Time expired) .",11
3,Mr SLIPPER,DELEGATION REPORT,"I am very pleased to support the remarks made by the leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn'Evans). I will endeavour not to cover a number of the areas mentioned by the honourable member, who was a very effective leader of the delegation. He quite rightly pointed out that the delegation, which represented both sides of the parliament, worked very well together. We cooperated and I got to know the honourable member for Bonython, the honourable member for Corio (Mr O'Connor) and Senator Baden Teague very well. I believe that we certainly represented our nation's interests. I would also like to endorse the comments of the honourable member for Bonython in his praise of the secretary of the delegation, Mr Cleaver Elliott. The service he provided to our committee was certainly above and beyond the call of duty. I think that the actions he took and, indeed, the service he provided ensured that the delegation was able to be as effective as it was. Many people in the Australian community tend to criticise parliamentary delegations and suggest that sometimes they are junkets. I had never been on a delegation before and I thought that perhaps there may have been some validity in some comments made by some people in the Australian community. I have spoken to people who have been on other delegations, and this-as well as my own experience from the delegation last year-indicates to me that nothing could be further from the truth. The trip we went .on was rigorous. We were constantly on the move, and I believe that the Australian taxpayer received good value for money. As the honourable member for Bonython said, the delegation visited the Republic of Singapore, the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of Indonesia. Intellectually, I always knew how important Asia was to Australia and how we, being in this part of the world, have a shared future with the countries of South-East Asia and ASEAN in particular. While I intellectually appreciated that, the delegation's visit to the three countries we went to really brought home to me very clearly just how real that situation is. When you look at the very short distances between Australia and these countries and when you look at the fact that we have so much to offer each other, you see how important it is for us on both sides of politics to encourage the relationship between Australia and South-East Asia. While we might have had .a different past in many respects, we share the present and I think we share the future. When I spoke to people from the ASEAN countries, they almost fell off their chairs laughing at the fact that some Australians say that we are an Asian nation. It is pretty clear to them and to us that we are not an Asian nation; we are in the same Asia-Pacific region. It is always important to be credible. In the past, some of our nation's spokesmen have said that Australia is an Asian nation. Because that is not a credible comment in the eyes of the people with whom we are dealing, it often means that some of the other comments made by our nation's representatives are discounted. The reality is that we are not an Asian nation; we share the Asia-Pacific area with the nations of South-East Asia. We are what we are. We should be respected for what we are. We should also respect the values and cultural traditions of the nations of South-East Asia. When we got to Singapore and spoke to government ministers, members of parliament and bureaucrats, what really struck me was the fact that our two nations have many shared values. Perhaps 20 years ago Singapore was a Third World nation. In my view, it is now very clearly a First World nation. There are many things that we can learn from the Singaporean experience. We are old friends. We have shared interests and values. There are absolutely no blights on the current relationship between our two nations. That is why I was particularly pleased with the first recommendation of the delegation which, in effect, said that we should encourage the growing defence cooperation between Australia and Singapore. We really enjoyed the opportunity to visit the Singapore airport and the port of Singapore. When you look at what the government of Singapore has been able to achieve in these two areas, you realise just how much further we in Australia have to go to achieve reform of the waterfront and efficiency in the transport area. What was really driven home to me in Singapore was the principle of forward planning. Singapore does not look 12 months down the track. It tends to have a long-term plan, and it works assiduously to implement that plan. That relates not only to the transport area but to almost every aspect of Singaporean society. I do not know whether it has something to do with the fact that the government has such an overwhelming majority in the Singaporean parliament that it is not at risk of losing the next election and, as such, is able to take a long-term approach. We all know this government has a very limited tenure and tends to always have one eye on the next election. It is important to have long-term planning, and I suggest that is one of the drawbacks that we have had in this nation over the years. Another recommendation of the delegation is that there ought to be an exchange of visits every two years between the Singaporean parliament and the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. That is very important, given the health of the relationship between the two nations and the fact that, if one knows personally the people on the other side with whom one is dealing, it makes it much easier when our two nations have dealings at an official level. I endorse the comments made by the honourable member for Bonython about the Changi memorial. A member of my family was incarcerated at Changi as a prisoner of the Japanese during the Second World War. It was a most moving experience for me to visit the place in which so many allied service men and women were imprisoned. While I was impressed with the Changi memorial and the Changi museum, I believe that, if the government could do something this year to try to improve the degree of maintenance of that museum and make sure that what is there is able to be preserved for future generations, that would be money well spent. I certainly intend to contact the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) about this because 1995 is the year that we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. It would be entirely appropriate for the government to put a few dollars into the Changi memorial. I found the AIPO Conference very interesting. The delegation was particularly fortunate to have Senator Baden Teague, because he has been on a number of other AIPO visits. It is very important to have at least one member in any delegation who has previously been to AIPO, because the ropes are understood and we can get on with the job. I was saddened that, as an observer delegation, we were not able to participate as fully as we could have. I still believe it is absolutely vital to Australia's interests to continue to go to the AIPO Conference. During the bilateral visit, I found the Philippines to be very interesting. We have to do whatever we can to encourage the development of trade between northern Australia and the Philippines, particularly Mindanao. As a parliament, we ought to do whatever we can to overcome the particular impediments there are to trade. I was impressed with the way in which the Philippines were endeavouring to improve the human rights situation to ensure that it enjoys the same democratic traditions that we have in this country. Indonesia is of course Australia's closest neighbour. I was impressed with the access we had to ministers. I was also impressed that so many people in Indonesia understood the role that Australia played in helping Indonesia to become an independent nation. We have had difficulties over East Timor, but they have not damaged the relationship to the extent that I thought they would have. Indeed, Australia is seen as a long standing friend by Indonesia. I think that is very fortunate. I was pleased to be able to visit East Timor, and no doubt my colleague the member for Corio will talk more about it. The delegation was of one mind; that is, it is important to recognise that East Timor is important. (Time expired)",13
4,Mr OCONNOR,DELEGATION REPORT,"Corio) (12.52 p.m.}-I support the leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans), and his remarks in tabling the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 15th ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organisation-AIPO-Conference. That visit included bilateral visits to the Republic of Singapore and the Republic of Indonesia. I entered the parliament in 1993. As a newcomer to this place, I welcomed very much the opportunity to represent my country abroad. When the opportunity arose for Australian parliamentarians to visit countries in the ASEAN region, I took great pleasure in representing the government in the official discussions that the delegation had. Rather than go into the specifics of each country, which have already been mentioned by the honourable member for Bonython and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), I will sweep with the broad brush and give some of the impressions I had coming from participating in my first parliamentary delegation abroad. The first impression is simply this: Australia is held in very high regard in the region to our near north. The policy that we have had in the past of participating more fully in the life of the region is well understood, accepted and appreciated by our ASEAN neighbours. I suggest that we ought to step up the cooperation that exists at all levels-economic, political, social, et cetera. Australia is perceived as an honest broker in the region, and some great opportunities exist to advance our national interests. We are a natural partner to many ASEAN countries. The honourable member for Fisher mentioned the discussions that we had with the Singapore government. That partnership is probably one of the more natural ones that we can have in the region. One impression that came to me-it has been reinforced in many of the debates that have been held in this place-is that the ASEAN area is one of great growth and opportunity for Australia. I believe that we have successfully positioned ourselves over the past decade to take real advantage of that growth and opportunity. But more needs to be done in building upon those economic and, especially, political linkages. The honourable member for Fisher and the honourable member for Bonython spoke at great length about our visit to Singapore. I was impressed by the vision that has guided the country's development over the last 20 years and by the planning that has gone into producing one of Asia's highest standards of living in a relatively short time. We have much to learn from the Singaporeans. Their heavy investment in the infrastructure of this city state is something that Australia could note and emulate. Singapore is an important transport and financial hub in South-East Asia. Singaporeans see Australia not as an economic rival but really as a natural partner in exploiting the opportunities that are coming from the high-growth economies in the east Asia region. We have had wide-ranging traditional links with Singapore of a defence, economic, social, political and historical nature. With the Singapore government pursuing a policy of regionalising its economy-we have been doing it for the past decade-there are great opportunities for Australia and Singapore to joint venture. The Philippines is a nation that perhaps does not get the recognition it deserves from within political circles here in Australia. There are significant synergies between the Republic of the Philippines and Australia. We share democratic values and institutions. We have a significant Philippine population in Australia. The Philippines is predominantly a Christian country on the verge of great economic growth. There is a great need for Australia to support the institutions and values that underpin the Philippine democracy. When we attended the AIPO Conference, it became abundantly clear to all the delegates that Australia is highly regarded within this fo-um. Even though we were observers, we were one of the first countries to attend the AIPO Conference as observers. We have been at that conference ever since. I encourage Australia's participation in the conference in future. We ought to maintain that participation, because it gives Australian parliamentarians an important opportunity to network among their ASEAN colleagues and understand the political nuances of South-East Asia. It is only in those informal discussions and sessions of a conference such as AIPO that one really gets to understand the underlying shifts in attitude that are taking place within the political elites in these countries. I pay particular thanks to our host, the Philippine government. The Philippines is well noted for its hospitality. Probably one of the saddest things was that the Australian delegation never got to perform in the AIPO Conference because of the happy time that was being had by certain ASEAN delegates. We did not get a chance to sing' Click go the shears' and show a bit of Australiana to our ASEAN colleagues. Nevertheless, the delegation's appearance as an observer at that conference was productive for Australia. Our visit to Indonesia came hot on the heels of the visit to Australia by the Indonesian Vice-President. We were treated exceptionally well by our Indonesian hosts. The access that we were given to President Suharto and other high ranking members of the Indonesian government is an""indication of the importance which the Indonesians placed on our bilateral visit to that nation. The access that we were able to get to the highest levels of the Indonesian political hierarchy has given a good opportunity for our officials to assess those often subtle movements in attitude that occur within the governments of our neighbours. Our meetings with President Suharto and Minister Soedarman certainly represented an engagement of the older members of the Indonesian government. We also met younger members Hartarto and Harmoko, who were able to give us some interesting perspectives on developments in Indonesia and the succession. I was very happy to visit East Timor as part of this delegation, and I will build upon the remarks that were made by the honourable member for Fisher. The Bishop of East Timor, Bishop Belo, consented to meet me on the Saturday after the Australian delegation had left East Timor. There had been reports in the Australian press that Bishop Belo had decided not to see the Australian delegation. Those reports were not correct. Bishop Belo was on retreat with his priests and was quite happy to see me as a member of the delegation on the Saturday. Bishop Belo made some very important points about East Timor /lnd its development. He stressed the need for autonomy and special status for the province. He stressed the need for the East Timorese to be given more control over their affairs, and he stressed the need for a reduced military presence by the Indonesians. My thanks to our leader, the member for Bonython. He was an extremely capable leader, quick on his feet and articulate. He exuded the political experience he has accumulated from 10 years at the state level. We wer.e very fortunate that the member for Fisir brought along his family; they were a great asset to the delegation. I am pleased to pass on my thanks to Senator Baden Teague, who brought to bear his enormous experience on this delegation. My thanks also go to Cleaver Elliott, the secretary to the delegation, to the overseas embassy staff and to our host countries. (Time expired) NA NA",15
5,Mr NEVILLE,MACKILLOP,"Hinkler) (1.02 p.m.) I move: That the House: (1) notes with pleasure and national pride the beatification of the Blessed Mary MACKillop; (2) acknowledges her unique contribution to the education of generations of Australian children, in particular to those in less fortunate circumstances; (3) celebrates the social and spiritual dimensions she and her communities have added to the lives of ordinary Australians, especially in rural and remote areas; (4) commends her as a role model of vision, determination and feminine achievement; and (5) joins in congratulating the Josephite Sisters Australia and beyond our shores at a time of great pride for their communities. Along with those who are supporting my motion today, I join with those who spoke last Thursday to honour Blessed Mary MACKillop and to celebrate the pride and accomplishments that Australians of all faiths feel at the first beatification of an Australian. I join with them in acknowledging the great honour Pope John Paul paid us with his presence. Much has already been said about that marvellous spectacle at Randwick, so I will concentrate on the second, third and fourth paragraphs of my motion in an effort to understand the times, the persona of Mary MACKillop, the social and spiritual dimensions of her work and her place as a feminine model for our times. It is often the little known, small forgotten communities that have spawned our greatest heroes-religious and otherwise. Penola was the visible expression of the vocation of Blessed Mary MACKillop. This little town in South Australia now has a unique place in Australian history. It was in a stable at Penola that Mary MACKillop commenced her first school. A stable is not a bad place to start a new movement. It was another stable 1,860 years before that changed the face of an ignorant and uncaring world. It was a stable in Penola that would change the face of colonial and Christian education. From Penola and later Mount Gambier, Mary's new movement moved to Adelaide in 1867 where the new state, just three decades old, had its own social difficulties and inequities. Notwithstanding the vast technological changes we have experienced in the last 150 years, and the advent of social security as we know it today, the conditions that prevailed in South Australia at that time-the 1860s to the 1880s-bear remarkable similarity to today's. Unemployment was high; there were periods of severe drought; and there was a prevailing secularist movement. As Mary's biographer put it, the age had 'no theory about life or society, but was simply a spirit of freedom permeating the new society, an impulse to build a social order in with equal opportunity for all, blended with a youthful spirit of nationalism and a materialism' in the wake of the gold rush days. Substitute the postwar prosperity for the gold rush days and it is frighteningly similar. There was grinding poverty. The new nonconformist liberal society saw no need for religious education other than that delivered by the government school system. . With the guiding hand of Julian Tennison Woods she formed the Institute of the Sisters of St Joseph and took her vows as Sister Mary of the Cross on 15 August 1867. By the end of that year the institute had 10 adherents. What was different about this institute or order was that it adapted itself to the conditions that prevailed in the Australian colonies at that time and to some extent prevailed until comparatively recent times. Even from its earliest days, equality of access to Christian education was not only talked about but practised. Even Governor Daly's grandson, an early pupil of Mary's, was accepted on the basis that he received the same education as the other children. The distinctive characteristic of her order was that it took education to where it was needed, to the down-market urban areas, to the bush and to the mining towns. Mary saw the vow of poverty to be what it was-a vow of poverty. There were no grand convents for her nuns. One can scarcely imagine the deprivation of these dedicated women in their plain brown robes frequently working in temperatures around the century, frequently without running water and at times having to beg for their own existence and that of their deprived charges. The early nuns were not from the cream of society or the fine educational institutes of Europe; they were simple, working and for middle class women of average accomplishnism ment. Edmund Campion poses the question: What made them join Mary? What made them stay? Living in isolated little cottage convents, young and unlearned, subject to chicanery and abuse ('ignorant servant girls' as one parish called them from his pulpit), they nevertheless stuck to Mary and her understanding of their Their loyalty is a high tribute to her personality. Mary MACKillop had her enemies, though she assiduously avoided provoking them. Like the Master she served, there was something distinctively uncomfortable about a person whose goodness, vision and ability to command loyalty offended the hierarchical structures of the day. She suffered from the envy and taunts of the clergy, bishops whose Irish and British backgrounds made them very much lords of the manor. There were others with ambition for diocesan empire building and those who maliciously accused her of disobedience to the church, intemperance and bad bookkeeping, even in one instance to the point of excommunication, the worse trial or punishment to which a Catholic, much less innocent one, can be subjected. She understood the spirit and legalistic dimension of her vows, personal prayer, encouraging others, and the rigid dictate to her sisters, one which she practised herself, that never were her detractors or her order's detractors to be criticised, no matter what the provocation. The respectful fearlessness with which she approached the church establishment and the gentleness with which she viewed them, even after unjust rebuffs, was truly remarkable, if not saint-like. It must have been a stinging rebuff from Cardinal Moran to some of his fellow bishops when he said that Mother Mary and her sisters understood their vows even if they did not. Mary's life was no less easy as a child. Her family fortunes fluctuated and ultimately sank with the naivety and bad business decisions of her father. She worked as a bookstore assistant, a governess and a teacher to support her family, which has been described as loving but, as Campion put it, 'dysfunctional'. Mary MACKillop was seen by many as a role model feminism, as indeed she is. But the femithat she and her other sisters displayed was earned rather than demanded. They looked more to the rights of others-to the dispossessed, the uneducated, the orphaned and the sick than to their own rights or to priest self-aggrandisement. Mary refused in her order's rules to be fettered by colonial state vows. boundaries. She and her sisters had a wider vision of Australia and its needs, years before the Commonwealth became a reality. Mary had an inner dignity that made her comfortable on the streets of Melbourne, literally begging for the poor, as it did in mixing with the curial cardinals of Rome where she went to argue for the Rule of her Order. It is all the more remarkable that a century and a quarter before the women's movement and that marvellous word, 'empowerment', she had the stature and character at the age of 31 to argue the rights, responsibilities and rules with senior Vatican officials. It is a tribute to the respect in which she was held that, in the toughest of times, a wide spectrum of friends, from Jews to Presbyterians, stuck an to her and her vision of God's work. She cared for, prayed for, visited, wrote to and encouraged her community of sisters. At the time of their greatest challenge in Adelaide, a Sister Patricia wrote to Mary of her encounter with an archdeacon at a time when these brave women, after years of dedication to their God and their communities, were going to their graves without so much as a requiem mass. Father Gardiner, Mary's biographer, recounts the incident in his book quoting Sister Patricia: I then spoke of poor Sister Magdelen who was buried a day or two before with apparently as little sympathy from the Ecclesiastics of the Diocese as if it had been a duck that died at the bottom of the yard. To rise from that sort of treatment to become a leading movement of the church in Australia says more about a true feminine resolve than many oftoday's skewed views that purport to be feminism. Mary MACKillop was saint-like indeed, but there have been many unsung heroes of the movement she started. They were the real flesh and blood women who took Mary'S vision to a wider Australia than even the clerics of their time ever imagined. They were the ones who knew the frost cold of the morning or the intense heat of the outback in a classroom, in the most primitive of conditions, in refuges, beside sick beds. Today, there are still 1,500 Brown Josephites and 500 Black Josephites doing the work Mary MACKillop started 128 years ago in Penola-albeit with different challenges, but the one focus. It is very much their celebration, and I offer our heartiest congratulations to the Josephite sisters of Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and Peru, and I commend this motion to the House.",17
6,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MACKILLOP,Mr Jenkins)Order! Is the motion seconded? Mr Vaile-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,19
7,Mrs CROSIO,MACKILLOP,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (1.12 p.m.)-In supporting the private member's motion before the House, I appreciate that this is the second opportunity that has been provided to me to speak on Blessed Mary MACKillop. With so much produced over the years about her life and times, there is a wide selection of biographical material from which we have been able to gather wonderful information about her. Regardless of what has been said, however, perhaps the most significant features of what we have gained from her beatification, are her spiritual symbolism and its unifying effects for Australians. Question the average Australian about his or her perceptions of what is a defining moment for Australia and answers will range from our participation in various world wars to winning the America's Cup or gaining the 2000 Olympics. Certainly many events have shaped and sharpened our sense of who we are and what our values hold, enabling us to be proud of being Australian. In my view, Blessed Mary MACKillop's beatification is a defining moment for Australian culture. Whether one is a Catholic or not, we can all be justifiably proud of the woman destined to be Australia's first saint. With the beatification, there is a declaration that Mary is in a spiritual sphere. In our earthly world, which desperately limits its own horizons to what can be seen and experienced and in which we often ignore the spiritual, this event, more than anything, focuses on far more than the tangible. For many Australians-whether they be Jewish, Muslim, Christian or of other belief systems-this moment defines us as a nation which has refused to limit its scope of interesto the pragmatic or to merely the here and now. In other words, I personally believe that Australia has come of age. Mary MACKillop's courage and determination defined for us what are the greatest traits of the Australian character-not the Catholic character but the Australian character with 'which people from all walks of life and creeds identify. In that sense she is indeed a role model for us all and serves as a unifying force. When Mary and Father Julian Woods set up the order of Josephites, whether it was planned or by accident, they nevertheless developed a culture which sits well with many aspects of our Australian ethos. Her personality, sometimes depicted as larrikinism, and her example are peculiarly Australian and well removed from the demeanour of some saints of other cultures. The sisters' poverty, their mobility, their living in groups of two or three in places where a priest of the day seldom visited, their independence of clerical control and their refusal to kowtow to authority all exemplify well that renowned Australian desire to be egalitarian. Characterised at times as a rebel who irked some of her contemporaries, Mary's behaviour epitomises the fair go attitudes of all Australians. Her well documented attributes of kindness, care and compassion serve as lessons for us all. Mary MACKillop can be seen as having many facets. Sections of contemporary society would characterise her as a feminist and there are indeed aspects of her life, not the least which was standing up to the Irish bishops, which strongly lend weight to such a claim. Mary refused to be put down by men who wanted to control her work or her sisters. That this beatification coincides with times when Australian history is reclaiming the lost voices of women also adds to the attractiveness of those perceptions. However, it would be unfair to categorise her or seem to place limitations on what she set out to do. Her appeal straddles a broad spectrum of society. She must be saluted as an educator, as a battler who coped with enormous setbacks and even as a personality which, however strong-willed, had to be submissive at times to the higher will of the then Catholic bishops of the day. Her belief that things were 'not quite right' and her resolve to set about improving the quality of life for the poor are adages from which we as parliamentarians might take heed. In representing our constituents, examples of her work should remind us of what we are elected for-that is, we are here to facilitate change and work towards creating a fairer and more just society. Mary's beatification gives hope in the sense that it vindicates the stand she took in life. Her challenge to civil and religious authority, her defence of the poor and her vision for a more just society give hope to those who struggle for the same realities today. She and her followers did not gain any financial rewards for their efforts, not only living within a vow of poverty but also making a virtue of their complete dependence upon the goodwill of the community. But she inspired an amazing loyalty, from not only the 6,000 or 7,000 women followers who abandoned the world to follow her example but also the people of other religions. Mary was able to transcend class and religious barriers. In a bigoted age she attracted ecumenical admiration and financial support from quarters one might normally expect to be opponents. Ironically, when she was excommunicated from the Catholic Church her greatest support came from people of other denominations. Though she came from a Gaelic speaking of Highland family, this woman was able to break down denominational barriers and win wide-ranging support. It is well documented that when she and the other sisters were turned out of their convent during the excommunication crisis a Jewish businessman, Emmanuel Solomon, gave them a home. Throughout Mary's life a major benefactor was the Barr-Smith family, who showed the ultimate in generosity and friendship. A member of that Presbyterian family, Joanna Barr-Smith, paid for the marble slab over Mary's tomb when she died in 1909. Perhaps this piece by Julian Thomas in the January 1833 edition of the Victorian Review exemplifies well the prevailing mood about Mary MACKillop and her band of nuns: The consensus of opinion amongst Protestants as well as Catholics is that the Sisters of St Joseph are doing a really good work, that they are ever ready to go to the relief of the sick, to succour the orphan and abandoned child and to shelter and encourage to virtue the poor victims of a vicious life. The proof that they are esteemed by all classes is the liberal support they receive from Protestants as well as from those of their own creed. Many leading Protestants they refer to as being their best friends. Today, as has been stated, there are nearly 2,000 sisters of St Joseph found in almost every diocese in Australia and New Zealand, and they also have houses in New Guinea, Peru and Ireland. In my area a school run by the Josephites has 900 students representing some 40 ethnic backgrounds. I am sure that if Mary MACKillop could see this school today and its wonderful achievements with youth from so many different nationalities she would be very proud indeed. I think it is appropriate to add to the list of accolades that Mary MACKillop was ahead of her time with multiculturalism. It is with a great deal of honour that on behalf of the government I support the private member's motion before the House.",19
8,Mr VAILE,MACKILLOP,"It is a privilege to speak on this particular subject for the second time in a week. I think it is extremely important for this House to take note of the motion that has been moved recognising the beatification of Blessed Mary MACKillop, the work she did in Australia, the empathy that she certainly had with the poor arid the underprivileged and the role model she has established for Australia. When we compare ourselves with other nations around the world where Roman Catholicism is alive, well and strong and where other saints have been beatified and canonised, it is very interesting to note that we have a history of a little over 200 years. A lot of these other nations around the world have histories going back thousands of years, so the beatification of Mary MACKillop is a great achievement and something that all Australians should be very proud of. As I said, it is with much pleasure that I rise today to commend the beatification of Blessed Mary MACKillop, now to be known as Blessed Mary of the Cross. The beatification of Mother Mary MACKillop comes at a time when the pace of modern society seems hell-bent on swamping the ideals and values of Christian life in Australia. It was, therean fore, heart-warming to witness the widespread community support for the recent papal tour along with the subsequent beatification of Mother Mary MACKillop. The interest that was shown in these events confirms the importance of faith within the Australian community. This should not be forgotten by us in this place when we make decisions on behalf of the Australian community. I believe Mary MACKillop's greatestcontribution to Australia has been the development of the teaching order of the Josephite sisters whose talents and skills now exist far beyond Australian shores. That was evidenced by the number of speakers here last Thursday, including me, who have been educated by the Josephite sisters in our earlier years. Mary MACKillop's parents, who were migrants from Scotland, instilled in their eldest daughter the importance of an education. She was thankfully given opportunities to develop that intellectual skill. Amongst the commentaries written about Blessed Mary MACKillop was an article that said that the one element in her life which all commentators point to in order to relate her to modern interests is her vile treatment by male hierarchies. Mary MACKillop's sufferings in a patriarchal church have made her a heroine to modern Australian feminists. The facts are not in dispute. Five years after starting the Josephite sisterhood she was excommunicated by the Bishop of Adelaide for insubordination. This meant that she could not participate in mass or receive communion, although sympathetic priests ignored the bishop's act as they thought it was illegal. She remained in public disgrace for five months, the ban being lifted only days before the bishop's death. Despite these setbacks she continued to champion the cause of the poor, and it is this point that makes her a heroine to all Australians. These harsh times also say something for the strength of the Josephite sisters who never wavered from their belief in Mother Mary. Indeed, it was during her excommunication that the Josephite order strengthened in its resolve. Mary MACKiIlop is seen as more than just educator of the poor, the deprived and the underprivileged; she is seen as a visionary who stressed the Australian foundations of her faith. Against the wishes of the bishops who wanted her enterprise to be regionally based and influenced she emphasised the necessity for an Australia-wide vision. She looked for an educational institution which could reach across physical and racial boundaries. Indeed, long before a federation of Australia was even thought of Mary MACKillop was thinking of a body which, in its mobility and homogeneity, would cover the whole continent, including New Zealand. One important example of this vision is the Mary MACKillop College in Port Macquarie in my electorate of Lyne in New South Wales. Considered one of the finest educational institutions in the region, the legacy of the 19th century Josephites continues. From hearing the fascinating history of Blessed Mary MACKillop, I am encouraged by her remarkable ability to extend friendship and kindness to those of different religions and traditions. The biographer Geoffrey Hull said: The whole early history of the Sisters of St Joseph is a lesson in the Australian pioneering spirit, an illustration of the Australian talent for improvisation ... As Mother Mary noted, 'solicitude about one's temporary wants, necessity of securing beforehand a place to live in and such things, are the greatest possible drawbacks to the missionary spirit.' He went on to say: Mother Mary was never guilty of reserving a greater share of her love for members of her own Church ... Her friendship and kindness towards Protestants, Jews and unbelievers was reciprocated by non-Catholics who supported and encouraged her at times when members of her own Church persecuted or rejected her. (Time expired) Mr FITZGmBON (Hunter) (1.26 p.m.}-I pay tribute to those women members of religious orders in Australia who have carried on the wonderful work that the Blessed Mary MACKillop commenced: women engaged in a whole host of good works, those thousands of nuns who will not be beatified, nor canonised nor attain sainthood but who will always be regarded as saintly by those who witness or benefit from their good works-the teachers, the missionaries, the nursing sisters and the sisters who work with the homeless, the handicapped, the poor and the elderly and the sisters who work with patients who suffer from AIDS. These women truly are reflections of the light of the world. Blessed Mary MACKillop was the founder of the Brown Joeys, but today I say thanks to all Josephites, brown and black, as well as all the other religious orders, including those religious orders we refer to as 'enclosed'. Perhaps it is not fair to single out individuals, but I express my appreciation to nuns such as Sister Agnes Hopper of St Joseph's College, Lochinvar. Sister Agnes is not only a brilliant mathematician but is known as the 'clerk of works' at Lochinvar school, where she is a great organiser and has her finger in every pie ranging from plumbing to ensuring that a classroom is painted. Sister Agnes devotes hours of time to keeping ex-students in touch with each other through arranging reunions and publishing a student newsletter. Another remarkable Josephite is Sister Bede, who taught and was such an influence for good on my four children and thousands of other children throughout the Hunter Valley and beyond. I pay tribute to Sister Lauretta Baker, a dedicated feminist in the accepted sense of the word. Her brilliant speeches and wise leadership inspired thousands of girls during her time as principal of St Joseph's, Lochinvar. Another brilliant mind is Sister Evelyn Woodward, who is now Superior of the St Joseph's sisters at Lochinvar. Sister Claire Tobin, an outstanding musician and composer, is doing brilliant work as coordinator of liturgical music in the diocese of Maitland. Blessed Mary MACKillop would have been in perfect step with the Mercy Sisters who were and are pioneers of nursing at Newcastle Mater Hospital. A knowledge of the people they serve and an understanding of every aspect of life is the characteristic of every nun I have known. Once I accused Sister Patricia MCGinty of not knowing much about certain things. She said, 'Don't be crazy. I know all about the vagaries of life-my dad was a publican and an SP bookie.' Another religious following in the footsteps of Blessed Mary MACKillop is Sister Marie Dagg of Singleton, who celebrated her golden jubilee last year. Sister Marie worked for more than 30 years as a missionary in New Guinea and was the driving force in the construction of the first Catholic schools in areas of New Guinea where schools had not previously existed. Sister Marie's work followed very closely that of Blessed Mary MACKillop, except Sister Marie's great contribution was in the highlands of New Guinea. Blessed Mary MACKillop was a wonderful pioneer but no less a pioneering spirit drove those sisters who followed her example. Those sisters who ran schools and hospitals proved the worth of women in Australian society long before the phrase 'affirmative action' saw the light of day. I was impressed by an article by Tony Stevens in last Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald. Tony wrote of the advances Australian nuns have made and pointed to the fact that sisters served at the altar at the recent papal mass at Randwick. Tony mentioned that when Sister Carmel Pilcher went to Rome a monsignor there said, 'Thank God, at last a country has sent a woman.' Blessed Mary MACKillop may never have guessed it, but she has set the ball rolling which will result in the ordination of women priests.",21
9,Mr HAWKER,MACKILLOP,"I support this motion of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville). I congratulate him, and I congratulate other speakers on their very generous support. This motion is timely, appropriate and shows that the parliament has a respect for Mother Mary MACKillop and the fantastic things she did during her lifetime. Many countries teach their children the details of the lives of their saints. With the recent coverage and publicity of Mother Mary MACKillop, many Australians are now going to be familiar with her life and times and, most importantly, her achievements and the example she has set. Therefore, it is good not only to know the history of this very fine Australian but also to have a living legacy as an example for others to follow. Many details of Mother Mary MACKillop's life have already been documented in this debate and, indeed, in the debate last Thursday in this place. I would like to focus on one part of her life: her very close links with Western Victoria, which began in June 1862. She journeyed from Melbourne to Portland, which is in my electorate, to be governess to Mrs Cameron Duncan, a relative of hers. She lived in her home, Fitzroy Cottage, and gained her first teaching position, at Common School No. 510, in October 1863. That school is now called All Saints Primary School and is still very much a part of the Portland education scene. Mother Mary MACKillop taught at the school for two years. At the same time, she developed not only her teaching skills but also the organisational skills which she put to such great use in the future. Late in 1863, Mother Mary's scattered family also came to live in Portland. To support them Mother Mary established the Bayview House Seminary for Young Ladies, which she ran with her sisters. So not only was she teaching at school by day but she was also running the seminary by night. Unfortunately, not all went well. The school struggled, some of the family tensions grew, debts multiplied and, unfortunately, she lost her teaching position. Late in 1865 Mother Mary was invited to set up a school in Penola, which has been referred to in this debate, and she returned there in January 1866. It is important to realise that Mother Mary spent a very significant part of her life in Portland. She learned the good and bad sides of teaching and carried these lessons with her for life. It was through this formative process that Mother Mary MACKillop also acquired philosophies which were to help guide her through her life. If you visit Western Victoria, you will find there are several sights connected with Mother Mary MACKillop. In Portland, the original Catholic Church and Bayview House still stand, now part of All Saints School. Unfortunately, several other houses connected with Mother Mary MACKillop were torn down in, the 1970s. At the Siesta Motel in Portland, the original well beside Mary MACKillop's house has been excavated and restored, and we have yet to find whether this is Australia's Lourdes and a testing place for miracles. Finally, in Hamilton you will find the grave of Mother Mary MACKillop's father, Alexander MACKillop. As all honourable members would acknowledge, Mary MACKillop has set a very fine example for all of us to follow. I am proud to speak in this debate and proud to say that many people in my electorate had the privilege of learning from this very fine Australian. It is important not only to learn from the history of Mother Mary MACKillop but to pay respect to the memory of this truly remarkable person. (Time expired)",23
10,Mr SIMMONS,MACKILLOP,"Like so many of my colleagues, I acknowledge the worth of this motion that has come forward for debate in this House on the initiative of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville). We as Australians, representatives of the Australian co'lnmunity in the Australian Parliament, certainly can take a great deal of pride in and acknowledge with pleasure and national pride-as the motion indicates-the beatification of Blessed Mary MACKillop. I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the significant act that took place last month with the beatification of Australia's first saint, Mother Mary MACKillop, by His Holiness the Pope during his visit to Australia. While much was certainly said of the beatification at that time, I feel that, like most news events, its significance will fade with the passing of the media's coverage. While it would be naive to expect that it could remain at the foreground of the public's thoughts indefinitely, it is suitable to recognise the event's significance without the prompting of the media. To that extent, this is another very worthwhile initiative of the member for Hinkler in bringing forward this debate into the House today. The beatification of Mary MACKillop held special significance for many of the constituents of my electorate of Calare because of her close links with the area. I noticed that the previous speaker in the debate, the member for Wimnon (Mr Hawker), also claimed some special significance for his area. The fact that so many members of parliament are speaking in this debate and making those claims points to the very wide geographical and spiritual significance of Mother Mary MACKillop's links with Australia. Mary MACKillop met on several occasions the sisters from St Joseph's Convent at Perthville near Bathurst as well as going to convents which were located nearby in Wattle Flat and Trunkey Creek. Those visits were certainly cherished by the residents of the community. One elderly Wattle Flat resident, Mary Ireland, who died just a few years ago, often spoke of meeting Mary MACKillop. As a schoolgirl, she had taken it in turns to sit with Blessed Mary in the front room of the convent as she was writing letters. As a gesture to those links forged over a century ago, among those quarter of a million people present for the beatification mass celebrated by His Holiness Pope John Paul II in Sydney last month were quite a few bus loads of people from central western New South Wales. They had been looking forward to it for some time. In October last year, a special mass to celebrate the impending beatification was held at Sts Michael and John's Cathedral in the diocese of Bathurst. Following the mass, the route taken by the first Josephite nuns, as they travelled to the Perthville convent to establish the Sisters of St Joseph order in the region, was retraced. Bathurst Bishop Patrick Dougherty was amongst the members of the Australian and New Zealand hierarchy taking part in the beatification ceremony in Sydney. Bishop Dougherty announced last week that the former diocesan Catholic Girls High School in Bathurst will henceforth be renamed as MACKillop College, but will continue with the motto 'With Mary's help we'll be a light to the world'. Given those links, I think it is important that I point out how significant it is that Australia now has its own saint because, even for those of you who may not believe in the divine, Mother Mary's way of life and sense of purpose should still serve as an inspiration. There are few things in today's society that prompt us to rethink howÂ· we are living our lives or our approach to others. But if anything can, it is the example that has been set by Blessed Mary MACKillop. Last month's beatification was not so much to add any gloss to the work of Mary MACKiIlop-because it would be difficult to find an area that did not already shine-but to hold that work up as an example for the rest of the world to see. Mary MACKillop was one of Australia's greatest historical figures in the devotion of her life to the care and welfare of others. That work-though impossible for most of us to achieve-is something that we can certainly all use as a benchmark. The fact that this work was carried out in Australia, by an Australian, should bring it all closer to home.",23
11,Mr NEHL,MACKILLOP,"--,-It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise today to speak in this debate to support the motion and to endorse the comments of so many of my colleagues who have made valuable contributions. It is absolutely marvellous that here we are in Australia in 1995 and we have the first beatification of an Australian. I speak not as a Roman Catholic but as a Presbyterian. It is absolutely marvellous that we have had such wide support right throughout the Australian community for the beatification of Mary MACKillop. Mary MACKillop was an outstanding woman in any sense, even if we leave aside the religious context. She was a dedicated teacher. Her concern for people was absolutely remarkable. She put her concern for the welfare of her fellow human beings well above wealth and ambition. She undertook activities in which she was subjected to considerable stress, to the extent of being excommunicated from her church. It was wonderful to have that excommunication turned around so completely. Religion in Australia is more and more becoming a binding, uniting thing as we get a far more ecumenical approach and become broader in our tolerance. Once upon a time that was not the case. I can recall going to school as a very small boy in the very early 1940s. I lived in the suburb of Hamilton in Newcastle and I went to the public school. There was a Catholic school nearby and we used to cross paths. I would be going home from school one way and the kids from the Catholic school would be going the other way. I can remember one occasion quite vividly when I was teased and taunted a bit and the Catholic kids came up with a little rhyme: Catholics, Catholics, ring the bell while the publics march to hell. It is very possible that some bigoted Protestants had a similar sort of rhyme. But that has gone. To me, this is one of the things that we can ascribe to people like Mary MACKillop. There has been this wonderful growth in religious tolerance in this country. I do not think that would happen today. I believe we owe a lot to Mary MACKillop for that change. She was not just a religious or a teacher; she was a first class politician. I would like to see her around today. I think she would be in this place if she were still alive. She became an excellent politician because she had to. She had to manipulate the hierarchy of the church and she had to manipulate the whole of society. I do not say 'manipulate' in a derogatory sense. She had to manage and get what she wanted and, boy, did she go out and get it. She was a businesswoman. She made a tremendous contribution to society in the way she was able to raise money and get things going. Above all, she was a very practical, sincere, religious woman-as were fellow Josephites. I am very pleased to be able to tell the House that in Kempsey, in my electorate of Cowper, a Josephite school was started in 1884, and it is still going strong. The number of kids that have gone through that school over the 111 years is testimony to the good work that came out of it. The Josephites have been tremendously successful as educators and administrators, and I certainly take this opportunity of praising them as an order and as a group. Blessed Mary MACKillop was a pioneer in every sense of the word. She came from a poor family. Her father was very often unemployed. It was a pretty large family. The family was constantly on the move in the search for work. They did it tough. They had very little money for food and clothing. So I wholeheartedly support this motion. It is amazing that she reached out and touched the lives of so many people right across the community. It is interesting to note that, when she was turned out of the convent in Adelaide during the crisis of her excommunication, it was the Jewish businessman Emmanuel Solomon who came to her assistance. She got this sort of support from Presbyterians and from right across the whole of society. It is very fitting that His Holiness visited Australia to beatify Mother Mary MACKillop.",24
12,Mr OCONNOR,MACKILLOP,"It gives me a great deal of pleasure to support the motion by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Neville) which is now before the House. The life of Mary MACKillop was indeed an extraordinary and special one. What makes Mary MACKillop, and those like her, unique is the impact that her life had not only on her contemporaries and those she served, but also on future generations of Catholic Christians and other Christians in Australia. Mary MACKiIIop's life was driven by a strong Christian faith which underpinned a fierce commitment to the poor and the underprivileged in urban and regional Australia in her time. That commitment grew out of the circumstance of her own life and the material poverty that she observed around her. Mary saw that poverty was limiting the intellectual and the physical development of many young people. That observation and her commitment drove a fierce desire to improve the lot of those people and to give them an opportunity that they otherwise would not have had. Many words have been spoken recently in church circles, in the media and, indeed, in this House on Mary MACKilIop's place in Australian history. However, we must not let the many spoken words obscure the message conveyed by this life. She led a simple life, free from the material encumbrances that really do chain the lives of 20th century Christians and non-Christians alike. If I could alter a phrase from a modern song, she indeed lived in a material world but she was no material girl. She displayed a fierce loyalty to the community of nuns that she founded. That brought her into conflict with her church hierarchy and on one occasion led to her excommunication. But excommunications are a bit like political victories and defeats-they come and go. What remains is the judgment of history on the contributions that individuals make. She displayed a fierce loyalty to the poor and disadvantaged, who became the focus of her life's work. Her commitment to her ideals and a sense of sacrifice became an inspiration to those who joined her and to those who supported her in her own day and through the decades since. The Josephite nuns are an important community within the Catholic Christian community. But it is important to reflect on the fact that, when this very special person went about delivering her commitment to the poor and underprivileged, she drew support from across the political spectrum of church circles. She received support from the Jewish community and large support from the Protestant community at a time when some in her own ranks had doubted the mission which she never doubted. I think there are very simple messages here for those of us who operate in this chamberand, I guess, for the general Australian community. We must never bypass the commitment that she had to the poor and the underprivileged in our society. That is a commitment that must exist from government, from voluntary organisations and from individuals, if the fabric of this community is to be held together and if the wealth of this great nation is to be shared equitably. The power of Mary MACKiIIop's life can be judged by her capacity to inspire Christians today, and that is evidenced by the Josephite community which stilI carries on her good work. However, she has the capacity to touch the lives of ordinary Australians. My own aunty, Peg O'Connor from Colac, attended the beatification of Mary MACKiIIop in Sydney recently. She described that experience as a wonderful spiritual feeling, giving a sense of renewal and a renewed sense of devoting one's life to others. (Time expired)",25
13,Mrs MOYLAN,MACKILLOP,"It is a pleasure for me, not only to be able today to speak to this motion, but also to have had the privilege over the last several days of listening to the tributes of many of my colleagues in this place to the wonderful work of the Blessed Mary MACKiIIop. In an era when women were seriously marginalised and when feminists were waging a battle to allow this nation's women to vote and to take seats in the parliament, another young Australian woman was fighting her very own battle-not strictly in the feminist terms of the day, which was for equality of opportunity, but assiduously, and against all odds, for autonomy. For the order of nuns founded by her and Father Julian Tenison Woods, known as the Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart, Mary fought many battles to free the order of the patriarchal interference from both religious and secular quarters. Mary's struggles against civil and religious authorities were not designed to make her life easier or to earn her an income. Rather, her motives were selfless-service to others, in particular, to women and to children. Mary understood that to liberate the poor, to give hope to the dispossessed, she had to do more than recognise the problem, more than feed and more than comfort these people. She recognised the value of education and the liberating effect it had. By teaching the children of the poor to read and to write and to look after their own financial affairs, Mary MACKillop went a long way to liberating the children of the poor in the early days of this country's history. The Sisters of St Joseph were all that came between perpetuation of illiteracy of parents and their children in working class Australia. Mary recognised the problem and worked to comfort and then to bring about real change in the lives of the people she served. The Josephites visited working class families, the sick and the aged in their homes. They went to the hospitals, to the destitute asylums and to the gaols. Mary worked for Aboriginal health, education and welfare. By any standard, Mary MACKillop was a remarkable woman. The celebration of her beatification reminds us of the contribution made by many women in the development of this nation-contributions and talents that too often have been ignored because no perceived monetary value was attached or because the feats of women were not considered to be particularly important. The social value of this work alone is inestimable and should be enough to give the women of Australia an honoured place in our history. The economic value of this work has never been reflected in our national accounts. It is interesting that this year, for the first time, the Australian Women's Yearbook the monetary value of the contribution of voluntary and unpaid workers in the community has been highlighted. I think it is interesting to note that the value of unpaid household work contributed to the nation for 1992 was $209.7 billion while the value of volunteer and community work was $18.1 billion. It is true that much of the work of women has not given rise to shattering news headlines, but that should not exclude it from a place of honour in our nation's history. After instituting the Pearce Australia Day awards, I was pleased to see a lot of volunteers emerge in my electorate. In fact, three women from one country town have collectively given close on 90 years voluntary work. A maturing nation relies on recording and celebrating the contribution of all its people. Women have played, and will continue to play, a significant role. The life and work of Mary MACKillop can be enhanced if her beatification acts as a catalyst to include the lost voices and the hidden work of Australian women in our history.",26
14,Mr HORNE,MACKILLOP,"Paterson) (1.56 p.m.}-Much has been said about Mary MACKillop in recent months, mostly, of course, by members of the Catholic faith. As a non-Catholic, I am not qualified to pass comment on aspects of Blessed Mary MACKillop's religious claim; however, as a former teacher and a humanist I will discuss the educational aspects of her work and the significance of her beatification. I believe the acceptance of Mary MACKillop by the Vatican symbolises the acceptance of Australia as a truly mature and independent nation. It is a decision that has been well received by all Australians, Catholic and nonCatholic alike. After all, so it should because during her life Mary MACKillop inspired and received support from all sectors of the community. The other important point of this historic event is Mary MACKillop's struggle against the entrenched male hierarchy of her organisation, the Josephite nuns. Her fight for her organisation's autonomy was a remarkable and revolutionary achievement. Mary MACKillop's progressive organisation of the in Josephite order was revolutionary in that 20 years before federation she had established a national order traversing all the colonial boundaries. She was surely one of the original great Australians with a vision of a united nation. My own electorate of Paterson is served today by a number of Josephite organisations. At Dungog and Buladehlah, primary schools are staffed by members of the Federated Sisters of St Joseph, while at Lochinvar the convent that was founded in 1883 has developed into a comprehensive educational facility which not only has proudly served the community of Maitland but, through its boarding facilities, has given educational opportunities to the children of families from many rural communities also. The most recent principal of Lochinvar, Helen Hemphill, has proved to be an outstanding educator herself and has been promoted to the position of director of educational services in the diocese of Maitland. She is the first woman to hold this position. The traditions started by Mary MACKillop are still at work. There are many examples of people whose lives have been altered because of Mary MACKillop's leadership. Between 6,000 and 7,000 women have since joined the Federated Sisters of St Joseph. One of the longest serving, best known and most loved sisters at Lochinvar, Sister Agnes, now in her 60s-she was mentioned by my colleague the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon)-read of Mary MACKillop's life when she was only 14. This inspired Sister Agnes to devote her life to the work of this impressive Australian. Another outstanding woman who has devoted her life to the caring and compassionate precept of Mary MACKillop is Sister Annie Laurie of the Mater Hospice and Make Today Count. Her work at the MACKillop AIDS Hospice has brought comfort to many of the Hunter district. The thousands of children who have been given their fundamental education by the Sisters of St Joseph and the aged and infirm who have been supported in their need owe an enormous debt to our most public spirited women. I congratulate all those who have worked for the beatification of Blessed Mary MACKillop.",27
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MACKILLOP,"As the occupant of the chair at this time. I am going to take the unusual step of saying that I have listened to this motion with great interest and have followed it very closely. As a Christian, I wish to be identified with all that has been said during this debate. The time allotted for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA",28
16,Mr FILING,MACKILLOP,"I move: That the House: (1) deplores the abject failure of the UN to protect the people of Bihac, Bosnia-Herzegovina, from attack by the forces of the Bosnia Serbs and their allies; (2) calls on the UN to lift its sanctions on arms supplies to the armed forces of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and (3) rejects proposals to divide or cantonise Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are looking at the future of international relations, in particular at the future of some of the conflict resolution problems that we are going to face. Right now we are looking at the problems being encountered by the people of Bihac, the enclave in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In my address today I want to canvass the three areas of the motion. I would like to refer to some of the excellent articles that have appeared recently in relation to the problems that have been created by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia; in particular, the conflict that has been raging in Bosnia and Herzegovina-something with which I am reasonably familiar, having visited the region three times; the last two times visiting Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Lawrence Freedman, the professor of war studies at King's College, London, has written an interesting article. He mentioned: The lessons of Sarajevo drawn after 1918 were about the dangers of great powers' allowing their destinies to become tied to the behaviour of Balkan hot-heads, and then denying conciliatory diplomacy its chance by slavishly following the logic of military mobilization. Opposite lessons should be drawn from Sarajevo this time around: The great powers were so anxious to stay clear of the Balkans that they did not engage until it was too late, and then so determined to avoid substantial military mobilization that they denied diplomacy the resort to military force. He concluded later in the article: ... the international community failed to comprehend its character and inner dynamic So they were not able to act in a decisive manner. Having visited the region and having seen the sorts of horrors that have been inflicted on the people as a result of the most bloody warfare on the continent of Europe since the Second World War, I am conscious of the fact that it is easy to speak about activities or acts in an isolated fashion in a parliament on the other side of the world, when people are suffering the most horrific degradations in terms of loss of life, loss of property and, of course, the loss of freedoms which many of us take for granted. The independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina was recognised in 1992 by the United Nations and, in the first instance, by many nations as a result of the breakdown of the former federation of Yugoslavia Bosnia-Herzegovina is a sovereign nation within the meaning of the United Nations. As a consequence, its sovereignty should be a matter of concern and ought to be preserved by other member nations of the United Nations. If we allow the independence and self determination-the sovereignty-of BosniaHerzegovina to be eclipsed by the use of military force by the Bosnian Serbs, we are setting a precedent for other nations which also may be nation members of the United Nations. Before Christmas we saw horrific images of warfare within the Russian federation in Chechnya. We saw the Russians launch military operations against their own people, in many cases ethnically Russian people who live in the Chechen capital of Grozny. We have seen in that conflict another example of the incapacity of the post-Cold War power structure to be able to deal effectively with conflict resolution. I am somewhat of a fan of Alvin Toffler. I notice. that in the United States Congress Newt Gingrich and others are said to be Tofflerites, and now have the ascendancy in the United States Congress. I hope that reflects in the way in which these matters are dealt with in the future by the United States. But Alvin Toffler looked forward in 1980, in writing his second book, The Third Wave, to a future of nationality, and he looked in particular at how the international order would evolve in the face of the technological revolutions that were taking place. It is no accident that we are seeing a repetition of events in the region of the Balkans that occurred in the early part of the 20th century. I read recently in the Age a very important article by Gaddis Smith, the director of the Yale Centre for International Studies, who looked backwards to the crisis in the first part of the 20th century for some indications in relation to our present crisis in the Balkans. She mentioned in the first instance in her article that the sickening situation is similar in many respects to the pitiful and portentous failure of the League of Nations, predecessor to the United Nations, of major governments to deal with aggression, violence and contempt for international obligations .in the 1930s. A number of members have for some time-right from the word go when the Yugoslav Federal Army attacked the militia of Slovenia, the first republic of Yugoslavia to want to leave the former Federation of Yugoslavia, to the war in Croatia and more latterly in Bosnia-Herzegovin;t-tried to point out that in the final analysis the absence of any effective will to deal with aggression,. murder, torture, unlawful imprisonment, the use of ethnic cleansing, which has somewhat of a less disgusting connotation to it than it ought to, and any lack of resolve in the first instance on the part of the Western powers would eventually lead to the setting of a precedent that would continue. We saw that in the 1930s when the League of Nations and other nations failed to act when Italy attacked Abyssinia, and used enormous forces against the basically primitive military force of the Abyssirtians; we saw it when the Germans marched into the Zeiland when they annexed Austria; and we saw it more latterly in the Munich agreement when Germany was able to take over Czechoslovakia with a minimum of fuss. All through that particular period a number of voices railed against what was seen to be the use of diplomacy to avoid the hard lessons of history. Again, we find ourselves in the position where diplomacy-and more latterly, I suppose, former President Carter's Bosnian fiasco-is used as an alternative to setting down basic codes of behaviour on the part of member nations of the United Nations. Back in 1993, when I visited Sarajevo as part of a group of international members of parliament from all around the world, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Jordan, Italy and Malaysia, I was interested to hear the complaints of the Bosnian government at the time in relation to the behaviour of the United Nations. It was alleged, in particular in the case of the Bihac enclave in the north-west of Bosnia-Herzegovina, that the United Nations was using food convoys as a political weapon to try to lever the BosniaHerzegovina government to accept the then cantonisation proposal that was being put to it. It was being pushed into that particular agreement because obviously it was going to suit those who wanted to get out of BosniaHerzegovina as quickly as possible and settle the thing down. But, at the same time, the Bosnia-Herzegovina government saw quite clearly the UN provide food supplies to the then rebel chieftain of Bihac, Mr Abdic, who was then a Muslim but is now allied with the . Bosnian Serbs. That gave Mr Abdic sufficient credibility and the ability to deliver supplies to the people, to preserve his authority at a time when the Bosnia-Herzegovina government desperately required all the assistance it could get. Now UN peacekeepers are in the middle of crossfires. At this very minute bombardment is happening in Bihac. UN peacekeepers are in the line of fire from Mr Abdic's militia who are assisting the Bosnian Serbs. It is quite clear that, if Bosnia-Herzegovina's sovereignty is to be preserved, it must be able to protect itself. In that case it needs to be able to protect itself militarily, and that means the arms embargo must be lifted. We lament in this motion the incredible inability of the United Nations to perform its central mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina-to preserve and protect those people who are in the so-called safety zones.

17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MACKILLOP,Is the motion seconded? Mr Andrews-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,30
18,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MACKILLOP,"Watson) (2.11 p.m.}The proposed lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina is a naive and misguided response to the warfare in the former Yugoslavia. After almost four years of war, the tens of thousands of dead, an even larger number of people injured, the more than 5Y2 million refugees and displaced persons, and the endless and seemingly useless cease-fires, I can understand the frustration of the peace negotiators. No possible argument could be mounted to justify this armed conflict, which has seen the shameful re-emergence of ethnic cleansing, the systematic rape of women in some towns and indiscriminate sniping, shelling and bombardment of civilian populations. This conflict has caused a level of suffering which will take years, if not generations, to overcome. It is easy from where some members sit to point the finger at the United Nations and to come up with what might seem to be glib and useless scenarios to supposedly end a conflict that has continued despite the concerted efforts of all UN member nations. The United Nations Protection Forces group is often criticised for not achieving things for which it was never intended to achieve. The UNPROFOR was initially deployed in Bosnia to deliver humanitarian aid at a time when people were suffering enormously from the consequences of war. Later, under the authority of various additional UN Security Council resolutions, the UNPROFOR has become involved in seeking local and temporary cease-fires, and sought to expose and bring to an end to the more systematic patterns of human rights abuses. My colleague who spoke before me, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), has overlooked the UNPROFOR contribution in the delivery of humanitarian aid. In criticising the UNPROFOR for the things it has been unable to achieve, it is important to remember that institutions are only as effective as the political will of the member states. Lifting the arms embargo will not resolve this conflict. Late last year, the UNPROFOR commander, General Michael Rose, said referring to the situation in Bihac that 'there is nothing much we can do as peacekeepers when both sides are determined to fight a war'. I believe that the diplomatic process has largely faltered and stalled because the conflicting participants have always thought they could achieve more militarily and therefore have not been focusing all their efforts on political negotiations. This is partly the result of the fact that each party so firmly believes in the correctness of its cause. In July last year I visited Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as the other countries of the former Yugoslavia, as a member of an International Parliamentary Union delegation. But after nine days and meeting with 54 various government and United Nations officials, I do not pretend to hold the key to how we can put an end to this misery. I witnessed first hand the negotiations break down. I was in Pale on the day that the Bosnian Serbs rejected the United Nations contact group's proposal for peace, which would have seen 51 per cent of the disputed territory under the Croatian Bozniak Federation and 49 per cent under the Bosnian Serbs. If this is what my colleague calls cantonment, then that has been a cantonment which has been accepted by the Bosnian government, not something which has been forced upon it by others. At the time, a meeting of foreign ministers representing the various countries involved in the peacekeeping actions agreed, amongst other things, to extend sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and to tighten enforcement of existing sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs. I think we saw in that a genuine attempt by the UN to isolate those elements in Serbia who were of the belief that assistance was being given to the Bosnian Serbs. We saw a positive response by the Serbian government to close its border and ensure that those sanctions were fair dinkum. The foreign ministers also concluded that, in the event of the continuing rejection of the contact group's proposal, the arms embargo would be lifted. The US, similarly, was threatening to pull out of the UN action if the embargo was not lifted. However, I did not then and still do not believe that lifting the arms embargo will further the resolution of this conflict; it will only extend it. Indeed, having talked to a number of people in parts of the former Yugoslavia, it became obvious that, if the arms embargo were lifted, BosniaHerzegovina would become a free fire zone. When people there talk of this dispute, they do not talk of what happened last week or last month; they talk of what happened 50, 100 and sometimes 200 years ago. They talk of minorities being persecuted and discriminated against, of cultural and language differences. No doubt, these things simmered along under the lid of the former communist regime but now they have come to the surface. During my visit, I was struck by the fact that just about every person I met held very definite views as to what was the cause of the conflict and who was responsible for it; and it was certainly never one of them. Everyone was willing to apportion blame to somebody else. Most of the people I spoke with focused their attention more on the historical causes and the errors and injustices of the past rather than on considering what one should do for the future. For centuries, Bosnia has been the fault line between the East and the West. The armies of Europe and the East marched back and forth, littering the country with a rich mixture of religions and races. As a previous speaker said, the spark to ignite the powder keg that became the First World War occurred in Sarajevo, when the Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated by a Serb nationalist. I firmly believe that should the UN lift the arms embargo it would be all-out war in Bosnia-Herzegovina on a scale that we have not yet seen. The conflict would spread to Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia-Montenegro--and who knows where else. I do not think that people, from the safety of Australia, should underestimate the extent to which this war will extend if there is all-out fighting in BosniaHerzegovina. It would seem, from my experience there, that both sides are quite interested in having a fight. As for the argument that without lifting the arms embargo the Bosnian Croats and Muslims are being deprived of essential means to defend themselves, I know that in spite of the existing sanctions some measure of military balance between the different armed forces is already being reached. In the words of one senior Bosnian government member with whom I met, 'We are much stronger and more motivated now.' I do not know how good it is to be motivated about the idea of having a war. I would hope that people might be a bit more motivated about having peace. I think there needs to be some form of systematic effort to re-establish confidence between all the parties. Political negotiation is, to my mind, the only way to arrive at a comprehensive and lasting settlement of this conflict. The other side of this Bosnian equation is the Serb enclaves in Croatia. The present arrangement, whereby the United Nations offers protection to Serb minorities in these territories and assists further cooperation on economic and social issues, must be maintained. Only over time, with a strengthening of democratic and legal institutions, can a lasting political solution be reached. The constitutional arrangements suggested by the contact group, whereby the Croats and the Muslims can enter into a confederation with Croatia, must be matched, in my view, by the ability of the Bosnian Serbs to enter into a confederation with Serbia-Montenegro. In addition, Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia, Serbia-Montenegro, should recognise each other within the borders of the respective republics as defined at the time of the former Yugoslavia. All efforts should be made to draw Croatia into Europe, particularly the Council of Europe and the European Union. It is most unfortunate that in recent weeks, despite a four-month cease-fire, negotiations on the contact group's proposal for territorial divisions have stalled again, with the Bosnian Serbs refusing to come to the table. The cease-fire has slowed the fighting, although it is badly frayed around the edges and clashes have continued, particularly in the Bihac enclave and intermittently around Sarajevo. Like everyone else, I am disappointed by this latest turn of events but I do not think should lose heart. Blaming the United Nations peacekeeping forces for the ineptitude and intransigence of others is a pointless exercise. Handing out more bullets will certainly not put an end to the shooting. The conflict will be resolved only by agreement. In the meantime the best we can do, and what the UN protection forces have been doing, is contain the fighting and assist the civil population. A lasting peace in the Balkans can be achieved only when they rule off the book of history and start rebuilding confidence in democratic institutionsinstitutions in which there has not been much experience in that part of the world. A legal system that can deliver justice, and can be seen to deliver justice, regardless of race and creed would be a good beginning. A lasting peace can be made only with a true commitment to respect human rights. In this respect, I congratulate and commend the UN forces, particularly General Rose, who concluded his tour of duty last month. This is not a simple issue and it is not an issue on which one should take partisan sides. People need to see that what we are looking at here is confidence building that has never before been exhibited in that region of the world. To provide more bullets and to provide more arms is certainly not the answer, as is proposed by this motion. (Time expired)",30
19,Mr ANDREWS,MACKILLOP,"Menzies) (2.21 p.m.)Since the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina voted for their independence from the Yugoslav federation on I March 1992, there has been almost non-stop fighting amongst ethnically divided forces. As referred to by previous speakers, despite efforts of the United Nations and other nations-such as Britain, the United States and France-to obtain a cease-fire and diplomatic settlement of the conflict, the fighting has not only continued but escalated, resulting in tens of thousands of casualties. There have been countless incidents of the most egregious human rights violations, such as rape and torture-in fact, the worse in Europe since the end of the Second World War. I find it somewhat disingenuous that the previous speaker, the honourable member for we Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), talks about the escalation of some sort of free fire zone if the conditions change, given the nature of that conflict over the last three years. The United Nations initially responded to the conflict by repeatedly demanding an unconditional cease-fire and initiating a trade embargo against the remaining Yugoslav federation, which had been suspected of assisting the Bosnian Serbs carry out their acts of aggression. Additionally, the United Nations passed a resolution to deliver humanitarian aid to the victims of the aggression in Bosnia, authorising the use of force to carry out this objective. But the atrocities did not stop and the government of BosniaHerzegovina repeatedly asked the UN for deployment of military force in order to stop the war. The whole world has turned to the UN for a solution to this problem. Years into the conflict, however, there is a growing concern that the United Nations is incapable of effectively dealing with the problem. Night after night, images of warfare are beamed into living rooms throughout this nation and elsewhere around the world. We see images of destruction, the razing of once stately buildings to the ground and the brutalising of a whole population. One clear message comes through from those images, and that is the impotency of the United Nations. The traditional role of the UN has been threefold: to provide humanitarian aid; to aid in the negotiation between warring and disputing parties; and to assist in peacekeeping. The latter has traditionally favoured no military intervention into the domestic affairs of a nation, although an expanded peacekeeping role has been recognised and implemented gradually. The current situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina illuminates the ineffectiveness of the UN's peacekeeping powers. In response to the conflict, the UN has repeatedly demanded permanent and unconditional cease-fire, and peaceful settlement. Numerous cease-fire agreements have been signed but immediately ignored. It is interesting to note that the Secretary-General of the UN, Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, noted the limitations of the UN when he said in a speech: Each international war in modern history has been followed by a ""turning-point,"" at which nations convene to shape a new world order. After the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna met in 1815. After World War I, there was Versailles. After World War II, the United Nations (""UN."") was created at San Francisco. When the Cold War ended, a system of international relations also departed. Thereafter, when troubles arose, individual states turned to the for guidance, as it was a foundation already in place. At this point in time, we have reached another such turning-point in world history. Yet, no new international gathering has come in the wake of the Cold War; no Vienna, no Versailles, and no new San Francisco is to be expected. The UN. as it exists may serve as the only forum. Yet the images of international paralysis in the face of national intransigence abound. Each time Serbia pledges to stay out of the war in Bosnia, reports follow almost immediately to the contrary. Just this morning, the Herald-Sun reported: UN troops witnessed what they described yesterday as the most flagrant violation yet of Serbia's pledge to stay out of the war in Bosnia. Peacekeepers said 15 to 20 Serbian government helicopters landed just outside the eastern Muslim enclave of Srebrenica, apparently to resupply Bosnian Serb forces. Given the state that we have reached in international affairs, it is time to consider what Brian Urquhart, former UN Under Secretary General for Special Political Affairs, wrote some time ago in the New York Times: A third category ofinternational military operation is needed, somewhere between peacekeeping and large-scale enforcement. It would be intended to put an end to random violence and to provide a reasonable degree of peace and order so that humanitarian relief work could go forward and a conciliation process could commence ... [S]uch troops would be required to take, initia!iy at least, certain combat risks in bringing the violence under control. The ongoing problems point to this direction. (Time expired)",32
20,Mr GRACE,MACKILLOP,"I rise today to support the motion put forward by the member for Moore (Mr Filing). In doing so, I acknowledge with respect the many friends I have from each of the main ethnic groups of the former Yugoslavia, all of whom are affected in some way by the continuing sore on the collective conscience of the international community. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not support war and I do not speak today in support of war. From one who has lost both parents and nine other close relatives during World War II, you can be assured that I, more than most, have UN. a particular aversion to the type of war where ordinary citizens are used as targets for bombs. I do, however, support fairness. It is my belief that the people of BosniaHerzegovina have never been given a fair go. I cannot believe how the international community has just stood by and silently watched as the majority of Bosnians have been served up on a platter to the Bosnian Serb forces. In recent months we have heard much in this place about the labelling of goods and the use of the words 'Made in Australia'. Make no mistake about the label on the platter used to serve up the people of Bosnia. Its label is absolutely clear and accurate: 'Made by the United Nations'. The Bosnian government and the people it represents have been crying out for help from the international community and the United Nations in particular since 1992. They have continually stated that the UNsponsored embargo was affecting their ability to defend themselves against the Bosnian Serb aggression, let alone any thought of counterattack. What did the United Nations do at the time? It sat on its hands while hundreds of thousands of innocent people were killed and maimed. People talk about a war not escalating! It continues to sit on its hands while innocent people of Bihac are being killed and maimed. Those innocent people deserve far better-far better from a body that is supposed to assist. Flicking through a United Nations report on the situation in the former Yugoslavia recently, I came across a section which stated: It soon became clear that the most valuable contribution the United Nations could make at that stagethat is, 1991was a peace-keeping operation to create the necessary conditions for the pursuit of political negotiaUnited tions for a peaceful settlement. A joke in context! It is now 1995, and we are still waiting for the conditions to materialise. It became clear to everyone a long time ago--everyone except the United Nationsthat the necessary conditions were never going to eventuate as long as the Serbs were allowed to get away with aggressively taking whatever they wanted. Even today, the Bosnian Serbs refuse to come to any agreement-particularly regarding the proposal being touted by the so-called contact group. I firmly believe that the majority of Bosnians, Muslims and Croats have every right to feel betrayed by the United Nations and the international community. In July last year, in an attempt to come to some sort of negotiated peace, the MuslimCroat federation accepted a plan that would see Bosnia divided-a division that, in simple terms, would reward the Serbian aggressors. However, the proposal was accepted by the Muslims and the Croats as a price that they were willing to pay for peace. In spite of this, and as late as today, the Bosnian Serbs still refuse to accept the plan. Overlaid on this lack of action by the Bosnian Serbs, we have had the circus of the US envoy, Charles Thomas, saying in December that the contact group sticks to the contact group plan, whereas in January, and in direct contravention of the United Nations Security Council resolution not to hold discussions with the Bosnian Serbs, he offered the contact plan to the Bosnian Serb leaders as a starting point for negotiations. The Muslims in Bosnia must today feel really sold out, and who can blame them? They have deserved better from us all. While I fear that nothing has been done with any contact plan in Bosnia at present, it is my considered view that the United Nations must stand condemned for its inaction and its inability to protect the people of Bosnia and, in particular, the people of Bihac. (Time expired).",33
21,Mr CAMERON,MACKILLOP,"It is with some regret that I am speaking on this motion today. My regret stems from the inaction and apparent uncaring attitude of the Nations and its lack of involvement in this unfortunate conflict, which has allowed the fighting to continue. I commend the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) on moving this motion. It is not the first time either he or I have spoken on the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict. In August 1993 the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) moved a motion deploring the continuing loss of life caused by the conflict-a motion which received cross-party support. Today, 18 months on, we continue to witness the bloodshed. The new year cease-fire negotiated by former US President Jimmy Carter now seems to have been futile. The renewed fighting in Bihac certainly put an end to that. What annoys me is: why is this happening? Going back to the lowest common denominator, we are all human beings. It is irrelevant whether one is from Australia, the United States, the former republic of Yugoslav or wherever-we are all human beings. Yet we continue today-after two world wars, many other conflicts, and the deaths of millions of people-to see human beings pitted against one another and killing each other. All the while, we have the United Nations viewing from the sidelines as innocent men, women and children are being slaughtered. I realise I am straying a bit but I stood for parliament not just because I wanted to make a contribution to the administration of this wonderful nation, but to hopefully be part of a parliament which had some impact, however small, on international events. We admittedly have our problems: drought stricken farmers, horrendous debt, homelessness and unemployment. Whilst these should be our primary concern, it does not diminish our responsibility to assist other less fortunate nations. We cannot and should not ignore the poverty of many African nations; we cannot ignore the violence of the Middle East; and we cannot ignore the conflict in BosniaHerzegovina. For goodness sake, we assisted in the Iraq-Kuwait conflict-and 1 hope it was for the right reasons and not just because of the massive oil stocks there. We did our bit to end apartheid in South Africa. We have sent assistance to Rwanda. Now it is time for Australia, as a member of the United Nations, to force the United Nations to do more than just be a toothless tiger. It is time to force action: greater action in Bosnia, greater action in Rwanda, greater action in the Middle East. Our government has surrendered many legislative responsibilities to the United Nations, and that has been quite controversial over the last few years here in Australia. Let us now see the government force the UN to act on more important responsibilities. Its prime responsibility should be enforcing peace throughout the globe. The United Nations has the ability to be powerful. With the membership including the nations of America, Britain, France and Australia, to name just a few, surely we can use the backing of each nation's government to force the United Nations to act. It is all well and good having a body like the United Nations, but it is pointless having it if it is just going to be full of verbal diarrhoea and lacking in action. It is time for it to get involved, to bring the international community together to solve these problems. It is worth casting our minds back to the IraqKuwait conflict. The UN acted immediately with the support of the Americans, British, French and Australians to liberate Kuwait after Iraq's invasion. It was unfortunate that many Iraqis were killed-so too were people of other nations. But the fact is, with the joint forces of the UN membership, Iraq was forced out of Kuwait. It hurts me to say it, but some deaths were inevitable. However, it was minimal when you compare it with the number of people who would have been killed if there was no international involvement. Now why, it must be asked, is the same not taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina?",34
22,Mr SLIPPER,MACKILLOP,No oil.,35
23,Mr CAMERON,MACKILLOP,"Having no oil could have something to do with it. Why has the United Nations dilly-dallied around while innocent women, men and children are being murdered? Cease-fire agreements are not working, peace talks are failing, and it is time for action and commitment. While I concur with the sentiments of this motion, it must be asked: will this debate assist in any way? We spoke on this 18 months ago, and nothing happened. Thousands of people have continued to be killed between now and then. I would urge you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to pass this debate on to the minister responsible and urge him to make representations to the United Nations, advising that Australia supports an enforcement of the cease-fire, even if it means sending in troops and enforcing it with military force. We owe it to the innocent women, men and children, our fellow human beings to ensure this conflict ends, and ends quickly.  degree of bipartisan concern is expressed in the motion for the people of Bosnia and the suffering that they have endured and the fact that peace does not look to be in sight. I want to take the same tack as that taken by the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) in his contribution. A number of speakers have spoken of the failure of the UN in peacekeeping. It is not possible for the UN to bring peace to a country where there is no willingness by a side to have peace brokered, which is clearly the case in BosniaHerzegovina. It is really unfortunate that the Europeans, who are so unctuous about human rights abuses in our region of the world where we have not seen ethnic conflicts break out as they have in Bosnia-Herzegovina, are showing a real lack of willpower to lem. When looking at the problems in BosniaHerzegovina, we should go back a little earlier in time and look at the premature recognition by Germany of the independence of Croatia. Clearly, whilst the world community was urging Bosnia to have a referendum about its future, no consideration was given by the world community, particularly the Europeans, to what would happen if Bosnia elected to opt out of the former Republic of Yugoslavia. Other members have referred to the atrocities that have been committed in Bosnia and that I too condemn. However, it also needs to be placed on the record that the atrocities have not been all one sided. It is true to say that there are more refugees on the Serbian side in the former Republic of Yugoslavia than on the other two sides. The world's media has not always been even-handed in its reporting of the plight of refugees, the hunger and the starvation. I do not believe that we will ever see an intact state of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The contact group is recommending a split. I had some sympathy for the position advocated by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) because I felt that, if the world community cannot broker peace, let us at least have an equality of opportunity in arms and fighting capacity. However, should arms flow to the Bosnian side, I am convinced that one of the first things that would happen would be that the UN peacekeepers would move out. Whilst the role of the UN peacekeepers has been limited, and whilst it has not been as successful as both sides in this debate would wish, I am sure that we would see-and the Bosnian government accepted this-a new slaughter of civilians in Bosnia. In the limited time that is left to me, I want to point out that in my electorate there are Serbs, Croatians and Bosnian Muslims. I really feel for what they suffered in their former homeland so many miles away. But I want to compliment those communities because, notwithstanding the emotion, the feeling and the sympathy, by and large, all sides have conducted themselves in an exemresolve this prob- plary manner. I believe that the solution in BosniaHerzegovina will be a negotiated one, and I say that to the Serbs and to all people. It will be won by force of arms; it will be a negotiated solution-a solution that in principle will be very unacceptable and very disappointing but in practical terms that will be the solution. Once we get peace, and that peace will not come soon enough, we will then have the real challenge, as the honourable member for Watson pointed out, about confidence building. These people will have to live together. The tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina is that Catholic, Muslim and orthodox religions had a long history of living peacefully together. I find it disappointing that in international affairs we appear to be striving for the lowest common denominator in terms of nationalism. I hope that that does not break out in our region. (Time expired)",35
24,Mr SLIPPER,MACKILLOP,"At this stage of the debate I think it is appropriate to outline once again to the House the motion that was so ably moved by my colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing): That this House: (I) deplores the abject failure of the UN to protect the people of Bihac, Bosnia-Herzegovina, from attack by the forces of the Bosnia Serbs and their allies; (2) calls on the UN to lift its sanctions on arms supplies to the armed forces of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and (3) rejects proposals to divide or cantoniseBosnia and Herzegovina. As the previous speaker, the honourable  a very large degree of bipartisanship in this debate. Everyone in Australia, certainly everyone in the coalition, is totally opposed to the human tragedy which unfolds daily in the unfortunate nation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. One ought to bear in mind that the UN has had a fairly major role to play in BosniaHerzegovina and other parts of the former Yugoslavia over the past few years. The role of the UN has been multifaceted: it has been responsible for aid, it has helped negotiations and it has certainly been involved in peacekeeping. But the Bosnians have every cause for concern when they look at the role of the UN because the role of the UN in BosniaHerzegovina has certainly not been evenhanded. The honourable member for Chifley suggested there ought to be a negotiated settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Everyone in Australia would applaud were that to occur. But, sadly, despite the fact that talks seem to go on interminably and despite the fact that we have had so many cease-fires--each of which appears to have been broken, particularly by the Bosnian Serbs-it seems to me that there is absolutely no will on the part of the Bosnian Serbs to have a negotiated peace and, indeed, to resolve the conflict in a civilised way that people throughout Australia would wish to see. Therefore, if the UN is not able to bring about a successful, negotiated solution which will last, obviously we need to even up the odds; we need to give all sides in BosniaHerzegovina equal opportunity to compete. Like the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), I certainly do not defend war, but at the moment we have the Bosnian Serbs with an almost limitless supply of arms able to effect aggression constantly on the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the moment the Bosnians are simply unable to defend themselves, and while the arms embargo remains in place that will continue to be the situation. Undoubtedly the situation in BosniaHerzegovina is a mess; it has been a mess for a number of years. But in 1992 the people of that nation elected to become an independent country. They were recognised internationally as a nation, and Australia too recognised them as a nation. Unfortunately, the Bosnian Serbs have not been prepared to accept that decision by the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, they have not been prepared to accept the decision of the international community, and of course the result is the debacle that we currently have. A number of years ago I visited BosniaHerzegovina as a private individual. I was amazed to find that in Sarajevo there were about a million Serbs, a million Muslims and perhaps 800,000 Croat Catholics working and living together. I believe that if the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina were given the opportunity to live in peace they would. But, unfortunately, there has been aggression from Serbia and from the rump Yugoslavia. Therefore, I think it is important to deplore the failure of the UN to protect the people. We should also call for the lifting of sanctions. Mr SPEAKER.....,...()rder! It being 2.45 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 104A. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Monday. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Australia-Antarctic Alliance",36
25,Mr NEHL,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Cowper}---I rise to speak as the convener of the Australian Parliamentary Antarctic Alliance, a group of members and senators from all parties who have visited Antarctica. I congratulate Dr Pat Quilty, the Assistant Director of Science of the Australian Antarctic Division, and all members of the Australian National Antarctic Research expeditions in Antarctica at this moment on their amazing discovery at marine plain in the Vestfold Hills near our base at Davis. Dr Quilty and his assistants have found the fossil remains of a dolphin 3 Y:z million years old. It is 8.5 metres long and the skull is one metre long. The average dolphin today is three metres in length. It is a most important and exciting discovery of a species previously unknown. They have also found what could be described as a whale graveyard with 20 specimens found at one spot. There are seven sites. This is the first excavation that has been undertaken in Antarctica. It was done with great difficulty, in extreme cold and in conditions which none of us would believe if we had not been there. On behalf of the parliament and the Australian Parliamentary Antarctic Alliance, I congratulate them all on the marvellous job they have done for Australia and for world science. Bankruptcy",37
26,Mr ABBOTT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I rise to draw the parliament's attention to a potential anomaly in the Bankruptcy Act and to an actual injustice done to one of my constituents. I refer to a constituent of mine who is a bankrupt. Under the Bankruptcy Act, he has been assessed to make contributions to his creditors on the basis of deemed income: namely, the free accommodation he receives from his parents. Meanwhile, after he was assessed to make this contribution, in Alan Bond's case, the Federal Court held that gifts from family members were not assessable for the purposes of contributions under the Bankruptcy Act. The official receiver then wrote to my constituent advising him that he had paid excess contributions, but stated that, under section 139ZH of the Bankruptcy Act, excess contributions cannot be refunded. It seems to me that, if the official receiver was not entitled to collect the contribution, he is not entitled to keep it. I want to draw the government's attention to this anomaly. It seems to me that the phrase 'as bankrupt as Bondy' has become a byword for luxurious living in this country. It would be a terrible thing if this government or this parliament were to permit there to be one law for the rich and another for the poor-a lax law for rich bankrupts like Alan Bond and a stringent law for poor bankrupts like my constituent. Child Care",38
27,Mr HAVILAND,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Surprise, surprise! On 25 March there will be an election in New South Wales and what do we now have? Suddenly the New South Wales government wants to sign an agreement with the Commonwealth to provide 12,900 childcare places to the people of New South Wales. For the last four years the New South Wales government has refused to sign that same agreement with the Commonwealth, thereby denying young families of New South Wales getting those child-care places funded by the Commonwealth. The same thing that happened before the 1991 state election, when Premier Greiner wanted to announce childcare places arising out of the 1988 federal government strategy, leaving it until a week before the election, has happened again-just as I predicted in my grievance speech of 19 September last year. The federal government had been requesting the New South Wales and Victorian governments for four years to sign that agreement. But in its desperate attempt to play politics, the New South Wales Liberal government refused to sign that Commonwealth-state agreement, thereby denying the young families of New South Wales child-care places. But now there is a state election and it suddenly wants to sign the agreement. The funny thing about that is that the Commonwealth government has not heard anything from the New South Wales government. As the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) pointed out in the Senate five minutes ago, her office has not heard from the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government is announcing to all and sundry that it is finally going to sign this agreement. What political cynicism! That is typical of what we can expect from the Liberal Party, typical of what we can expect from the opposition here, and typical of what we can expect from the New South Wales government. The New South Wales government has not even had the courtesy to reply to the letters that have come from the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and from the Minister for Family Services. Now the New South Wales government wants to give out child care (Time expired) Unemployment",38
28,Mr CLEARY,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"The unemployment figures published in the Age this morning are something to worry about. In the north-west of Melbourne the figure is recorded at 14.6 per cent. This includes my own electorate of Wills, part of the electorate of Calwell which is the electorate of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous), parts of the electorate of Maribyrnong which is held by the former minister for industry, the honourable member for Maribymong (Mr Griffiths), parts of the electorate of Batman which is represented by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), and parts of the electorate of Lalor which is represented by the President of the Australian Labor Party, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). Of 15to 19-year-olds in the labour force, 56.5 per cent are out of work. That compares with the Australian average of 26.9 per cent. So much for economic restructuring, for the so-called recovery, for regional economic development and for Better Cities! The would be member for Wills, Australian Labor Party candidate, Kelvin Thomson, was bragging about the so-called fall in unemployment. He said unemployment fell by 40 per cent in the north-west. He praised the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for his job creating abilities. He would say that, wouldn'the? The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) will tell us that mobile telephone charges are down and that plane fares and telephone calls to Sydney are cheaper. That is going to do the people in the north-west a lot of good. Bill Hunter, a great actor and by all accounts a decent bloke, has been recruited by the government to endorse the mythology that Working Nation has given us 'job readiness' and that the rosy dawn of full employment is just over the horizon. If that is true, why are all these people in the north-west of Melbourne-the traditional Labor stronghold-out of work? What, are they bludgers or dills? (Time expired) Alcohol Consumption",39
29,Mr GRIFFIN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"I am pleased today to voice my support for the federal government's $2.7 million 'Alcohol-go easy' campaign. A joint initiative of the federal government, the alcohol industry and state and territory governments, 'Alcohol-go easy' will encourage social drinkers aged 25 to 34 years to take stock of their alcohol consumption. That is an age group I just fit into at the moment-at least for another couple of weeks. A secondary target group will be young people aged 18 to 24. Within my local area, Westernport Drug and Alcohol Service statistics showed the need for a change in attitude towards alcohol consumption. In the eight months to February 1995, 93 people sought help through the service for drinking problems; 52 of them had abused alcohol for more than five years. The local figures reinforce national research which indicates that many 'social' drinkers are consuming alcohol well in excess of recommended levels-and harming their healthwithout realising it. Many Australians who think they are moderate drinkers are deluding themselves that their drinking habits are not affecting their health. Contrary to popular thought, much of the cost of alcohol misuse relates to the levels and patterns of social and adult drinking. The National Health and Medical Research Council defines low risk drinking as four standard drinks per day for men and two standards drinks for women, with at least two nondrinking days a week. The campaign is not preaching abstinence; instead it is reaching out to the average Australian with the warning that his or her drinking habits are not as harmless as they may seem. It is about responsible drinking. We are telling people to watch what they consume and take it easy. The campaign is backed by iron-man Trevor Hendy, singer songwriter Joe Camilleri, and world aerobics champion Sue Stanley. I commend it to the House. Unemployment",39
30,Ms WORTH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"Adelaide}-The plight of the unemployed should not be overlooked. The editorial from the Advertiser, which devoted some attention to this subject when heralding the return of John Howard to the leadership of the Liberal Party, should be quoted. The editorial stated that Mr Howard: ... does not have an hour, let alone a'day, spare. Look at today's Australia. Unemployment remains at unacceptable levels. For millions of best. Australians, this means a blighted future. Recession was followed by a patchy recoveryvirtually undetectable in South Australia-which was so badly handled that it has been stopped tracks by the interest rates bludgeon which brought renewed hardship to business, home buyers and everyone with even small credit accounts. The Keating Government's arrogance is exceeded only by its incompetence. Unwilling to cut ing, it actually contemplates putting up taxes, apparently unaware that tax rises on top of vailing interest rates will be ruinous. It has entirely unable to control the balance of payments crisis. Whilst I welcome the improvement in the unemployment figures-the national average now being 8.9 per cent-my concern is for the areas of my electorate where unemployDunkley ment figures are still as high as 25.3 per cent and 14.7 per cent. To remind us of the tragabout edy of unemployment I would like to quote from a letter I recently received: Personally, the human tragedy of unemployment is devastating. Having to confront the unemployment line every fortnight is humiliating, frustrating degrading and can lead to incredibly low se1ffrittered esteem. (Time expired) Kennett Government",40

In the Financial Review today there is a reappraisal of the Western Australian losses with Western Australia Inc. when the Labor governmentthe previous administration of Carmen Lawand rence, Brian Burke and Peter Dowdingaway $1.5 billion of Western Australian taxpayers' money. It is absolutely colossal, and the fallout is still occurring. Mr Court, the Premier of Western Australia, has very kindly given us a breakdown of all that money went to. This is where in the sums of money were lost: $492 million in was lost through the State Government Insurto ance Corporation; $139 million through the cuts. Government Employees Superannuation Board; $39 million through BankWest; $413 he million through the failed Petrochemical Industries Company Ltd; $22.6 million 200 through the merchant bank, Rothwells Ltd; a $139 million through the Teachers Credit Society; and $18.8 million via the Swan Building Society. These are absolutely colossal sums. Mr Court added that there were also contingent claims against the government by Mr Warren Anderson for money lodged with Rothwells, and against the Government Employees Superannuation Board by the Rothwells liquidators, both of which, with interest, total more than $50 million. That must be one of the most disgraceful periods of government in Australia's history, and the current member for Fremantle (Dr Lawrence) participated in it. (Time expired)",40
34,Mr FITZGIBBON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS,"There is considerable unease within the community about the number of boat people and refugees who are trying to enter Australia, and this unease is added to by a whole series of false stories. Every day throughout Australia in some daily paper, in the letters to the editor one can find a story which suggests that all refugees who are accepted into Australia, and some of these boat people, are given ridiculous grants. One letter I read in the Newcastle Morning Herald last week suggested that when refugees gain acceptance into Australia they are immediately given $200,000 and later, if they so need, they can apply for a further loan of $60,000 which does not have to be repaid. These stories are absolute bunkum and responsible editors should get the true facts from the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs before they allow these spurious stories to be published.

If he wants to give history lessons, maybe he should think back to some of the statements he has made about 'beautiful numbers', 'J-curves' and 'bringing home the bacon' - all statements that were made to make him look impressive. But where have we really got to? We have gone down the drain with our deficit. We have gone down the drain with unemployment. If he wants to talk about history lessons, we are quite happy to come into this place and debate history lessons, because a hell of a lot of the history of this Prime Minister and this government needs to be brought before the people. This Prime Minister has tried to use words to justify to the people of Australia the disgraceful situation in which he has us at the moment.

46,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Do not misquote him. What I was saying when I gave that answerI do not know who asked the question-was that in terms of the forward estimates which have been published; as you know, with projections out to 1997-98, outlays come down as a proportion of GOP from an estimated 26.2 per cent for 1994-95 to 24.2 per cent of GOP. I made the point that the government in the 1980s cut outlays from 30Yz per cent of GOP-where your leader, the former Treasurer, left them-to 23 Yz per cent of GOP. That was the largest outlays consolidation in the Western world-seven per cent of GOP. But GOP is about $500 billion so that is about $30 billion to $35 billion of - uts as a proportion of GOP. At 23Yz per cent of GOP you would have to say that is pretty much rock bottom. You would have to say that for running a relatively sophisticated middle-sized OECO economy, 23Yz per cent or 24 per cent of GOP is down at the bottom. There are few other economies in the world that compare with us that have outlays of GOP less than that.",42

48,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those on my left will cease interjecting. The member for Berowra! :tyIr KEATING-I was simply making the pOint that on the government's published estimates of outlays, we have it descending to a projected 24.2 per cent by 1997-98. In other words, I was saying that the underlying level of outlays has not been substantially disturbed other than by the spending on unemployment benefit recipients and other changes which have been driven by unemployment. As unemployment has come down the underlying state of the outlays has not' dramatically changed from the middle 1980s. I have made this point in the House before, and let me make it again, that a measure of the good housekeeping of any government is what it does with its spending and its outlays. In every budget the Commonwealth cuts outlays. In any expenditure review committee round in any budgetary round to make either roofor new policy or to reduce the budget deficit or ad? to the surplus, we cut outlays. We do a review of the budget. We will do it again. That is the point I have made, that is the point that the Minister for Finance made on the weekend. We will do it again. But we will not be cutting $10 billion out as advocated by you on a radio program. Let me refresh your memory. Before Christmas I instanced the fact that on radio you advocated c-ts of up to $10 billion in spending and you t:led t? wor- your way out of it after questIOn time with an explanation which, of course, went nowhere.

No doubt the area where we agree with the Business Council is that the government needs to be more fiscally responsible and that mean$ substantial cuts to expenditure. He said his view was that if the government made savage cuts of $4 billion to $5 billion in the budget then interest rates would not be necessary later in the year. That is what you said. Although Mr _Prosser urged spendirig cuts in the government he would norcommit the opposition to make a more rapid reduction in the budget deficit. When we go over the Business Council lists that he was recommending to us, we see that he included things such as phasing in the reduction in the age of a child for which a parent can be eligible for the sole parent pension, possibly eliminating completely when the child enters secondary school.

It is out to work. It goes on: Or abolish the general subsidy on pharmaceuticals to the tune of $434 million. You are toughening the eligibility criteria for Ailstudy. You have endorsed that.

76,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will conclude on this, the general point. Members of the opposition want to run around as though they are the macho people cutting government spending, with their shadow Treasurer making languid gesticulations about how they are going to do this and they are going to do that. the matter is that whenever they are faced with cuts in outlays of $5 billion to $10 billion, which is the thing they believe in, they run away like a lot of frightened fawns. They then try to focus on the government, whose record shows a reduction in outlays to GDP of seven percentage points-the largest fiscal consolidation in the OECD area at any stage in the postwar years. On the basis of government's record, the best advice I can give the shadow Treasurer is: leave the budget to the government. All you need to do is kick it through the Senate when it turns up.

I am sure that view is not shared by this parliament but it is an unfortunately high percentage of people who regard domestic violence as acceptable. In response to that very horrifying statistic we, together with the states, initiated a number of programs, two of which are still going on. One of those community education programs designed to change those attitudes is 'No means rio' and the other is 'Real men don't bash or rape'. I hope those views are endorsed by this parliament because current events illustrate the magnitude of the problem.

Does he endorse the view that this is something that can be justified because this man, as a New South Wales colleague said, is part of Australia's sporting history, is something of a legend? Does that excuse the attitudes and the behaviour that have been expressed? Does that excuse the views of the New South Wales Premier that he has withheld judgment on the candidate's behaviourdespite the fact that there have been threats made against the woman standing for Cabramatta in this case?

86,Dr LAWRENCE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is not a matter of small significance. We are asking the people of Australia to change their attitudes and views-those of them who hold views that suggest that domestic violence is acceptable. If the political leaders of this country do distance themselves from that sort of attitude, as the Leader of the Opposition should do, then how can we ask that of the wider community? How can I go to the women of this country who have said, in consultation after consultation, that the thing they are most concerned about is violence against women? The people of this country, the women of this country, deserve from the Leader of the Opposition a very clear statement of his opposition to that sort of attitude and for to call on the New South Wales Premier to remove that particular gentleman from his pre-selection. Logging and Woodchipping",45
87,Mr MACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Prime Minister whether he will confirm that the government has received legal advice that the Commonwealth can act to prevent logging and roading of high conservation value forests by state forest agencies and timber companies, using one or more of the following Commonwealth powers: constitutional corporations power and corporations law; the export regulation powers; the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act; the Commonwealth Endangered Species Act; and the Australian Nature Conservation Agency establishment legislation. In view of the announcements by several state premiers that your recommendations will be ignored, will you ensure that the government utilises these powers and any other Commonwealth powers necessary to prevent the logging and roading of the 509 high conservation value forest areas nominated by you for exclusion from export woodchip licences?",45
88,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen any such advice but obviously the Commonwealth has a range of powers beyond the external affairs power, the export control regulations. It is true, as the honourable gentleman said, that certain state governments and premiers have said they will seek to log some of these areas. More is the pity that they have said it, but they have. We have already signed a national forest policy statement. That has been agreed between the Commonwealth and all states, bar Tasmania. We are seeking now to move towards regional forest agreements so that we not can have a representative reserve system and we do not have a compartment by compartment, coupe by coupe change of forests over the period. To engage the states in that cooperative structure-and they have indicated their preparedness to be involved in that by signing the national forest policy statement-is, I think, the way to go, rather than try to use powers to operate forestry from the Comhim monwealth's resources minister's or environment minister's offices. I do not think it is possible for the Commonwealth to run a forestry regime when it does not have forests and it is not primarily responsible for the development, maintenance and operation of forest areas. That is not to say that, in the environment interests, with the imperatives of the environment upon us, there is not a requirement for the Commonwealth and the states together to develop a forest policy; that is an entirely different argument. That is where I think it should go. But the environment movement has been saying that the Commonwealth should now use the corporations power to say that any proprietary limited company or public company should be subject to direction by a Commonwealth minister. That will bring that power into question-at least into challenge, if not into question-and then other industries and other purposes will be enjoined to use the power again. As you know, that power sits behind such things as the Trade Practices Act. I think that it is used without any caprice on the part of the Commonwealth. Remember this: we have the Wilderness Society running around saying that 800 coupes of pristine forests will be desecrated and destroyed. Of course, that is completely untrue. As far as we know-and our knowledge on this is reasonably comprehensive-the 800 coupes do not include pristine stands of trees at all. This sort of recitation of untruths--as though in some way these people are invested with some sort of high moral purpose and if the government does not fall into line with them we are therefore desecrating forests-is a very false view to have been put afoot. In my view, it does nothing for the very objective that the same people want.",45
89,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Where did 511 come from then?,46
90,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not heard from you in three years. That is why I think those who are legitimately interested in the environment and the preservation of important stands of native forests should at least make sure that what we are seeking to preserve are important stands of pristine forests. The fact that they are trying to say that any number recommended by the environment movement represents pristine stands of trees is a blatant misrepresentation of their position and the government's position. As I said last week in the House, the government is seeking to come to the right decision about this and get the right balance between the imperatives of the environment and the protection for the nation of the heritage values of these particular native forests, and a sustainable timber industry that is basically built on plantation and regrowth forests and which the community wishes to maintain. I think that is the objective. The way to meet the objective is basically through regional forest agreements. I know where the honourable gentleman's question has come from but I do not think that the Commonwealth is in a position to say to him in reply, 'Yes, we will use the endangered species corporations power, stretch further the external affairs power and effectively seek to manage particular logging and particular compartments in various forests around the country.' That is why this debate has been so very unfair.",46
91,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,46
92,Mr KEATING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It does not matter where you are coming from-your side of politics or ours. The fact of the matter is that people run around with enthusiasm, saying that we should lock everything away and, if we do not, in some way the Commonwealth is dropping the ball. They do this when, as the member said in his question, state premiers are actually saying that they are in charge of the logging process. The New South Wales premier is going to an election at the end of March. The environment movement, the Wilderness Society and others should get on to him and say, 'You have the chainsaw in your hand-not the Commonwealth. You stop it.' But, when a lot of these characters who are comfortable only in the air-conditioned surrounds of the press gallery and press boxes get out there on Macquarie Street with John Fahey, it is all a bit too hard. But the fact of the matter is that, as Premier Groom and Premier Fahey have made abundantly clear, they are the authorities and they are going to continue. The fact that they have put their hand up and identified themselves as the relevant authorities in saying whether certain sawlogs are taken or not in this season would, one would think, get the environment movement to at least pay them a visit or even send them a fax. But maybe that is asking too much. Housing",46
93,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Housing and Regional Development. Is it a goal of the government's housing policy to provide affordable housing to Australians on low incomes? Does the better cities program have an affordable housing component? If so, can the Deputy Prime Minister inform the House of his response to the Western Australian government's attitude to affordable housing for the East Perth better cities project in my electorate? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, in the phrasing of that question, clearly the member is asking for government policy, details of government policy and an announcement in respect of government policy. That offends standing order 144(b) and, as such, should be ruled out of order.",46
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not think policy would be announced in the response that the Deputy Prime Minister will give, but I will listen very carefully to the answer.",47
95,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question is out of order, not the answer. We haven't heard it yet.",47
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is quite right. You haven't heard it.,47
97,Mr HOWE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I acknowledge the interests of the honourable member in the issue of affordable housing and in the very exciting redevelopment of the East Perth housing site. The government is absolutely committed to the issue of affordable housing. Against that record of the government's commitment to and achievements in affordable housing, one needs to contrast the attitudes and policies not only of the Western Australian government but also of conservative governments, such as that which existed between 1977 and 1983. Fundamental to delivering affordable housing is the Commonwealth-state housing agreement. During 1977 and 1983, there was a reduction in the real levels of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement funding by the order of two-thirds. This shortfall of something like $2 billion of investment left a legacy of neglect and severe shortages in the public housing stock. It was also associated with extremely high levels of unemployment in the housing industry. There were all-time low levels of finance for home loans. Around 20,000 dwellings were financed each month in 1982. In 1994, we are financing around 50,000 dwellings each month. There were low levels of investment and residential investment property. Under Labor, this has risen from $200 million in 1983 to $1.4 billion in 1994. During that particular period, we saw a government in office that had absolutely no commitment to the issue of affordable housing. That was very clearly reflected in the government's record, where each successive year one saw reductions in public housing and therefore reductions in the capacity of the government to protect those who were most in need of housing. What is more: we saw a lack of commitment to activity in the housing industry, which caused widespread unemployment and problems of affordability for middle income earners. The issue of affordability relates not only to housing in general but also to the opportunities provided for redevelopment. Almost every state government has a commitment to urban consolidation and those state governments are seeing quite large scale redevelopment. This morning's Financial Review reports on the increased level of activity in Honeysuckle in Newcastle. In every major Australian city, substantial redevelopment is occurring. The issue of housing is crucially important, particularly when the Commonwealth facilitates what the honourable member for Perth would regard as a very significant redevelopment. It is one that will bring people ?ack into the heart of Perth. It will be very Important for the central business district. It links the city to the Swan River and takes advantage of the historic area where the origins of Perth lay. That very significant redevelopment should be associated with opportunities for affordable housing. The commitment from the government of Western Australia is for 50 units of affordable housing out of 2,000 units that will be built in that redevelopment. That is the point that I am trying to hammer home. We have conservatives like the Leader of the Opposition. Given a chance, he will demonstrate absolutely no commitment to equity; no commitment to fairness",47

Renting privately, they lost two per cent under the coalition. Under Labor, they picked up 19.3 per cent. When opposition members question me about family certainty, or certainty for families, they should not be so completely hypocritical and disingenuous to talk about families when they cut family incomes to pieces. So when John Howard talks about families, yes, he is in favour of families but he is not in favour of family support.

But their record is in the past, and their record in the present is that they do not believe in these sorts of income supports. That is demonstrated by' the factMr Andrews-Could I take a point of order, Mr Speaker? Under standing order 145 you said in reply to me earlier that the Prime Minister was coming to the question.

138,Mr GRIFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. Can the minister advise' the House of how well Australia's system of retirement income support meets the needs of both pensioners and the broader community? How does our system compare with those in other countries?,50
139,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It is of course a very important issue, particularly in light of the ageing of Australia's population which will raise very significantly the number of people of aged pension age both in absolute terms and as a proportion of the population. an area where we have to get it right, and were it is an area where we have to think long In light of that I draw the attention of members of the House to a recent World Bank report titled Averting the old age crisis: we policies to protect the old and promote growth which was published by the World Bank late last year. It goes to a number of those key issues. It defines a number of features of retirement income assistance that it considers to be compatible with the ageing pattern that is going on throughout the world. The World Bank advocates a system that has three basic pillars: firstly, a public pillar which aims to alleviate poverty and which is highly and efficiently targeted; secondly, a mandatory private sector pillar to encourage to savings; and, thirdly, voluntary occupational and personal savings plans. So a three-tiered structure of retirement income provision is what it advocates., The same report makes the point that the system that we have evolved here and are continuing to develop through our targeted aged pension - ystem, and also through' the introduction of the superannuation guarantee charge, is act,uallY very compatible with this approach. Michael Stutchbury, commenting on that report in the Financial Review, referred to the report asbracketing Australia at the international forefront of efforts to head off a looming global crisis of old The study suggests that Labor's combination of a more means-tested public pension and the introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee Levy is a far-sighted move which will make the greying of Australia less financially painful than in most other industrialised countries. That is a pretty good indication, in terms of the basic structure of our system, that we have it basically right. At the moment we are reviewing the operation of the pension income and assets test, but the basic three legs that the World Bank report refers to indicate that we have essentially got it right. Now what does the opposition say about all this? I note that the opposition is very concerned to reduce the budget deficit and to reduce the level of Commonwealth outlays. It repeatedly expresses its great concern that public expenditures need to be appropriately targeted. In light of that, it is absolutely extraordinary to see the opposition spokesman on social security matters, the honourable member for Berowra, continuing to suggest imply that the opposition would contemplate the introduction of a so-called universal aged pension, that is to say, an aged pension payable irrespective of income and assets testing. The cost of removing the income and test on the aged pension Â·in a full year amounts to about $5 billion. It would mean paying aged pensions to multimillionaires. It is a preposterous suggestion which the opposied tion knows full well it cannot possibly deliver. But the honourable member for Berowra, in a press release dated 20 January referring to the Ageing Agendas' report on incomes and assets tests, among other things, says: The Report also fails recommending to the Governare ment that it investigate the option of implementing a universal pension. It is unwise and short-sighted to dismiss out of exist? hand the opportunity to consider cost effective ways of implementing a more broadly based system of benefits ... In other words, the opposition is saying that we should have the concept of a universal pension under active consideration. Not did the government consider the suggestion of the universal age pension, but also the concept gums! was subject to very detailed examination by the government's retirement income modelling task force, which is made up of officials from Finance, Treasury and Social Security. Gippsland. The task force's report, commentary and analysis of the most significant universal pension proposal, which came from the Institute of Actuaries, says:. The net result of the lower private higher age pension in the IAA proposal is to produce lower incomes for the couples earning less than 100% of AWE but higher incomes for the couples whose wage rate was A WE or above .. In other woÂ·rds, a thoroughly regressive redistribution of income. This comes from same mob who expect us to believe they have a concern with social equity and inequality. Members will remember the debates last and questions where. they purported to have some concern for that. The reality is that the opposition has no policy coherency on deficit reduction or fiscal policy and it has no policy coherency on retirement incomes. The member for Berowra or seemed to say we should keep open the option of a universal pension-in contrast to the Leader of the National Party, who said some interesting things implying that retirement income should be left to families. There is no . policy coherency there and no credibility on assets fiscal policy or anything. else. Logging and WOQdchipping",50

153,Mr BEDDALL,PAIRS,"As I said in question time last week, the list was compiled by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. Last week I forwarded it to the states. Obviously, the member for Barker has not caught up with events that have taken place since then. Cabinet met last Thursday. It decided that those coupes that were currently being logged-that had been approved for logging in 1993 and 1994, and carried forward into 1995-would be assessed quickly, some time by the end of this week. Those coupes would then be released and the remaining coupes would be assessed in about eight weeks time. That is the procedure we should follow. For the information of the member, officers of the Commonwealth are meeting in Tasmania today to progress that process. South Africa:Â·HeaIth Insurance",53
154,Ms DEAHM,PAIRS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. Is it true that the South African government's development of arrangements to finance its national health scheme is being greatly assisted by the Australian aid program, and that this program is making available to it the advice of Dr John Deeble, one of the architects of Australia's health insurance scheme, Medicare?",53
155,Mr BILNEY,PAIRS,"I thank the honourable member for her question. She, like most Australians, has been the beneficiary of Medicare-the great national universal health insurance program which this government put into place and has defended against the attacks of the opposition at every election since. It is true, as the member says in her question, that the South African government has been so impressed with Dr Deeble's work that it has invited him to join its health finance commission, the job of which is to develop and implement a national health finance plan for the new South Africa. The national health finance committee produced a draft report for Mrs Zuma, the South African minister for health in the Mandela government, in December 1994. It had three options, one of which was essentially the Deeble proposal. In January John Deeble was asked by the minister for health to join the health commission because his advice had been accepted. That is very gratifying on two counts. The first is that it demonstrates that Australian expertise and Australian innovation in public policy are world's best practice, recognised as having something unique and valuable to offer the world. Secondly, it demonstrates that our aid program is making a real contribution to building a just society in South Africa in the post-apartheid regime. I remind the House that when the new South African government was inaugurated on 10 May, the Australian government announced a three-year $30 million aid commitment to South Africa; that is, a 35 per cent increase. The objectives of that program were, firstly, to assist the government in its delivery of basic needs for the millions of people previously disadvantaged under apartheid; secondly, to assist in human resource development, capacity building and institutional strengthening of all the institutions that need to be developed; and, thirdly, to contribute to the democratisation of the state and society, with particular attention to the needs of women. Dr Deeble's work will make a great difference in South Africa. I will be talking to him later this afternoon and will hear from him, at first hand, what he has done. What his proposal has in common with the original Australian proposal for Medicare is that it has attracted both strong applause and strident criticism. We would not expect any less of a proposal which is so radical, bringing about such significant change. While I am talking about aid to South Africa, I will mention one other activity in which we are making a real contribution to South Africa: that is, the South African Broadcasting Corporation.",53

157,Mr BILNEY,PAIRS,"I will be making a statement shortly. Everyone in this House will know what a corrupt and biased organisation was the South African Broadcasting Corporation. It is perfectly true that a lot of us in this place have occasional disagreements with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation but those disagreements tend to go across the political spectrum. As the Prime Minister has remarked in another context, if we are getting flak from both sides we are probably getting something more or less right. I think the same thing applies to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It has a team of people providing media advice and journalistic skills to the South African Broadcasting Corporation, to make that the kind of organ that is suitable for a newly emerging democracy. That transformation is taking place under the direction of a truly remarkable woman, whom I met last year, Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri. She is the chairwoman of the SABC board. She is the first woman and the first black person to have trod the hallowed halls of the executive of the SABC---except, of course, for the tea ladies. She is doing a wonderful job, with Australian help. It is important that we are responsive to South African needs. That is a feature of the work of Dr Deeble. I would be delighted to respond to the great interest in this matter that there obviously is in the House, and say more about our South African aid program. The story is worth telling and it will reflect very well on this country. Logging and Woodchipping",54
158,Mr TIM FISCHER,PAIRS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and relates to his accusations about the state government's role in the timber shambles. Is the minister aware of the three-volume, 700page EIS report published on the Eden area of New South Wales? Is it a fact that the report's purpose was to decide the low conservation value areas and, within those low conservation areas, which compartments had the lowest conservation values? Did it analyse every possible environmental value, including endangered species? Can the minister explain how eight compartments on his revised list were in the least conservation value areas in the Eden EIS, which must be one of the most comprehensive studies done anywhere in the world? I ask the minister: did you use the massive Eden EIS to arrive at your decision, or not? If not, why not?",54
159,Mr BEDDALL,PAIRS,"--The basic premise of your question is totally false. As I said to the member for Barker, the list was prepared by the Department for the Environment, Sport and Territories. The reality is that I have written to the states asking for their comments. If there are areas, as the member for Barker says, that are not in existence or are of low conservation value, the states will respond to that. They have not yet done so. That brings us to the much broader point that the EIS done in the Eden area was completed before I became the minister. It was a basis for the south-east forest agreement. I have had the great pleasure of putting in place a south- . east forest agreement management committee on which many members of the timber community and the environment movement at a local level serve. That is the basis, we hope, for a regional forest agreement in the future. It is not a regional forest agreement. What we need is for the states to be involved in the national forest policy statement to give us a regional forest agreement which takes into account all of the values, not just individual values that particular groups may have, including conservation and forestry groups, so that we can get to a stage where we have a comprehensive reserve system",54
160,Mr CADMAN,PAIRS,The states have done everything for you.,54
161,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for Mitchell wants to be very careful.,54
162,Mr BEDDALL,PAIRS,"That comprehensive reserve system locks up those areas on a national level, so that we have forest of representative areas tied up, and we can have those as the future. What we will then have is a sustainable industry that will have a secure future, but it will not go through the annual coupe by coupe licence process. Computer Games: Violence",54
163,Mr HOLDING,PAIRS,My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Can he inform the House what action the government is taking or proposing in relation to aggressive and violent content in computer games?,54
164,Mr LAVARCH,PAIRS,"Members would be aware that in April of last year the Office of Film and Literature Classification commenced a system of classification of computer games. That system broadly matches that with which members would be familiar concerning film and video, though being somewhat more strict in its application. That response came largely from community concerns, as I am sure members are familiar with through their own experiences in their own electorates, about the impact of violence and aggressive computer games particularly on the attitudes held by many young Australians towards violence. We must remember that it is predominantly young Australians who are the major users of these games. Although there has been some research on this matter in a number of countries, it is true to say that the level of research on the of such games in Australia has been quite scant. I am pleased to be able to tell the member in the House that, as a result of agreement reached with the states and territorin ies at the end of last week, there will now added to the role of the Office of Film Literature Classification a more extensive research role. This will be funded jointly the Commonwealth, the states and the territortogether; ies. The first of the research projects will be on the very subject of the honourable member's question, and that is the impact of violence and aggressive computer games on particular young Australians and also on the broader community; the perceptions they are developing in the community following the widespread use of these games; how in fact the games are used in the homes and in video arcades. Armed with this research which will be completed within the next 12 months we will have a sound base on which to dtake further decisions about the regulation of this important area. Logging and Woodchipping",55
165,Mr ANDERSON,PAIRS,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, last week and again today, you told the House that the forest industry mess was the fault of the states because they had not invited the Commonwealth to help establish regional forest agreements. It is reported in today's press that, according to industry representatives who attended meetings with the government last week, the Minister for Primary Ind-stries and Energy, Senator Collins, admitted that the real problem lies with the federal government. Is Senator Collins correct to blame the debacle on warfare between the resources department and the department of the environment, along with poor advice given to you from within your own office?",55
166,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"You are relying on a press report, is that what you said? I do not know who writes these for you. I would have thought it was pretty clear that obviously, in any national policy towards the maintenance of forests, there is a dichotomy between the role of the Commonwealth and the resort of impact many sections of the community to the Commonwealth for the protection of endangered species and the preservation of native forests, and the management of those forests practical terms by the states. That conunbe drum, difficulty, policy, division, dichotoand my-call it what you like-was referred to obviously in substance in the national forest by policy statement. That is why it was put that is why the future is for regional forest agreements. That way we can decide to have a sustain-ble forest products industry but, at the same time, manage to maintain the important technically and scientifically evaluated areas of native forests, or, if they are not native or not entirely pristine, those that have been logged perhaps many years ago, as much as half a century ago, to see if they are, by and large, representativeÂ· areas that should be considered for maintenance under a regional forest agreement. That is the way to go. Where we have this coupe by coupe analysis, we will always have jockeying between Commonwealth forestry departments and the Commonwealth about what should be there and what should not, advice being given to the Minister for Resources from the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, whomever it may be, urging that particular groups of compartments are worthy of some action in terms of the export regulations and, of course, the industry pressing a case from the other way. It is important to know that this year and in the last years we have saved a lot of Australia's important native forest areas. More has to be done. But in the last 12 months it needs to be borne in mind that the Commonwealth has protected Shoal water Bay in Queensland, Jervis Bay in New South Wales and spent $20 million in the budget to buy back the hole in the heart of the Daintree rainforest-three points not referred to by the environment movement in the propaganda that is incapable of being defended about the status of so-called trees being desecrated under the Commonwealth's policies. We have shown our bona fides on that. I just remind you that your policy and the policy of the Leader of the Opposition, when he was last at the polls, was that he would leave decisions to the state governments. When the Queensland rainforest came up for World Heritage listing he said that he would leave it to the Bjelke-Petersen government and it had agreed it would go on, and that he would hand over Kakadu and Uluru to the Northern Territory government and abolish the department of the environment. That was your policy at the time and it will remain your policy because we know where you are coming from.",55
167,Unknown,PAIRS,Government members interjecting,56
168,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! Those on my right!,56
169,Mr KEATING,PAIRS,"Obviously, the Commonwealth has been correct in trying to seek the right balance here. Intransigence on the part of the states not moving into regional forest agreements has meant that we have been involved in this coupe by coupe arrangement with all its inherent difficulties. We are now well and truly on the way in discussions with the state forest authorities, companies, industry associations, unions and environment groups. We have, under the decision of the cabinet last week, allowed for forest product industry representatives and environment groups to give us a view about the 509 coupes, to be able to give us advice. We are speaking to them now about drawing the policy together. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. Obviously, I got no question from the Leader of the Opposition so the flowerpot of last Thursday will not be repeated again today. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would like to highlight to the House that question time was reduced by two questions, in accordance with the convention, from 14 to 12. That represents an utter blow to the workings of this parliament and is contrary to an undertaking given by Minister Beazley.",56
170,Mr SPEAKER,PAIRS,There is no point of order. You are now debating the issue. Resume your seat. NA Naming of Members,56
171,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"My question relates to a matter of procedure. Will you restate, for the information of the House, when and in what circumstances the chair will name members or impose the less severe penalty of the sin bin pursuant to standing order 304A, particularly in light of the sole interjection by the member for Fisher during question time last Thursday, recorded on page 372 of Hansard: Shouldn't the Prime Minister sit down while you are talking? which resulted in his being named and then suspended by the government without either a personal or general warning from the chair or prior interjection or disorderly conduct from the member for Fisher? Could you also advise how the member for Gippsland can be named for an interjection made by the member for Moore.",56
172,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Order! I will be more than happy to consider all the points the honourable member has made and give him a full explanation. Mr CosteIIo--In the House?,56
173,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,If necessary; if you w-uld like. I am always pleased to assist the House. NA  claim to have been misrepresented.,56
174,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.  the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) sought to misrepresent my position in regard to an article in the Financial ReviewMrs Bishop interjecting,57
175,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The member for Mackellar! One of your colleagues is trying to give a personal explanation.  not read on a little further. I quote from the article: But he warned that large spending cuts in this year's Budget would have major social consequences and said the Government should have moved earlier with more moderate spending cuts. In regard to that article, I went on to sayand I quote from an article in the Age of 18 January 1995:  ""drawing a long bow"" by asserting the coalition endorsed the council's specific proposals. ""What I do agree with is the council's suggestion that there are savings to be gained through better efficiencies in government departments and the management of programs.""",57
176,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Order! You have shown where you have been misrepresented. NA,57
177,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE BLOCKADE,"Last week three questions were directed to me on Thursday emanating from the difficulties that were experienced in this place. I undertook to bring a response back to those questions and also to make a statement in the House. I propose to do that now. The first point that it is necessary to make is that, to my knowledge, no member or senator was denied access to Parliament House last week as a result of that blockade. But I do think that the protest raises some fundamental questions about access to the parliamentary precincts, security of members and the welfare of some 4,500 personnel who work within Parliament House and for whom the President of the Senate and I have responsibility. As far as the protest was concerned, on 24 January I was advised, along with the President, that a number of groups intended to conduct protest activities at Parliament House on Tuesday, 31 January. The groups included forest industry workers and those opposed to the third runway at Sydney airport. In discussions with police, Parliament House security and other parliamentary officials, the organisers of the forest industry protest indicated that they would park 200 timber trucks around Parliament Drive on the outer kerb. The organisers stressed that the vehicles would not be used to block access to the building. Logging trucks, as I think we all know, began arriving at Parliament House at about 3.30 p.m. on Sunday, 29 January. Police were on hand to direct the parking of the trucks, which went well until union representatives intervened and directed, or at least encouraged, members to blockade Parliament House. The police claimed they were unable to prevent the trucks from blockhad ing Parliament Drive. This, I think, is to be regretted. Meetings were held with union officials in an attempt to resolve the situation. On the morning of Wednesday, 1 February, the blockade was escalated to prevent the delivery of documents and goods to Parliament House. It was in fact an official picket. On that same morning, the President and I, at our initiative, met with the parties involved in the blockade, including representatives from the timber workers, transport workers and the Forest Industries Association. As a result of these discussions it was agreed that the official picket would be lifted. People who had difficulties in walking some distance would also be exempt from the blockade. The documents necessary for the conduct of the House were delivered as usual, together with the mail, newspapers, food and supplies. A number of what could be characterised as unfortunate incidents were drawn to the attention of the organisers. These included vehicle access for a disabled staff member being denied and, as has been reported in some media, unsavoury comments being directed at someÂ·female staff. The organisers clearly regretted these incidents and, we understand, reminded the protesters of the need to maintain goodwill. Arrangements were also made for parliamentary security staff to be available on request to escort parliamentary staff through the blockade. Over the next two days there were a number of other meetings and discussions with the organisers of the protest. This was to ensure that there were no more unfortunate incidents. For example, the organisers agreed to abandon a proposal for the protesters to march over the top of Parliament House. Australian Federal Police officers had already been instructed to prevent such an occurrence and the, cooperation of the protesters avoided an escalation of the situation. The President and I were also successful in discouraging proposals for blockades to be imposed at the airport on Thursday night and at some of Canberra's major access points. The honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) raised with me last Thursday the issue of security passes in Parliament House, which is relevant to this issue. Members may recall that, on 9 November last year, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) raised with me his concerns about two visitors wandering in the vicinity of the chamber late one night. The visitors had unescorted passes and the member suggested that members should look carefully at those who are signed into this place. On that occasion, I reminded members of their obligation in relation to passes. Members are responsible for the conduct of those people in the private areas the building. On the morning of Thursday, 2 February, the President and I directed, that unescorted passes no longer be issued: Our actions were precipitated by concerns for the security and safety of members, senators and workers in Parliament House. Last week, there were a number of occasions when people with unescorted passes were wandering the private areas of Parliament House. Members' offices were doorknocked, and members and senators were intercepted by visitors in the private areas of the building. It has been a long standing practice of this House that members are free from being canvassed in their offices by uninvited lobbyists. If members wish to meet with interest groups, they can arrange for them to be escorted to their office. I do not consider it appropriate-nor does the President-for those interest groups to be let loose within the private areas of the House to buttonhole members. The President and I have now resolved that the ban on unescorted passes will be lifted as they related to specific security concerns we had for the safety of members, senators and staff of the building. I advise, however, that the President and I will be conducting a review of the escorted pass system. Therefore, we will oe seeking the views of members, senators and staff on the system currently in place. In passing, I might also note that one of the guidelines for the media provides that, in general, members of the gallery wishing to speak with a senator or member in Parliament House should make an appointment. They also provide that members of the media sh0uld not linger in the corridors in the vicinity of the cabinet room or party rooms. The activities of last week were not 'without cost. A preliminary estimate of the additional cost to the Australian Federal Police is in the order of $ I 20,000. I understand that the Australian Capital Territory administration intends seeking reimbursement of those costs. There are sure to be other costs in relation to gardens and additional security, and r am the issue of awaiting advice on these. I think it is fair to say that a trend has of developed over recent years for visitors in the galleries to partiCipate in the debate, contrary to standing orders. Members may recall the debate on the Gulf War, when protesters were regularly removed, from the galleries. On other occasions, there has been restrained applause for first speeches by enthusiastic and well-me-ning supporters. Reference has also been made to speeches by leaders and to the passing of certain bills. On Thursday, 2 February, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop) put to me in a question her view that freedom of speech and the need for ordinary Australians to have their voice heard should not be impeded in the public galleries. I am sure that, on reflection, she and all members would agree that to suggest visitors to the public galleries should participate in any way in the proceedings of the House is undesirable and totally unacceptable. To take this point further, standing orders 310 and 314 provide, amongst other things, for the Sarjeant-at-Arrns to take into custody any stranger who causes a disturbance in the galleries, and I think we saw evidence of that today. House of Representatives Practice states: Admission to the galleries is a privilege extended by the House and people attending must conform with established forms of behaviour ... Elsewhere it states: . . . visitors are required to refrain writing, conversing, applauding, eating, and so on. Successive Speakers of the House have upheld these rules. I have directed that these conditions be to the attention of all visitors to the galleries. I am sure all members would agree that the standing orders must be upheld, and I appeal for your cooperation. Before question time last Thursday, I a warning to the galleries regarding behavthe iour, pursuant to what I have just said, suggested that an option may be to clear them. Subsequently, both the Leader of the Opposition e Mr Howard) and the Leader of the House e Mr Beazley) responded to this option. I can advise that my research has indicated that, on two previous occasions, Speakers have ordered that the galleries cleared and then suspended the House while these instructions were carried out. There have been many occasions when a particular individual-to wit, today-or groups of privilege persons have been removed from the galleries. For the benefit of honourable members, table an updated list of such disturbances the chamber, as detailed in House of Representatives Practice on page 161. As I indicaton ed earlier, it is in all members' interests the provisions of standing orders 310 and 314 be enforced, as has been the practice of previous Speakers. As far as the long term is concerned-I sorry to delay honourable members this disruption afternoon but this i-sue raised a lot of concern last week-it would be unrealistic not to expect future demonstrations against decisions taken by the government of the day. That a right which Australians in a democratic society cherish. However, a clear distinction must be drawn between the right of free expression and issues of security and upholding the law. The parliamentary precincts are the responsibility of the Presiding Officers. They cover the area within Capital Circle but not the approach bridges to Parliament House. That area is the responsibility of the National Capital Planning Authority. With regard to the parliamentary precincts, there is an area set aside for protests and all future protests will from reading, be directed to that area . Members may have noticed certain structures at the front of Parliament House. These structures are located outside the precincts. drawn They have caused some inconvenience, particularly on ceremonial occasions. This matter needs to be addressed also. One option is to seek the extension of the precincts to allow the parliament to control access to gave Parliament House. The Joint Committee on National Capital and External Territories and is at present conducting an inquiry into protests within the parliamentary zone. It is my intention to place a submission before this inquiry based on the experience of the last differently couple of years. Finally, I turn to a question put to me by the honourable member for North Sydney e Mr be Mack) last Thursday. He said that, from his point of view, the blockade represented harassment, intimidation and a physical strain. He asked whether it amounted to a breach of and, in doing so, referred to another incident involving disruption of mail and the I playing of a recording of aircraft noise at in members' residences in the early hours. I have to say to the honourable member that three previous occasions somewhat similar that matters have actually been raised as complaints of breach of privilege. In respect of the first two complaints, the Speaker and Acting Speaker found that a prima facie case am had not been made out. In the third case of mail services to certain electorate offices-the Committee of Privileges found that the work of the electorate offices had been disrupted and the ability of constituis ents to communicate with members had been impeded but that the actions complained of were not taken with any specific intention to infringe the law concerning the protection of parliament. The committee concluded that the actions complained of should not be regarded as an acceptable means of expression and were to be deprecated, but that, although it would be open to it to make adverse findings, such findings should not be made. I respectfully agree with these previous decisions. In the recent matter, whilst some inconvenience occurred, the blockade did not prevent the House meeting and transacting business. In these circumstances, had a formal complaint of breach of privilege been raised, I do not believe a prima facie case existed. In conclusion, we all should as members of parliament thank the occupants of Parliament House for their tolerance and patience during the past week. The problem was directed at members of parliament, not the people that work within this building. There were some unfortunate incidents and these are to be regretted. I would also thank the parliamentary security staff, the Australian Protective Service and the Australian Federal Police who have managed most of the parliamentary response. I thank the protest committee for its cooperation at crucial times when the dispute could easily have escalated to physical clashes. Finally, I thank the members for not only their suggestions but also their assistance in ensuring the work of the House continued. I think, however, the protest last week and recent protests at Parliament House raise a number of specific matters which we should all be careful about and give some thought to. If members do have any specific concerns, I urge them to direct them to the committee being chaired by the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth). QUESTION TIME: CONDUCT",57
178,Mr HOWARD,PARLIAMENT HOUSE BLOCKADE," Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I would like to raise a couple of matters relating to the conduct of question time today and touch on the statement that you have just made. Question time today resulted in thp. opposition collectively-that is, the Liberal and National parties and the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack)asking six questions. Although it is outside your formal remit, the arrangement then negotiated between me as Manager of Opposition Business and the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was that there be a minimum of seven questions. However, it did not involve the specific condition where, if somebody were named, it would result in the withdrawal of a question. That did not happen last week when a similar situation occurred. Throughout the whole of question time, we had the constant practice, particularly by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), of totally ignoring the substance of a question asked, particularly that asked by the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). Mr Speaker, the fact is that you told the House, in response to a point of order from the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews), that it was perfectly in order for a Prime Minister or a minister to range over a subject in the course of actually getting to the point of answering a question. The problem we have is that he ranged over the subject, but he never actually answered the question. Mr Speaker, you ask of us, quite properly, that we cooperate in the enforcement of the standing orders. As a matter of principle, the opposition has absolutely no difficulty with that. But I have to say on behalf of the opposition, if we constantlyMr Keating interjecting",60
179,Mr HOWARD,PARLIAMENT HOUSE BLOCKADE,I am speaking on indulgence which the Speaker has granted me; he has the right to give indulgence to other people as well. There is an implied covenant in all of that: we will cooperate in the enforcement of the standing orders if you-not only in reality but also in appearanceenforce the standing orders against the government as well as against members of the opposition.,60
180,Mr KEATING,PARLIAMENT HOUSE BLOCKADE,There were six questions given to the opposition and one to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack)Opposition mem hers-Five!,60
181,Mr KEATING,PARLIAMENT HOUSE BLOCKADE,Five and one. The member for North Sydney is not a member of the government,60
182,Unknown,PARLIAMENT HOUSE BLOCKADE,Opposition members interjecting,61
183,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE BLOCKADE,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition was heard in silence, as will be the Prime Minister.",61
184,Mr KEATING,PARLIAMENT HOUSE BLOCKADE,"There were five questions from this side of the House. But we have a persistent tactic by the opposition to disrupt the J:Iouse . .It d?es .so by way of perpetual, consistent mterJectlOn, which is now the ambi-nt noise to th- background of every questlOn---controverslal or otherwise. The ambient noise is now at levels never experienced over the years in other parliaments. It was never experienced in my time, going back to 1969. As weII as that, we have from the opposition the perpetual resort to the standing orders about relevance. Very few, if any, such points of order made to you, Mr Speaker, have been upheld. So it becomes a tactic . . If, in the course of this tactic, the oppositIon delays questions by having ministers sit while these points of order are taken, and a behaviour leads to you naming a member and the question period is extended-as it was t?day, until 10 minutes past four-the oppositIon cannot then seek, in a very disingenuous way, to say that it is cooperating when in fact it has an overt policy of disruption. Of course the government wants to run question - ime. with the 14 nominated questIon-, but .It wlII not comply in an overt policy of disruptIon, of continual interjecting, so that - inisters in this House who are in the positIon of extemporaneous replies have got to think and put their answers while there is an absolute barrage from those opposite. I was around in the period of Speaker Aston; I was around in the period of Speaker Snedden. The only other member who was in the House in my time here is the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who is not here today",61
185,Mr SINCLAIR,PARLIAMENT HOUSE BLOCKADE,I beg your pardon.,61
186,Mr KEATING,PARLIAMENT HOUSE BLOCKADE,"Sorry. I am pleased to see him; he is looking suntanned and well. Whether it suits him to say so, I know he will con-rm-privately if nothing else; I hope publicly-that the state of ambient discussion in the chamber today does not in any way resemble past practice. The fact that I with him, alone in the parliament, know this to be the truth will not ever dissuade me from reminding the House of the unseemly state of argument or of the background ambient noise - hat the H-:)Use now delivers to anybody who IS on their feet and how difficult it is to answer a question-particularly an extemporaneous question. While ever that tactic is employed by the opposition, it will have a problem with the length and duration of question time.",61
187,Mr SPEAKER,PARLIAMENT HOUSE BLOCKADE,"I know that the honourable member for MackeIIar (Mrs Bishop) wants to address a question to me, but at this stage I will briefly respond to the matters raised on indulgence by both the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). - he Leader of the Opposition quite rightly pomte- out that the number of questions asked IS covered under an arrangement which exists between the government and the opposition, and the chair has no control over that.

189,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, my question relates to the question that I asked you, and to which you referred in your statement. I looked again at my question, and the question I ask you now is: why did you not relate your remarks to the question I in fact asked you? It related to the question asked by the member for North Sydney, who said that he had been harassed. I was concerned that those people were using their right to freedom of speech. I also referred to the way in which question time had been conducted and to your response to the Prime Minister. My concern about freedom of speech was that there seemed to be one rule for one and another rule for the other. I indicated further in the body of that question my concern that, for instance, in the Mabo debate, there was acclamation from the galleries. You did not address the substance of my question.",62

191,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Resume your seat. I was about to say that, if the honourable member takes the opportunity to read my statement when it is provided in Hansard, she will see that in my view I did address the points which she raised in her question. Parliament House Blockade  grant me indulgence, on behalf of at least the majority of members, to thank you and the President for the way you handled a difficult situation last week. I thank you for your comprehensive statement. However, I would be remiss if I did not express my concernnot, like you, at the right of Australians to demonstrate but at the apparent inability of the Australian Federal Police to prevent trucks from blockading the parliament. Mr Speaker, whether it is the committee of inquiry that you referred to or your own negotiations, I for one-and I suspect others-might want some reassurance that there are plans in hand that facilitate protests but prevent the blockading, as we witnessed, of entry and egress to this parliament.",62

On Wednesday morning there will be a meeting between the President, me, the Security Controller of Parliament House, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, the head of the Australian Protective Services, somebody from the National Capital Planning Authority and anyone else who has an interest in these matters within the parliamentary precincts, to discuss that very matter. It is of great concern to me, and many members and staff in this building have expressed concern on the specific issue which you have raised.

Family Law Act To the honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament.

Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enact the following changes: 1. That the existing Family Law Act be scrapped and replaced by a more simplified version together with the minimum of rules and regulations necessary. 2. That The Family Court be replaced by a Tribunal and that all matters resulting from divorce and family breakdown be heard before, and determined by a panel, the panel to be made up of persons qualified in matters arising from family breakdown. 3. That legal professionals be barred from appearing before the Tribunal resulting in vast savings to the disputing parties. 4.

ANZAC Day To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws of Australia to the attention of the House: The ANZACs at the GaIIipoli landing on 25 April 1915 were instrumental in forging a new identity for AustraIia That landing was a lifetime ago but the deeds of those ANZACs of 1915-18 still speak a message of selfless service and sacrifice that will last forever. ANZAC Day is a day to remember those who left their homes with a strong desire to return but did not, as well as those who did return, but in so doing carried for the remainder of their lives the scars of these experiences. It is a day to contemplate the spirit that moves men and women to serve, to suffer discomforts, dangers and fears and to risk their lives in defence of their country and in the pursuit of peace, justice and freedom. On ANZAC Day, we salute not only the spirit of the ANZACs but, in paying tribute to them, we take the opportunity to dedicate ourselves to striving for our country as they did and to upholding their finest qualities of courage, commitment, endurance and mateship. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House urge the Government to declare ANZAC day as Australia's National Day of Commemoration and that it be held on 25 April in each year, and on no other day. by Ms Deahm (from 91 citizens), Mr Holding (from 165 citizens) and Mrs Silvia Smith (from 180 citizens). Forests To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth: That the ancient and irreplaceable native forests in the South West of Western Australia, and many species in these forests, are in danger of extinction, and that Federal Government intervention is urgently needed to protect our natural heritage. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives call on the Federal Government to: (1) immediately use its powers to protect Hawke, Sharpe, Giblettand Rocky blocks and all other high conservation value and old growth forests in the South West of Western Australia, (2) refuse to renew woodchip export licences unless it is guaranteed that the wood comes from tree crops, agroforestry or plantations and, (3) takes steps to ensure the rapid transfer of the wood products industry from all native forests and on to plantations, tree crops and agroforestry. by Mr Beazley (from 8,205 citizens) and Mr Mack (from 1,105 citizens). International Conventions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the fact that Australia is now a signatory to more than 2100 international treaties, conventions and agreements, which, once ratified, bind Australia by international law to implement and to abide by them. While accepting that it is necessary for Australia to subscribe to any of these agreements if it is to participate freely and effectively as a member of the international community, we are concerned that such agreements are signed and ratified by the Executive Government without first being referred to the Australian Parliament for inquiry or debate. We are further concerned that there is no provision in the Australian Constitution for such a course of action to be followed by the Executive Government. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will: 1. request the Executive Government to immediately place a moratorium on the signing and ratification of any further international treaties, conventions and agreements unless they have been examined by Parliament; 2. request that the moratorium remain in place until such time as the people of Australia have been asked, by way of a referendum, whether they will support an amendment to the Constitution to include a clause stating that all international treaties, conventions and agreements must be examined by the Parliament before they come into force in Australia. by Mr Cobb (from 32 citizens) and Mr Sinclair (from 64 citizens). Young Homeless Allowance To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned shows that: 1. We are concerned that teenagers are able to leave home by obtaining young homeless allowance without adequate investigation. 2. We believe that the flawed nature of the guidelines governing eligibility for young homeless allowance is in some circumstances encouraging family breakdown. 3. With the number of young people receiving youth homeless allowance increasing by a factor of ten over the past six years, we consider that there are insufficient programs to help keep families together. Your Petitioners ask that the House of Representatives should: Call on the Government to: (a) review the guidelines for young homeless rate benefits and (b) show a greater commitment to programs which prevent family breakdown. by Mr Connolly (from 35 citizens) and Mr Ruddock (from 173 citizens). Forests To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: This petition of concerned Australian citizens respectfully points out that: There is a growing concern among the people of Australia that native forests, including areas that should be protected under National Estate or World Heritage classification, continue to be logged and woodchipped. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will: Implement an immediate and permanent moratorium on the logging of all native old growth and wilderness forests in Australia, and legislate for changes to existing forest management practices to: Permanently protect all remaining old growth, wilderness and other high conservation value forests throughout Australia, in a secure reserve system adequate to protect in perpetuity biodiversity, water catchments, natural and cultural heritage; Utilise existing extensive plantation timber for indusOy needs, and accelerate programs for tree-farm timber and fibre plantations on existing cleared lands; Create economic incentives for farm forestry, thereby generating employment for timber industry workers, youth and others in the propagation, establishment and management of sustainable permaculture style mixed-species timber plantations, inter-grown with a variety of annual crops for fibre and food production; Encourage investment in the growing and marketing of indigenous, plantation based tree products such as wattle seed, eucalyptus and tea tree oils, and other medicinal and nutritional resources; Develop educational eco-tourism as a sensitively managed major industry in appropriate forest areas; and further support the above initiatives by providFlag, ing Commonwealth funding, including the progressive transfer of military spending to assist rural communities to implement sustainable plantation forestry practices. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Hollis (from 134 citizens) and Mr Mack (from 2,954 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: We, the electors of the Division of Maranoa, draw to the attention of the House that Australia must preserve and uphold its present National Flag which has proudly represented this country ever since the Federation of its Sovereign States in 1901 and then being confirmed under the Flags Act (1953). We do so because: (a) It truly reflects our history and heritage, our culture, law and language; (b) It embodies our common law rights and liberties, our very birth right; (c) It signifies the Christian ethic, friendliness, international goodwill; (d) It enshrines in memory the wartime sacrifices of our gallant servicemen and servicewomen; (e) It symbolises our past achievements and inspires future loyal efforts. Your petitioners therefore request the House that our present Australian Flag be not changed, replaced or diminished in any way whatsoever without such a proposal being first voted upon and approved by a majority of Australian citizens in a national referendum. by Mr Moore (from 11,395 citizens) and Mr Bruce Scott (from 14 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker, and Members of the House of Representatives , in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows That the majority of Australians clearly stand united in satisfaction with their existing Australian National Flag which reflects their values, history and heritage, And that they condemn unwarranted attacks on their historic AustraliaFlag, whenever or wherever made by any Australian citizens. So therefore we call upon the House of Representatives to ensure that the Australian National as publicly acclaimed in 1901 and confirmed under the Flags Act (1953), is not changed, replaced or diminished at any time, or in any manner whatsoever, without such a proposal being first voted upon and approved by a majority of Australian citizens in a national referendum. by Mr Howard (from 56 citizens).

National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their deep concern that the Australian Flag, also known as the ""Flag of Stars"", should: I. not be changed without the consultation of the people of Australia through a Referendum 2. continue to portray Australia's heritage by displaying the Union Jack in the upper left hand corner which itself portrays the red cross of Saint George of England, the white diagonal cross of Saint Andrew of Scotland and the red diagonal of Saint Patrick of Ireland 3. continue to portray our religion and our democratic system of government by retaining the Union Jack 4. continue to display the Southern Cross under which we live as it is only visible in the Southern Hemisphere and is believed to shine brightest over Australian night skies 5. continue to depict the Commonwealth of Australia as represented by the large star at bottom, each point of which represents the States and Territories of Australia. Your Petitioners therefore pray that: I. By Act, Parliament ensure that the Prime Minister of Australia cannot change the Flag of Australia without the majority consent of the people of Australia. by Mr Cadman (from 52 citizens). Republic Bears To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of Western Australia draws to the attention of the House that approximately 8,000 bears are being kept in cages in China for the purpose of extracting bile for medical purposes and that the cages are so smalI the bears cannot move, which results in some of them going mad. It is further brought to the attention of the House that the Chinese plan to increase the number of bears, for these purposes, to 40,000.

VVoodchip Licences To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representativesassembled in Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the State of Victoria draws to the attention of the House the widespread community support for the Forestry and Forest Products Industry, which is contrary to the negative demands of conservation groups who campaign against the renewal of export woodchip the licences, and generally attempt to close the Industry down with the resultant loss of over 100,000 jobs. Your petitioners therefore request the House to ignore these incessant and baseless demands and instead, strongly urge the government to establish the Advisory Group under the National Forest Policy Statement, and to actively develop an economic blueprint for the Forestry and Forest Products Industry. by Mr Cunningham (from 1,577 citizens). National Competition Policy Legislation To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of South Australia draws to the attention of the House to certain shortcomings in theÂ· draft National Competition Policy Legislation which would result, on the one hand, in cuts in wages and conditions for affected public sector employees and user-pays price increases which will cut low income people from services they now enjoy, and on the other hand, price cuts for big business. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to amend the Bill for a national Competition Policy to ensure that: 1. all existing environmental, consumer, health and safety, wages and working conditions and socialjustice regulations are maintained for all public sector operations affected by the new law; 2. no privatisation or franchising out or ""third party access"" to public facilities take place without a transparent public process which establishes the advantages to the public interest from such a change; 3. where a privatisation, franchising out or ""third party access"" takes place, that the wages and working conditions established in current Enterprise Bargaining Agreements and Awards transfer to the new employer, thus preventing bidders from bargaining with the employees' wages and working conditions. Laws to this effect apply in Europe, and should also apply in Australia. by Mr Duncan (from 42 citizens). .

We therefore pray that the Parliament take steps to ensure that greater resources are made available for research into breast cancer. by Mr Richard Evans (from 51 citizens). Vietnam: Human Rights To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled: The petition of the undersigned showeth that: Since May 1992, the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (GOSRV) started a new campaign trying to stamp out the voice of the United Vietnamese Buddhist Congregation (UVBC) which is led by the Modest Venerable Thich Huyen Quang, an Amnesty International's prisoner of conscience since his third arrest by the GOSR V in 1982. The GOSRV has ignored the UVBC's moderate demands: the restoration of its structure and activities in the country, as clearly stated in the letter signed by Thich Huyen Quang on 25.6.92 to the Hanoi authorities. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House make stronger representations to the GOSRV by: a. urging that the GOSRV respond promptly to motion passed by the Commonwealth Parliament condemning the continual denial of basic religious freedoms to the people of Vietnam; b. ask the Prime Minister to express, in the strongest possible terms, the disapproval of Australia at the religious intolerance displayed by the GOSRV; and c. requests that the GOSRV restore and recognise the independenceofthe UVBC's structure and activities.

To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representativesassembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws attention to the House that the Federal Government and the Sate governments (except Tasmania) signed the National Forest Policy Statement (NFPS) in December 1992. The policy states: 'until assessmentsare completed, forest management agencies will avoid activities that may significantly affect those areas of old-growth forest or wilderness that are likely to have high conservation value.' (NFPS. page 11) This obligation is being totally ignored by the NSW Government. A prime example is in the high conservation value Deua Wilderness in southern NSW. Despite the NFPS obligation, logging activities are continuing in both the Eastern and Western Deua Wilderness before the required assessments. This reckless approach to forest management threatens endangered species known to exist in the area. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to force the NSW Government to cease logging in the Deua Wilderness, and all other areas of high conservation value forest in the state. This will then allow assessments to be undertaken as required by the NFPS. by Mr Mack (from 24 citizens).

Breast Cancer Research To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia: (a) deplores the fact that six Australian women per day die from breast cancer and notes the possibility of contracting breast cancer is as high as one chance in 12 for Australian women; (b) recognises the fact that breast cancer has the potential to affect every Australian family; (c) recognises that there are inadequate research funds available to help combat breast cancer.

194,The Clerk,PETITIONS,"A ministerial response to petitions previously presented to the House has been received as follows: From the Prime Minister relating to a petition lodged by the Members for MaIIee, Scullin, Richmond, Moncrieff, Macquarie and Fairfax, on 17 October 1994, praying that ANZAC Day be declared Australia's National Day of Commemoration and it be held on 25 April each year and on no other day. NA THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES ON 17 OCTOBER 1994. The Department of the Prime Minister and Mr Lyn Barlin Clerk of the House House of Representatives Parliament House CANBERRA ACT 2600 DearLyn Your letter of 17 October 1994 to the Minister for Administrative Services has been referred to the Prime Minister for response. I am replying on the Prime Minister's behalf. As you would be aware the Government has considered this matter and introduced the ANZAC Day Bill on 8 December. The Bill has as its purpose the preservation and protection of the observance of ANZAC Day. The legislation will declare ANZAC Day a National Day of Commemoration, to be observed on 25 April each year, to recognise and commemorate the contribution of all those who have served Australia in time of war and war-like conflict. The Bill was introduced on 8 December to aIIow time for passage through the Parliament in time ANZAC Day 1995. However, as you would appreciate the Government cannot control the timing passage of legislation through the Senate. Yours sincerely David Stephens Senior Adviser Parliamentary and Government Branch 12 December 1994 NA Question proposed: That grievances be noted. Responses Coastal Management ANZAC Day Mr NEVILLE (Hinkler) (4.47 p.m.)-The summer of 1994-95 will be remembered not only for some pretty ordinary test cricket by the English team, but also for some pretty ordinary politics by the Australian Democrats. On 3 December last year, Australian Democrats Leader Cheryl Kernot launched the Democrats summer coastal watch program to highlight the federal government's lack of action on coastal management issues. The Democrats declared that, by summer's end, they would identify 12 of Australia's worse coastal 'hot spots' in environmental damage-the so-called 'dirty dozen'. While it is a quite reasonable thing to try to draw Cabinet the government's attention to the serious issue of coastal management, and while from a political point of view it might be a clever stunt, as a credible commentary on 12 communities, it was a gross insult. The Democrats forgot to consider the glaring lack of any genuine scientific data to back-up their 'dirty dozen' claim and the consequences of their mostly ill-informed and negative publicity for the areas concerned and especially their tourism industries. Quite simply, the Democrats chose to 'bag' a dozen coastal communities from around Australia, all for some cheap, political summer sport! One such community was the region of Bundaberg in the southern part of my electorate of Hinkler. On 10 January, at the height of the school holidays tourist season, Queensland Democrat Senator John Woodley named Bundaberg as the fifth of Australia's 'dirty dozen' coastal regions, with parades up and for down one of our popular beaches-no doubt looking for the ominous signs of pollution. I of the might add, he did not find any. According to the report in the Bundaberg News Mail, a spokesperson for Senator Woodley said: ... the city was chosen because of its position at the centre of a sugar cane growing area, concern about recent fish kills in the area, ad hoc development on the coast, destruction of melaleucas and complaints about poIIution in the Burnett River. I repeat: ... the city was chosen because of its position at the centre of a sugar growing area. I ask: is it a dirty industry? For someone claiming to be the Democrats rural spokesperson, Senator Woodley's claim, as well as being baseless, was naive to the extreme and insulting to the sugar industry. Cane growers are among the most proactive environmentalists in the agricultural sector, and have moved quickly to introduce such landcare practices as green cane harvesting, trash blanketing, zero tillage systems, integrated pest management and so on. Even water samples taken from the recent fish kill at a local creek have not been found to contain any traces of agricultural chemicals, yet this was supposedly one of the senator's main reasons for condemning the Bundaberg region. As might be expected, community leaders were enraged, and the local newspaper so reported. Burnett shire mayor Bill Neubecker said that Senator Woodley's statements were 'inaccurate descriptions' and 'weren't very bright'. Ray Duffy, local chairman of the Clean Up Australia campaign, said: I'm sick and tired of do-gooders flying in here on their magic carpets and running off at the mouth. We've got our facts and figures, so if he'd come to us he wouldn't have made this blunder. James Corvan, manager of the Bundaberg District Tourism and Development Board, said: ... the timing of Senator Woodley's statement was deplorable, falling at the height of the tourist and with many people in the region looking at investing here. Given the strong reaction from nearly all sections of the community, it was hardly surprising that just three days later Senator Woodley was forced to back down over his claims. The local newspaper said: HeSenator Woodleywas very sorry for any offence taken by the people of Bundaberg and acknowledged the description was inaccurate. Sadly, the whole campaign has been full of inaccuracies as the Democrats have sought to tag regions as dirty on the basis of speculative claims and little or no scientific evidence or research. A similar stunt was pulled just north of Bundaberg in the community of Agnes Water which is also in my electorate, and it was met with scathing criticism from John Bell, Miriam Vale shire chairman. But let me introduce a few other members of the Democrats' 'dirty dozen'. I refer to 13th Beach at Geelong in Victoria. On Friday 13 January, the very same day that Senator Woodley was in Queensland apologising to the people of Bundaberg about including them in the dirty dozen, his Democrat colleague Senator Spindler was at 13th Beach south of Geelong on the Victorian coast declaring that area to be the sixth of the infamous 'dirty dozen' beaches. Unfortunately, Senator Spindler's media release on that day still listed Bundaberg, along with the Gold Coast, Coffs Harbour, Mandurah and Glenelg as part of that 'dirty dozen'. So on the same day one Democrat in Bundaberg was saying that Bundaberg should not be on the list and would be removed from it, but another Democrat,in another part of Australia, was bagging the region. In fact, as recently as 30 January the current 'hot spots' list, which I have been able to obtain from the Australian Democrats, still contained Bundaberg and Agnes Water in Central Queensland. So much for promises. I have the list here. However, in the case of 13th Beach the Democrats also failed in the following areas: season firstly, local beach monitoring found the water quality to be within the Environment Protection Authority's requirements; secondly, the Black Rock plant was in the final stages of a $46 million upgrade to improve water quality and the marine environment; and, thirdly, the local people were actually paying a five-year special levy to fund what will be a worldclass sewerage treatment plant. Here was a community doing something positive about its coastal environment, but all the Democrats could do was denigrate the region's image and reputation for some quick political gain. My colleague the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) was possessed to rebuke the Democrats for their 'spooky political nonsense', embarrassment and community insult. But the Democrats' campaign of insulting coastal communities did not stop there. I refer now to Mullaloo in Western Australia. The coast watch campaign also received negative responses from Coffs Harbour on the New South Wales north coast and, equally, in anticipation, scathing criticism of the proposed listing of Mullaloo Beachjust north of Perth in Western Australia when the name of the beach appeared on a logo contained in Senator Spindler's media release that I referred to earlier. According to the local MP, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing): ... a soon to be released report by the Western Australian Water Authority shows quite clearly that there is no measurable level of impact on the water quality to Mullaloo or nearby beaches by either the release of effluent from the Beenyup Waste Water treatment plant or any other source. But it seems that the Democrats have even been criticised from within their own ranks. A local newspaper quotes David Churches, the Democrats' WA branch president, as being very critical of his party for not consulting local members before they named local beaches in their list of the 'dirty dozen'. Mr Churches said: Local knowledge should always be sought before publicly speaking out on an issue. He also said: Our local knowledge suggests that Mullaloo Beach is better than most. So here we have the Democrats' coastal watch program criticised even by members of their own party and, to say the least, a state president of their party organisation. There is good reason to be critical of the federal government's lack of action on coastal management issues after 12 years in government. Indicative of its inaction is the fact we have been waiting for more than a year for the government's response to the Resource Assessment Commission's coastal zone inquiry. The coalition recognises the importFerguson, ance of coastal management, and it fits with the broader water and land degradation discussion paper released last month by colleague the shadow minister for the environAsian ment. But the tactics of the DemocratsOxley, members of a party that claims that it will keep the bastards honest-to condemn individual coastal communities out of hand on the basis of little or no consultation or scientific evidence is far from honest. I found the Democrats' actions cheap and irresponsible and an appalling and gross .insult to my tourism community at a time when people from all over Australia were on east coast beaches and when people who are very sensitive about spending their tourism dollars were in the area and perhaps looking at approaching retirement and settling in those areas. They just defy description. As I said, it was a season for very average cricket from the Englishmen, and it was a season for very average politics from the Democrats. Tripartite Working Party on Labour Standards",71
195,Mr DODD,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Leichhardt) (4.57 p.m.)Today in the grievance debate I want to congratulate the Minister for Trade, Senator MCMullan, for his announcement on 15 December last year regarding the setting up of the Tripartite Working Party on Labour Standards. The working party has been established following the unanimous resolution of the Australian Labor Party trade platform at the 40th National Conference in September 1994: ... to establish a well-resourced and high level Working Party including representatives of the ACTU, Australian industry, and Government, to investigate effective measures that the Australian Government can take, in a tripartite manner with the ACTU and Australian industry and in multilateral forums within the international community, including consideration of the possible role of trade and international financial institutions, to develop and promote worker rights in the region. that I congratulate the honourable member for Holt (Mr Duffy) on his appointment to chair of the committee. I think that is a very good appointment. Other members are Martin the President of the Australian in Council of Trade Unions; Allan Handberg, national chief executive of the Australian my Chamber of Manufactures; Ms Vicki Lukins, affairs manager of BHP, and Alan Managing Director of International as its catch cry Trade Strategies. Briefly, the terms of reference are to look at: Â· the commitment of labour standards amongst countries of the Asia-Pacific region Â· the nature and effectiveness of current measures by Australian government, unions, industry and non-government organisations to promote labour standards in the Asia-Pacific region Â· the nature and effectiveness of measures which could be taken to address labour standards Â· the likely effect of extending existing measures and introducing new measures Â· the development of worker institutions, and modern industrial relations policies and practices the region and their effect on economic development. I do not want to prejudice the report of the committee, but it is my very firm view, in light of the new GATT agreement and the Bogor declaration and other free trade agreements, that as a matter of urgency we have to address the problems of workers' rights in trade. In a previous speech in the House I and other honourable members when speaking to a motion introduced by the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) have highlighted the problem of child labour. There have been situations to our very near north when trade unionists have been gaoled for simply engaging in trade union activity, so trade has to be not only free but also fair. The options that have been canvassed and that may be canvassed by this committee include the possibility of developing a code for Australian corporations operating overseas and a greater recognition of international standards by internationalÂ· financial institutions such as the World Bank, .the IMF and the Asian Development Bank in terms of incorporating labour issues in project assistance. We have the example of legislation passed through the US Congress last year for labelling goods to indicate that they have not been produced by child labour. Another important initiative is the social clause. The concept of linking workers' rights and trade is not new. Some limitation on below standard competition was incorporated in the International Trade Organisation charter, adopted at the 1948 Havana conference. It was withdrawn only because it was seen to have no chance of ratification in the US Senate. The GATT, which replaced the ITO, upheld labour standards in principle but allowed no trade discrimination to enforce them except in the case of prisoner made goods. However, at the ministerial meeting in Uruguay in 1986 which launched the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations the US proposed that workers' rights should be included as a subject for negotiation. Although no consensus was reached, the chairperson of the ministerial meeting named in workers' rights as a subject to be taken up at a later stage in the negotiations. In 1987, and again in 1990, the US proposed in the GATT council that GATT should establish a working group to consider 'the relationship between international trade and respect for internationally recognised workers' rights'. In April last year, the Uruguay Round meeting in Marrakech agreed to refer the issue of workers' rights and trade to the preparatory committee of the agreed new World Trade Organisation. There have been recent supportive comments from the Prime Minister of France; the President of France, Mr Mitterrand; Jacques Delors; as well as the President of the United States, Bill Clinton. As I have already mentioned, the primary, although not the only, mechanism to link workers' rights and trade has been the idea to include a 'social clause' in trade agreements-in particular in the WTO. In discussing the social clause, it is important to establish what the social clause is not about. It is certainly not about establishing a worldwide minimum wage. It is not about transferring First World wage levels and conditions to developing countries. It is about ensuring that basic human rights are respected in all countries engaged in trade. The international trade union movement, including the ACTU, has moved beyond its earlier outright suspicion of free trade and is taking a simple protectionist stance to accept the free trade principles embodied in the GATT and to emphasise that trade must be not only free but also fair. The ICFTU proposes the following clause be included in the WTO: The contracting parties agree to take steps to ensure the observance of the minimum labour standards specified by an advisory committee to be established by the WTO and the ILO, including those on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, on the minimum age for employment, discrimination, equal remuneration and forced labour. It is very important to' emphasise that any social clause would be based on ratified international standards contained in ILO conventions. These rights have been long recognised beyond the ILO. In relation to freedom of association, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948, proclaimed, 'Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests. ' We already know that, as a result of the motion moved by the honourable member for Wills, article 32 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child mentions child labour. Under the ICFTU proposal, if a country were falling short of its obligations a joint advisory body consisting of representatives of both the new WTO and the ILO would 'recommend measures for improved performance to be undertaken by the government within a specified time. Such measures could include better enforcement of laws and regulations through a strengthened labour inspectorate. At, the end of the period, a further report would be prepared on the effect given to the earlier recommendations. The second report would state that the country was now fulfilling its obligations or progress was being made and further time was needed or that the government had failed to make <,tdequate efforts to implement the recommendations. In the latter case only, the government concerned would. be warned that if progress was not made within a year the matter would be referred to the WTO council for considenition of appropriate trade sanctions., The key to promoting global growth is to create expanding broad based consumer demand in developing countries. But for this to happen international trade regimes must make it possible for agricultural workers, industrial workers and workers in service industries to receive a rising share of benefits of increased productivity and economic expansion. What benefit is it to the future of the world economy, not only Australian workers, that the majority qf workers in developing countries live below acceptable poverty lines? We need increased prosperity for workers in the developing world not only because not to do so is an offence to humanity but also because increased demand promotes growth in both the developing world and the existing manufacturing nations. I welcome the establishment of the committee chaired by the honourable member for Holt. I have confidence that that committee will come up with good recommendations. I certainly look forward to the recommendations in the report. Security Systems",73
196,Mr TUCKEY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"O'Connor) (5.06 p.m.)One of the great assets that any member of parliament can have is a continual involvement with the community in general or with specific parts of the community. I, through the activities of my family, continue to have direct interests in the small business area. I am constantly reminded of how tough things are out there and the sorts of circumstances' that are arising. One of the circumstances today that has been confronting the businesses run by my children is breaking and entering. It is on that issue and a specific aspect of it, the provision of security systems, that I wish to comment today. It is not a high profile business; it in fact sells pot plants. One would think that the breaking and entering of those premises would not occur too frequently, but in fact the premises with which my children are involved have collectively had 10 individual break-ins in the last month. Of course, theft and damage have resulted from it. Shortly after they became involved in the business, they put floor safes in all the premises. Within a month, as a result of the breaking and entering, every one of them had been smashed to pieces with sledgehammers and the funds stolen. Claims of break and enter add significantly to insurance premiums imd those sorts of aspects. It is an ongoing problem where I think more police activity is required compared with, as I have said in this place before, the accent that is put on certain aspects of traffic control. Nevertheless, both the business and the private community are turning more and more to the private sector for protection of their premises by one means or another. Flashing blue lights and things of that nature are appearing more and more on private houses, because the most significant means of protection is a security system. Naturally, this happened in this family business. As a practical person, I was very smartly stunned by how inadequate they are and how little thought has gone into the business of installing them to guarantee security to the people who have paid for them. These issues are well worth some report today in my grievance. As I have just reminded the House, it did not take the thieves long. It was always considered that floor safes were the most safe means of short-term security for funds or other valuables because they could not be carried or towed away on a cart like the ordinary old-fashioned safes. It did not take the criminal elements long to discover that, if safes were made a little more convenient and a little larger than they used to be, they could be damaged sufficiently by continual bashing with a sledgehammer to get the lid off to steal the money. In one experience we had, a neighbour reported that sort of noise to the police. After a quarter of an hour, she rang them to say it was still going on, so they went around to have a look. A little practical application by safe installplug ers can prevent an attack with a sledgehammer. All that is needed is to lower the safe by six to eight inches, in old-fashioned measurement, into the floor. In that way, a blow to a rather small area cannot be impacted directly onto the lid. After a hell of an argument, I convinced safe manufacturers to do this, and we have not had any of these safes broken into since. Rather than giving it a go, the safe manufacturers gave me every reason why it would not work. I had to demand that it be given a go. That is one example. People installing floor safes should make sure that they are sufficiently set into the ground so that they cannot be attacked with a sledgehammer. I am concerned about the alarm systems that are available. Frequently the control system has installed within it an automatic dialler so that when the alarm is activated this thing rings a control panel somewhere. The control panel is manned by a security company at a cost of$l a day-$365 a year-and the security company is able to take action. There is nothing much wrong with that, except that the most common variety of alarm systems have a key pad which activates and deactivates this thing sitting on the same box. It has to be within reach of the proprietor of the shop. Frequently, it is somewhere inside the shop and there is a delay built into it. The proprietor can open his shop and activate the alarm but still have time to get to the control box and deactivate the alarm. There are a couple of interesting aspects to that. If you are a person with a sledgehammer you know you have X seconds to get to the box. You do not mess around with it: you hit it with your sledgehammer because it is right there on the wall and, of course, the telephone does not ring and the alarm does not go off. However, it is even worse than that. Telecom has to connect the automatic dialler. Telecom demands that its plug is outside the box. I invite the very limited number of members present in the House to have a look at one of these alarms in a shop in their constituencies. The Telecom plug is sitting on top of the black box. If you do not have your sledgehammer with you, you just run in and pull the out and it does not ring, although at least the alarm will go off in those circumstances. These sorts of things can be resolved. Obviously, a key pad independent of the control box should be as close as possible to the door. That facility is available. But installers, for their own convenience-they do not like getting up on ladders-will continue to install the control boxes within reach of the person who is planning to break and enter the premises. This should be prohibited. ItÂ· is almost a case for consumer law where these sorts of issues need to be covered by a code of practice; thus the equipment can be installed in such a way that it cannot be deactivated other than after a period of time in which the alarm system has worked. Too many people involved in the industry seem to be much more interested in selling access to their phone-in service than their equipment. This adds considerably to the cost to small business when sometimes it does not give any great benefit. Installers should be offering the equipment and giving people the option. Installers usually disappear when they are told that consumers do not want their phone service. Recently one company had a very large advertisement in the West Australian newspaper for a complete service for $690. All the items were listed. We needed this service for one building, and I suggested to my daughter that she should go and get that. However, the quote was for $1,300. In other words, it is a racket. This is unfortunate when people are becoming so dependent on these sorts of things. Consequently, I am hopeful that some other honourable members listening to my remarks might, through one of our committees, have a look at the practicalities of this situation. There have been other allegations of people not getting services by way of property inspections that they have paid for. People have given bald statements on television that they were employed in this patrol category and simply could not carry out the tasks that they were given. It is patently silly to have people going around installing equipment that can be so easily deactivated by criminals. There are such simple solutions to make sure that that does not happen. For example, the control boxes should be positioned in a high or hidden position. Recently, I saw one installed right in the middle of a shop. I advised the proprietor to put his hat on it. A person who was considering breaking and entering merely had to walk into the place and make a purchase. The little black box was staring him in the face. He knew exactly where it was and how to get to it. He knew exactly how much time he had to smash it. It should not occur in that fashion. It should be obligatory that these boxes are put in a position that is extremely difficult find. They should not be activated from the controls, but they should have a separate key pad. Safe installers, who install these floor safes by the hundred these days, should also make sure that they cannot be smashed with a sledgehammer. That is a relatively simple concept. I hope the House will take some notice. It is a great pity that people have to have all these security systems today but, if they do have to, they are entitled to know that they work. Indonesia",75
197,Mr FERGUSON,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"In the past week international attention has again been focused on the repressive regime in Indonesia, this time the focus being on an international case concerning the Timor Gap treaty. Today, I want to address another aspect of these regime's operations. I refer to the regime's treatment of independent trade unions and the use of the state apparatus to basically ensure compulsory membership of rather compliant organisations that are fundamentally part of the state apparatus. In 1992 the SBSI was formed as an independent alternative trade union organisation. It has been subjected to very persistent harassment by the securities forces. On 21 November last year Time magazine commented as follows: Sixteen of hisMuchtar Pakpahancolleagues are still on trial in what looked to many like an attempt to bust a union that the authoritarian Indonesian Government views as dangerously independent. US. officials ""deplored"" Pakpahan's sentence and said Clinton would discuss the case and other ""problems in the human-rights area,"" including the closure of three influential publications, with Indonesia's President Suharto. The case referred to concerns the chairman of this trade union federation; a trade union federation which has seen at least 2,000 of its members dismissed from employment because of their membership of the union. In the period since its establishment, the union's offices throughout the country have been continually occupied by a very diverse range of Indonesian security forces. In June 1993 Pakpahan and other Medan officials to were arrested. In July 1993 police broke up its first national conference by persuading the owners of the place that was leased for the conference to decide that the union could not meet there. Room keys were seized. The national federation movement was disrupted at gunpoint. That is typical of the pattern that has occurred. In February last year the authorities were concerned at the threat of a national strike by this organisation. A large number of union officials was arrested for 'spreading hatred against the government of Indonesia' . On 7 September last year the manpower minister said that the organisation's activities should be subject to police visits and that it should be repressed because 'it had political motives in mind'. There were convictions after these arrests. There was a degree of international focus on the trials. Whilst it was basically a trumped up effort by the state apparatus, people went away thinking that the sentences could have been worse. On appeal, the main protagonist had a very serious deterioration in his health, not being transferred to better medical facilities within the prison system. And not having access to legal counsel has seen a very serious increase in his convictions. He was originally charged with two offences-one under article 161, dealing with 'incitement to rioting' and one under article 160, dealing with 'inciting others to engage in punishable offences to oppose the authorities by means of violence or to incite them not to comply with the law or a legal order issued in accordance with the law' - and received a sentence of three years. On appeal, that was increased to four years. His associate, Mr Telambanua has had his sentence of 15 months increased to three years. This has focused very strong international attention on the interrelationship between the government, the various commercial interests of a large number of ministers, the commercial interests of the armed forces-which is so crucial in Indonesian society-and the fact that a large number of military officials, once they turn 55 and retire, are appointed as regional and provincial trade union officials. So there is a process whereby you have a government controlled union, with compulsory membership in some spheres, completely compliant with and completely controlled by the armed forces. At the same time, those armed forces personnel actually run the show locally and have an interrelationship with other military officials with very strong commercial interests. In the last two years, the United States, in particular, has been putting extreme pressure on Indonesia in relation to conditions there. There was an increase in the minimum wage and at one stage there was the supposed lifting of decree 342 of 1986, which dealt with the interference of the military in labour disputes. However, it is interesting to note that the day after it supposedly lifted this decree under United States pressure, at a factory called PT Naga Sakti Parana in Tangerang, West Java, similar kinds of measures were implemented. In Indonesia, as well as the military controlling this kind of tame cat union movement, the military has great power to intervene in industrial disputes. It relays the announcement from companies that people should return to work. It assists in the determining of sanctions and has some say in whether local companies pay wages during disputes. It basically implements practices whereby the message is conveyed to workers that if they do not return to work they do not wish to work. As I say, the armed forces of Indonesia are a very integral part of industrial relations in that country. It is not as though there is no need for protection of people in that country. It is interesting to note an article by Richard Rothstein in the magazine American Prospect in the spring of 1994. This relates to the matter that the member of Leichhardt (Mr Dodd) has just dealt with-child labour. In that article, Rothstein noted: Indonesia in 1949 prohibited children under 15 from working. But in 1987, to attract more investment, the country abolished this prohibition for ""children forced to work for social or economic reasons."" Rothstein went on to say: By 1991, there were 2.8 million Indonesian children ""bonded"" to factories-that is, mortgaged by parents to employers. So it is not as though there is a glorious nirvana in Indonesia for the work force. It is not as though there is no need for an independent trade union organisation to take up the cause of people. In the current situation, where the Medan leaders have been tried supposedly because of anti-Chinese riots resulting from a very big industrial dispute, one interesting facet is that, while under US and ILO pressure Indonesia has nominally increased minimum wages, the vast majority of strikes there last year were actually about getting this minimum wage on the local site. But, as I say, there was an outbreak of anti-Chinese feeling, and one individual was killed. In the magazine put out by Asia Watch, a human rights organisation monitoring this region, it was said of the allegations: With all the charges and countercharges swirling around the Medan events, it is imperative that a full, impartial and independent investigation be undertaken into allegations of incitement to violence, before any accusations are levelled against SBSIthat is, the independent unionthe armed forces, or any other party. That organisation and many others have strongly questioned the possibility of military instigation of these riots. So at the moment we have international focus on Indonesia over these trials. It is part of a widespread pattern of undermining the trade union movement, through harassment and military intervention in disputes, which is seeking to secure overseas investment in the country.

ANZAC DAY BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed from 1 February, on motion by Mr Sciacca: That the bill be now read a second time.",77
198,Mr NEVILLE,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"Hinkler) (5.29 p.m.)When I was interrupted in my contribution to this debate on the ANZAC Day Bill 1994 I was saying how important it was that continuity be maintained in the celebration of ANZAC Day. The point I was making was that the youngest of the Second World War diggers is now 68. Because of that, it will not be long-a couple of decades down the track-before we do not have these great men from the Second World War to keep that tradition alive. Notwithstanding the fact that there are veterans from the Korean, Malaysian and Vietnam campaigns, and from United Nations activities, they will not be sufficient in number to solely carry out the activities of commemoration. It will at that stage be important that young Australians, those who have no experience of war-and, pray God, never have any experience of war---carry on that tradition. They need to realise that, although they may never be asked to put their lives on the line, the sort of freedom we enjoy in this country today was paid for at the great price of blood. I was particularly impressed last Saturday in Bundaberg when I attended the first regular meeting-the second meeting-of the newly formed national servicemen's association for the Bundaberg district. I found that meeting significant because, in a way, a lot of these guys are not a lot younger than the Second World War diggers. Many of them never served in conflict. Some would have gone to Vietnam and Malaysia, but the vast majority of them would not have done so as national servicemen, so very few of them have experienced any overseas military engagement. That makes their contribution towards keeping alive that spirit of ANZAC all the more significant. There is a realisation amongst them that they too need to play their part. When I go around the electorate-or anywhere in Australia. I cannot not have a look at the local war memorial. I guess I am a bit of a freak about that. War memorials seem to haveÂ·Â· a fascination for me: not a morose fascination, but the fascination of seeing in relatively small communities the number of people whose names are on those marble and stone tablets; people who paid the price of war. Some of those communities were never very large. You might go to a war memorial and see a number of times a not common name in that district. One that comes to mind was the name 'Cleary' at one war memorial. There were seven Clearys. Obviously fathers, uncles, sons and brothers-and first cousins perhaps. When you see seven of one name taken out of a community you can imagine the trauma-the loss and void-that must have been felt in that family and community. It is said that a lot of nations throughout world have not recovered from great conflicts and that a lot of the problems in eastern Europe today can date back as far as the Second World War and further. It is not generally recognised that there are pockets of that in Australia. In my electorate, near the town of Gin Gin, there isa tiny hut. It is a strange looking hut; it has a verandah and three doors. It is a bit like a tavern. Each of these three doors is quite individual. The roof is rusting. I asked what was the story of this hut. The story was that, just before the First World War, three young boys bought this property and built this hut so that they each had a room in the hut. All three were killed in the war; and the hut remains, some 80 years on, empty. It is a very stark reminder, in the middle of a new development, of the price that was paid in that community for freedom. As I look at those war memorials I see the extraordinary contribution that very small communities and individuals made in the war effort. Sometimes the towns are no longer even there. There is a little town over the border of my electorate, in the Wide Bay electorate, called Burnstown. There is no town there any more, but there is a war memorial with many names. That contribution is at risk of not being remembered; and even more so when the Second World War diggers move on in a couple of decades. That is why it is important that we lay down now in the parliament, in a bipartisan way, that ANZAC Day is our national day of commemoration. It is not to be a bodgie Australia Day or a substitution for anything else. It is not something to be manipulated for political purpose. It is to be enshrined in the psyche of future generations of Australians as something worth cherishing, guarding and defending; with its virtues inculcated in the characters of successive generations. In the few minutes remaining to me, I would like to talk very briefly on what is happening in my electorate for the Australia Remembers commemoration this year. There are 11 local authorities in our electorate. All have cooperated with me, as the convenor of the Hinkler committee. We have set up a the marvellous program to take us right through from VE Day to VP Day. I favour the name VP Day because I can remember as a young child going to the movies in August that year to pick up my mother. As we were collecting her, people were walking along the footpath putting 'VP' in whitewash on the windows of the shops. So my memory of that day was as VP Day. We have over 35 people on our committee and 23 programs in place for Australia Remembers. The programs include joint passing out parades of cadets, school competitions with Australian provincial newspapers, military balls, debutante balls, victory parades, victory concerts, light horse displays, school musicals and dedications of special parks and memorials. I would particularly like to pay tribute to the people of Childers who have their commemoration in place already. They have the whole year ahead mapped out with a range of activities. People in the city of Gladstone have laid out their three major activities, one of which is particularly interesting. It is called 'Women at war'. (Time expired)",79
199,Mrs EASSON,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"I think the ANZAC Day Bill will come as a surprise to most Australians. All our lives ANZAC Day has been a public holiday and a day of very great community unity. It will surprise most Australians that this day, with its central significance in the Australian national soul, has not until now been enshrined in the laws of our country. I am glad that this day has come and that I can participate in this important moment in the process of building our nation. Building a nation is what we here in parliament must be doing. The events of the first ANZAC Day at Gallipoli in 1915 are the unbreakable and permanent foundation for our nation building. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), in his second reading speech, referred to widespread sentiments in this land and in this House in 1915 in relation to Australia as an independent nation. The prevailing sentiment was one of subjection of Australia to Britain and the slavish, almost sycophantic, view of Britain as the lord and Australia as the servant. I will add to this sorry record a statement concerning Gallipoli by William Morris Hughes, the Australian Prime Minister at the time and a member of the Labor Party. He said: We have no responsibility in directing the campaign. Our business is only to carry out the instructions of the Imperial Government. We must give all the assistancewe can, and at all events, we owe the Imperial Government this duty-refraining from criticising any position of vital responsibility. This is hardly the remark of a leader of an independent nation. Obviously, even elements of the Labor Party in 1915 were slow to see the differences between Australia and another nation. ANZAC Day put an end to all that, at least on our side. This question of national identity is very important. Sometimes one hears cries by various groups and individuals that such things as republics and flags are minor and trivial; and not nearly as important as the really vital concerns of the 30-day bond rate or the level of the all ordinaries at 5 p.m. yesterday. A nation is not a business, it is a homeland for its citizens. A citizen is not just a consumer; a citizen is a person who is bound, by birth or choice, to the land and to the soul of a nation. The false materialistic philosophy of consumption, even more consumption, is insufficient to hold a nation together. The psychological dynamics of maintaining national unity seem to be unknown to many journalists, commentators, conservative politicians and even some talk-back hosts. The appeal of goods and services to people is necessary for a decent life but it is not sufficient for the moulding of a future-oriented nation, such as Australia. It is because of these points that Gallipoli, Beersheba and the Kokoda Trail are vitally important. These were, on a materialistic level, important and bloody struggles for power between nations. However, on a psychological and spiritual plane, these events spoke to the Australian soul words of enduring brightness and hope. These events were epic and creative in just the same manner as Homer's writing of the Trojan Wars created the Greek people and Rome's struggle against Carthage created the real soul of the Roman republic. If we are to have a future, then we must open ourselves to the creative forces of these events and numberless others which are bound together under the title of ANZAC Day. ANZAC Day is not a celebration of war or victory. Indeed, at Gallipoli we were defeated, and we deserved to be. We were invading other people's lands and they fought to protect themselves from our aggression. Yet that war and its conduct resulted in a very great and deep sense of unity and regard between Australia and Turkey. Many strange and wondrous things happened in those months at Gallipoli. If I could point out just one incident, it would be the short and magnificent life of John Simpson and his donkey, Murphy. Simpson was his middle name, the name that he used to enlist in the army. John Simpson Kirkpatrick was illegally in Australia. He had jumped ship a few years earlier. When honourable members and others get themselves worked up over people illegally in Australia, let us not forget to add Simpson's name. Let them also not forget the job that he took away from an Aussle, the job of going out into no-man's land and retrieving the wounded Australians and Turks. Would any legal Australian sitting in this chamber volunteer for such a job? Although Simpson was born outside Australia, it was as an Australian that he found his destiny and his glory. He did it without permission of the public service clerks, and fortunately his Australian officers did not interfere in his self-appointed task of retrieving the wounded. His life is one of great example to a nation that we are trying to build on this continent. In collecting the wounded, John Simpson also collected the Turkish wounded and returned them to their own lines. The Turks responded to. this heroic gallantry by not interfering with his activities, and generally respecting those soldiers wearing the red cross who were helping the wounded and burying the dead. John Simpson was killed, accidentally, by shrapnel from a mortar explosion on 19 May 1915. He died at the age of 23 and he lives forever. He is a greatly neglected figure who should be neglected no longer. His spirit is the spirit of our nation today. The people at Gallipoli were like those of any suburb in Australia today: Australian, Englisl), Irish, New Zealand, Indian, Maltese, Egyptian, Turkish, Jewish-and undoubtedly there were numerous French, Germans and a multitude of Europeans. This epic event is a very suitable foundation stone for our nation and one whose lessons need to be taught to our current and future generations. If we are going to take seriously this day of commemoration, then let us take it really seriously. Days of national commemoration held in other lands are events that stand out from the normal run of the ordinary days of the year. I would suggest that the minister may like to consider approaching the radio, television and media outlets to treat ANZAC Day in a broader sense. Specifically, I would like to suggest that on the night of 24 April, the eve of ANZAC, each television station should run a special evening-length program on ANZAC Day and its significance to us. I think that in the interests of nation building we could forgo a single night of Roseanne, Seinfeld, the X-Files and Models Inc. There are occasions when the interests of our nation, as a unit, take precedence over the pursuit of small individual interest. Perhaps even the members opposite, so ideologically absorbed by the individual, may recognise that there are moments when we are not 18 million Australians but one Australian nation. The purpose of this commemoration day is not to wallow in a nostalgia of a long dead empire. The nostalgia still grips some in Australia, even some on the other side of this House, who perhaps should know better. Whilst it is true that our heritage is important, it is not as important as our future. ANZAC Day, through a proper development as a national day of commemoration, can become even more central to our future than it is to our heritage. This re-orienting of our national sense, from the past to the future, requires the involvement of all the major. institutions of our nation. This means that both the Liberal and National parties have to make a psychological leap from an Anglo-Australian imperialist, nostalgic past to a purely Australian republican future. The new Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard)-and I congratulate him and wish him well-has a wonderful opportunity to say that our multicultural Australia is a nation with no hyphens. There are no Greek-Australians, Scots-Australians or Vietnamese-Australians. Let the opposition say that there are no Anglo-Australians. Let the new leader opposite say that we on this side have always said that there are only Australians. Where your family came from is not as important as where you are going and the effort that you are willing to put into Australia, getting it to its own promised future. If the conservatives in Australia will not let go of England, then howcan we tell others to let go of Vietnam, Greece; Lebanon, Turkey or wherever they may have originated. The combined multicultural effort at Gallipoli is a wonderful background canvas for us to add to our national future. But to do so successfully, we need to alter our perception of the past and, above all, to stand on our own two psychological feet. Australia is still bedevilled by fears that we cannot function on our own; doubt about whether we can rise above by our own efforts; fear that we cannot walk across the high wire without someone holding a net under us. This psychological crippling has still not left us, because we are not making a big enough effort to beat it. I think that we should make that effort and keep making it until we can truly refer to ourselves in terms of our endeavour and not in terms of our friends, real or imagined, overseas. To refer again to Gallipoli, Australia was not in charge at Gallipoli. It was someone else's idea and someone else was in charge. Our 7,500 dead and 20,000 wounded were a tremendous cost for such a small number of people. That is often what happens when one hands one's future over to others. Our future will undoubtedly contain warfare. In South-East Asia, strong nations and socially divided countries are engaged in wholesale industrialisation and massive rearmament. To imagine that this will not lead to warfare one day is to defy history's lessons and to be blind tragically to human nature. Our safety and future requires that we make our decisions based on our perceptions, not just on the interests of our allies. This may sound harsh, and it is. However, the real world of security in military affairs is singularly devoid of sentiment. Our fault as a nation has often been to go along because we thought that we had no other option. Unless we engage in the process of building a nation and doing so seriously, we will nevet get off the psychological treadmill. To build this nation we must have some ideas beyond the consumption of goods and services. The search for these ideals takes us to Gallipoli, to Beersheba and to the Kokoda Trail. It involves not only men and not only battles. It involves women like the Blessed Mary MACKillop and her nuns educating the poor in the slums and in the outback; it involves men and women in science searching for solutions to polio and developing penicillin; it involves great men like Essington Lewis building BHP and the great men and women of the labour movement ensuring that our people did not live in a Third World country. The spirit that envelopes all these activities is a spirit of equality and fair go. It is not a spirit of immovable class barriers and upper and lower orders. These barriers and orders are the spirit of a foreign country; they are not the spirit of Australia. These barriers and orders are not part of our future, and members opposite should walk away from the dead-end feigned values and join the rest of us as we face our national future. Our future is very clouded. Our economy needs an immense amount of development; our population is far too small; our agricultural and environmental needs are not yet properly integrated; and our overseas relations still present Australia as over eager to please-an attitude which betrays our insecurity. To overcome these real problems we must show ingenuity, determination, intelligence and plain stubborn courage. Those were the qualities that all the men and women of ANZAC displayed. Whether in Gallipoli, Vietnam, New Guinea or today in Rwanda these qualities, free of class considerations and born to rule fantasies, are the core of the ANZAC spirit and message. They are what we inherited and what we must add to, before we pass it on. This is what is meant by building a nation. If we do this enthusiastically, we will be able to look with pride at our achievement and be glad that time, fate and history have given us the wonderful prize, the very fitst prize, in the lottery of life-the prize of being an Australian. We have inherited our past; we must now build our future. I commend the bill to the House.",81

They are the names that appear on a memorial out the front of the Keith Styles reserve in Mentone, Victoria--one of many hundreds of memorials around Australia that indicate the deaths of young Australians who went to serve in the First World War. In any town in any state across this country you can see these memorials. Some of the roads into these towns are not the major highways any more. One road that comes to mind is the road into the city of Ballarat, where you drive for a number of kilometres through trees that have been planted in memory, in an avenue of honour, of those young men and women who died in the service of this country. Our involvement as a country, as a people, goes back as far as Sudan, where we lost six young Australians. In the Boer War we lost 588 young Australians. In the First World War we lost 59,330 young Australians-2,862 of those were officers; 56,468 were other ranks. In the Second World War, 27,191 young Australians died as a result of active service, with our total death toll of young Australians being 39,429. In Korea, 339 young Australians. were killed. In the Malayan emergency 35 were killed, in the Malayan Peninsula activities four were killed and in the Indonesian confrontation there were a total of 15 deaths. In Vietnam we lost a total of 501 young Australians and since then we have lost three young Australians in peacekeeping activities. It is interesting to note that two those three young Australians were women, which indicates some change in our service activities. I listened with interest to the comments of the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) about the direction she wants this country to head and about a national day of commemoration and recognition of the contribution of all of those who have served Australia, including those who have died during times of war. She talked about history lessons, and about our involvement in the First World War and the problems that arose then. No doubt there are history lessons for us about who we allow to be in charge of our soldiers. 1, as a returned serviceman-and I regret to say that there are only three in this place and the other place-have a number of concerns about how far the member for Lowe and some others in this debate on the ANZAC Day Bill have gone. I note the comments of my colleague the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) in this debate a couple of days ago and the comments raised with regard to what he said. There are many things we can learn from our involvement in conflicts. One I must raise-and I do not think it can go unsaid-is the way in which the Vietnam veterans were treated. It is important in recognising this day of commemoration that we do learn some of these lessons of history and that we do have a bipartisan approach not just for this piece of legislation but for when we send troops overseas. I regret to say that, during the time of the Vietnam conflict, that was not the case. In any future conflict Australia sends troops to I do hope we have bipartisan support for the sending of those troops-as much bipartisan support as the government expects us to show on this piece of legislation. Quite frankly, I believe that is important. I note that we have in the chamber at the moment the initiator of the legislation, the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), and the member for Cook (Mr Dobie) as the Deputy Speaker. They are from opposite sides of the House and I congratulate them on the framing of this piece of legislation. But it does not take away from the fact that we must of learn lessons from what has been done in the past, because in future we as a country must make sure we provide bipartisan support when sending young people overseas. We must now recognise in a bipartisan way the activities of many of those young people who gave their lives. I think it is significant that comments of a political nature have been made in this debate, because most of these young people could not have given a damn about who was governing the country and about which side of the political fence they came from. They were more interested in doing the job they were sent for, getting it over and done with and getting back to their families in Australia. Regrettably, many were not able to do that. All of those young people who lost their lives and those who have returned were only after, I suspect, a fair go for this country. We as the survivors, if you like, can do nothing better as part of a bipartisan approach than to continue to maintain a political system where a - air go is provided; I suspect that, then, we will have done the best we can to provide what all of these many young people would have wanted. As I read out the names of some of the young people who have lost their lives overseas, I wondered what Australia would have looked like if we could have had another four generations from them. I wonder how many of those young people, if they were able to come back to Australia and look at where we are at and what we are doing, would have asked: did we win the war? When you look at the changes that have occurred since those young people lost their lives in the First World War-the railways that we built to build up this country, which have now disappeared, and the systems we put in place in the country-I wonder, if they could come back here, whether they would feel that we had succeeded. There are a few people here who perhaps get a little upset about these comments and are a little concerned about what I am saying. But. if we look at the number of young Austrahans who lost their lives fighting for what they believed this country represented and what they wanted to see as a future not only for themselves but for the generations of their families to come, what it does is throw out a challenge to everyone in this place-not just on the commemoration day, 25 April, but over a lengthy period of time-to ask the questio?: are .we really doing the things that we do m the mterests of all Australians? Are we really achieving what Australia wants on behalf of those who made a sacrifice for this country? I put that question before each member of this House. I know there are some who will be upset because I have made comments about the Vietnam War, who will be upset about other comments that I have made in this speech. The fact is that we as a country have made a number of mistakes over the years. Some in this place will say that we made mistakes by sending people overseas. Others will believe that we did the right thing. But the factis that we did send young Australians away. I hope the lessons of that will be remembered as part of the process of this - eba!e. - ipa-isan, the debate on this legisla!lOn IS; bIpartIsan, by members of parliament, m the sense of what it is intended to do for commemoration, it should be. But if that biparti-a-ship is achieved - t the expense of recogmsmg some of the thmgs that we have done wrong in our society, it is not bipartisanship at all. I make those comments without any reservations. I hope that in the future when inevitably, we get involved in conflicts overseas, members of this House-seeing that many on the other side have wanted to point to our side regarding things that have been done, I will point to the government side and say t-is specifically-remember the bipartisanshIp that we are talking about in this debate on commemoration. I hope they will remember the bipartisanship that we need for those .young people who go away and fight for.thl.s country and who, in many cases, give theIr hves for what all of us would like to see for the future of this country.",84
201,Mr SWAN,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"I, too, rise to support this ANZAC Day Bill. I do so in the spirit of bipartisanship that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson), referred to. I believe it is important that this bill is passed and is enshrined in legislation, because ANZAC Day should be the day of the commemoration of sacrifices made for this country by all Australians who served in conflicts that have plagued the world in this century. I believe that ANZAC Day does symbolise the debt owed by the nation to those whose !ives were affected by war. Most importantly, It must serve as a reminder of our continuing commitment as a nation to honour and serve veterans and their families. It is not sufficient to have rhetoric about the importance of ANZAC Day unless it is backed by concrete government policies supporting veterans and their families. I think ANZAC Day should serve for all Australians as that special time when we contemplate and salute the spirit of ANZAC. What do we mean by the spirit of ANZAC? For individual Australians, ANZAC reaffirms those ideals of service, courage, commitment, endurance and mateship-very important values for the Australian community, very important values to reaffirm and very important values for the future. Most people of my generation would have had a parent, a grandparent, an aunt or an uncle involved in active service in World War I, World War II or even in Vietnam, or knew somebody who had served on the home front. So most of my generation is familiar with the personal and social trauma of war. That will not be the experience of my children's generation, because they may not have had that personal experience gained through the stories of a parent, an aunt or an uncle. My generation, in the main, grew up listening to the stories of veterans, be they our parents, our aunts or our uncles. My father, for example, was a World War II veteran. He instilled in me the importance of remembering those who fought and died in war. Some of my earliest memories are of attending the ANZAC Day ceremonies in Nambour at an early hour of the morning and listening to the speeches that were made at the cenotaph. My father was very active in veterans' organisations and was for 12 years the secretary/manager of the Nambour RSL. So as a boy I grew up with those personal experiences, passed on to me not only through my father but through his friends and the community of the RSL in that country town. I guess through my father and his friends I learnt some of the lessons of war and about how we should not repeat the mistakes of the past. He never, however, spoke of his personal experiences. But he did tell me the stories of the ANZACs because his father was in fact an ANZAC. My grandfather was a World War I veteran who fought and was wounded at Gallipoli, and was repatriated to England. When he recovered he was then sent to France, where he was gassed. He survived that experience and returned to raise his family on a soldier war settlement farm at Amiens, in Queensland's granite belt, where most of the towns are named after famous battlefields on the western front. What I learnt from my father about my grandfather were the lessons, I suppose, of the ANZACs-ofthose who fought at Gallipoli and those who fought on the western front. Really, that is what this bill is aboutcommemorating the sacrifices that tens of thousands of young Australians made there, and the sacrifices that those at home made in supporting them. I do not think it is necessary to spend too much time talking about the deprivation of those who fought at Gallipoli or on the western front. But I learnt, like many other children of my age, stories of soldiers who lived for months in waterlogged trenches hacked out of the frozen mud; how the diggers endured footrot, body lice and chronic infections; how they suffered the horror of mustard gas attacks and, as a result, many died or spent many months in hospital suffering from those effects; and, of course, the stories of those who brought those illnesses back and who never recovered. So my grandfather's story was fairly typical of so many of those ANZACs who passed on to their children the lessons of that period. In my area of Brisbane there are still some of those ANZACs alive and well and continuing to pass on those important lessons. I refer particularly to Mr Ted Smout, a resident of Sandgate, who enlisted in 1915 at the young age of 17. Ted served in France as part of the Army medical corps in the battlefields of the Somme and in many others. He had the opportunity to return to those battlefields on the western front with the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Faulkner, in August-September 1993, to pay tribute to his mates who never returned. Men like Ted, my grandfather and tens of thousands of others will continue to celebrate the ANZAC spirit with their families and are determined to ensure that we continue to commemorate the sacrifices of those diggers. It is very important that, through this bill people like Ted Smout, we as a nation collectively succeed in passing on those lessons to the generations that follow because, as I said at the beginning of this speech, my children and the generations to come will not have had the privilege of enjoying a personal relationship with someone who was a World War II digger or someone who fought in World War I. That is the importance of the Australia Remembers program this year, the 50th anniversary of the end of the World War II. We should take the opportunity to build a bridge between the war generations and successive generations so experiences are not lost and so future generations can learn the values of sacrifice, compassion and caring for your mate. Today I would like to talk briefly about work of the various sub-branches of the RSL in my electorate of Lilley. Since I have become the member for Lilley, I have been fortunate to work closely with all of the local RSL sub-branches in that electorate. They are all working very actively to ensure that the commemoration of the Australia Remembers program this year is very successful. I want to pay tribute to some individuals in RSL sub-branches in my electorate and the contribution they make to the welfare of the community. We as a nation-and probably as a parliament--do not always pay sufficient attention to the voluntary work done in our community. Voluntary work provides many services to many of our citizens and is done by organisations like the RSL, which backs up the very important work done by government departments. In my area I have had the privilege of working with people such as Eric Kay, who is a resident of Nundah and the state President of the Queensland branch of the RSL. Eric is a tireless worker for veterans and their families, and speaks to young students in my area of Brisbane about the lessons of war. I have had the privilege of working with Kev Dean OAM of Sandgate. He is a tireless worker for the rights of incapacitated service personnel and their spouses, and was recently awarded a Lilley Australia Day award for his service and to the veteran community. Kev is President of the Sandgate branch of the Incapacitated Servicemen and Women's Association of Australia. I have also had the privilege of working with people like Gordon O'Sullivan, who is President of the Sandgate RSL, and Ray Suess, who is a member of the Sandgate RSL. Ray is the previous state president of the Queensland RSL and is an active participant in the Australia Remembers committee. I would like to pay tribute to Ted Tremayne, who is from the ClayfieldToombul sub-branch of the RSL. Ted is also an active member of the local Australia Remembers committee and his input is highly valued. George MCGregor, who is also a member of the Clayfield-Toombul branch of the RSL, is very active in promoting the Australian spirit competition committee, the which brings generations together in commemoration of the sacrifices made by ex-service men and women. I also pay tribute to Mick Beeston and Syd Bradley from the Geebung-Zillmere branch of the RSL. That branch recently organised a re-enactment of the march of soldiers from Marchant Park to the Zillmere train station as part of its program to commemorate World War II. I would like to pay tribute to Jean Scouller of the Geebung legacy care group, who also received a Lilley Australia Day award for her hard work fighting for the rights of ex-service widows. I also pay tribute to the work of all of those involved in the Kedron-Wavell RSL, particularly Pat Quinn and Roy Glanville. The Kedron-Wavell RSL is a very large RSL organisation in the north-east suburbs of Brisbane and does an enormous amount of work with local veterans and their families. I pay tribute to the work of George Catchpole and David Prince from the Nundah-Northgate RSL, who are also tireless workers for the local veteran community. ANZAC Day has become as much a day for families as it is for the diggers themselves. I have noticed in recent years an increasing number of people attending ANZAC Day ceremonies, whether at the Kedron-Wavell RSL, the Sandgate RSL, the Geebung RSL or in Brisbane city itself. Each year there is a far greater attendance of people at these ceremonies and, most importantly, a greater attendance of young people. That is a positive outcome we must aim to achieve not only with this bill but also with the Australia Remembers commemoration. We must aim to use this year and the designation of ANZAC Day as a special day to build a bridge between the generations. We must pass on the lessons of war and the values of the ANZACs so that we remain a nation which regards fairness, justice, compassion, service and sacrifice as important values which guide our nation's future. Personally, I regard this bill as being partly in memory of both my father and grandfather, who themselves made those sacrifices.",85
202,Mrs SULLIVAN,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"Moncrieff) (6.15 p.m.}Mr Deputy Speaker, I am particularly pleased that you are in the chair for part of this debate and I am sure it is of pleasure to you, too. I pay tribute to the effort made by you and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) in putting before this House a motion to the effect-which was, of course, carried and supported by this House-that ANZAC Day be declared a day of national commemoration. I, along with many others, welcome the fact that we are debating this bill-particularly in a bipartisan way-and that your efforts have come to this legislative fruition. To me, the bill is a recognition of all who served in Australia in wartime in a spirit of national commitment. Throughout the debate, there has been mention of all those people: both those who bore arms with great courage and bravery-many of whom were killed or maimed-and those who served in the way they could-or were allowed to-at home. Many veterans live in my electorate. The area I represent-the northern Gold Coastdid not have a major urban population at the time of World War II, nor did it even in the days of the Vietnam War. The Gold Coast's growth in population has been very much since then. Whilst certain families on the Gold Coast have family links with those who served in wars, they are not the sorts of links that so many other members have referred to. However, I place on the record-as I have on other occasions-that, whilst the number of veterans Australia-wide is declining, in my electorate the number is increasing because they come to the Gold Coast to retire. So, whilst I do not have in my electorate the long list of RSLs that other members have, there are three very strong RSL sub-branches with numerous members, and many other ex-service organisations. So far as I am concerned, this bill is about all of them. I still have in my electorate a number of World War I veterans. Sadly, there are not very many of these veterans still alive and nearly all of them are in nursing homes. Nevertheless, we manage to get a couple along to our ANZAC Day parade each year. I have a large number of World War II veterans in my electorate. I also have veterans of the Korean War, the Malayan insurgency, the Borneo War-orthe 'Confrontation', as those veterans tend to refer to it-and the Vietnam War. In that context, I feel that I must tryever so gently-to put on the record an objection of a number of my diggers on the subject of the Australia Remembers program. This objection is not at all to the programthey welcome that. The objection relates to a subject raised-I thought a little foolishly-by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) in a dorothy dix question here last Wednesday. Frankly, I could hardly believe that he would invite a dorothy dix question on the subject of whether 15 August 1945 was VP Day-that is, Victory in the Pacific Dayor VJ Day-that is, Victory over Japan Day. Mr Deputy Speaker, I was born in Brisbane during World War II and, like you, grew up in Brisbane postwar hearing about the Brisbane Line. Because I grew up in an atmosphere of some understandable paranoia about Japan because of the fear of invasion and what that meant for the families who lived in Brisbane during the war, I accept that perhaps the term 'VJ Day' was a bit more emotive and may have been more widespread in Queensland than it was in other parts of Australia. I am aware that a few other Australians now living on the Gold Coast who have come from places further south, such as Melbourne, express surprise at this. They have always considered 15 August to be VP Day. I had never heard of it as anything other than VJ Day until the minister starting putting out his material on the Australia Remembers program. I was surprised, as were all my ex-servicemen. It is for that reason that I feel I have to say a couple of words on this subject. My ex-servicemen would not understand why I would not have replied to the minister's assertion on the subject. I would have left it alone if he had. I was particularly offended at his dismissing the diggers' custom of referring to 15 August as VJ Day by holding up a picture of a young woman in a knitted sweater which happened to have 'VP' on it. The picture was apparently taken in 1945 at the time of the victory. The minister said that we do not refer to the victory in Europe as VG Day for Victory over Germany Day. I shall place on the record Why. In Europe there was more than one enemy; Germany was not the only enemy. However, in the Pacific there was only one enemy, that was Japan. That simply is why victory in the European theatre is referred to as Victory in Europe. It was not just victory over Germany; it was victory over the Axis powers. In the Pacific, there was one enemy, Japan; so it became 'Victory over Japan' in common lingo. It seemed to me that the minister was straining a bit-as I have felt the issue has been a bit strained since it was raised-when he referred, rather ironically, to the fact that King George VI delivered a VP Day message to the Empire and the Duke of Gloucester delivered the Governor General's VP Day message in 1945. In the same breath he pointed out: I notice that our comrades in Britain use VE Day for Victory in Europe Day but they use VJ Day Victory in Japan Day ... It is a little ironic that we should have King George VI and the Duke of Gloucester quoted to us as justification for Australians using the term 'VP Day' when the Brits themselves do not follow what King George VI and the Duke of Gloucester said. I think the minister should leave the subject alone. I am quite happy to refer to it-in the spirit of bipartisanship-as VP Day in the commemorations in my own electorate. I point out in passing, however, that we do not have to depend on knitted jumpers and old newspapers. I am sure that, if the minister went back through the records, he would find just as many references as VJ Day as he gave us regarding VP Day. I did not have to go very far to find one. On 1 February 1995, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), incorporated a table on page 210 in Hansard listing 'Australian war casualties'. That table, which was drawn up for him by none other than the Parliamentary Library, refers to 15 August 1945 as VJ Day. I return to the issue of the Australia Remembers program. The committee members in my electorate will be very pleased to put their all into the Australia Remembers program, which I think is an excellent program. As I said, I have a limited number of RSL branchesthey are Surfers Paradise, Southport and Nerang. They are all serving with vigour on our Moncrieff committee. The two local authorities shortly to become one-the Gold Coast City Council and the Albert Shire Council-are officially serving on that committee. They are making a major contribution to what we have planned. The Editor of the Gold Coast Bulletin is also serving on the committee with enthusiasm. An individual called Paul Sharratt is also lending a hand. Paul Sharratt is a name which is virtually synonymous with the Gold Coast. Anyone who has ever holidayed there will probably remember Paul Sharratt's Music Hall. It was the longest running, seven-day a week entertainment anywhere in Australia. Paul Sharratt is a consummate showman, but for he is much more than that. He is an organiser of major events. He organises Tropicarnival, which is our major annual carnival-along the lines of Moomba-and others. He has great skills and a great enthusiasm for this subject. As an individual, he will really add a lot to our program. I also pay tribute to the indications of support we have received from various official quarters in our celebrations. For example, we are delighted that the Brisbane Army Band will be coming to the Gold Coast to support our Victory in Europe celebrations, as will others. It is very important to us. Whilst the Gold Coast has a lot of older retired people, many of whom are veterans, its other concentration of population is the young people. To me, Australia Remembers is about communicating to those who do not have a memory of a major Australian involvement in a conflict how much we owe. That is also what the ANZAC Day Bill is about. How appropriate it is that we celebrate ANZAC Day. At a distance of 80 years, it does seem a long time ago. One has to research a little to find out why' ANZAC' became such a significant word. What those ANZACs did was establish a standard of superhuman heroism in the face of fire, and a carelessness of self when a mate needed help-a standard which succeeding generations of Australians have been exhorted to achieve and have striven for. From my parliamentary experience of Australia's professional armed forces, ANZAC Day is virtually a sacred day. What the ANZACs did on 25 April 1915 is their individual and collective yardstick. They set that standard, one which all must strive for. I also welcome the opportunity to briefly restate the very real significance of Australia's participation in a so-called European war, the Great War, which saw the ANZAC tradition established. Five years ago there was a major celebration-the 75th anniversary of the landing at GaIIipoli. We made much of it in Australia; indeed, much was made of it at ANZAC Cove. A number of our veterans of that day travelled to GaIIipoli in the official party, to be part of the tribute being paid on that very significant occasion-the 75th anniversary of the original ANZAC Day. I was terribly saddened to hear a number of those veterans interviewed on television saying that they felt it had all been a waste; that they had gone for good reasons but those good reasons had not been realised in the way they thought they would at the time. They felt they had achieved what they wanted to achieve. They spoke of the terrible slaughter, bloodshed and injuries that they withstood and endured. It should be put on the record that it is tOeieasy tei look at history from a distance of 75 years but judge it in terms. Of the modern day. 1 think that is what Australia Remembers is about It is about telling young people, 'This is the world the way it was 50 years ago.' It is not that way today, and we hope it never is again. The simple fact is that, back in the 1910s at the beginning of this century, colonialism was very much a part of the world's structure. If you were a superior power, nothing was thought to be wrong with colonising smaller countries, particularly those considered 'primitive'. There were a number of German colonies in the Pacific, not the least of which was the northern half of New Guinea. The rules of war were: if you won, to the victor went the spoils. And the spoils included colonies. If Germany had won in World War I, New Guinea would not have been the buttress for us in World War II-when we were in real peril-that it turned out to be. Further, Germany would have had a base in Western Samoa, one of its colonies earlier this century. However,. because Germany lost the war in 1918, Western Samoa became a New Zealand protectorate under the spoils of war rules. Northern New Guinea became an Australian protectorate, under the rules of war, because we had participated in the so called European war and. were therefore entitled to claim that particular German colony. We did not treat those places badly-as places to exploit. But under the rules of 1915, participation in the war was important; Australia had a big stake in being in that war and in making sure that Germany did not win. Nobody foresaw 1939. Nevertheless, that was the way the world was in those days: every 20 years or so there seemed to be a war between the major powers. That is no longer the case, thank goodness-although we can never tell what the future may hold. I put those facts on the record to say to those World War I diggers and their descendants: it might have been Europe, but it mattered to Australia. Like many other Australians, I have visited Australian war cemeteries overseas. The first one I ever visited was in Jerusalem-Palestine as it was in W orld War I. I remember what a gut-wrenching experience it was to walk past all the crosses bearing so many young Australian's names and ages. They were so far from home---comparatively much further away from home then than it is to us now. I wondered in awe and humility what motives took them there to die. It is very appropriate that 'ANZAC' be a word that we enshrine in legislation and that it live forever. I want to finish with a little reminiscence. When I first became the member for Moncrieff, the electorate covered a large rural area which included a town called Beaudesert, which has a population of about 2,500 people. In my attempts to do my duty on ANZAC Day on behalf of the veterans in Beaudesert, Beenleigh and the Gold Coast, I used to attend the Beaudesert dawn service. If there is anything in the world more moving than an ANZAC Day dawn service, I have not seen it. My experiences of the Beaudesert dawn service will live with me until the end of my days. The situation in Beaudesert is like that of many country towns: there is a war memorial at the main intersection in the town on a little traffic island where all the roads intersectthere are now traffic lights there, as well. The people of Beaudesert gather in the cold and dark-as it is out there in April-on the footpath opposite the memorial. At a given sign they fall in on the roadway; the traffic is blocked off; a catafalque party comes down the street in the 'dark, provided by the Land Warfare Centre. The people at the dawn service in Beaudesert stand in the dark, on the road by the memorial, while a very simple service is conducted. In my experience only two wreaths were ever laid: one by' a nurse from the local hospital-who laid a wreath on behalf of the people of Beaudesert-and one by me. What was hugely evocative to me about that service, as we stood in the dark and listened to the ode being read, was the knowledge that Australia-wide, in hundreds of towns many of which are even smaller than Beaudesert, right at that moment, thousands of people were gathered anonymously in the dark and were going through exactly the same service and echoing exactly the same words-the ode to those that 'we must not forget'. It is something that has been happening for decades, and it is something that will go on happening. Like every other country memorial, the memorial in Beaudesert has a long list of names of those country boys who went off to World War I and also to World War II, times when a higher proportion of our population lived in the country. The names which appear on that memorial are names that still exist in the Beaudesert area but in lessening numbers, because proportionally fewer and fewer people are living in the bush. Even when those names are no longer local names, they will be immortal names. If those country towns shrink right away, as many of them have, one knows that Australia-wide, in the dark, before 4.30 a.m. on 25 April, Australians of all ages will still gather and pay tribute. Like everywhere else, the crowd in Beaudesert gets bigger every year, and it gets younger every year. Whilst I know that so diggers sometimes get a little pessimistic and think that people are going to forget, I do not think that we will ever forget the debt we all owe to all those very brave Australian men and women who have ventured off the shores of this country prepared to pay with their lives to protect what we either hold dear or take for granted. I hope that this year we will remind ourselves how dear we must hold what has been protected. I trust that this bill to permanently make ANZAC Day a national commemoration day will play its part in that.",88
203,Mr NEHL,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"It is very hard to stand and speak about the ANZAC Day Bill without becoming, at least to a very slight degree-even to a greater degreeemotional. No-one in this House who has grown up and spent ANZAC days attending dawn services-some have attended more than others-in the way just evoked for us by the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) could really think of ANZAC Day, if they were to think about it in the way it should be considered, without a degree of emotion. In a way, I suppose it is surprising that we actually need this bill. I certainly support the bill; it is very important that the measures it contains should be enshrined in law. But God forbid that anybody should try to take ANZAC Day away from Australia. ANZAC Day is built into the psyche-into the whole Australian society. Every year when ANZAC Day is celebrated it emphasises that we in country have a long, very proud, history traditions of courage and valour. All Australdemocracy ians can take pride in the service to humanity and to Australia provided by so many Australas Ian men and women over the years. ANZAC Day in Australia does not celebrate war. That is not what it is all about. Returned service men and women who are marching and praying and remembering are not rememSpeaker, bering and celebrating war. ANZAC Day is about service to your fellow man and service to your country. It is really about love or, you wish to use the Australian term, about mateship. It is certainly about dedication. This bill seeks to enshrine the national day of commemoration to recognise and commemorate the contribution of all those who served Australia, including those who died, time of war and in warlike conflicts. It goes further-to the civilian population, to the pretty good. families left behind and to the very many other people who, for various circumstances, could not serve in the armed services but still served their country in other ways. That history of Australian involvement time of war starts in 1860 with the Angloand Maori wars in New Zealand, followed in 1885 with a contingent going to the Sudan, folThere lowed in 1899-1902 with the Boer War. 1900 and 1901, Australians served in the Boxer Rebellion in China. World War I was very significant for Australia. When we stop and consider the background to it, it is absoonly lutely amazing that 10 per cent of the total population volunteered to serve in Out of a population of four million, 400,000 people volunteered. That is quite extraordiII-and nary. We can think back to our forebears; these are our grandparents and other relatives, unless you are part of an Australian family that has come here since that time. Nearly 70,000 people died in that war and 150,000 people were wounded. We say that so quickwere ly-but these are not statistics; they are individual people, like us. A great many them suffered; a great many of them died. They offered themselves for Australia and, indeed, for those perhaps ephemeral things fabric-of called liberty and freedom. When I talk in this place to schoolchildren this who come down from my electorate, I bash with their ears about how important and vital is, so that they are aware of what we have in this country. I can stand up here, I often do, and complain bitterly about what the government and the Labor Party are doing; I have the freedom to do it. But those people who have served in these theatres of war have given me and you, Mr Deputy the opportunity to talk and say what we think. So we might have complaints about the government and other institutions within if our society but, if you boil it down, the reality is that the system we have is pretty good. Just as an aside-I do not wish to become partisan in this debate-I say to those who very genuinely and sincerely advocate some in form of republican change: be very careful before you change it because what we have is As a member of parliament, I suppose I am a fairly old-fashioned sort of politician. Every election I get out in the last week and I spend the whole week on the street corners and the in footpaths with a microphone and I stand up I say what I think about politics in Australia-quite freely, with no fear whatsoever. are no secret police across the street In and nobody with a submachine gun around the corner. But, by heaven, look at your television news tonight-and you will see it. Of the 184 countries of the United Nations, in a handful, 20 to 25, could you or I do what I and, I guess, some others do every that war. election in this country. World War I was followed by World War I will come back to the concept and the program of Australia Remembers-which was followed by the Korean conflict between 1950 and 1953. Australians served in the Malayan Emergency between 1950 and 1960. These tend to be forgotten and yet Australians there serving. Between 1963 and 1966 we had the Indonesian confrontation with of Malaysia. And, of course, one can never forget 1962 to 1973, the Vietnam War. I just cannot help myself; I have to take this opportunity of paying tribute to those Vietnam veterans who returned to Australia after serving. Again, I regret the reception they received but, more importantly, I rejoice that that was rectified. I hope that all of them who came out of that war so scarred do manage to recover very fully and very quickly, although many of them are still suffering. Since then, we have had many peacekeeping forces. Talking about World War II, I was a fairly small boy then and my father served overseas. He was a major and he was the commander of the 10 Battery and 2nd/3rd Anti-tank Regiment, and I might mention one or two things about him in a moment. The member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) mentioned in his contribution something about a cork. When I was at primary school in the early 1940s, I had to take a cork with me. It was threaded on a piece of string and it hung around my neck. Supposedly, when the bombs fell we would bite upon the cork to keep our mouths open, so that our ears would not pop and we would not go deaf. We also had a couple of women's powder puffs which were sewn together with a bit of tape. These were to go over our heads, with the powder puffs on our ears to stop the noise getting to us. I do not think it really would have worked. Every day, as quite a small kid, I went off to school with an enamel plate, an enamel mug and a knife, a fork and a spoon. With air-raid drills several days a week, I went into the slit trenches in the park across from the Hamilton public school in Newcastle. I vividly remember my birthday party on 19 February when Darwin was bombed. My father, of course, was overseas. There was quite a group of kids and the news came of Darwin being bombed. Another memory is of the fruit cases of sand at the front and back doors. The sand was there to put out the incendiary bombs. I am very pleased to say that they did not come and all that happened with the sand and the fruit boxes at my place was that the cat used to have kittens in them. But this is the part of the fabric of Australmorning is. These reminiscences-and it is a very personal anecdotal reminiscence-are part of what we are talking about. Again, I can recall quite vividly that all of the windows in the house were crisscrossed with sticky tape. Brown paper was stuck all over them so that when the bombs came and the concussion came and broke the windows, the glass would not come flying into the house and cut us. I can remember hearing the explosion of the shells when a Japanese submarine entered Newcastle harbour and shot up the customs house and the power station. I am very pleased that my kids and my grandchildren do not have those memories. And I hope that no other Australians ever get to the point of having to have those memories. I mentioned my father. He died on 15 December 1993 at the age of 88 after a long lifetime of service to.the army in Australia. I will not go into it in great detail but he started off as a cadet at school and ended up, as I said, commanding an anti-tank battery throughout the Middle East. He served right through the siege of Tobruk. I think of him and his comrades with incredible pride. I saw a note from one of them only today in my mail. I know from seeing him and the people he served with in action that that comradeship, that mateship, was something very valid, very real and very important. I often say in this place that the 'p' in politics stands for people. Let us face it: if you forget individual people, it is not worth being here. You have to be concerned with individual people. The other person that I would like to mention-because, as I said when I started, one cannot talk about this sort of thing without a degree of emotion-who unfortunately died on 30 November last year, waS my godfather, Archibald Clyde Menzies Ewart. He was a commanding officer of B Company of the 2nd/20th Battalion which arrived in Malaya in February 1941. The 2nd/20th was located on the east coast of Johore and it fought a rearguard action to Johore Bahru across the causeway into Singapore on the morning of 31 January 1942. The Japanese launched an assault on the 2nd/20th on the evening of 8 February 1942 and, by next when they were overrun, 400 of that one company had been killed and wounded. Archie Ewart was the only surviving officer of B Company. He was wounded and hospitaIised. But when the final stand was on around the perimeter of Singapore, he discharged himself from hospital and took part in that last stand. He went into Changi as a Japanese POW. In May 1942, he was part of the first large group of POWs, A Force, which went to Burma. They started off doing some airfield construction and then worked on the infamous Burma railway. He was a unique man. He was one of the very few who were promoted-he was promoted from captain to major while a prisoner of war-and that was in recognition of the work he did while a POW working on the Burma railway. In fact, he was actually mentioned in dispatches at the end of the war because of that. He had a strange way of keeping busy. He carved thousands of water bottle stoppers because the original stoppers for the water bottles decayed, rotted or whatever and so he carved these out of local timber. As well, he carved a chess set. I visited Jenny Ewart, his widow, only a week or so ago and she gave me the chess set that he carved while working on the Burma railway. It is in a cloth bag, which has a drawstring, and is getting tattered and holey. Th-t was Colonel Varley's peanut bag, which was used to hold the chess set. I have actually been on the Burma railway. I spent some time at Hellfire Pass. You cannot help but be very overcome by what went on in that bamboo forest. Of course, many Australians died there. When you walk along the old railway, the lines are gone but the sleepers remain. The bamboo forest is quiet. I was there on Christmas Day a few years ago. It was hot and oppressive but very quiet indeed. The quickest way of walking was to step from sleeper to sleeper. There were 100,000 sleepers laid, and a life was lost for every sleeper. You cannot help but be affected by that. I said when I started that we are not talking about celebrating war; we are talking about celebrating service-and love and dedication. That is what ANZAC Day is about. I want to mention, too, the Australia Remembers program. I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) and, indeed, the government as a whole for their promotion of this and for the provision of funding so that Australians can remember. We must never forget. I would like to mention briefly the members of the Cowper Australia Remembers committee. They are all ex-service men or women: Pat Gillespie, John Martin, Geoff Plummer, Bob Denner, Bert Huxley, Brian Duncan, David Doyle, Jack Needs, Roger Jones, Frank Ellis, Bob Provost, AlfMartin, Tom Simmon, Peter Millet, Russell Pinkerton and Marie and Bill Fuller. I mention them because they are still alive. They are here. We have to remember those who have passed on, as I have remembered my father, Major William Barr Nehl, and Major Archibald Ewart, my godfather. These people are still here. Many of them are still suffering from their service, but they are still in there working like crazy-still serving, still dedicated. That is what, for me, Australia is all about-and that is what ANZAC Day is all about. In conclusion, I want to pay a tremendous tribute to the work done by the RSL subbranches right around this country and by Legacy. Legacy is doing a wonderful job. The number of people it is serving is growing, but the number of legatees who are left is diminishing. I urge those from the Vietnam days to think about joining their older cobbers in looking after Legacy, because it is, as the saying goes, a torch which has to be taken up. I think about the war widows, the TPI pensioners and those wonderful people who have served Australia. That is what ANZAC Day is about. I can only finish by saying: 'Lest we forget.'",91
204,Mr FILING,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"I rise to speak on the ANZAC Day Bill with a great deal of pride and pleasure because I think the bill has a fair amount of bipartisan support for its objective-to provide for a recognised national day to recognise the efforts and the service of those who served Australia in war and warlike conflicts. Of course, as has been enunciated by many of the previous speakers, 25 April has been, for a long time, the national commemoration. The member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) indicated that it may be unnecessary to have legislation to make sure ANZAC Day is permanently enshrined as such. However, I think that the objective of the bill is commendable and as a consequence I support it wholeheartedly. I would like to offer a few comment.;; of my own in relation to the tradition of ANZAC Day and also to make some comments in relation to the Australia Remembers commemoration for 1995. In particular, I want to mention some of the people in my electorate who have become involved in organising the commemorations in our area. First of all, it is quite clear that the efforts of the ANZACs at ANZAC Cove were seen to be a tremendous step in the history of Australia's independence and self-determination. They are often seen as the first great Australian national effort. Perhaps it is a shame that we commemorate an event in which so many Australians lost their lives. However, the efforts of the ANZACs at ANZAC Cove were seen as being one of Australia's great feats as an independent, self-determinant nation. As a person who came here from the United Kingdom in 1971, I have always been absolutely fascinated by the events which surrounded the landing at ANZAC Cove, Gallipoli, and by the importance of Gallipoli and the ANZAC tradition to Australia's nationalism. I am a very staunch Australian nationalist and I am keen to see that our great national symbols are upheld and supported and that, through things such as the ANZAC Day holiday, it is made clear to Australians that those symbols hold such importance within our society and our lifestyle. There are many who would, I suppose, say that ANZAC Day commemorates a failed military operation. Of course, historically speaking, the Gallipoli landing was, militarily, a failure. It was a failure in strategic terms, but, in terms of the efforts and the sacrifices made by Australian servicemen during the period following the landing, during the actual campaign and then during the evacuation, it was a feat of tremendous bravery and courage on the part of those who were obliged to land and take position in the face of Turkish opposition, which had been well warned of the eventual invasion and which was prepared and dug in. As those of us who have seen the more popular versions of these events on the cinema screen and elsewhere know, the ANZACs were given a tremendous pounding and, as a consequence, were obliged to make terrific sacrifices. Their military efforts included individual feats of bravery, especially when supplies were unable to be brought forward to them, and deprivations suffered while they were pinned down by the Turks. As a consequence of the ANZAC Day tradition, ANZAC Day became seen as-and has become-the commemoration of the efforts of Australian service men and women in all military campaigns in which Australia has been involved. I take a great deal of pride in being able to attend the services that are held on ANZAC Day in my electorate. The two main services are held at the Wanneroo memorial, which is just off Wanneroo Road, a very important historical part of my electorate, and just outside the inn at the Yanchep National Park. There is also a commemoration by the schools in the city of Wanneroo in my electorate, generally held at the Wanneroo show grounds. That was an initiative by one of our local Liberal members who decided that it was important that schools, because they were generally on holidays at the time the ANZAC Day ceremonies were held, were able to show, through their own commemoration, their support and respect for the efforts and sacrifices of those who have fallen and those who have served.",94
205,Mr SLIPPER,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,What was the name?,95
206,Mr FILING,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"Cheryl Edwardes MLA, the member for Kingsley.",95
207,Mr SLIPPER,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,She does a great job in the ministry.,95
208,Mr FILING,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"She certainly is a very good Attorney-General in the Western Australian state government. That ceremony is a very moving one. A large number of veterans, and nowadays a very large contingent of school children, come along to show their respect. We generally have a speaker from each of the main campaigns-the First World War, the Second World War, the Korean War and the Vietnam War-and from time to time one of the other campaigns, for instance, Borneo. The increasing attendance by school children and the increasing interest in the commemoration augurs well for the future celebration of what is, I think, Australia's great national day. Of all the public holidays we do celebratethere are a large number of public holidays on the Australian calendar-ANZAC Day has the special significance of being the great Australian national commemoration. After all, as I mentioned earlier, it was the first great feat for Australia after becoming an independent nation. As someone who sees that as an important facet of our cultural development, I think ANZAC Day ought to be permanently enshrined as a national holiday. People ought to be able to take time off to show their respect. At the beginning of my address I mentioned that I would refer to the Australia Remembers commemoration in the Moore electorate. Before doing so, I congratulate the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for initiating what is a very important and useful program not only in commemoration but also in education. One of the original objectives of the Australia Remembers commemoration was to involve young people in the commemorative efforts. The sacrifices and contributions of service men and women and the efforts of those at home were recognised. People put up with rationing, their loved ones being overseas and away from the family for long periods and suffered sacrifices and deprivations as a consequence of being at war. There has been the issuing of a medal to honour those who made an important contribution in civilian service to our national in World War II. That commemorative medal is worthy of commendation. I have spent some time in my electorate encouraging people who are entitled to apply for the medal or those who know of people who are entitled to apply for the medal to do so. I think it is important that they be remembered for the service they gave to their country in a time of war. We have a number of projects being undertaken as part of ,our Australia Remembers program in the Moore electorate. We have had significant support from the local community. I took the trouble of writing to all the community groups in the area and I was very pleased with the response we had.",95
209,Mr SLIPPER,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,From the RSL?,96
210,Mr FILING,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"The RSLs were the first organisations I wrote to. I made sure that I involved as many of the community groups as possible in the program. I will mention some of the people who decided to help with the activities of the Australia Remembers committee. We have had the assistance of Maureen Hill. She is a very active local community member in the electorate and works for the Department of Veterans' Affairs. She has been able to give us an insight into some of the potential pitfalls or problems we might encounter with our program and has also given us encouragement. We have been given the opportunity to use the funds that have been generously allocated to the Moore electorate in order to ensure that the Australia Remembers commemoration is a memorable one in our area. Margaret Cockman from the city of Wanneroo and past President of the Wanneroo historical society has helped us. She is a member of one of the original pioneering families in the Wanneroo district. Her contribution has been very much appreciated because she is a very important local community figure. The oldest building in Wanneroo, Cockman House, is named after her family and is one of the landmarks in our district. We have also received assistance from Philip Baker from the Church of Jesus Christ; Colin Fletcher from the 53 Regional Cadet Unit; Tony Martin, a former Wanneroo citizen effort of the year and former Chief Inspector of Police and also with the Wanneroo Historical Society; Phil Renkin, President of the Yanchep-Two Rocks RSL; John Astill from the Northshore Rotary Club; Daryl Deacon from Craigie Senior High School; Don Edwards from the North Suburban Historical Society and Coastal Heritage Association of Western Australia and the Northbeach RSL; Kelcey Toleman from the 507 Regional Cadet Unit at Joondalup; Cara Cox, Deputy Principal of the North Beach primary school; Kate Hurlbatt from TS Marmion, which is one of the best cadet units in the country. It has won the national award twice in a row and seems to be, if not the best, one of the leading cadet units in the country. The list goes on: Darryl Dunlop from the Lions Club of Duncraig; Captain Alex Kent from the 507 Reigional Cadets; Justin Townsend from No.2 Flight Wanneroo Air Training Cadets; Michelle Westaway of the 53 Regional Cadet Unit, Wanneroo; lain Grealish of 53 Regional Cadet Unit, Wanneroo; Arthur Ventham from the Wanneroo Schools Association and from the Air Training Cadets. Arthur is another person of considerable community contribution in the Wanneroo area. Because of the contribution he has made, the Wanneroo primary school named its new building after him. We also had help from Alison Kent from TS Marmion; Councillor Fleur Freame from the city of Wanneroo; and the Mayor of the city of Wanneroo, Councillor Waters. We decided to support and participate in as wide a program as possible in the electorate because we felt it was important that as many people as possible were involved. We have a large number of projects which I will talk about now. The city of Wanneroo will have a series of five free wartime musical concerts held at the Wanneroo show grounds. That is an absolutely superb idea. The atmosphere of a wartime concert hall will be recreated. In my electorate there are a large number of people who have come from the United Kingdom, like I have. We have the highest concentration of people from Britain. About 25 per cent of people in my electorate were born in Britain. Many of them would have come from families that experienced the Blitz in London. I think they would be very interested in participating in the wartime musical concerts. The Craigie Senior High School will have a community based resource project focusing upon the creation of an educational package consisting of war grave data and interviews with veterans. That will be a very interesting project. Glengarry primary school will have an ANZAC Day service and will dedicate a memorial wall and flagpole to those who served in the war. The Inner Wheel Club of Wanneroo-Wangara and the Wanneroo Rotary Club will have a 1940s style supper/dance with a band and a boxed supper, which I imagine would make people sentimental for the times when those suppers were held during the Second World War. The Lyons Club of Duncraig is organising a memorial grove to be sited in the western part of Tom Walker Park, Sorrento, which will consist of a gazebo, native plants and a memorial plaque. The Lyons Club of Whitford, which holds a very well attended community fair each year, will have the community fair adapted to take on the theme of Australia Remembers during 1995. It gets about 15,000 people a year to the fair and it is one of the great events in the city of Wanneroo. We are pleased to be associated with that. The Men of the Trees, a very well respected organisation in terms of conservation and the environment, will have a commemorative planting of 500 locally grown trees at Perry's paddock with a commemorative monument to be installed. Perry's paddock is close to Cockman House and is another area which has a great deal of historical significance to the city of Wanneroo. Mullaloo Heights primary school will construct a small stone memorial in its school grounds. The North Beach school, which consists of the North Beach primary school and a special ed school, will have an ANZAC Day ceremony. They will have a brass memorial plaque to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the conclusion of the Second World War. The North Suburban Historical Society, assisted by the Coastal Heritage Association of Western Australia, will compile a video collection for archives. They will display World War II material at the museum and will have a plaque commemorating local service action. There will be a booklet issued for young people within the area to bring them up to scratch. The Ocean Reef Residents Association will be installing a bench seat with an attached commemorative plaque at Trig Point Park lookout. It is a very picturesque lookout on one of the high points of the coastal area in the Ocean Reef zone; a good place for people to look at the coastal environment. The St Mark's Anglican community school will be having a series of excursions to venues dedicated to Australian Defence Force involvement. The Wanneroo Agricultural Society-of which I am a member-is going to re-create,or rebuild, the original Wanneroo war memorial park by planting roses and erecting a plaque and an honour board in the very spot where the memorial was originally. The Wanneroo junior primary school will mount a history collection and display contributed to by the five schools in the Wanneroo town district-St Anthony's, East Wanneroo, Wanneroo, Wanneroo junior primary school and Wanneroo senior high school. This venture will appeal to a lot of the youngsters because they will be directly involved in assembling all the material and ensuring that it is a good effort. The Yanchep-Two Rocks Returned Services League sub-branch, the Gloucester Lodge Museum and the Department of Conservation and Land Management are going to have a 'remember and rejoice at Yanchep Park' open day and an earth care market. They are going to mount a static display on radar of the 227 Unit and No.4 Convalescent Unit which were based at Yanchep. All in all, a large number of events in the electorate of Moore will involve a good, wide range of the community associations, groups, and clubs. In my capacity as chairman of the Moore electorate Australia Remembers 19451995 committee I am pleased to be associated with these endeavours. It is something which will be remembered for many years to come. Instead of merely being the vehicle for distributing the grant that was made to each electorate by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the committee decided that the Australia Remembers committee would act as a permanent committee during the year to oversee, coordinate and publicise the activities munity. associated with the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. I am looking forward to that tremendously because we have had such an exciting level of support within the electorate. In closing, may I also recognise the presidents of our local RSL branches. I have mentioned Phil Rankin, the President of the Yanchep-Two Rocks RSL sub-branch. I would like to recognise Neil Fancourt, president of the Wanneroo district sub-branch. Neil has been associated very closely with the commemoration of ANZAC Day by the school children. He has been an absolute tower of strength. I also recognise Mr Bennett and Mr Tomlinson, who are the president and secretary respectively of the North Beach RSL subbranch. I support this bill. It is a tremendous bipartisan push to have Australia's great national day permanently enshrined as a national day and a holiday. It will allow all Australians to recognise the tremendous contribution made by service men and women in the service of their country during wartime.",96
211,Mr SLIPPER,PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL,"The Australian people often complain that, as parliamentarians, we always seem to be at each other's throats and that quite often we do not agree on things. They believe that we are not able to cooperate and work together for the good of the Australian community. The ANZAC Day Bill 1994 is an indication that parliamentarians on both sides of the House can work together for the good of the Australian people. Of course, it is healthy when we disagree on issues. We will disagree strongly and vigorously with the government when it is necessary. On the other hand, when a minister comes forward with a good idea which we support, we will be fulsome in praise of the initiative. We will not hesitate to support what the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) has done in introducing the ANZAC Day Bill 1994. It is one of those bills that will receive unanimous support in both houses of the parliament and, indeed, will receive widespread support in the Australian comThe ANZAC Day Bill 1994 aims to establish ANZAC Day-if it is not already established as such in the minds of the people of Australia-as Australia's day of commemoration. It also aims to enshrine into the Australian way of life this very important national event. It encourages us to remember the sacrifices that were offered and made by so many in all spheres of conflict since Australia became a nation. Having grown up with stories of the war from a grandfather who served in two world wars in all three services, I see this bill as permanently recognising the contribution of the thousands of men and women who have served our nation and who have helped to make it great. Although I congratulate the government and the minister on the introduction of this bill-and in particular the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) for suggesting this approach-I cannot help but feel that this bill highlights the hypocrisy of this government in a number of areas. We laud and applaud what the government is seeking to do through the introduction of the ANZAC Day Bill, but one can contrast its intentions in relation to the ANZAC Day Bill with its attempt to undermine and subvert so many of our other national institutions and symbols. It is important to remember that many Australians went to war to ensure that our generation is able to enjoy our current standard of living. In those days, of course, people considered that they went to war to fight for God, King and country. Today it might be expressed differently: perhaps they might say that they went to fight for our constitution, and our Christian values; the freedom and the way of life that those things represent. I cannot help but feel that the bill does go far enough and that it is perhaps a halfhearted attempt by the government to ensure that our service men and women were honoured. If the government were really serious about stressing what we, as a nation, owe to these people, it would desist from seeking to undermine our national symbols, our national values and our constitution. They are matters which our service men and women fought and died to preserve. I believe, however, that we ought to applaud the government as far as it has gone. Many groups in the community have invited and urged the introduction of this particular bill. The Returned Services League has continually called on the government to introduce this legislation and, indeed, introduce legislation which enshrines other national institutions. Over the last couple of weeks in the House we have seen another attempt by the government to undermine symbols and traditions through the way in which the Speaker ordered the removal of the wigs worn by the clerks. I certainly hope that, upon return to government, we will restore the traditional dignity of the clerks. It ought to be remembered that ANZAC Day is one of the very important days in the life of any member of parliament, as indeed it is in the life of the community generally. It is fortunate that we now celebrate ANZAC Day on 25 April each year. In the past ANZAC Day was, at one stage, celebrated on the nearest Monday and, consequently, we all had a long weekend. I felt that many people perhaps did not celebrate ANZAC Day as they should, but treated it as yet another long weekend. People would go away to the coast or just enjoy the very pleasant lifestyle that we have in Australia. The national consensus which resulted in 25 April being the ANZAC Day holiday was very wise. When one looks at the very many ceremonies on ANZAC Day right across the nation, and the very important participation from all groups in the community, one realises that to make 25 April a public holiday is very much the right and significant thing to do. Many years ago I privately visited ANZAC not Cove. It was rather difficult. At that time. I was backpacking around the Middle East and I managed to get from Istanbul to ANZAC Cove. I landed at ANZAC Cove at about the same time in the morning as the original landing took place. It was half light. I was absolutely shocked at how narrow the beach at ANZAC Cove was. When one looked at the terrain one appreciated just how much territory those Allied men were able to gain in such a very short space of time. It is easy to understand how the toll was so high, given the terrain and the difficulties that were experienced. It is a credit to those men who were part of that landing and part of that first campaign, and in many respects that was our baptism by fire as a nation. I also had the opportunity of visiting the various war graves there. As other honourable members have indicated, it was a very moving experience to be at Lone Pine, to look at the names and see the ages of many of those young men who lost their lives in Turkey at that time. Simpson, who was about 23, was virtually an old man. The number of people who were 16, 17 or 18 was really quite frightening. As a nation we must always remember what we owe to those ex-servicemen. The ANZAC Day Bill seeks to do just that. But it commemorates the contributions made by Australians in all conflicts, not merely the ANZAC campaign at Gallipoli. Like most other electorates, we have a vigorous Australia Remembers campaign committee. When we heard about the Australia Remembers program, I was very pleased. I complimented the minister because I think that it is wonderful that as a nation, in the year of the 50th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, we stand still and take stock of what we owe to all of those people who offered so much and risked so muchmany of whom did not come home at all. So I set up a committee. We had a public meeting and a large cross-section of the electorate cam- along. The electorate of Fisher is over 8,000 square kilometres on old boundaries, and over 9,000 square kilometres on new boundaries. Yet the ex-service men and women, and others in the community, travelled a very great distance to come to this first committee meeting. I was very impressed at how easy it was to get a consensus and to get a committee elected. It would be quite easy for one area to fight against another area. But there was a oneness of purpose in the room and everyone agreed that what we needed to do, as far as the electorate of Fisher was concerned, was to participate fully in the Australia Remembers program to ensure that our electorate played its part in honouring those who had offered so much. I was a little sorry that it was not possible for the government to provide a $20,000 allocation to the new seat of Longman. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), the honourable member for Ryan (MrMoore) and I all had to spend part of our $20,000 in the new electorate of Longman because it did not exist at the time the government allocated $20,000 to each federal electorate. But, to its credit, our committee in Fisher did not worry about old boundaries and new boundaries; it invited submissions from all over the electorate. A large number of submissions were received and 19 projects were recommended to the minister. I am hopeful that we will get word back from the minister shortly indicating that those 19 projects, geographically spread right across the electorate, will be approved for funding. It would be entirely inappropriate for me to conclude this speech unless I outlined the members of the Australia Remembers committee in Fisher because they have done a wonderful job. They have met regularly. They have gone through the applications and ensured that all the i's were dotted and all the t's were crossed. The chairman is Mr Gordon Caldwell, the secretary is Dick Alchin, the treasurer is Bill Platten, and the committee members are: Jim Courtney, Bernie Barton, Bob Russell, Gordon Granzien and John Hodgkinson. That group of people has risen to the task admirably and they will ensure that the Fisher electorate will play its role in Australia's national celebrations this year in relation to the Australia Remembers program with an enormous range of projects, from victory parades to the construction of permanent bricks and mortar memorials. I think we have recommended a balanced program to the minister and I am hopeful that those recommendations will be endorsed. I am also pleased to see that our young people have not been left out. A school education program has been initiated and a number of schools have put forward submissions. It is important that as our younger people come along they realise that the Australia of 1995 did not just happen; it was not through luck that we are what we are as a nation. The nation today is a product of its past and the contributions made by so many others. That is why I am pleased that many schools are taking an interest in the Australia Remembers program, as they do in the ANZAC Day ceremonies each year. The honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) mentioned that it was unfortunate that the government did not include the Australian flag in the Australia Remembers logo. I must say that I endorse his comments in relation to the omission of the Australian flag. The Australian flag was and is an important symbol to all Australians, and in times of war the Australian flag, with the significance that it has, was an inspiration. The Australian flag represents our nation's Christian heritage, with the three Christian crosses of St George, St Andrew and St Patrick; the federal star shows that we have a federal system of government, with one point for each of the states of Australia and the seventh point representing the Australian federal territory; and the Southern Cross indicates our geographic position in the world. Yet again, I place on record my very strong support for the Australian flag and my sadness that the government did not include it in the logo of the Australia Remembers program. As I said at the outset, this is one of those occasions when the people of Australia and their representatives are able to come together to celebrate this important national event. We are standing shoulder to shoulder to indicate what we owe to those people who risked so much so that we could be in this parliament debating this bill and other bills as we do. I would like to commend the minister, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Cook for their initiative. This bill has been kicked around for a while. Fortunately, the bill has emerged through the bureaucracy, has been printed and we are now debating it. I think it is great. It is important that we continue the bipartisan approach that has been taken and that this bill becomes law. It is important that ANZAC Day become enshrined as Australia's national day of commemoration, to be celebrated on 25 April each year. I commend the government and I support the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Hicks) adjourned. NA Motion (by Mrs Crosio) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Faulkner, Mr and Mrs R.",98
212,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"Warringah) (7.28 p.m.}-- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise again in the case of Reg and Sylvia Faulkner. I ,rise to restate my belief that, in this particular case, the Commonwealth may well have acted to pervert the course of justice. Injustice is injustice is injustice. The fact that this is an old injustice-an injustice perpetrated by the Commonwealth-simply makes the situation worse. What is new is certain material obtained under freedom of information which has cast an all too unhappy light on what the Commonwealth has been doing. The first problem in this case is that the Commonwealth doctored evidence. This is not a private citizen but the Commonwealth government doctoring evidence. The Commonwealth knew that the relevant Commonwealth officer had negotiated with the Faulkners with the full authority of the Commonwealth itself. Freedom of information material confirms that officers of the Attorney-General's Department tried to fix the evidence given by that officer. I quote from one officer in the Attorney General's Department writing about this case. That officer said: Shouldthe relevant personconfirm in a statement that he was acting without authority, this litigation would quickly evaporate and it seems more than justified to take whatever steps are necessary to bring about that result. In other words, an officer of the Attorney General's Department was writing to another officer about fixing this case. Another officer in the Attorney-General's Department said: Re ... proposalthat the evidence should be fixedhe thought it sounded like we were trying to buy the truth. I said that is to say, another Commonwealth officer saidwhere's the ethical problem in buying truth? In other words, we have two officers of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department writing to each other about fixing a case. The second problem is that the Commonwealth acted as judge in its own cause. The Faulkners, as bankrupts, required legal aid to prosecute their case. The Attorney-General was both the chief law officer for the Commonwealth and the arbiter of whether or not the Faulkners were to receive legal aid. So the Attorney-General was acting both for the Commonwealth and, in a sense, for the Faulkners. He was on both sides of the case. The freedom of information material recently acquired shows that even the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department was aware that there was a serious conflict of interest. The next problem is that the Commonwealth acted in bad faith. The freedom of information material just obtained indicates , that the Attorney-General had agreed to a token settlement with the Faulkners in the hope and expectation that the settlement would be rejected and legal aid could then be cut off. Let me put that to you again, Mr Speaker: the Attorney-General's Department approved a settlement offer in the hope that it would be rejected; and that would enable legal aid to be cut off. The Commonwealth's own counsel in this case described the Attorney-General's proposal as amonstrous travesty which amounted to blackmail. The Commonwealth government has not come to this litigation with clean hands. It not acted in the way a responsible government should. If an ordinary litigant had acted in this way to pervert the course of justice, he she would be subject to grievous penalties. So I challenge the Attorney-General to look again at this case, to prove that in this situation there was not one law for the Commonwealth and another for a small citizen-the little person in this country. National Competition Policies",101
213,Mr LATHAM,ADJOURNMENT,"As the House would appreciate, I am the strongest possible advocate of the introduction of competition policies throughout the Australian economy. You can, therefore, imagine my pleasure this morning to read in the Australian the findings of the draft Industry Commission report on the benefits of the introduction of Hilmer reforms. It is important to acknowledge and recall the origins of this report. At the last gathering of COAG there was a dispute. The states rejected the Commonwealth's compensation offer of $700 million. Some of the states argued that compensation of the order of $5 billion should be paid. They argued that there would be a substantial loss of revenue to the states as their government business enterprises were exposed to competition. The meeting of COAG, on the recommendation of the states, called in the Industry Commission as an independent referee. The results and report of the independent referee are becoming available. The Industry Commission report finds that state revenues, as a product of competition policies, will increase by $2 billion per annum, partly through the large increase in economic growth feeding back into the state revenue base. The Industry Commission report goes on to find that Commonwealth revenues are likely to decrease by $1 billion. There should be no dispute about compensating the states. The only argument for compensation would run in favour of the Commonwealth. On that basis, it is imperative-it is of the utmost national importance-for the states, at the next meeting of COAG in April, to agree to the speedy introhas duction of national competition policies. This is the largest set of economic benefits in the nation's history. It is the way Australia can or trade its way out of any economic difficulties and trade its way to international economic success. If we are to confirm the benefits and advances made by this government in making the Australian economy more internationally competitive and internationally exposed, it is crucial to lower the cost of business inputs in Australia and lower the costs faced by all Australian industries. That requires public sector efficiency and competition throughout all parts of the national economy. The Hilmer reforms, and this government's program of national competition policies, will reward the Australian people and economy with an enormous efficiency dividend. The Industry Commission forecasts an increase in GOP of 5.3 per cent. That is an increase in national output of $23 billion. It goes on to forecast a 3.7 per cent increase in real wages. Because of the competition on prices, it also forecasts a fall in the CPI of 4.4 per cent. That is a perfect outcome; a huge increase in national output and an improvement in the real wages available for working Australians, yet with a decline in the inflation rate. The report goes on to forecast a $9 billion increase in household disposable income. That is, every household in Australia will be better off by $1,500 on its consumption. That increase in national consumption would produce a huge increase in employment in all industries, in all parts of the national economy. The most important findings relate to Australia's international trading position. The Industry Commission has forecast an enormous increase in export performance, with exports going up by 14 per cent, while imports increase by just 1.5 per cent. That is a dollar equivalent of an $8 billion improvement per annum on Australia's current account deficit, an improvement of 1.9 per cent of GOP on our external account. This is of the utmost importance. That finding is the best news any government could have on the economy. It means that we change forever the threshold from which the economy faces constraints on the external account. In times of bust over the last 20 years, the current account deficit has been about three per cent of GOP. Ouring times of boom and economic recovery it starts to move towards six per cent of GOP, which is always seen as a constraint on economic growth. These Hilmer based reforms will lower that threshold of the current account as a proportion of GOP by almost two per cent, dramatically improving the strength of the Australian economy and the durability of growth throughout the recovery phase. These are tremendous improvements, not least for consumers in relation to prices on local telephone calls, Australia Post producing more competitive prices, and the states deregulating their marketing authorities-improvements across the board for consumers and economic growth. (Time expired) Primary Producers",102
214,Mr FORREST,ADJOURNMENT,"I take this opportunity to again draw the parliament's attention to the critical hardship being faced by the rural areas I represent. Whilst I am very interested to hear the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) enthusiastically embrace proposed reforms by Hilmer, I am mindful that for my rural constituents that sort of competition will mean that some of those post offices will close. I think that in any such reform we have to be mindful of the pain and anguish already being suffered in rural areas. I mentioned last week on the adjournment the difficulties being faced by grain growers-my area being a very strong part of the grain belt. There have been three failed seasons in a row: the first due to adverse weather during a harvest; the second due to a massive mice plague; and the third-which no-one hears so much about-due to a drought. I have been really disturbed that the government has not responded to requests from Victoria for special circumstance consideration. I again urge the reconsideration of that decision as a matter of urgency. The situation in Victoria is having a devastating impact on regional economies. Small businesses are suffering. These are the businesses that depend on the strong primary industries that surround them. It is time for urgent action. I do not think my area can wait for a decision in the autumn, a decision which the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) has promised. Those who rely on their income for cropping products need access to capital. This is not just to sow the 1995 crop but also to attend the enormous 1andcare needs of an arid region such as the Mallee. They need that capital at an affordable interest rate. I remind the government that in the 1980s a crop loan program was introduced-and it worked well then-where the crop itself was used as security. Such a scheme could be easily embraced to assist Victoria. Those who rely on their income from pastoral sources are very concerned about retaining their core breeding stock. We have seen the same situation on a massive scale through New South Wales and Queensland. It is essential that that stock be preserved. I have mentioned small business, which deserves some relief from the imposts of ever increasing interest rates. The process by which special circumstances is considered works through a special Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Committee, RASAC, which considers applications. This was submitted on 28 October last year. I note that in the Senate on 8 December the minister said that, on the basis of drought, exceptional circumstances was a rare event-in other words, a one in 20 years or so experience. I have to say that Victoria, particularly the north west, has suffered worse than a one in 20 years experience. Three failed crops in a row is more than anybody can sustain. I note the minister's assurance that an autumn review of that decision will be considered, but I fear it will be far too late. In his press release of 28 October 1994, Senator Collins said: ... as a working guideline, exceptional circumstance would be indicated when the combined impact on farmers of the core criteria was a and severe occurrence. I say to you that Victoria qualified for five out of six of the criteria needed to determine exceptional circumstances, and the people of that region feel very disappointed and let down that the government has not considered their position one of exceptional circumstances. I urge the government to reconsider its decision, because every day I am confronted with distressing representations from farming families. Many are denied access to welfare the support because of perceived valuable assets, which nobody wants to buy, and oppressed by the hard-nosed attitude of their financial I institutions, denying them access capital and even living expenses. Again, I urge the government to please reconsider urgent needs of the north west of Victoria. Bishop, Mrs J.",103
215,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Bass) (7.43 p.m.}-I rise this evening to make a number of points, especially to answer the ill-considered and highly presumptuous comments made in this place by the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) during the adjournment debate last week about my attitude to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The member for Wannon referred to an adjournment speech that I had made earlier that week which incorporated the text of a speech made in my electorate by Mrs Jan Bishop, a woman whose family is particularly reliant on Tasmania's timber industry. The member for Wannon was obviously of the misconception that I quoted this speech in order to criticise the Prime Minister. Let me inform the House and the member for Wannon that the reason I quoted this speech into Hansard was to highlight the level of feeling in and the importance of the forest industry debate to Tasmania and Tasmanians. Jan Bishop is a true example of a Tasmanian involved in the forest industry. Her words were from the heart and the hip pocket. Her words were born of the frustration she felt from the status of the debate at that time. I am the sort of politician that will always listen to the concerns of the grassroots people in my electorate, and I am indeed very suprare portive of Mrs Bishop and the families involved in the forest industry. In fact, during the adjournment speech I made last week, time prevented me from finishing the last few lines of Mrs Bishop's speech. I will quote them to the House now, because this was her final plea to the 2,000-odd people who had marched through the pouring rain in Launceston to hear what people such as she had to say on the issue of the forests. She said: We are the converted. Long ago we realised the importance of conservation and we learned how to find a balance with our forests. In practice, we are world's best environmentalists. The politicians in Canberra simply don't understand. urge all of you today to tell our story, the true story, and to speak out against the lies that have put to ongoing our future at risk. the The member for Wannon made the ludicrous suggestion that I had lost faith in my Prime Minister. Nothing could be further from the truth. I have the greatest of faith in Paul Keating and in his ability to produce a decision which is considered, fair and balanced. Mr Kalter interjecting",104
216,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"In fact, on the very issue to which the speech of the member for Wannon alludes, my faith in the Prime Minister has been totally vindicated by the decision of the cabinet last Thursday evening. Mr Katter-What rubbish!",105
217,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I warn the member for Kennedy.,105
218,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"The great thing about the Labor Party is that it is truly a broad church. Sometimes that means that things get a bit heated at both ends of the debate; but it also means that invariably we come up with the best solutions. The Liberal Party, unfortunately, is far too narrow to come up with a compromised decision like we did last week; it is simply incapable of it. The comments by the member for Wannon about my attitude to the Prime Minister were simply wishful fantasy. The suggestion that the government is falling apart is simply laughable. Paul Keating knew that my stance on the woodchip issue was a strong one because it was so important to jobs and families in northern Tasmania. He spoke to me on the phone and invited me to his office to hear those concerns. He then took those concerns into account during the cabinet meeting which followed. The member for Wannon should know that I support the Prime Minister because he is a Prime Minister who is prepared to listen to the concerns of his backbench. Perhaps the member for Wannon should examine his own relationship with his new leader before he fires blank and misguided bullets at my relationship with the Prime Minister. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is yet to formally announce the reappointment of the member for Wannon as a whip. Department of Social Security: Telephone",105
219,Mr WAKE LIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Grey) (7.47 p.m.)Among a number of frustrations that are aired about the Department of Social Security or the Child Support Agency is the frustration about the waiting period on the telephone lines, particularly the numbers beginning with 13. In the larger regional electorates in particular, people are becoming frustrated and tired with the extraordinary waiting period on the DSS phone lines. A number of people have given me some examples and I will quote a couple. One chap, who inquired over four days about his father and a pension issue, waited up to three-quarters of an hour. I think it averaged about half an hour each day. By the time he got to me, he was not particularly impressed. The DSS staff in my electorate do a great job to the best of their ability, with the resources available and the demands made upon them. Not only are their resources scarce; they are sometimes misapplied by a centralist mind-set and an overreliance on technology which eliminates the human factor and the common sense factor. The introduction of several new DSS programs, such as the home child-care allowance and the partner allowance, have brought in a two-edged sword: the DSS staff are busy trying to implement the new legislation and to place people onto new allowances while their clients, naturally enough, become more concerned to understand their new entitlements, and use the phone more. My particular concern is that people living in areas of regional South Australia, such as Grey, are currently put through to the DSS telecentre based in Adelaide-where more than 100 people are employed-because they cannot be put through to their local office. My constituents should be able to access their local DSS people in a much more direct way. There are a number of ways in which that could be done without detracting from the intention of the current service. There is the matter of regional employment. There is some irony that, as the technology becomes more sophisticated, it seems that the service in regional Australia in some cases is actually more remote. Only last week one of Service my constituents who lives in Laura called the DSS telephone line to discuss his payments. He eventually asked to be put through to the local DSS officer at Port Pirie so that he could speak directly with staff there about his particular problem. This request was refused. My constituent was forced to drive from his home in Laura to the Port Pide DSS office in order to get the answers he required. Besides the sheer frustration, waste of time and inconvenience of his trip, the drive cost my constituent at least $20-$20 that cannot be wasted when you are dependent on government payments. These are a couple of examples of how people living in regional Australia are disadvantaged by the so-called service provided by government departments. Our urban based policy makers have little concept of the added difficulties faced by people living outside cities. Telecentres were originally set up because the DSS found that any DSS officer with a computer could answer a query for a client from any area of the state. The DSS also found that if all telephone queries were directed to a dedicated telecentre it gave staff more time to deal with people in the . office and process their own paperwork. However, the regions have paid a price for this. The telecentre may have given local staff more time, but it has meant a loss in customer service. Part of the charter of the DSS is to provide a good customer service, but when people have to wait on the telephone for half an hour or more there is clearly something astray. I recently spoke to the manager of the Cairns DSS telecentre and found that the officers there have made a distinct commitment to customer service and have decided to have local calls directed to their office rather than to a Brisbane telecentre. The Cairns telecentre has a telephone waiting period of approximately 10 minutes-still not perfect but much better than the current situation in South Australia. I believe telecentres in Grey could employ staff to deal with local clients. I would rather have the DSS employing people and providing a better service to clients than the present situation. In November I brought this problem to the attention of the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) by way of a letter, and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (MrsCrosio), who is at the table, acknowledged it. I am grateful for that. The parliamentary secretary mentioned the added technology available and the answering machine proposal, but of course a few questions come to mind immediately. Would people have their telephone calls returned? How long would it take? How long would DSS officers continue to try to return a call before they gave up, et cetera? It is absurd and totally unacceptable that one of my constituents was, in the end, forced to drive to another town to talk about his problem with the local DSS. This kind of thing should not occur and the government must administer the DSS in a different way. (Time expired) Child Care",105
220,Mr HORNE,ADJOURNMENT,"This evening I would like to talk about the national child-care strategy, because it is one of those local areas that we on this side of the House are very proud of. We have a strategy that actually encourages parents of young families to place their children in accredited child care. We subsidise the fees and give cash grants to ensure that those places are of the highest quality. It comes as a surprise today that the Premier of New South Wales should make an announcement that his government now will participate in the national child-care strategy. It must rank as one of the most hypocritical announcements in the history of this nation. For four years the Fahey government has refused to participate in the child-care subsidy program. In April 1992 the then Minister for Community Services, John Hannaford, said that New South Wales wanted out of child care and asked the Commonwealth to take over full responsibility for it in that state. Seven weeks out from an election, the born-again protector of families in New South Wales, Mr Fahey-it seems to be a fairly common trait with Liberal Party leaders-has decided that he is going to look after families and that, in that state, child care deserves attention. The four-year delay in New South Wales by the Fahey government has meant that 12,000 child-care places and $40 million in subsidies have been lost to the families of New South Wales. In my own electorate there are extended waiting lists for child care. A community day care centre at Metford, one of the fastest growing suburbs in the lower Hunter, was rebuilt last year by Maitland City Council. It is currently operating 20 places short simply because the Fahey government has refused to participate in this program. The commitment by the residents of Maitland to this centre has been great.' The commitment by the council and the federal government has been ongoing for many years. Because the state government refused to acknowledge the need of young families in that area and because the state government oUohn Fahey refused to participate in the program, this facility is now operating at a loss. Mr Katter-He has taken money off working families.",106
221,Mr HORNE,ADJOURNMENT,"You wouldn't know because you don't participate too often, but I do know that low income families in the Dungog, Rutherford, Tenambit and Thornton areas are being pushed to find acceptable child-care places. Mothers who may have the opportunity are denied work because the state government has not supported their need. I also believe that the Fahey government's refusal to participate in the child-care subsidy program up until now can only be viewed by all women in New South Wales as refusing to recognise the vital role women play in the workplace. The difficulties many women have in balancing home and work commitments has surely been compounded by the lack of childcare facilities. Surely if the state government was supportive of women and the increasing demands placed upon them, the national child-care agreement would have been signed in 1990. Instead, help has been callously denied to them for so long. I guess it is all about priorities. We know what John Fahey's No. 1 priority is: get re-elected-with the help of Rocky Gattellari or not. Unfortunately, after that the priorities somewhat more obscure. I could only take the state Liberal government's statement of commitment to families in an extremely cynical light. Surely the Fahey gove-nment's enormous grant of $2.3 million to the Newcastle Knights football team and the $4.3 million currently being spent on a highly questionable railway station in a yet to be developed suburb where there are only limited railway services anyway, having previously been cut by the same state government, is not representative of a benefit that many families are desperate to use. (Time expired) Child Care",107
222,Mr BRADFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"It is amazing to hear a Labor member come into this place and talk about child care when the Labor government has made such a huge mess of it. It is going to the wrong people. The honourable member for Paterson (Mr Home) was quite right: there are working women out there that need to get child care but cannot get it. The latest episode from your side is the absolute backflip of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), now foreshadowed as we face the budget: that is, the possible means testing of the child-care rebate. The Prime Minister made a great fuss about this at the last election-another example of absolute electoral fraud. He went on record as quite clearly saying that this was a matter of right and not a matter of welfare at all. We now hear foreshadowed as we face the budget that this is going to be means tested. There is also the horrifying possibility that the home child-care allowance may be means tested. This was another great con job on your side as far as child care was concerned",107
223,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I remind the honourable member for MCPherson to address his remarks through the chair as members of this place constantly remind me. Mrs Crosio---Scar-mongering.,107
224,Mr BRADFORD,ADJOURNMENT,"The parliamentary secretary never likes to hear the truth. It must really hurt when you hear this. The parliamentary secretary will recall that the Prime Minister went to the electorate prior to the last election and made a great fuss about how are the government was going to provide this allowance for the stay-at-home parent and gave the impression that it was going to be something innovative. What happened? It turned out to be the dependent spouse rebate in another form. That dependent spouse rebate worked perfectly well through the tax office; there was never any problem with getting it. Now, those who did get it have to go through the Department of Social Security to get it. Are we now to see yet another enormous backflip on the home child-care allowance? As far as I am concerned, it would be absolutely deplorable if there were an attempt to means test that. It is already means tested on the stay-at-home parent's income. It is normally the mother whose income is means tested. But are we to see a situation where it is tested on the family income? Will the husband's income, as it will be in most cases, be means tested for the home child-care allowance? I fear for families. That is why I could not miss the opportunity to put on record my disgust at the sort of approach this government has had to families. Child care is an example of it. The government has absolutely failed families in this country in respect of providing adequate opportunities for child care for those who really need it. The test of that will come in the next budget. House adjourned at 8.00 p.m. The following notices were given: Mr Leo MCLeay to move That: (1) the following Bills be referred to the Main Committee for consideration: Prawn Boat Levy 1994; Prawn Export Charge 1994; Prawn Export Promotion 1994; Asian DevelopmentBank (Additional Subscription) 1994; and Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment (No.2) 1994; and (2) the following order of the day, government business, be referred to the Main Committee for debate: Family Law Council-ReportMotion to take note of paper: Resumption of debate. Mr Tanner to move That this House calls on the Government to develop a Timber Industry Plan to (a) ensure full protection of high conservation value native forests, (b) facilitate the move to high value adding production in the industry, (c) eliminate inappropriate subsidies which artificially depress the price of timber extracted from native forests and (d) guarantee that there will be no net loss of employment as a result of the changes. Mr Adams to move That this House: (1) calls on the Government to continue to support the timber industry which is a vital part of Australia's economic future and the economic foundation of many Australian communities; (2) accepts that there can and should be an ecologically sustainable forest industry at the same time as the establishment of comprehensive and representativeforest reserves on a national basis; and (3) maintains that both of these objectives can be achieved through regional forest agreements and that priority must be given to the comprehensive regional assessments that will form the basis of these agreements.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Australia Post: Direct Marketing (Question No. 1696) Mr Bradford asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 8 November 1994: (1) Has his attention been drawn to the concern caused by a letter sent by Pan-Pacific Seminars on behalf of Australia Post to 25,000 persons in Australia to promote a seminar organised by Direct Marketing Solutions, an advisory arm of Australia Post. (2) Was the letter sent in a plain envelope with no return address and signed ""AP"". (3) Did the Australian Federal Police issue a warning to recipients of the letter to take special care. (4) What action is he taking to ensure Australia Post never again authorises the distribution of a similar letter. (5) Will Australia Post apologise directly to the recipients of the letter. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, I am aware of the contents of the promotional letter in question and the nature of the concerns it caused. Australia Post has advised that it was planning to hold a series of national seminars on creative mail opportunities. The seminars were aimed at creative directors who currently focus on radio, TV and the print media. The objective of the seminars was to encourage creative directors to use direct mail as a marketing tool. Australia Post commissioned a private company to organise and promote the seminars. As part of the promotion, an initial letter was to be sent to some 2,000 creative directors. This was subsequently expanded to some 24,000 people on the advice that a wider distribution was needed. A second letter and brochure were to be sent two days later. Senior management within Australia Post became aware of the nature of the promotional campaign when complaints were received from people who had received the initial letter. Immediate steps were taken to stop the promotion and cancel the seminars in view of the obvious concern raised by the promotional material. NA Australia Post arranged for the company concerned to write a further letter to all of the recipients of the initial letter, apologising for any concern caused. This action commenced on 19 October 1994. (2) Yes. (3) To the best of Australia Post's knowledge, the Australian Federal Police did not issue a warning to the recipients of the letter to take special care. (4) Australia Post assures me that, as a result of an internal inquiry, it has put in place appropriate procedures to ensure that a similar mistake does not occur again. In addition, I am advised that the two managers that had been involved with the campaign have since resigned from the Corporation. (5) . Australia Post acknowledges that the form and content of the initial letter was insensitive, ill considered and inappropriate. In addition to the Company writing to all recipients of the initial letter, Australia Post has written to all those who complained to it offering sincere regret and unreserved apology for what happened. Child Support Agency (Question No. 1737) Mr Filing asked the Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 15 November 1994: (1) Has his attention been drawn to instances of financial suffering of Australian families caused by differing stances adopted by the Department of Social Security and the Child Support Agency (CSA) over eligibility of children as dependants. (2) Is it a fact that a 19 year old university student living at home is recognised as a dependant for the purpose of making Austudy payments but is not recognised by the CSA as a dependant for the purposes of assessing the legitimate living expenses of a person paying maintenance; if so; why. (3) What steps are being taken to evaluate the ability of persons paying maintenance through the CSA to meet the level of payment required by the CSA.",107
225,Mr GEAR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I am aware of the financial struggle many non-custodial parents face when they take on the responsibility of supporting their new partner's children. For non-custodial parents trying to do the right thing by providing adequate financial support for children in two households, it will usually be a struggle irrespective of how much they have to pay under a child support assessment. In determining the amount payable under a child support assessment, only the incomes of the parents of the child are taken into account. This is based on the family law principle that it is the child's parents who have the primary duty to maintain the child. It means that if either parent has re-partnered, the income of the new partner is not taken into account. In addition, no allowance is given in the assessmentfor a child of the new partner from their previous relationship. If an allowance were given, it would lead to the non-custodial parent paying less child support for their own child. This would be particularly unfair if the non-custodial parent received an allowance for their partner's child and their partner also received child support payments for the same child from the child's non-custodial parent. If the non-custodial parent has taken on the role of step-parent of their partner's child, they can ask the court to find that they have a duty to maintain the child. Such a finding will enable the noncustodial parent to ask the Child Support Review Office to reduce their assessment to take into account the additional cost of supporting their stepchild. (2) A child support assessmentonly applies until a child turns eighteen, even if the child is still a full-time student. In cases where a non-custodial parent has other natural or adopted children who live with him or her, the child support assessment will take account of those children and be reduced accordingly. However, if the non-custodial parent has a dependent child who has reached eighteen years of age and is still a full-time student, no allowance will be made for that child. This approach is consistent with the family law view that, generally speaking, a child is capable of financial independence at the age of eighteen. Therefore, the child is not considered as a dependant for the purpose of a child support assessment. However, just as a custodian may apply to the court for a maintenance order which continues beyond the child turning eighteen, a non-custodial parent may also ask the court to grant an allowance in their assessment for a dependant child who has turned eighteen. In both instances, the court must be satisfied that there is a duty to maintain the child, either to enable the child to complete their education or because of a mental or physical disability of the child. (3) At the time of the introduction of the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989, the Government put in place a mechanism for monitoring the Child Support Scheme. The then Minister for Social Security appointed the Child Support Evaluation Advisory Group for this purpose on 6 September 1989. The Advisory Group's role was to monitor the conduct of the evaluation of the Child Support Scheme and to advise the Minister for Social Security on this matter. Its final report, which was tabled in December 1991, dwelt at length on the adequacy and fairness of the child support formula. The Group concluded that on the basis of available research on the cost of children, the current child support formula provides payments which more closely reflect the real costs of children than did the previous court based system. The report made a series of recommendations for fine tuning the formula, most of which the Government has adopted or is in the process of adopting. The Child Support Review Office provides a further means of evaluating the capacity of noncustodial parents to meet their child support commitments. Non-custodial parents may ask the Review Office to review their assessment if they have special circumstances which the child support formula cannot take into account. You would no doubt also be aware that the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues reviewed the adequacy and fairness of the formula as part of its terms of reference. In its report to Parliament, it made a series of recommendations for modifying the child support formula. The Government is currently considering these recommendations.

Kurnell Refinery: Risk of Air Crashes (Question No. 1853) Mr Dobie asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, upon notice, on 7 December 1994: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the risks associated with aircraft using Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport crashing upon the facilities at the Kumell oil refinery. (2) Were the facilities at the oil refinery sidered in the relevant environmental impact study. (3) To what extent can the risks referred to in part (1) be stated accurately. (4) Is the Minister able to say what would be the environmental impact on Botany Bay if the oil refinery facilities were hit by aIi aircraft or aircraft debris.",111
228,Mr BRERETON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) & (2) A comprehensive hazards analysis and risk assessment was undertaken for the environmental impact statement (EIS) for the Third Runway proposal. This assessmenttook account of the potential risks associated with aircraft crashing into the oil refining and storage facilities at the for the extension Kumell oil refinery. (3) As in any risk assessment study, the assessment for operations at Sydney Airport with a be parallel runway necessitated the adoption of a number of assumptions. For example, due to the excellent safety record for scheduled flights into and out of Sydney Airport it was necessary for the EIS to base the likely frequency of aircraft crashes on overseas data. The risk study, which was undertaken by the Australian Centre of Advanced Risk and Reliability Engineering, was based on the best available information and to that extent the risks calculated for various contingencies can be regarded as being as accurate as is possible. (4) It is difficult to predict the possible environmental impact on Botany Bay if the oil refinery facilities were hit by an aircraft or aircraft debris. Any impacts on the bay would be heavily dependent on whether the protective bunds around storage tanks were breached and on the effectiveness of the emergency procedures adopted. In considering this matter, the EIS prepared for the third runway proposal noted that it is difficult to predict the con- likelihood of spilt oil flowing into Botany Bay because of the wide range of possible outcomes.",112
