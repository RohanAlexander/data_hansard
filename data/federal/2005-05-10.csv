5,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I move: That this House: (1) records that 8 May 2005 marked 60 years from the surrender of Nazi Germany thus ending the second World War in Europe; (2) honours and remembers the thousands of Australians who fought in that war and in particular the over eleven thousand Australian soldiers, sailors, airmen and nurses who gave their lives; (3) pays tribute to the sacrifices of allied nations in that conflict; (4) recalls the magnitude of Nazi war crimes against humanity and in particular the Holocaust which claimed the lives of six million Jews and other minorities; and (5) records its gratitude for 60 years of relative peace and its ongoing commitment to the universal values of freedom and democracy. It is appropriate, even though we are 60 years on, to pause for a few moments to recall that historic moment, on 8 May 1945, which saw the end of World War II in Europe. As Winston Churchill was to observe on VE Day 1945, although the German war had ended, Japan ‘with all her treachery and greed' lay unsubdued, and, for another few months of particular relevance to Australia, the war in the Pacific continued. The end of that war will be the subject of particular commemoration in this country later this year. With remarkable prescience, when the Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919 the former Allied Supreme Commander in World War I, Marshall Ferdinand Foch, of France, was to remark, ‘This is not a peace treaty; it is an armistice for 20 years.' Tragically, his prediction turned out to be deadly accurate and World War II became the most costly, lethal, evil and horrible conflict that the world had seen. It was a war that, unlike World War I, ended in the total subjugation and surrender of Germany. It was a war that consumed, to a far greater extent than any previous war, civilian populations. It was a war that clouded-but, when defeat came to Germany, ultimately revealed-the horror of the persecution of the Jewish race by the Nazis. The extermination of six million Jewish citizens and other minorities in the concentration camps of Europe represents the most systematic and horrible genocide in all of recorded human history. It was a war in which Australia played a very significant and honourable role both in the European theatres and also in the Pacific, a role that involved the deaths of many thousands of Australians. It will always be to the credit of this nation that for 12 months at a crucial stage of World War II-before the entry of the United States and all that that entailed, with the huge industrial capacity and overwhelming economic power of the United States-she stood alone alongside Great Britain and other Commonwealth countries against Nazi Germany after the subjugation of most of Europe. History will always remember the contribution of the airmen of Australia in the Battle of Britain and the role they played alongside their British, Canadian, South African, New Zealand, Rhodesian, Polish, Czech and other comrades in that decisive air battle, which represented the first significant setback that Hitler suffered during the war. It was a setback which was not in itself enough to turn the tide, but it was the first time reverse had been suffered by the Nazis. As I know all members of the Houseand, in particular, the Leader of the Opposition-will appreciate, the land battles in eastern Europe of course represented the greatest bloodbaths of World War II. It has been estimated that some 85 per cent of German casualties were incurred fighting on the Russian front. And the losses of Russia were truly staggering; some have put them at 25 to 27 million people. Then of course the most decisive event in the war occurred, in terms of the ultimate conclusion, when Japan attacked the United States and thus brought into World War II all the power, strength and overwhelming industrial capacity of the most powerful country economically that the world has ever seen. One could talk at great length about the historical significance of this conflict, and this is perhaps not the time to do so; but it is a time to record the fact that it was a fight for the values this nation believes in. It was a fight for freedom; it was a fight for democracy; it was a fight against those who sought to impose their will brutally on minorities. It was also a fight that led to an upheaval that dramatically reshaped the face of post World War II Australia. It is fair to say that much of the migration that changed Australia after World War II would not have occurred had it not been for the upheaval of that war and the coming to Australia immediately after World War II of so many people, not only those who were called, in the language of the time, ‘displaced persons'-those who came from the Baltic countries and from eastern Europe-but also those who came from northern and southern Europe seeking a better life in this country. They have made a permanently beneficial impression and have shaped in a very significant way the face, the temper, the mood and the character of postthat a significant war Australia. As we mark this very important anniversary, we acknowledge the huge sacrifices that our allies made-the sacrifices of the Russian people, the British, the Americans, the Canadians and those brave people from countries such as Poland who suffered so much at the hands of both the Soviet Union and the Nazis. No country in the history of Europe was more picked over and cast aside-and despoiled perhaps-than the nation of Poland. We remember these events, we give thanks to God that we have had relative peace for the last 60 years and we rededicate ourselves as a people and a parliament to the universal values of freedom and democracy, which were the values we fought for and finally succeeded in protecting in those terrible days of World War II.",23
6,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I support the Prime Minister's motion and trust that the House will get a full opportunity to debate this important motion later on. A couple of weeks ago, we in this parliament, the Prime Minister leading, had the sorrowful duty of attending and participating in the commemoration service for the nine Australians serving in Australian Defence Force in peacekeeping mode who were killed when a helicopter from the HMAS Kanimbla crashed on the island of Nias, off Indonesia. The sacrifice made by those nine Australians was appreciated by all their fellow Australians, and their service to the nation was properly commemorated in this place. They stand in direct line with the 27,000 Australians who gave their lives in that worse of conflicts, World War II. Of course, the way they performed their role in peacekeeping was a very different task, though the conclusions for them were the same as for those 27,000. The war for Australia was basically a Pacific war; it was not principally the war in Europe. Our commemorations in this country will I suspect be a deal more substantial on 15 August this year, when we recollect that that is when that war finally concluded. Though our war was fought here, the consequences of that war were enormous for this country. At the very beginning of that war, that is where we stood. In the Middle East and in Europe just over 10,000 Australians lost their lives. As the Prime Minister pointed out, for a period in this war we had the honour of standing alone. We and the other members of the British Commonwealth who were then engaged fought on when most European resistance to the Nazis had collapsed. In that period Australians found themselves gradually drawn into what ultimately became a massively successful effort on the Western Front. A primary commitment was made in the Battle of Britain and in the development of bomber command and coastal command, which kept Britain in the war, by many thousands of very Australians, some 4,000 of whom lost their lives in that process. As we debate politics in this country, we often think of the argument between Curtin and Churchill on the withdrawal of Austrathe lian troops from the Middle East. It was in many ways the beginning of a substantially independent outlook on Australia's part about the way in which we would judge what was in Australia's interests, what we would have to confront in the battle for the survival of Australia and what priority that ought to get. But when we contemplate that we tend to forget that one Australian division remained behind: the 9th Division, which was the pivotal division in Montgomery's victory at El Alamein. Churchill went and personally thanked General Morshead, who was head of the 9th Division, when that battle concluded. Morshead's response to him was: ‘Gee, thanks, Prime Minister. The boys were interested.' Indeed, the boys were interested and they successfully concluded a battle that was described by Churchill as being perhaps not the beginning of the end but the end of the beginning. It was the first battle which gave the Allies a sense that they could win, that the Germans could be beaten and that a successful outcome to the war could be secured. Though the war had by then expanded massively and those who ultimately defeated the Germans had come into it, there had still not yet been a victory which indicated that the conflict at the end of the day would be successful. We also sometimes lose sight of the fact that, although there were very different wars in the Pacific and Europe, at different points in time they were interlinked. The role played by the Australian troops who remained in the Middle East and by the Australian troops who held the Japanese in Papua, like the roles played by the Americans who held the Japanese at Guadalcanal and the British who held the borders of Burma and India, actually was quite substantial in determining the outcome of the war in Europe. It is not well known or understood by many that in 1942 most of the supplies to Russia went through the eastern Indian Ocean, not through the Atlantic Ocean. That is what actually kept Russia in the field. By holding the Japanese in place, by weakening their capacity to strike across India and dominate the western Indian Ocean and by holding the Germans in place in the Middle East, a supply route was sustained. It was only necessary in 1942, but the route was sustained and that kept Russia in the field and us in a warwinning position. I am so glad that these commemorations are being held in Moscow. One of the side benefits of the collapse of the confrontation between East and West that came as the Cold War concluded is that it permits us a greater degree of honesty about those who were responsible for what occurred in the 1940s, both in Russia and here, and to pay tribute where tribute is due. In earlier commemorations of the conclusion of World War II none of us were encouraged to do that. We on our side now acknowledge, as the Prime Minister did, that the basic task, the basic function role of destroying the German war machine, was in fact performed by the armies of the Soviet Union. They are the ones who chewed up the German defence forces like the god Moloch. The consequence of that, of course, was that they also carried most of the casualties. The deaths that were experienced by both the civil and military populations in Russia and in its satellites absolutely dwarfed anything experienced by anyone on the Western side of the dispute. We have been able to acknowledge that fact since the collapse of the Berlin Wall. We can also note that, when the Allies in the West finally attacked in Europe on DDay, a month later the Russians decided to relieve pressure on the bridgehead that had been established in western Europe. To give the Allies some comfort, the Russians opened up a front early on the Germans. That battle saw more Russians killed than were killed amongst all the Allies from D-Day till the final conclusion of the war. It was a huge blood feud between two huge totalitarian powers, finally decided in favour of one of them. Just as we have now been able to admit to these central facts, so have the Russians been able to admit to a few with the conclusion of the Cold War. It should be noted that back in 1989 the Russian parliament passed a resolution condemning the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and acknowledging the errors of a previous Soviet government in producing a situation which for a time materially encouraged the Nazi regime in Germany. The postwar world was dominated, just as our population structure was dominated, by the consequences of World War II. World War II threw up the Cold War, which effectively succeeded it. We in Australia have reason to be grateful for the education that young Americans received during the course or of World War II. It was the experience of those boys and women from the Middle West who fought the battles in Europe and the Pacific for the United States that led them to understand that the United States could never again afford to be isolationist and that they had to take responsibility. They provided the essential underpinning and popular opinion that sustained the preparedness of the United States to act internationally and take responsibility for the international system from that point on. That formed the basis of the type of United States to which we allied ourselves for all of the Cold War and to which we remain allied. The effect of the human depravity displayed by many on the enemy side during the course of the war was to create a surge of people out of Europe as refugees to this country, including the parents of my wife. They changed the character of Australian society, making it the multicultural society it has become, and very arguably changed our character for the better. They strengthened us to confront the realities of the world and world politics as they have subsequently emerged. We have much reason to be grateful to those who came here in sorrow and suffering for what they were prepared to build here with the rest of us in creating the new Australian nation in the aftermath of the war. So that had, of course, a substantial fect on the mindset of Australians, our cultural experiences and the character of the society we were. We cannot go past a commemoration of VE Day without also drawing attention to that most terrible of many terrible events during the course of World War II-that is, the Holocaust, in which the Nazi ruling authority was responsible for the deaths of six million Jews. Out of all the horrors of World War II, that stands signally as probably the most depraved act by any set of human beings directed against any other set of human beings in all of human history. So humanity, if you like, has not much to be proud of in terms of our capacity to demonstrate ourselves as people of goodwill and decency by anything that occurred in the course of World War II. But, just as World War II revealed the depths of human depravity, it also revealed the heights of human greatness. That greatness was manifest by that marvellously tough generation of Australians who participated both in the European war and in the Pacific war, coming out of the depths of an economic recession here, and who have passed on to future generations a legacy of enormous pride in their achievements and sacrifice. Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places. NA His Holiness Pope John Paul II",25
7,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That the House notes the death on 2 April 2005 of His Holiness Pope John Paul II, expresses its profound regret at his passing and records its deep admiration for the magnificent leadership he provided to the Catholic Church during the period of his pontificate. The death of Pope John Paul II left an imef- pression on the world and grabbed the attention of the world, as the deaths of few people in my lifetime have. His death took from the world a great religious leader, a man of great strength and conviction, a man of peace and a man who, arguably, played an instrumental role in the destruction of Soviet communism. The late Pope was an inspirational leader for the one billion adherents of the Catholic Church throughout the world. As a nonCatholic can I say that, on most occasions, he spoke in the name of the entirety of Christendom. He was a person with enormous authority who believed that to temporise over your basic beliefs in the hope of gaining some short-term popularity was always an unproductive thing to do. He was a person who opposed watering down the faith, as he saw it, in the face of criticism in order to win support. He was a friend to all Christian denominations. In an unprecedented way he reached out to Jewish people, to those of Islam and to other denominations. He was also to many people of no faith at all a figure of great strength and inspiration. He demonstrated great personal courage when he survived an assassination attempt more than 20 years ago. He will be remembered as a very muchtravelled pope. He came to this country on two occasions: in 1986 and again either late in 1995 or early in 1996. I had the great privilege of an audience with him at the can in 2002, and although the onset of Parkinson's disease was very obvious and although his health was failing, his great good humour, his vivid recall of his time in Australia and his capacity to communicate about the affairs of the day were still very much there. He dedicated his life to the dignity of the individual. He incurred a lot of criticism both from outside and on occasions from inside his own church. But he never wavered from what he thought was right. Although like every other human being he was not always right, and although there were things he said that I may have disagreed with, overwhelmingly he articulated the basic tenets of the Christian faith common to all of us, and he articulated them in a very courageous and very effective way. In many respects his finest hour was when he advocated the cause of freedom in his native country, Poland. The way in which he associated himself with the Solidarity movement in Poland, the way in which he gave a spiritual dimension to the political leadership of Lech Walesa, was quite inspirational and quite outstanding. The reason why Soviet imperialism finally collapsed was that it was economically worthless but, even more importantly, it was morally bankrupt, and no person, no individual, did more to expose the moral bankruptcy of Soviet communism and the suppression in particular of his native Poland than the late Pope. So with some personal commitment and feeling, I am very honoured to have the opportunity to move this motion and speak in praise of the contribution to his own church and Christendom more broadly, the cause of peace and the values of our civilisation that I believe the Pope represented. He sometimes appeared to take an unfashionable stand. He was often criticised but he never wavered. Whether he was always right or sometimes Vati- mostly right and sometimes wrong is not really the point: he showed a strength of character and a commitment to what he believed in that is rare in this modern world, so I salute him and I honour the contribution he made to the world, his church and many things that I think bind all of us together. May I take this opportunity of congratulating the new Pope, Benedict XVI, on his election to the See of Rome and to the throne of St Peter and to a position which is in a sense the oldest in Western civilisation as well as its spiritual dimension. I wish him well. It is not an easy time to assume the job but I suppose, that being the case, I do not seek to compare him with his illustrious predecessor. That is always unproductive. On this occasion we pause to honour a great figure, a dominant figure of our time, a great religious leader, a person who believed in the good things of life and a person who was a great advocate of the cause of the dignity of the individual, the human spirit and the free values of democratic life that we all hold dear.",27
8,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to support the remarks of the Prime Minister. When Pope John Paul II was elected in 1978, he and the world's 1.1 billion Roman Catholics embarked on a papacy that was arguably one of the most historically significant in the history of the church. It was a journey that created the world's first global papacy. Geographically, it was a journey that meant the Pope was seen in person by more people than anyone else alive and arguably by more people than any person who has ever lived. It is estimated that four million people attended one mass alone in Manila, in 1995. Over his 26 years as Pope, nearly 18 million people came to his Vatican audiences. He was the first Polish pontiff, not an insider from the Vatican's inner sanctum but a worldly cleric whose faith had been tested both by personal experience and the brutal politics of his homeland. His mother and brother died at an early age. He lived in the shadow of Nazism: several of his Jewish friends were executed at Auschwitz and he was conscripted as a labourer in a limestone quarry. As the Nazis attempted to eradicate Polish culture and pride, he joined a secret seminary and just after the war he was ordained. As a cardinal he was known as a staunch enemy of communism, the champion of human rights and a sophisticated intellectual. He recognised the importance of giving expression to Polish feeling, all the time maintaining a delicate balance to avoid provoking an explosive wave of rebellion and inevitable brutal retribution. The experience gave him a deft touch when it came to dealing with people with whom he disagreed. Again as cardinal, he was the chief advocate for concessions by the state towards the church and the Polish people spanning human rights, education, access to the mass media, the elimination of censorship and religious choice. ‘Do not be afraid' was the catch cry at his inauguration and this turned out to be relentlessly prophetic both in his beloved Poland and the rest of the world. In the 15 months following his election as Pope John Paul II, world politics experienced near-seismic shifts: Vietnam invaded Cambodia, consolidating communist power in Indochina; the Khomeini revolution dramatically altered the balance of the Middle East; Nicaragua fell to the Sandinistas; the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Many perceived all this as a substantial tilt in the global distribution of power towards that of the Soviet bloc. In response, Pope John Paul II embarked on a mission to reclaim eastern Europe. In June 1979 in Warsaw's Victory Square, he stood before an 11-metre-high cross and implored the crowd: ‘Do not be defeated.' They responded, shouting back, ‘We want God. We want God.' It can be no coincidence that the instrument of Polish liberation-the trade union movement, Solidarity-was born just 12 months after Pope John Paul II's first visit. Ever since, Cold War historians have debated how much influence his nine-day visit had on the politics of Poland, how much quiet moral support he gave Solidarity, which went on to topple the communist regime. Solidarity founder Lech Walesa had no doubt about the powerful persuasion of the Pope: We know what the pope has achieved. Fifty percent of the collapse of communism is his doing. The Pope ended the Warsaw mass with a prayer for the Holy Spirit to ‘renew the face of the earth', words that became a rallying cry for Solidarity. According to Lech Walesa, more than one year after the Pope spoke these words Solidarity was able to mobilise 10 million people for strikes, protests and negotiations. He said: ‘Earlier we tried, I tried, and we couldn't do it. These are facts. Of course, communism would have fallen, but much later and in a bloody way. He was a gift from the heavens to us.' The Pope recognised that the right of workers to organise themselves in trade unionism was an essential underpinning of democracy. The Pope's potential to influence political change was initially underestimated by the communists who ruled Poland after Soviet troops occupied the country following World War II. They were not overly concerned at his elevation to Archbishop of Krakow in 1963, dismissing him as a poet and a political dreamer. His coronation as Pope was a different matter. Here was a Pole from behind the barbed wire of eastern Europe who was now the most prominent religious leader in the West. For the Polish, it was nothing short of a miracle that one of their own should now play a pivotal moral and political role on the world stage. They were not disappointed. Distance was never any barrier. There was no pope in living memory more committed to reaching out to people wherever they lived. The first of his 104 foreign visits was to the Dominican Republic and Mexico, and the list of the countries ited illustrated his recognition of the demographic of the Catholic Church. He travelled a total of more than 1.2 million kilometres or 3.24 times the distance from Earth to the moon. He held meetings with 1,600 political leaders, including 776 heads of state and 246 prime ministers. He was a brilliant linguist. Besides his native Polish, he spoke Latin, English, French, German and Italian. He visited Ireland, England, Spain, the Middle East, Africa, North and South America, Turkey, the Philippines and of course Australia. He was always determined to meet people on their home ground and always proclaiming the challenge of peace transcending religious differences. God is everywhere, someone once commented, but John Paul II has been there several times. He visited Sarajevo, with its divided Orthodox and Muslim communities, at the height of the Balkans war and Kazakhstan in the days after the September 11 terrorist tacks. He went to the Holy Land and Egypt, speaking of tolerance and justice amongst Jews, Christians and Muslims. Before setting out for Israel, he asked forgiveness from the world for the faults committed by members of the Catholic Church in its 2000-year history. He nurtured the evolution of the Catholic Church into a world defender of human rights and a champion of the poor and disadvantaged. In his 2001 apostolic letter at the beginning of the new millennium Pope John Paul II described a world entering a new era burdened by contradictions where the affluent few enjoyed immense possibilities while millions of others lived on the margins of progress. As the spiritual leader of 1.1 billion followers, Pope John Paul II spoke out forcefully on issues of war and peace claiming that in our time every war is unjust. In January 2003 he gave an address to the Vatican stating: “NO TO WAR”! War is not always inevitable. It he vis- is always a defeat for humanity. modern He went on to add, and I quote: I will simply add today, faced with the constant degeneration of the crisis in the Middle East, that the solution will never be imposed by recourse to terrorism or armed conflict, as if military victories could be the solution. His unstinting condemnation of war and his willingness to engage in intense debate meant that no nation could automatically rely on his approval whatever their political allegiances. In the final years of illness and frailty, Pope John Paul II was an inspiration to Catholics and non-Catholics alike. His visibly deteriorating health was an example of the power of moral strength over suffering. In his own words, he said: I have understood that I have to lead the Church of Christ into the third millennium with prayer, with various initiatives. But I saw that this was not enough: I must lead her with suffering. This from a man who throughout his life at- worked to end human suffering, a man who bid for peace-a spiritual leader whose compassionate global ministry upheld the inalienable dignity and value of every human life. Like the Prime Minister, I extend our congratulations to his successor, Benedict XVI. He has mighty shoes in which to stand. He has already indicated humbly that he does not believe that his papacy can match this one. He was the man at the right hand of Pope John Paul II in the period of time he held the pontificate, so he is a man who has been in a situation to view one of the most significant human beings of the 20th century and the beginning of this century. Much must have rubbed off from him. Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places.",28
9,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I inform the Prime Minister that the resolution will be transmitted in the usual way. Hon. Albert (Al) Jaime Grassby AM,31
10,Mr HOWARD,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That this House records its death on 23 April 2005 of the Honourable Albert Jaime Grassby AM, former federal minister and member for the division of Riverina, places on record its appreciation of his long public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Al Grassby was born on 12 July 1926 in Brisbane, leaving Australia in the 1930s and travelling with his parents while his father took construction work in the Sudan, Italy, France, Spain and England. Mr Grassby went on to serve with the British Army in the infantry corps and the intelligence corps from 1945 to 1946. He returned to Australia in 1948 and, having trained in journalism, was employed first by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture and then the CSIRO as an information officer and editor of publications. He eventually moved to Griffith where he met and then married Ellnor Louez in February 1962. A member of the Australian Labor Party from 1951, Mr Grassby was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Murrumbidgee in 1965. He held that seat until his resignation in 1969. He was elected to the House of Representatives as the member for Riverina at the 1969 election and returned to office with the election of the Whitlam government in 1972. He lost his seat to John Sullivan of the National Country Party in the 1974 general election. Mr Grassby was appointed as the Minister for Immigration in December 1972. After leaving parliament, Mr Grassby was appointed as Commissioner for Community Relations, a position he held until 1982. In the 1985 Australia Day honours list Mr Grassby was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia for his service to community relations. On behalf of the government I extend to his wife, Ellnor, his daughter Gabriella and to other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their deep regret at the bereavement.",31
11,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"I rise to support the remarks in this condolence motion by the Prime Minister and thank him for his kind words directed to a colleague from this political party. Al Grassby's evolution as a passionate advocate of what he insisted on calling ‘polyethnicity', which we all know better as multiculturalism, was preordained. He was literally born into it. His mother, Margaret Foley, daughter of a Glasgow-Irish family, met his father, Spaniard Albert Grassby, on board a ship bound for Queensland in 1922. Adventurers and rovers were rife in the family. Al's grandfather ended up in Brisbane via Spain and South America, where he had assisted Chile with military supplies against Bolivia and Peru. According to his grandson, ‘He went through four fortunes and several marriages, liked to gamble and had the slowest horses in the state of Queensland. Young Al's father was equally restless, and by the time Al was 15 he had attended 13 different schools in six different countries and had never lived in one place for more than two years. He himself mused: ‘First the Depression, then the war; the constant moving from place to place, learning new languages and attitudes all the time-it was a tough but effective apprenticeship in community relations.' Ironically, he came to Australia as a ‘10quid migrant' on a British passport and, significantly, it was Al Grassby, Whitlam government immigration minister, who introduced Australian passports in 1973. Settling in Griffith, a region he embraced with typical enthusiasm, he was elected to the New South Wales parliament in 1965. Four years later he became the federal member for Riverina with a record 22 per cent swing. It was a result that prompted a stunned and smarting Country Party leader, Doug Anthony, to liken the new MP to Paterson's curse: a noxious weed, purple in hue-and, incidentally, the colour worn by Al when he was sworn in. Regarded by his detractors as something of a lair and a spiv, an aberration who would soon self-immolate, Al shamelessly courted the media, wooing them with his racy style and exuberant language. He was temperamental, quixotic, generous and prone to overdoing things. He never learned to say ‘No comment' to journalists. After holding on to Riverina in 1972, he was desperate to take on the primary industries portfolio but was considered too risky, too exuberant. In fact, Gough Whitlam later said of his decision to give Al what was then the relatively junior portfolio of immigration, ‘Oh, I couldn't give him primary industry, he would have agreed to everything.' Characteristically, Al warmed to his new role. Instead of being the champion of farmers, he became a champion of migrants. He came to the job with multiculturalism already inexorably gaining acceptance among Australians. Harold Holt had formally abandoned the White Australia Policy in 1966 and the Whitlam Labor government had removed the last pieces of racially discriminatory legislation. This was reflected on a visit to the Philippines when Immigration Minister Grassby was asked about the White Australia Policy and famously responded: ‘It is dead-give me a shovel and I will bury it.' He was passionately committed to the principles of the liberal democratic tradition: tolerance, equal opportunity, freedom of expression and choice. He was totally opposed to the fashionable thinking of the day: the rigid assimilation of migrants, the pressure on them to shed their ethnic identity immediately they set foot in the country and become homogenised Australians. Nevertheless, despite that commitment to multiculturalism, he was also greatly committed to his view of the Australian idea and ideal. He was a substantial exponent of the Eureka incident from the constituency of the member for Ballarat back in the 19th century as an exemplar of Australia's democratic spirit and the development of Australian democratic institutions. I suspect the multicultural character of some of the leaders of the Eureka rebellion probably assisted him in advocating other elements of his view and philosophy on life but, nevertheless, it was that Australian incident which was dramatically influential in his view of the world. Embracing the metaphor ‘the family of the nation' he explained: In a family you have the short and the fat, the tall and the thin and the blonde and brunette and everything you can think of. They are all in one family. We were going to talk about the family of the nation with many ethnicities. Everybody was embraced in the family of the nation.' In the same vein, he claimed: Beauty doesn't lie in one set of colours. The idea that Australia should have one image and one alone would be the equivalent of throwing away the pepper and salt. As immigration minister, and later in his seven years as community relations commissioner, Al introduced a raft of reforms to help immigrants from non-English-speaking backgrounds, including the nondiscriminatory selection of migrants, granting passage assistance to Vietnamese orphans-later extending this to all orphansand extending support and education to migrants. He played an influential role in the introduction of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. But he was not without his foibles. Barry Cohen, the Labor member for Robertson, who shared a room with Al Grassby in 1969, is on the record as declaring: It was like sharing a room with a cougar for three years. I loved him dearly but he was absolutely impossible. I don't know which was worse: having him in the room or not having him. Al would be hammering away on his 1819 typewriter while simultaneously screaming on the phone in Italian and turning up the radio broadcast so he could hear it all above his own noise ... all that was bad enough but when he wasn't there I'd have to answer the phone and handle them all myself. I gave up trying to work. Today we remember Al Grassby for his passionate advocacy of equality, difference and opportunity and for his exuberance, flamboyance and colour. On behalf of the Australian Labor Party I extend my condolences to his widow Ellnor, daughter Gabriella and grandson Khedra. Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places. Hon. Sir Johannes (Joh) Bjelke-Petersen",31
12,Mr ANDERSON,CONDOLENCES,"I move: That this House record its deep regret at the death on 23 April 2005 of the Honourable Sir Johannes Bjelke-Petersen, KCMG, former Premier of the State of Queensland, places on record its appreciation of his long public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen was a legendary figure in Queensland politics. He transformed Queensland from Australia's cinderella state into the economic powerhouse that it unquestionably is today. As has been recorded, his early life was hard. It was marked by childhood polio and by desperately hard work. Its only consolation was his very strong Lutheran faith. His early life shaped his character and was the source of his lifelong commitment to the virtue of work, family and private enterprise. In 2001, Sir Joh recorded his last formal interview, an oral history with Gregg Borschmann for the National Library of Australia. In it, he recalled how he had left school at 14 and started clearing an adjoining family property. He lived in an old cow bale and shifted his bed around when it rained because it had no walls, only a roof. He bought his first tractor in the 1930s for £300. He recalled that his neighbours had never seen one before and walked around it as though it had been delivered from Mars. They all said to him, ‘Joh, you'll go broke as sure as the sun's going to come up tomorrow.' But within a week they had started hiring him to do their contract farming. He began his political career in local government but quickly transferred to state politics as the member for Nanango and, later, the member for Barambah. He was commissioned as the Minister for Works and Housing in 1963 and quickly established a reputation for efficiency and reliability. He subseKCMG quently became the Premier of Queensland in 1968, holding that high office until 1987. He oversaw the remarkable development of Queensland that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. The state boomed with new industries. Its population grew dramatically, as more and more Australians crossed the Tweed in search of a better future. Brisbane flowered as a modern city that was showcased, of course, by the 1982 Commonwealth Games and the 1988 World Exposition. Sir Joh, as has been recorded, was personally responsible for Queensland's decision to abolish death duties in 1977. The other states and the Australian government, as the Prime Minister will recall, had to follow suit. As a result, an entire generation has now grown up without experiencing how those duties added the misery of unfair taxation and, in many cases, financial ruin to the burden of grief. Every political leader has a moment that defines them and crystallises everything they stand for. Today we have remembered VE Day-and I was interested in the commentary on the 9th Division. My father was one of those there, and he was horrendously wounded on the second day of El Alamein and very nearly did not survive. But we have remembered it: the end of the war in Europe. It is a day that will be forever associated Winston Churchill, but his defining moment had been five years earlier when he inspired his people to stand alone against Nazi tyranny. Today we have also remembered Pope John Paul II. His defining moment was surely his pilgrimage to Poland in 1979 which helped lead to the establishment of the Polish trade union Solidarity and the collapse of communism in eastern Europe. The profound effect of that visit was perhaps best summarised by a graffito scrawled on one of the banners of the Polish communist state. The banner read ‘The party is for the people', but a courageous Pole had added ‘But the people are for the Pope'. Sir Joh's defining moment, of course, was in 1985 when his government defied the industrial thugs of the Electrical Trades Union and restored power in every sense of the word to ordinary Queenslanders. The ETU had terrorised the people of Queensland for years-a point that the commentators writing about the dispute now seem to have forgotten. It ought not to be forgotten. Every year seemed that the lights of Brisbane would go out. You could stand on Mount Coot-tha and watch entire suburbs go black as engineers carried out ‘load shedding', as they called it. One year, teachers at a Brisbane primary school collected everyone's plastic school lunch boxes and filled them all with water. Why? Because someone in the ETU had threatened to cut off the power to the city's water pumping stations. And the teacher said to his class: ‘I can't give you a shower but I can give you a drink.' By 1985 the people of Queensland had seen enough, and Sir Joh's resolute stance against union blackmail inspired the nation and led to the National Party's stunning victory in the 1986 state election. I had the privilege of reading one of the lessons at Sir Joh's state funeral at Kingaroy, at which the Prime Minister spoke graciously with and very decently, as did the Premier of Queensland. I would like to share a part of that reading. It sets out his life in the rolling phraseology of the King James Bible. It is from II Timothy 4:7: I have fought the good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. Mr Speaker, I extend my deepest simply, the sympathy of The Nationals and the sympathy of this House to Lady Florence and to Sir Joh's family and friends.",33
13,Mr BEAZLEY,CONDOLENCES,"I join the Deputy Prime Minister in this motion of condolence and the expression of sympathy to members of Sir Joh's family as expressed at the conclusion of the remarks of the Deputy Prime Minister. I cannot pretend that Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen was anything other than a bitter enemy of my party or the trade union movement, with whom we are aligned. The matters between us had all the characteristics of a feud. We fought him and he fought us in political battle after political battle over the it years. But it always behoves a parliament like this to acknowledge the passing of a person who has been a genuinely significant historical figure in the Australian community, and Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen was a genuinely significant historical figure. Although the Deputy Prime Minister referred to the battles of Sir Joh with a number of the trade unions over issues in Queensland's affairs, I have to say that the lives of very many ordinary Queenslanders-their superannuation, their happiness in retirement-were destroyed in the course of those battles. And they were little Australians, not big Australians. As a minister I came across Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen on a number of occasions. He was an extraordinarily courtly fellow. He would walk into your office, usually accompanied by a bevy of Queensland public servants, and no matter what your political background he would say with very effusive gestures: ‘How nice it is to see you, young man. What a good thing it is that politics gives opportunities to young men. There are many important things that I have to discuss with you and I would like you to meet Sir Sydney, and he will now mention a few.' That would be Joh's contribution. The other abiding memory I have of him concerns Flo and is when the National Party were supporting us in expanding the size of this parliament over the bitter opposition of the Liberal Party and the Democrats. I received a call from a couple of National Party leaders-and I am not given to exposing people's hands, even when they are people good enough to share a bottle of whisky with me after this was all over-in which they said, ‘What are you doing, you fool?' or words to that effect. I said, ‘What do you mean “you fool”?' They said, ‘Aren't you aware of what is happening in the Senate?' I said: ‘Yes. The legislation is passing. You're going to vote with us.' They said, ‘Well, when are we going to vote?' and I said: ‘Well, it's a debate up there. The senators like to have a lengthy period of time to consider and mull over these matters.' Then he said words to this effect: ‘You idiot. Don't you understand we have got Flo locked in a room with the telephone pulled out so she cannot receive a call from her husband? Will you go into the chamber, make sure your whips move that the motion be put and carry the legislation. Damn you!' I do not paraphrase there. So I did. The legislation passed and a bottle of whisky was killed. These two events were times in my life when I crossed one way or another the path of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. As I say, I think they are thoroughly in keeping with all he managed to inspire at different points of time in the Australian political community. Nevertheless, I think his life must be laid down in record here, and so I do. He was one of three children of Carl, a Lutheran minister, and Maren, both Danish migrants to this country. In 1903 Carl was sent to New Zealand by the Lutheran Church to perform pastoral duties and he was soon followed by Maren, who travelled there to marry him in 1904. Together they returned to Australia in 1913, settling in the South Burnett region and establishing a dairy farm. As a child, Sir Joh was a pupil at the Taabinga village school. He contracted polio at nine-an experience which was to have a lasting effect on him-and he left school at the age of 13 to work on the family farm. He was determined to lift his family out of an impoverished existence and pay off the bank debt on the farm. Even at this age he demonstrated a determined capacity for hard work and a knack of identifying a business opportunity. In 1933 the Bjelke-Petersen family acquired another property, which he cleared and developed. For 15 years he lived alone in a cow bale, clearing the land with a team of horses from dawn to dusk, returning home only on Sundays. Little wonder that Sir Joh was the first farmer in the district to acquire one of those newfangled tractors, which soon became the mainstay of his successful contracting business. Moving into more diversified farming and acquiring more heavy farming machinery, the contracting business thrived. Sir Joh is also credited with pioneering that uniquely Queensland method of mass land clearingstringing heavy anchor cable between two bulldozers and advancing full steam ahead. The contract business grew rapidly and Sir Joh took up flying. He purchased a plane as a means of servicing the business. The purchase of the plane led to the establishment of a successful aerial spraying and seeding business, which in turn led to an expansion into oil and mineral exploration and eventually into speculative trading in stocks and shares. Sir Joh was a technically extremely competent person. There is a third memory that I have of him of one of the visits he made to me. He made several when I was aviation minister-he was fascinated by aviationand introduced me to his pilot, Beryl Young. He pointed out to me that he was about to take a jet pilot's licence. This was while he was Premier of Queensland, and I think by then he must have been well into his 70s. Immediately after he left the room of that meeting, I rang the department. I said, ‘This maniac is about to take a jet pilot's licence. We're going to have no diplomatic passes here, thank you very much. He will be examined by New South Wales air surveyors, not Queensland ones. I'm not having Russ Hinze set the police force into following home our examiners in the case of Joh Bjelke-Petersen not passing.' He passed. Not only did he pass but I was told by the officers who had examined him that there were mistakes in the exam which he detected and which he corrected and, in future when they were going to examine pilots, they would make sure that the Joh Bjelke-Petersen amendments were put in place. It was one of the low points, I must say, in my ministerial career. Sir Joh was a non-drinking, non-smoking committed Christian and passionate to the point of being obsessive about Queensland. He regularly discussed the Bible with his father, befriended the local Lutheran pastor, helped his mother teach Sunday School and became a lay preacher. He was elected to parliament in 1947. He said in his maiden speech: When I became a member of this Parliament I recognised that I incurred responsibilities that I did not carry previously. I assure Honourable Members that I regard these responsibilities as a duty ... I shall endeavour to assist in overcoming the many deficiencies that exist in primary production and country standards as a whole. In the same speech he said: Australia has wonderful opportunities for obtaining markets, not only for her primary but also for her secondary industries. We should lose no time in rapidly expanding our production in order to seize the opportunities offered on the markets of the world, and keep Australian economic life on an even keel. As you know, if we had no exportable wealth, the living conditions not only of the producer but of the city dweller would be seriously affected. Sir Joh maintained his loyalty and concerns for people in the Australian bush all his political life and acted consistently with that in the times that he was premier and a minister. On his passing, we on this side of the House, acknowledging that there was never a civil word to pass between us while he was in office, join sincerely in the condolences and sympathies that are directed to his widow and members of his family. Mr Katter- Mr Speaker, I crave the indulgence of the House to speak on the condolence motion.",34

23,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, may I briefly have your indulgence to congratulate the member for Werriwa, Chris Hayes, on his election. All of us on this side of the House are delighted to see you here and look forward to your companionship over the years. My question is to the Prime Minister. I fer the Prime Minister to his statements reported in the Australian on 30 April: ‘I am not planning to go anywhere', ‘Prime Ministers get interested in budgets too, you know' and ‘This is, in a way, my 16th budget.' Why did the Prime Minister create disunity during the preparation of the Australian budget? What national interest was served by him belittling and taunting the Treasurer just 10 days before budget day?",38
24,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me merely say to the Leader of the Opposition that I think I have answered a few questions on this subject and I do not intend to add to them, except to invite him to come here at 7.30 tonight and hear the Treasurer deliver his budget. It will be delivered by a man who I regard as the best Treasurer Australia has ever had. NA",38
25,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I draw the attention of honourable members to the presence in the gallery of Lady Sonia MCMahon, wife of former Prime Minister Sir William MCMahon. On behalf of all members, I extend a very warm welcome to Lady MCMahon. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Metroliner Crash",38
26,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Minister, would you advise the House on progress of investigations into the terrible Metroliner crash in North Queensland?",38
27,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question. I again express my deepest sympathies to the family, friends and colleagues of the victims of this tragic accident. I think I can safely presume to speak for all members of this House in this regard. I acknowledge the exrecellent efforts of the Queensland authorities, the police and emergency services personnel and the coroner and his team for their outstanding response to this tragedy in very difficult circumstances. As I said yesterday, I confirm that the Australian Transport Safety Bureau have recovered both of the black boxes-the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder. They are now due back in Canberra. Over the next few days, presuming that it is possible and if the contents of the boxes permit, they will be able to assemble a lot more information about what has happened. In the meantime, the ATSB will continue to map the site and gather available evidence. They have to complete that part of the investigation over the next few days. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority, CASA-as people would expect and as is the normal procedure in these cases-is cooperating fully and will make available all relevant material and all of their records, including their safety audits of the operators involved. If there are people with information that may be of use, we ask them to come forward-and that will of course be treated properly. I again emphasise the point that I made yesterday: uninformed speculation or public commentary in a case like this, ahead of our having clear advice and clear knowledge about what happened and why, is unfortunate and adds a burden to those already experiencing great grief. To the colleagues, friends and, most especially, though, the families of those who died, I again extend not only my sympathies but also the sympathy of all members of the House and, I am sure, the sympathy of all Australians.",38
28,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Purely on indulgence, and not for a question, I join the Deputy Prime Minister in the remarks that he has made in expressing sympathy to those who are bereaved as a result of the 15 killed in this terrible air crash in North Queensland. Leadership",39
29,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister endorse the statement of the leader of Britain's Conservative Party, Michael Howard, who said he would give up the leadership because at the next poll he would be 67 or 68 and ‘that is simply too old to lead a party into a government'?",39
30,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister may choose to answer that question.,39
31,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me simply say that I had not thought it was in my ministerial responsibilities to comment upon the remarks made by leaders of other political parties. me say this about my good friend Michael Howard. I had the opportunity after the British election to congratulate the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, a man who displayed spectacular courage on Iraq, a man who was prepared to lead and, where necessary, confront his own party on that subject. I had the opportunity to speak to him and I also had the opportunity, as is my fraternal wont, to speak to the leader of the British Conservative Party, who expressed to me-and I am glad you asked me this question-great admiration for the support he had received from my good friend Lynton Crosby.",39
32,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,39
33,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You know all about Lynton Crosby, don't you! All I can say is that different people have different views on all sorts of subjects. I wish Mr Blair well on his re-election. I wish the British Conservative Party good health. I am glad they won some seats from the Labour Party. It will be a very interesting contest at the next election. National Security",39
34,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, will you advise the House of steps that Australia is taking with key allies, including the United States and Japan, to increase security in our region?",39
35,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I know how interested he is in security issues, given his former career in the Australian Defence Force-and a distinguished career as well. Back in 2002 I pushed the idea with the Japanese and also the US Deputy Secretary of State, Rich Armitage, whom many here know, that we should establish a trilateral security dialogue between Australia, the United States and Japan. This eventuated at what is sometimes called deputies level. When I was in New York and in Washington Let last week, I met with Foreign Minister Machimura of Japan and also with the US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. We all agreed that we should upgrade this dialogue to ministerial level. This dialogue is likely to occur twice a year at ministerial level. It will also have an officials level component, which will meet out of session. I have been promoting this idea because Australia and Japan have a lot in common. Everybody is familiar with the trading relationship, but we have security interests in common as well. Both of our countries are great liberal democracies, both of our countries are developed economies-we are aid donors in the region-and both of our countries are allies of the United States of America. Bearing in mind all of those things, for us to get together from time to time and talk not only about regional issues but also about global issues makes a great deal of sense. Bear in mind, for example, that Australia and Japan are literally side by side in Iraq, and the United States, obviously, is substantially present in Iraq as well. That is an illustration of how we as countries can work together. Because we are countries that stand for similar values and we are close partners in the Asia-Pacific region, we do not want that partnership to be a limited one; we want to encourage and develop it. So I was delighted that Secretary of State Rice, Foreign Minister Machimura and I were all able to agree last week to upgrade that trilateral security dialogue to ministerial level. Baxter Detention Centre",39
36,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I draw the Prime Minister's attention to the 11-month ordeal of Cornelia Rau, the deportation of an Australian woman with head injuries and in a wheelchair-which his minister now concedes the department had known about for at least two years-and a court ruling deploring the totally inadequate medical and psychiatric services at Baxter. Does the Prime Minister understand that the parliamentary inquiry does not have the power to compel witnesses to give evidence and offers no protection from defamation? Will the Prime Minister correct this by setting up a royal commission, or will the government's arrogant and chronic indifference to the plight of those affected, including Australian citizens, continue?",40
37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I reject the suggestion that we are arrogant or insensitive on these matters. Mr Albanese-Did you see Lateline?,40
38,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I did see Lateline, and I thought the minister performed magnificently. I thought the minister displayed a steadiness under legitimate but tough questioning. That was admirable. I watched the whole lot of it. I thought Amanda did a very good job in a difficult situation. Quite plainly, the public expects answers in relation to both Cornelia Rau and the apparently mistaken deportation, and we will respond to that; but we are going to allow the Palmer inquiry to run its course. In the light of what the Palmer inquiry reveals, further decisions and responses will be developed. Mick Palmer is a person of ability. This is an issue that requires somebody who has an on-the ground understanding of how police and other procedures work. I think Mick Palmer is very well qualified for that. When we have the results of that inquiry, we will calmly have a look at them and only then decide what further action may be needed. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition and all members of the House that we do not take these matters lightly and that we do not dismiss them arrogantly, insensitively or contemptuously. Trade",40
39,Mr HAASE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister inform the House of the latest developments in Australia's trading relationship with China?,40
40,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and recognise his interest in this particular bilateral relationship, given that his electorate provides a lot of the exports that go to China, particularly the iron ore that goes out of Western Australia to China and, prospectively, the LNG resources that are going to earn significant amounts for Australia's economy in years to come. On 19 April, during his fifth visit to China as Prime Minister, the Prime Minister and his Chinese counterpart, Premier Wen Jiabao, announced that Australia and China will commence negotiations on an FTA. Obviously, the FTA will further enhance Australia's outstanding trading relationship with China, a trading relationship that now stands at a value of about $27 billion in two-way trade. That figure has trebled over the last five years. China is now Australia's secondlargest merchandise export market. Merchandise exports grew by 22 per cent in the last year. A joint feasibility study concluded that an FTA could boost the Australian economy by an estimated $24.4 billion. The announcement was welcomed by business groups, both core business manufacturing industries and agricultural industries alike. The National Farmers Federation has endorsed the government's decision to go ahead with the FTA, saying that farmers and agricultural exporters would gain significantly. The Australia China Business Council said that it sign of significant progress in a burgeoning trade relationship. As with the free trade agreements we have negotiated with Singapore and Thailand, and negotiations that are under way with the ASEAN group of countries and Malaysia, it is a part of this government's ambitious trade agenda with Asia-a trade agenda that is absolutely focused on expanding our export opportunities and generating new jobs in the Australian economy. Economy",40
41,Ms GRIERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Is the minister aware of figures released by the Hunter Valley Research Foundation last Friday that highlighted a 10 per cent decline in consumer and business confidence in the Hunter's regional economy in the last 12 months? Is the minister also aware of grave concerns about the impact on the wider community of the loss of 450 jobs at the University of Newcastle? What steps will the minister now take to ensure the ongoing viability of the University of Newcastle, to save jobs in our region and to prevent further damage to the regional economy?",41
42,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. I am not familiar with that particular survey. I can inform the mining community in Newcastle and the Hunter that, had there been a Labor government elected last year, there would have been a $470 million tax on the mining industry through the reduction in the diesel fuel rebate from 100 per cent to 90 per cent to fund more places for doctors and lawyers in Australian universities. Tell the mining companies that! As far as the University of Newcastle is concerned, I will not repeat what I said in the House in response to a previous question on this matter. But the Labor Party needs to be is a reminded that the problems at Newcastle university relate specifically to the management of the university. The vice-chancellor himself, Professor Nick Saunders, said in the Australian Financial Review on 4 May this year that the university's problem is its: ... “very old fashioned ways of doing business” which led to it being burdened by higher staff costs than most other institutions. In its editorial on this matter the Australian said it extremely well on the same day: Whatever the cause of the crisis, Newcastle faces a problem of its own management's making. And the Government cannot, must not, come to its rescue. I ask the member for Newcastle to explain to people in the Hunter why she and everybody on the other side voted against more than $50 million of additional money for Newcastle university in the reforms to Australian higher education. Illicit Drugs Miss JACKIE KELLY (3.28 pm)-My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister advise the House how the use of illicit drugs is decreasing and how the government's policies in this area have contributed to this decrease?",41
43,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Lindsay for her question. It is an opportunity to remind all members that this government is unmistakeably and unambiguously tough on drugs. Since 1997 the government has spent more than $1 billion on law enforcement, on education and on rehabilitation because there is no safe way to use illicit drugs. People said then, and they have said subsequently, that you can never win the war against drugs. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare recently published statistics showing that in 2004 15 per cent of the Australian population at some stage used illicit drugs. This is far too high, but it very big improvement indeed from the 22 per cent of the population who had used illicit drugs back in 1998. Heroin deaths are down from well over 1,100 in 1999 to about 350 now. The number of heroin users has come down by 12,000 since 2001. This government is tough on drugs. I have to say that there is a strange ambivalence from members opposite. In 1999 the Leader of the Opposition strongly supported heroin injecting rooms. I suggest to members opposite that, if they want to demonstrate that they are different now, if the Leader of the Opposition wants to say he has changed and got stronger, here is an opportunity: oppose heroin injecting rooms and support a zero tolerance policy for illicit drugs. ANZAC Cove",42
44,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Department of Veterans' Affairs web site currently states: With the exception of minor changes to vegetation, the ANZAC area of the battlefield has remained largely unchanged since the battles of 1915 raged across the landscape. Does the Prime Minister agree that the roadworks requested by the Australian government have resulted in the removal of the very cliff faces where the ANZACs charged, where their trenches were made and where they were buried? Hasn't the Prime Minister's road changed ANZAC Cove forever?",42
45,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have not seen the web site to which the member refers but on the question of the road, as the member knows, the changes that were requested by the Australian government in the former Minister for Veterans' Affairs' letter did not relate to the ANZAC Cove road. It is true that some changes were made to that road as a result of the common position of Australian and Turkis a ish authorities that, for safety and conveyance reasons, some reinforcement and change was needed, but the scale and scope of those were not specifically or, indeed, implicitly requested by the Australian government. Let me also say this: we have had excellent cooperation from the Turkish authorities. I had the privilege, as did a number of other members of this House, to visit ANZAC Cove on ANZAC Day and I also had the privilege to meet in person probably about 1,000 young people who were there. I will say two things about it. The first thing I will say is that not one single person of the at least 1,000 people-largely young but of many ages-that I met said anything about the roadworks: not one single person.",42
46,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,42
47,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member has asked this question. He has tried to make a bit of mileage out of it. He is entitled to that but I am entitled to put the facts as countered them there. I had the opportunity to meet these people, and not one single person made any reference to the road. I suspect that that was also the experience of others in this House who visited. Could I also take this opportunity to say that, as a result of discussions that I had with the Turkish Prime Minister on 26 April, there has been an agreement for a joint engineering review, and the review will be conducted as a matter of priority. The team from Australia that is contributing to that review will be leaving this weekend, and the Turkish government has agreed that no further roadworks will take place until those discussions are held. The other point that I will make to those who sit opposite is simply this: sacred though this site is to this country-and it plainly is-we must remember that it is Turkish territory. We must respect the sovereignty of Turkey and we must also acknowledge the contribution that the Turks have made to the joint commemoration of events that occurred on this particular site. I say to the member for Grayndler and to some-not all-on the other side who have sought to make some political mileage out of this that, if they had been there, they would have been sadly disappointed by the response of average Australians to their miserable campaign. Workplace Relations",43
48,Mr RICHARDSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House of recent research on the links between workplace relations reform and higher productivity and prosperity? Is the minister aware of any alternative views?,43
49,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kingston for his question. I was delighted to do join him to visit some small businesses in his I enelectorate last year. Just recently Michael Chaney from the Business Council of Australia released research commissioned by the Business Council which revealed the benefits of changes that have been made to the workplace relations system under this government. In particular, that research estimated that the benefits of change were equivalent to $4,200 in additional income per person per year in 2004 and the equivalent of over $80,000 in wealth per person. Indeed, this research indicated that, had it not been for the changes to industrial relations brought about in the last nine years in Australia, the unemployment rate in 2004 would have been 8.1 per cent rather than 5.8 per cent at that time. So what this clearly shows, once again, is the strong link between workplace relations reform and higher productivity. That is why the Business Council of Australia, along with almost every other business group in this country, is urging the government to make further reforms to the workplace relations system. The member for Kingston asked me whether there were any alternative views. Indeed, there is a range of alternative views. I was interested to see on Sunday on Meet the Press that the member for Lilley said: There will always be more to be done in industrial relations ... This did not quite ring a bell with what I had heard from the Leader of the Opposition, who on 12 April told the National Press Club: The industrial relations lemon has been squeezed dry ... Is there more to be done or has it been squeezed dry? Then we had the member for Perth, who last month told a union meeting: … I am in the market place for sensible industrial relations reform that is based on fairness ductivity … He went on to say: I am happy to contemplate serious industrial relations reforms that improve the productivity and efficiency of the economy … So there is yet another alternative view from the opposition. More recently we had the Leader of the Opposition telling the Australian Sustaining Prosperity Conference: The scope for productivity gains from the old reform agenda of deregulation, privatisation and industrial relations reform is largely exhausted. So the lemon has been squeezed dryaccording to the Leader of the Opposition, it is largely exhausted-yet we have these alternative views from the member for Lilley and the member for Perth. We must ask the question: just what does the opposition believe? The Leader of the Opposition is reported in the Australian this morning as saying that his strategy is to pursue a ‘two parallel tracks' approach. I am not quite sure what ‘two parallel tracks' is. All I can work out is that this is the railway equivalent of walking both sides of the street. Medicare Safety Net",43
50,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Does the minister recall boasting on 23 August 2004 that 650,000 people were already entitled to higher Medicare rebates under the safety net-200,000 more people in the first five months of the safety net's operation than was expected in the first year? Was the minister briefed on the implications for the cost of the safety net caused by the large jump in the number of people covered?",44
51,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As was perfectly clear at the time, the government and I, as minister, were aware that the cost of the safety net was increasing. We were briefed about the increases in the cost, and we made public those increases in the cost as part of the preand proelection financial outlook. Trade: Middle East",44
52,Mr FORREST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It relates to my interest in the fortunes of primary producers from western Victoria and, in particular, access to market opportunities in the Middle East. Could the minister advise the House what steps the government has taken to increase agricultural access to the Middle East?",44
53,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the honourable member would be aware, the Middle East is a very important market for Australian agricultural produce, not just for live animals, about which there has been a lot of public attention, but also for meat, grain-in particular, wheat and barley-dairy products, fruit and vegetables and a whole range of other agricultural produce worth at least $600 million a year. During a recent visit to the Middle East region, I was able to sign, on behalf of the government, some agricultural cooperation agreements with Kuwait, Jordan, Eritrea and Saudi Arabia-and that follows on from an earlier agreement with the United Arab Emirates. These agreements will provide for agricultural cooperation between our countries. They will provide opportunities for Australia to share ideas in areas such as dryland agriculture, locust control and the like. In the case of Eritrea, we are providing some assistance for the development of an agricultural college in that country. The signing of the agreement with Saudi Arabia is of particular significance because it will open up the capacity for us to lift the ban on the live animal export trade with that country. Saudi Arabia has established a quarantine facility which will be available to immediately unload any live animals should there be a dispute that would lead to a delay in the unloading of the shipment. Countries such as Kuwait, Jordan and Eritrea have also given similar undertakings that, in the event of there being a dispute, the animals would be unloaded into a safe place while those dispute issues are resolved. I think that important breakthrough. In the case of Eritrea, there has also been an undertaking to accept animals from other countries in the event of Australia asking them to do so as a result of a dispute in that region. Animals will be unloaded within 36 hours. That will provide the confidence that the Australian people expect that this trade will deliver good animal welfare outcomes and will be conducted in an atmosphere of assurance that the trade is acceptable internationally. From an Australian perspective, we will be doing more in relation to the choice, selection and preparation of animals for the trade, and, at the other end, as a result of these agreements there is now a firm commitment to unload the animals promptly and deal with them in accordance with proper animal welfare principles. This is an important market for Australia, and these agreements will ensure there is a strong level of agricultural cooperation between Australia and the Middle East. Medicare Safety Net",44
54,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Can the minister inform the House if he was ever briefed on the $800 million blow-out in the four-year cost of the safety net-that is, substantially more than was revealed in the pre-election fiscal outlook to which he just referred-which was exposed when Treasury and Finance costed figures were released under the Charter of Budget Honesty on 27 September 2004?",45
55,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is pretty hard for members opposite to say that there was some kind of conspiracy of deceit on the part of the government when the figures the member for Fraser referred to were published by this government before the election. There was no conspiracy; there was no attempt to deceive. Members opposite are trying to say is an that there has been some kind of travesty perpetrated on the Australian people by this government in respect of the safety net. I want to make three points. The first point is that when I made my pre-election statements about the safety net I made them in good faith. I absolutely believed them to be true. The second point is that the highest commitment of any government is to the long term national interest of the country. This government reluctantly made a decision that it was necessary to restore the originally proposed safety net thresholds for the sustainability of our great Medicare system. The final point I make is that this is not a question of members opposite supporting a low safety net threshold and members here supporting a high safety net threshold. They do not support a safety net at all. They would rip the safety net right off the Australian people. All this huffing and puffing, all this posturing from the member for Lalor and othersMs Gillard interjecting",45
56,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lalor is waxing indignant about this change to the safety net threshold. It is like Al Capone complaining that there are fewer policemen on the streets of Chicago! It is rank hypocrisy and it is totally unconvincing to the Australian people.,45

More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their placesMr Martin Ferguson interjecting",47
71,Ms GILLARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Batman is absolutely right: the minister should resign. Today it might have been covered up by the length of the condolence motions, but I think we should note that question time was cut off after seven opposition questions-and no wonder! The Minister for Health and Ageing is twisting and turning in the breeze, a carcass waiting to be cut down. He knows it, we know it, and he knows that he should have resigned. No amount of bluster is going to cover up that simple proposition. Many things in politics are complicated-many things involve tough choices and require you to look at the shades of grey-but this is a simple and blindingly obvious proposition. This minister went to the Australian electorate before tion and gave his word, and he did not keep it. It is no more complicated than not require any more frills or explanation than that. He went to the Australian electorate and he gave his word, a rock-solid, ironclad guarantee, and he did not keep it. When you look at the transcript of interview, there is no doubt. There is no equivocation here, no weasel words and no shades of grey. This minister on three separate occasions gave the Australian electorate complete guarantees that the Medicare safety net would stay unchanged. Let me take you to the first of them, the most famous of them, when he was interviewed on 6 September. The reporter said: Will this Government commit to keeping the Medicare-plus-safety-net as it is now in place after the election? The minister said: Yes. The reporter asked: That's a cast-iron commitment? The minister said: Cast-iron commitment. Absolutely. The reporter went on: 80 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses rebatable over $300, over $700? The minister said: That is an absolutely rock solid, iron-clad commitment. That is what this minister said before the election. And it did not stop there. On a second occasion, on 11 September, the minister was questioned again about the Medicare safety net. The question of the blow-out in the safety net was raised with him, and he said when asked: I can. I absolutely guarantee that the safety net as the government has put it into operation will continue. I absolutely guarantee that. the last elec- The reporter said: But the savings won't be extracted from other that. It does areas of the portfolio? The minister said: This government does not believe in cutting health expenditure. We do not believe in hurting people who have high health expenses. Later in the same interview, the minister was asked: Will you guarantee that if the Howard Government is re-elected it will keep entirety, without any changes? The minister said: Yes. The reporter then asked: For a full three years? And the minister said: Yes. That was three times before the election. I do not think any references to Saint Peter are going to help you at this point, Minister. He might have denied Christ three times, but I think Christ is more forgiving than the Australian electorate so it is not a great precedent for you to rely on. Three times before the election this minister gave the Australian people his word, and after the election he did not keep it. I will quote what that veteran political reporter, and I note a man who supported Minister Abbott with a reference at the time of his preselection, Laurie Oakes said about Minister Abbott and the state of his political career and what he ought to have done. He said: In a TV interview before the election, he had given “an absolutely rock-solid, iron-clad commitment” that the thresholds would not be altered. There was no wriggle room. Abbott's cabinet colleagues made a liar of him, in full knowledge of what they were doing. His word is now worthless, his credibility shot ... Presumably, as a religious man, Abbott likes to think of himself as principled. I believe he He should have resigned. The minister should have taken the advice of Laurie Oakes and resigned on the day that the Prime Minister announced the backflip on the Medicare safety net. Having lost that opportunity he should take the opportunity today to offer his resignation, on the day on which the cutbacks in the Medicare safety net threshold will become manifest in the budget papers. That is what this minister the safety net in its should do. This minister is trying to get away with a standard of honesty that would not be acceptable anywhere else in public life, or indeed in private life. If the minister had been a businessman and offered a promise like that and not kept it, he would have been sued. If the minister had been in a court of law and made a statement like that and it turned out not to be true, he would have been tried for perjury. If the minister had been in a church and made a statement like that and it turned out not to be true, the congregation would have known that he had broken the ninth commandment. I do not see why the standard should be different in business, should be different in churches or should be different in courts from the standard in public life. If anything, the standard in public life should be higher. This is a minister who likes to wax, as he did in question time, on the question of hypocrisy in others. Honestly, Minister, the man who goes out there and puts things in the public domain like his speech ‘The ethical responsibilities of a Christian politician', or the rather absurdly titled contribution ‘The moral case for the Howard government'-do we remember that not so bestseller?-should be more careful. I think we should note that ‘The moral case for the Howard government' rests on comparing the Prime Minister to is that. Russell Crowe in the movie Master and Commander: the far side of the world, clearly not a comparison based on physical similarity-but I am probably getting distracted. This is a man who goes out in the public domain and tries to parade his ethical credentials as a conviction politician. When he is out there in the public domain, moralising and telling others what to do, surely one of the standards he should model and exhibit in his own life is truthfulness. Surely that is one of the standards he should exhibit in his own life, but he has fallen short of that standard. I think he knows that he has fallen short and feels deeply uncomfortable about it. But, like the common problem across the Howard government front-bench, when confronted with a difficult choice he lacked the bottle to do the right thing, and the right thing would have been to offer his resignation and go to the backbench. Of course, we know that a lack of bottle is not the problem of only Mr Abbott on the Howard government front-bench. There is a Treasurer in the budget lock-up now with precisely that problem-lack of bottle. But that does not excuse Minister Abbott from not doing what he knew to be right, and what everybody else knows to be right-that is, to have resigned in these circumstances. I know exactly what Minister Abbott will say when he gets to that dispatch box. What he will say is what he said in question time: ‘Well, when I gave the rock-solid, iron-clad guarantee, I thought I meant it at the time. I mean I didn't know I didn't mean it. I mean, when I said I meant it I think meant it. I mean I think I should've meant it.' It will be that kind of thing: ‘I think I had a belief when I said it.' The problem for you, Minister, is that you are left in a dilemma where you have to say, ‘Either I wasn't honest or I was completely stupid.' It is the money or the box. Dishonest or stupid-they are your only two tracks. Minister, you know, and you have conceded in the public domain that you knew, the Medicare safety net was blowing out. It started at a cost of $440 million, it escalated through the pre-election fiscal outlook and by the time it was being costed through the Charter of Budget Honesty process it was $1.3 billion. You have not denied, Minister, that you knew about those figures. What sort of fool would you have to be to sit there as a responsible minister and watch a government program blow out by three times and not ask yourself the questions, ‘Is this sustainable? Does this need changing? Will the Treasurer say to me at some point, “I can't fund this”? Is this the best expenditure of government funds? What's the implication for other portfolio areas, for other expenditure areas in my portfolio? What's the implication for tax rates?' Would you watch a program blow out by three times and never stop to ask yourself those questions? If you did, are you a competent minister? There are only two choices here. You knew when you were giving the rock-solid, iron-clad guarantee that in fact there were real troubles with the safety net and that you might not be able to keep your word. Or, your incompetence is so manifest that you watched a program blow out by three times and it never occurred to you that something might have to change. Minister, either course-and, yes, it is weighing heavily on you, I can tell-leads you to the same point where, really, resignation is what should be under consideration. Now we know that the minister has never been particularly good with figures. This is the man in it who went out and announced the Medicare safety net and who, when asked how it was going to be funded, said those immortal words: ‘Peter will provide. He always does.' Mr Abbott-He is a marvellous Treasurer.",47
72,Ms GILLARD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He might be a marvellous Treasurer but he has not provided for your safety net. When you go to the dispatch box, you might explain how such a marvellous Treasurer has forced you into a position where you have not kept your word to the Australian people. Peter most certainly did not provide and, you know what: I do not think Peter ever had any intention of doing so. I think Peter knew that well before the election, well before he saw PEFO. He knew on day one, when you announced that Medicare safety net, that it was a pre-election stunt to get you through the election and it was always going to be pruned back. You know-and everybody in this House knows-Treasurer Costello was never happy with the safety net arrangements. They would have been working on hauling it back for all of the months in the lead-up to the election, and of course now they have done it. What that has done to you, Minister, is leave you in this position. You have only two courses: either you were not honest or you were incredibly foolish. Either renders you unfit to continue in your capacity as minister for health and you ought to be offering your resignation. That is the only way forward. That is the decent thing to do. I know what else this minister will say when he comes to the dispatch box. He will say, ‘This is all hypocrisy from the Labor Party.' I will get compared to Al Capone again. I am waiting for it. I would have worn all black if I had known that. I would have got a black shirt as well. When he is doing that comparison, Minister Abbott might like to think about this. Did Labor promise to abolish the safety net before the last election? Too right we did. Of course the minister never says Labor Party had an alternative plan-a billion-dollar public hospital planfor having specialist clinics in public hospitals. But let us put that to one side; let us tually put the advocacy of Labor policy to one side. This minister says Labor would have abolished the safety net. Too right, Minister, because the Labor Party is the party of truth telling. When we go out into the electorate and make promises, do you know what we would do in government: we would keep them. When we say them, we mean them. That is the difference between you and us. If I were minister for health in an elected government, it would be my duty to implement lock, stock and barrel-word for word-exactly what we had promised in the election campaign. That is your obligation. Labor would have abolished the safety net; Labor would have funded specialist clinics in public hospitals-we would have kept our word. The issue here, whilst we can have a long debate about the merits of the Medicare safety net, its cost blow-outs and its inflationary impacts-Minister, I am happy to have that debate with you any time you like-is not the merits of the Medicare safety net. The issue here is about truth: truth in politics, truth in election times, saying what you mean and keeping your word-and that is the problem that you have got, Minister. We are not arguing the merits of the Medicare safety net; we have not changed our mind on those things, but you went to the electorate and offered a rock solid, ironclad guarantee, and you have not kept your word. That is the issue that is before the House today and that is the issue to which you cannot find a satisfactory answer, because there is no satisfactory answer. You know that, I know that and everybody in this House knows that. Minister, it seems to me that this is going to surround you for the rest of your political career. We know that there is a very colourful member in this House-the member for O'Connor, Wilson Tuckey, who is referred to as ‘Iron Bar' Tuckey as a result of events earlier in his life. Minister, for the rest acof your political career you are going to be known as ‘Iron-Clad' Abbott, the man who gives his word only to break it. The thing you should be fearing is that when they write the history books they will actually say ‘Iron Bar' Tuckey had a better political career than you had.",49
73,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do not begrudge the member for Lalor her little moment of triumph. I suppose she is entitled to savour the fact that it was a moment of considerable embarrassment to me. I have said it before and let me say it again in front of my peers in this parliament: it was a moment of considerable embarrassment to me when the government decided to take the decision that it did. No-one enjoys making a commitment to do something which turns out not to be borne out by events. It was not the most golden moment in my political life-I certainly say that. But the contention of members opposite is that when I made the rock solid, ironclad commitment that I did in the pre-election period I knew this to be false. Let me say again-and I will say it until I am blue in the face and I will say it until they are sick of hearing it-that when I made that statement. I made it in good faith. I had absolutely not the slightest inkling that there would ever be any intention on the part of the government to change its position. Asked these questions, how could I have said otherwise, given that the government, as far as I was aware, had not the slightest plan or the slightest intention to change the safety net threshold? Truth is important. Anyone who is untruthful has done a dishonourable thing, and people who are untruthful in public life have shamed their office and people who are untruthful in public life should pay a high political price. But people's truthfulness should be judged by the state of their knowledge at the time. Let me repeat: when I made those pledges and when I made those commitments I had not the slightest inkling of a hint of a suspicion that anything was likely to change. As I said, there have been no lies told-not by me. I certainly accept that a pledge I made has not been honoured. I accept that, but I also point out that that has been, as it were, trumped by an even higher pledge. That is the pledge which all governments must honour. That is the pledge that all responsible ministers must always live up to. That is the commitment to the long-term national interest of this country. As the health minister, my fundamental commitment is to the strength and the sustainability of our Medicare system. What became obvious to the government in the post-election period was that this blow-out would be an ongoing blow-out. This was a government which had the power to make a change, and we believed that we therefore had the responsibility to make a change-not because we enjoy or in any way take pleasure in dishonouring pledges but because the highest duty of any government is to the long-term national interest. The highest responsibility that I have as health minister is to do everything I can to ensure the continued strength and sustainability of our Medicare system. Let me point out again for the benefit of members opposite that I believe the Medicare safety net which the Howard government introduced last year is the most important structural improvement to our Medicare system since it was first introduced more than two decades ago. It is the most important structural improvement whether the thresholds are $300 or $700 or whether the thresholds are $500 or $1,000. It is the most important structural improvement because it is a fact of life that some people, too many people, face high out-of-pocket, out-ofhospital costs under the system which members opposite support but do not do anything to try to correct-as this government have with the Medicare safety net that we introduced last year. The difference between members on this side of the House and members on that side of the House is not that they support the thresholds that the Senate pledge put in place last year of $300 and $700thresholds that they opposed then-and that we support thresholds of $500 and $1,000, thresholds that we originally proposed when we first put forward this policy in November 2003; the difference is that we support a safety net and they do not. I know that the member for Lalor has a lot of front. She would have to have a lot of front to come in here and cry crocodile tears over adjustments to a safety net threshold when she would not have any safety net at all. She claims to be bleeding for people whom she would leave totally in the lurch. Ms Gillard-I am an honest person.",50
74,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No honest person would go and metaphorically embrace people and say, ‘You've been ripped off. Labor will help you,' when Labor would rip them off even more. That is what she would do-she would take away the safety net altogether. She would deprive people who face high out-ofpocket costs because of the system that she says she supports of any help at all-help which they deserve and help which they have thanks to the policies of the Howard government. Let me explain for the benefit of the member for Lalor precisely what has happened. Back in March of last year when we first agreed with Independent senators that there would be $300 and $700 safety net thresholds it was costed at $440 million over the relevant forward estimates period. Those costings were based on Medicare data from 2001. It was the most recent available data. Yes, we had later data on the gap payments; but we did not have later data on how those gap payments precisely applied to different population groups. We did not have that data then when we did the costing. There were some things that we did not anticipate. We did not anticipate almost universal safety net registration. We did not anticipate that some specialist groups-with, no doubt, their patients' best interests at heart-would shift some costs from non-MBS items to MBS items so that their patients could take better advantage of the safety net. We did not anticipate that, but it became clear shortly after the safety net began to operate that there would be an increase in costs. In the pre-election financial outlook we made it clear that the first-year cost of the safety net would be considerably in excess of what was originally estimated. I think from memory that it had more than doubled. We made very clear in the Charter of Budget Honesty that the four-year cost of the safety net had at that stage blown out to something like $1.2 billion. The latest estimate of the four-year cost of the safety net at the existing thresholds is something like $1.4 billion. For the benefit of the House, let me point out that in calendar year 2004 this safety net cost $166 million and that those well-deserved benefits were provided to 1.95 million Australians. I am proud that the Howard government have paid those almost two million Australians, needy Australians who faced high out-of-pocket costs, some $166 million. Because I want the system to be sustainable, we are going to adjust the thresholds-but we are not going to take away the safety net. As a result of the higher safety net thresholds which this government have announced, the cost of the safety net over the forward estimates period will still be some $1.1 billion. So this is hardly the cutting and slashing of a hard-hearted, skinflint government. In calendar year 2006 under the Howard government's somewhat revised safety net we estimate that 1.5 million Australians are going to benefit from higher Medicare rebates. I want to let each one of those people know now that, if members opposite had their way, they would not get anything. That is $1.1 billion that would be ripped off 1.5 million Australians who face high out-of-pocket costs for their health care. The member for Lalor and her colleagues can huff and puff, they can shout and yell, but the Australian people will not take them seriously and they will have no credibility or standing on this issue until they say clearly and unambiguously, ‘We support the safety net, and we support it so much that we'll actually go back to the $300 and $700 safety net thresholds.' Let me simply indicate for the benefit of members opposite that this is a government which believes in Medicare. Just to mention a few of the things that this government has done since October 2003-I am talking here not about words but about deeds-this government has spent $3.8 billion on ‘Strengthening Medicare', $2.2 billion on the new aged care package, $1 billion plus in new life-saving and life-enhancing drugs put onto the PBS and $2 billion plus in 100 per cent Medicare. This government's policies have got bulk-billing rates up. This government's policies have raised bulk-billing rates for GP consultations from about two in three to well over seven in 10, and the rate is four out of five for people over 65. It has not done that by trying to bully the medical profession into bulk-billing. It has done it by providing correct incentives, which have benefited those who get bulk-billed and those who do not get bulk-billed by their doctor. Since October 2003 the government has invested more than $11 billion in Medicare over the forward estimates period, and that is why I said earlier this year, I said late last year and I again today that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had, notwithstanding the minor adjustment to the safety net thresholds which members opposite are so indignant about. The member for Lalor is right, to this extent at least: people expect governments to keep their commitments. This government has never broken the ultimate trust of the Australian people because it has never shirked the hard decisions necessary to ensure that this country stays strong and that the fundamental institutions of this country, including Medicare, remain viable for the long term. The Australian people expect governments to keep their commitments, and I would say that the Australian people well and truly judged that this was a government that they could trust to keep this commitment on election day. Just as the people expect governments to keep commitments, the people expect oppositions to develop a few commitments. I should close these brief comments on budget day, when the Howard government will demonstrate yet again tonight that it has the vision and the courage necessary to take Australia forward, by simply saying to members opposite: where are your commitments? Where are your principles? Where are your beliefs? We have had a lot of",52
75,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,53
76,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,They talk about telling the truth. Let me ask whether Rodney Cavalier was telling the truth when he said recently: The Labor Party has ceased to exist … Its death is one of the great unreported stories of Australian politics. Ms Gillard interjecting,53
77,Mr ABBOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"She is saying Rodney Cavalier is pathetic. That is what she is saying. Was he telling the truth or not? I think he say was. You cannot necessarily believe people when they slag off their opponents, but you can believe them when they are talking about each other because they have no incentive to lie when they are talking about themselves! It is high time that members opposite give up their huffing and puffing, look into their souls, decide what they believe and stand up for something at long last.",53
78,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Fraser) (4.19 pm)From that speech of the Minister for Health and Ageing in this matter of public importance we have just learnt three things. The first is that we must all make a desperate plea to the Prime Minister: whatever happens to Peter Costello, do not make the minister for health the Treasurer; he is entirely economically illiterate and innumerate. It is clear from that speech he does not have the faintest idea what economic incentives mean and what the drivers are of decision making in our economy-even in the health system, for which he is responsible. That is the first thing we learnt. The second thing we learnt is that he had his fingers crossed behind his back when he made the rock solid guarantee, because what he has now said is that it was actually subject to an unstated qualification, which was ‘if we can afford it'. He said, ‘There is a higher commitment to the national interest to preserve the economic strength of the nation,' but try as I might I cannot find those words in the things he said before the election. If had said, ‘I passionately believe we will do this and as long as we can afford it we will,' or if he had said, ‘I am committed to trying to maintain this because I think it's right and as long as the budget can stand it we'll do no-one could criticise him, because that would have been true. That is what he meant, but it is not what he said. That is what he said today: ‘I always had in my mind a higher obligation, unstated, that this promise would apply only if we could afford it.' That must be true about every other promise and statement that he ever makes: we know he is there with fingers crossed behind the back and there is a higher order commitment that is unstated. The third thing we found out from that speech is that there has been no significant new information since the election about cost blow-outs that justifies the change that was not known before the election. The minister came in here and said dramatically, ‘We knew when we made the decision that the cost was going to blow out over the four years of the forward estimates to $1.4 billion. But at the election they knew it was going to be $1.31 billion. You cannot tell me that at $1.31 billion they said: ‘That's fine. There's nothing to worry about. Oh, God! It's blown out by another $90 million. We'd better change it.' That cannot be true. Everybody in Australia, with the possible exception of the health minister, knows it is not true. What we have here is the sort of circumstance that always leads to the public having a lack of confidence in ministers and the parliament debating a lack of confidence in ministers. Why do we do those things? It goes beyond the question of policy disagreement-and we profoundly disagree with this very poor policy that the minister has introduced-but that is not what we are debating today, although I am very happy to debate it. We are saying that this minister has one or he perhaps both of the two fatal flaws that lead to want of confidence: either he was incompetent or he was less than honest. It cannot be neither of those; it can be one or the other or both. Regarding the policy that was introit,' duced, I will make a bet-and there is one way I can be disproved and I challenge the minister to do it. I bet that, when the cabinet submission went forward, Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration warned of the flaws in the scheme that would lead to the blow-out. The incentives in the scheme obviously had to lead to the blow-out which occurred. I am certain that happened, but I am very happy for the minister to come in and table the documents to prove me wrong. I challenge him to table them. Even if there were no warnings, although I am sure there were, what is clear on the public record is that the Department of Finance and Administration knew about the blow-out at the time of the budget. They knew about the blow-out when PEFO came out. They knew about the blowout at the Charter of Budget Honesty. The minister is asking us to believe that those responsible officials never told their minister, the Department of Health and Ageing or the Health Insurance Commission that there was a blow-out. I do not believe that the department of finance did not advise the Minister for Finance and Administration of that blowout before those figures were released prior to the election. When we came to know 12 days before the election that the blow-out was $1.3 billion, I do not believe that the department had not told the minister before. I do not believe they had not told the health department before. Therefore, I do not believe that neither the minister's colleague nor the minister's department had told him of the extent of the blow-out. If he knew that the cost could triple and no-one was going to do anything about it, he is chronically incompetent. It is an arguable proposition that he could be so innumerate that a policy he thought was worth $430 million could blow out to $1.3 billion and keep escalating. I do not know if he understands this, but costs go on outside the forward estimates. The cost had increased almost seven times by 2007-08. The cost had tripled over the four years because it started pretty low, but by 2007-08 the estimated cost of $67 million had increased to $447 million. That is nearly seven times the cost-it had tripled and it was accelerating. It is obvious it has accelerate: every incentive in the policy causes the cost to blow out. That is what is wrong with the policy, apart from the fact that it is so inequitable. The people in the electorate of the Minister for Education, Science and Training-the richest electorate in the country-were getting 40 times as much per head as the Indigenous people in the electorate of the member for Lingiari. That is 40 times as much to the richest as to the poorest. This is the best friend Medicare has ever had? The people who stand up for the rights of people who cannot afford the best health in the country? The most deprived recipients of health service in this country were demonstrably getting the least, on the figures the minister himself released before the election, and the richest people in the country were getting the most. It is not a surprise-of course they were getting the most. This is a system that gives you back payments the more you can afford to pay. If you can afford to pay a lot, you will get a lot back. If you cannot afford to pay anything, you will not get anything back. It is not a complicated system. How can you not understand the two fundamental drivers here? It is going to be inequitable because those who can afford the most get the most. It creates incentives for people to increase their fees and takes away the very cost control measures that make Medicare such a sustainable health system in Australia. It is why our health system delivers better outcomes for a lesser share of GDP than in the United States. We have built within the system downward pressures on costs and this safety net rips them away. That is what is wrong with the economics of this. It is why the Treasurer always knew it was flawed. It is why the finance department always knew it was flawed. And it is why this minister is so incompetent to have to advocated it in the first place, failed to understand it, seen it blow out, done nothing about it and, I believe, been advised that it was blowing out in an unsustainable manner and failed to tell the people of Australia at the time of the election. In fact, he gave them a rock solid guarantee that it was sustainable when any intelligent individual must have known that it was unsustainable. Mr Adams-He should resign.",53
79,Mr MCMULLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He has the incompetence that says he should resign. He has the misleading that says he should resign. Even if every word he says is true-that he is so stupid that he honestly believed it was sustainable at the time-to have one shred of dignity after you are so repudiated by your colleagues, you would have to resign. If you had one shred of intelligent self-interest says, ‘In the long term I want to be regarded by my colleagues and the people of Australia as a person of integrity,' you would have to resign when you are then so categorically repudiated by your colleagues. It is unsustainable. But, no, the comfortable cars, the ministerial office and the chance to be deputy leader or maybe leader when the change comes overcame his self-respect. This is a sad situation. I do not agree with very many things the health minister puts forward, but I have accepted until now that he was a person who was out arguing for things he believed in. How can anybody take him seriously again? He is a figure of fun- Mr Rock Solid, Mr Ironclad, Mr Unbelievable. It is just not credible any longer that this man can hold a senior office in any government in this country and deliver commitments to the Australian people with any shred of credibility. He should have resigned, he should resign now and this parliament should make it clear that this behaviour is totally unacceptable.",55
80,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this MPI on the important issue of health policy and other important issues relating to health policy put forward by those on this side of the House and those opposite. I will give the previous speaker, the member for Fraser, one thing: at least he had the decency to go through in some detail Labor's total opposition to the Medicare safety netunlike the member for Lalor, who moved this matter of public importance. It took her until the last minute or two of her contribution to confirm that Labor's position on the safety net is total abolition. At least the member Fraser went through in some detail Labor's philosophical opposition to the Medicare safety net. At least the Australian people know without any doubt-and I would say for the first time, unless I am mistaken-that that Labor opposes the Medicare safety net lock, stock and barrel. That is what differed in their contributions. The one thing that they both refuse to mention of course is Labor's alternative policy. They will not utter ‘Medicare Gold'. Since the election, the member for Lalor has said a number of things, but two phrases she has never used in this House are ‘Mark Latham' and ‘Medicare Gold'. That says so much about Labor's approach. This MPI is a welcome opportunity to expose again the hypocrisy of Labor's alternative health policy. We regret the fact that the thresholds have had to be altered. The Minister for Health and Ageing went through that in some detail. The important point is that the Medicare safety net is there and is there to stay. The Medicare safety net is a major health policy initiative that fills a gaping hole which has been in Medicare since it was first introduced. If those opposite think that the safety net is of no value to Australians, Australians will know that. The reason the policy blew out to the extent that it did was its popularity and that it was very much needed. Just over a year ago, when the Medicare safety net finally got through the Senate, we announced that 80 per cent of out-ofhospital, out-of-pocket expenses would be paid for a whole range of things that had never been covered before by Medicarethings such as consultations with specialists, tests, X-rays and scans provided outside the hospital. While Medicare paid 85 per cent of the schedule fee prior to the safety net, it paid nothing for those out-of-pocket expenses over and above the Medicare rebate. for We announced at that time the thresholds of $700 and $300-we do not shy away from that-and they have had to be increased by $300 and $200 respectively, to the level we originally announced. If you go back to the minister's original announcement of November 2003, which I have here, they are where we are today: $500 and $1,000 to do all of those things. If you believed those opposite, particularly their opposition to our announcement of a few weeks ago, you would have thought that the government had abolished the safety net in its entirety. We have done no such thing. The safety net is there, and it is there to stay. What we have not heard from those opposite, with the exception of the member for Fraser today, is Labor's absolute determination to abolish the safety net. That is the bottom line for the Australian community. The safety net is paying 80 per cent of out-ofpocket, out-of-hospital expenses for Australians. It will continue to do so. It will do the new thresholds that we have had to introduce as a result of financial responsibility. But, if Labor had their way, there would be no safety net. As the minister outlined in some detail, the safety net is already benefiting many Australian families and individuals. The cost of the safety net tells its own story. The fact that it is costing so much shows how much it is indeed benefiting Australian families. It is worth for the record going back over Labor's opposition to this measure prior to the election. First and foremost the reason those original thresholds were never introduced was Labor's opposition in the Senate. That forced the negotiation with the minor parties that resulted in those slightly lower thresholds. They voted against the safety net-not because they had a quibble with the thresholds but because, as we have heard today from the member for Fraser, they fundamentally opposed paying out-of-pocket, out-of-hospital expenses for any Australians. They opposed it lock, stock and barrel-that is, they opposed the substance of the policy measure rather than the threshold where the policy measure cut in and began to operate. You have only to look at their statements to see their ideological obsession against the safety net. Senator Jan MCLucas said: The proposed Medicare Safety Net is very complicated, confused and unfair. It was not ‘complicated, confused or unfair' for the public, who took it up in droves. In March of last year, on Channel 10's Meet the Press, the member for Lalor said: We won't be operating this sham safety net agreement. In a press release last year, she said: Labor's plan to save Medicare will scrap the sham safety net ... It is a funny plan to save Medicarescrapping the safety net which has proved so so at popular. Lindsay Tanner, the member for Melbourne, said: You don't need the safety net ... the safety net is unnecessary. In the dying days of the election campaign, the leader who has disappeared, the former member for Werriwa, said while in Tasmania-a very ominous place for the former member for Werriwa to speak: We don't believe in a second-class safety net. Labor voted against the safety net. They pledged to oppose it. The member for Fraser had the decency to point that out in some detail for the first time. But of course they did not point out what their alternative was. Their alternative, a policy conceived by the member for Lalor, was called Medicare Gold. Those on the other side do not have such a unanimous position on this issue. As the member for Lalor, I think five days before the election, said: Well, look I am happy to put my job on the line and say I will deliver Medicare Gold. The costings that have been offered for it are right and it will be delivered with these costings. The Department of Finance and Administration found that that was absolutely wrong: the costings were a nonsense. It was unfunded, uncosted and a policy catastrophe. Access Economics said that Labor's preferred model did not generate the savings it claimed. Econtech said that the blow-out would be $30 billion over the next 40 years. But you do not have to take our word for it. Take the word of Labor Party dignitariespeople such as the Leader of the Opposition's closest adviser outside of his office, Michael Costello, who said that Julia Gillard's policy was a ‘strategic disaster'. The other quotes bear some resemblance to word pictures out of Animal Farm, with Peter Botsman, a well-known Labor person, saying, ‘It had the head of a donkey and the body of a wombat,' Barry Jones saying, ‘Medicare Gold proved to be a turkey' and the member for Melbourne, on the back bench, saying, ‘It would have added a very substantial burden to future budgets.' But what has the member for Lalor said about Medicare Gold since? Nothing. She has said as much about Medicare Gold as she has said about the former member for Werriwa in this House-and that is nothing, as Alan Ramsey has rightly pointed out. We know that Labor will go to the next election promising to take away the safety net and that will be well and truly publicised. Australians will access that safety net at those thresholds for the next three years. They will know that, at the next election, if they choose Labor they will choose to get zero compensation for out-of-pocket out-ofhospital expenses. But nobody will talk about Medicare Gold, just like Labor's approach to private health insurance. Again, we know that Labor philosophically oppose the private health insurance rebate and that, if ever they had the chance, they would abolish it. The former member for Werriwa outlined this in great detail. With Labor and their health policy in totality, you would see no safety net, no incentive to take out private health insurance and a Medicare Gold policy constructed by the member for Lalor that is an absolute policy catastrophe that not even her own side supports-that is the alternative health vision for Australia. I am confident that, when the Australian people have another choice, they will choose a sensible health policy, one that mixes public and private and offers certainty and out-of-pocket expenses paid for by Medicare as they always should have been.",56

85,Mr BALDWIN,COMMITTEES,"I ask leave of the House to make a statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit concerning the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office for 2005-06, and also for leave to present a copy of my statement. Leave granted.",60
86,Mr BALDWIN,COMMITTEES,"I rise on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit to report on the budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office. This is a requirement of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951, under which my committee operates. The ANAO's budget allocation in 2004-05 was just under $60 million, with a further $2.34 million sought and largely granted during additional estimates. The ANAO advised the committee in March that an additional allocation in 200506 of $4.55 million, in addition to the funds granted during the additional estimates, would enable it to meet its responsibilities. The ANAO also advised that the total additional funding required for the period 2005-06 to 2008-09 was $17.84 million. Acmem- cording to the Australian National Audit Office, this funding was required to meet the increased market pressures of the cost of qualified accountants and auditors to conduct financial statement audits, in particular where the Australian National Audit Office needs to contract in these services, to meet 2005 the significantly increased costs of auditing the Department of Defence due to the inadequate systems in that department and the demerger with the Defence Materiel Organisation, to provide greater IT audit capacity to produce an annual report on progress in major defence projects, as requested by the Senate in May 2003. The Australian National Audit Office also noted the impact of the nine per cent ratchet clause in the Centenary House lease. The Report rent at Centenary House will increase by $517,000 in 2005-06, a further $564,000 in 2006-07 and a further $615,000 in 2007-08. The Auditor-General has now advised the committee that he has received additional funding of just over $2.3 million for 2005-06. This includes approximately $1 million to cover the additional costs associated with the Department of Defence and a further $1.3 million for contracted out financial statement audits, enabling full cost recovery in this area. However, $1 million sought for the extra cost of IT audit capability and contracting expertise has not been provided, nor has next year's rent increase for Centenary House of $517,000 been funded. These costs will have to be absorbed within the ANAO's total budget of around $63 million. The Auditor-General has advised the committee that, with some adjustment of priorities, the constraints will be manageable in 2005-06. On that basis the committee concludes that the Australian National Audit Office's budgeted allocation for this financial year is sufficient to enable the Auditor General to properly exercise his functions and powers under the Auditor-General Act 1997. The committee has some concerns, however, about the situation confronting the Auditor-General beyond this coming financial year. As I mentioned, the rent for Centenary House will increase yet again in 200607, a new certified agreement for the Australian National Audit Office staff is due to commence in 2006-07, and the increase in hourly rates for contract audit services shows no sign of abating. The Australian National Audit Office has indicated that it will continue to meet its statutory financial auditing obligations. Any reduction in the activity will be at the expense of the Australian National Audit Office's discretionary products, such as crossagency better practice guides, business support process audits and performance audits. The committee would be greatly concerned by any such reduction in the Australian National Audit Office's discretionary work. Items such as the better practice guides, which are applicable across the entire Commonwealth public sector, are a cost-efficient method of raising the standard of public administration. For example, my committee's current review of the management of special appropriations has revealed a desperate need for increased awareness of best practice across the Public Service. A decrease in such advice, and an oversight by the Australian National Audit Office for want of adequate funding, would strike the committee as a case of penny-wise and pound-foolish. The same could be said about any reduction in the Australian National Audit Office's highly successful program of around 45 to 50 performance audits annually. In summary, the committee is persuaded that the Auditor-General has sufficient budget allocation to allow him to meet his responsibilities for 2005-06. However, the committee will closely monitor the situation beyond 2005-06 to make sure that the Australian National Audit Office's wider program of performance audits and other discretionary activities is not compromised. I would ask the government to be mindful of our concerns in considering any Australian National Audit Office requests during the year in relation to unanticipated cost increases. In respect of the Auditor-General's budget for 2006-07, I would urge the government to be sympathetic to any strictly defined proposals from the Australian National Audit Office to access reserves or to undertake limited borrowings until the Centenary House lease expires. In light of the expected budget surplus tonight, the committee is disappointed that the Australian National Audit Office has not gained all of the additional funds it sought. However, the committee is aware of the need for government, as responsible financial managers, to continue to retire government debt and to invest for the future. I present a copy of my statement.

NA BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 March, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That this bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Laurie Ferguson moved by way of amendment: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House of Representatives notes with concern: (1) that certain policies of the Government, including processes for the use of ministerial discretion, limited tenure for members of the Refugee Review Tribunal, aspects of the detention policy and a lack of proper case management for claimants, have caused a significant increase in migration litigation; (2) that the Government refuses to make the Report report of the Penfold inquiry public and urgently requests the Government to make the report available; (3) that this Bill uses the mechanism of ‘purported privative clause decisions' to restrict judicial review of decisions made with jurisdictional error, which may be ineffective; (4) the views of Labor Senators during consideration of the Migration Amendment (Judicial Review) Bill 2004 that similar time-limit provisions could be unconstitutional; (5) that the time-limits proposed could prevent some applicants from exercising their right to judicial review; (6) that this Bill make changes to the Acts governing the High Court, Federal Court and Federal Magistrates Court with respect to summary judgements that would affect all litigation, not simply migration litigation; (7) that the provisions allowing cost orders against persons who encourage others to commence litigation without reasonable prospects of success would apply to volunteer and pro bono lawyers and advisers, and would apply without any cap on the costs that could be ordered and that these provisions may be too broad, with no clear explanation of how the ‘no reasonable prospects of success' test is to work in practice; and (8) that this Bill does not include the proposal contained in the Australian Labor Party's policy ‘Protecting Australia and Protecting the Australian Way' to establish a Refugee Status Determination Tribunal”.",62
89,Mr MURPHY,MIGRATION LITIGATION REFORM,"In the short time. I have left to speak on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005, I again ask the Attorney-General why the Penfold report has been withheld and when it will be made available to the public. I also make the point that, at face value, this bill seeks to deter unmeritorious litigation, to place uniform but generally stricter time limits in which to appeal and to otherwise facilitate quicker handling of migration cases. Essentially, the bill ensures that the judiciary must consider cost orders against advisers and lawyers if the action is considered unmeritorious. I put to this House that this is yet another attempt at flagrant government meddling by the legislature in the judicature, which the opposition stringently opposes. The Attorney-General is not unaccustomed to a fracas with the judicature. In this case, the bill would in my view impose a duty on the courts which would fail to give due weight to the procedural issues in raising cost orders by any party to proceedings. Also, as I have said previously in this debate, the effect of this bill will be to tively scare off lawyers and advisers even where the case has merit but has little prospects of success. For these reasons, I support the opposition's second reading amendment to this bill and commend the Senate to conduct a forensic inquiry into this bill.",62
90,Mr LINDSAY,MIGRATION LITIGATION REFORM,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the parliament on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005. For some time. I have shared the view of the government, and indeed the High Court, on the use of multiple appeal processes which, on the face of it, seem to be delaying tactics or are unmeritorious and result not only in the High Court's time being unreasonably taken up but also in those who are taking the action before the court in really delaying the inevitable conclusion that in 90 per cent of the cases that is what is resolved. It has been terribly inefficient and a waste of everybody's time. This bill seeks to in a proper way address that issue. I am particularly pleased to see the suggested use of the Federal Magistrates Service. There is a federal magistrate sitting in Townsville. The Federal Magistrates Court is next to the Family Court judge. Both the federal magistrate, Justice Coker, and the Family Court judge, Justice Monteith, work hand in hand, unlike in relationships between the FMS and the Family Court in some other parts of Australia. In Townsville the relationship is 110 per cent. The Federal Magistrates Court works very well indeed. What is more, it is a system that can work quickly. It is also a system that can work at low cost. Many of my constituents have never quite understood that taking matters to the Federal Magistrates Court can be a low-cost option. It can in fact be an option where you can represent yourself very easily. Many of my constituents do not understand that federal magistrates are very sympathetic and helpful when people appear before them-they understand that, in effectheir appearance, people are often quite stressed. I have spent time just sitting in the Federal Magistrates Court in Townsville, listening to how matters are dealt with. The matters can be dealt with through people actually appearing in the court or through video conferencing. I have seen both, and they work very well. I was quite surprised when sitting in the Federal Magistrates Court by how the court is able to help both sides of the argumentlistening to both sides of the argument and being very sympathetic and understanding to get not only the proper outcome at law but also the proper outcome for the parties concerned. When I saw this bill proposing that some of these migration matters should go to the FMS, I was heartily in favour because it is a low-cost option, a speedy option and it frees up the High Court to do the much more complex matters that it should be doing. In relation to facilitating quicker handling of these migration cases, this bill will require applicants to disclose previous applications for judicial review of the same migration decision and it will expressly provide for the High Court to remit migration and other cases on the papers-that is, without a hearing. That is certainly going to help. I understand that some people will be concerned about the bill's intentions to deter unmeritorious applications. The government does understand that not all applications are unmeritorious. But I say to those who do not agree with what is in this reform bill that, at the end of the day, it is the judges who will decide. It is the judiciary who, on hearing all the evidence, will decide whether an application is unmeritorious; it is not the parliament. This bill actually allows the High Court, the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court to dispose of a matter summarily, on their own initiative, if they are satisfied there is no reasonable prospect of success. The bill will also prohibit lawyers, migration agents and others from encouraging unmeritorious migration litigation, with the risks of personal costs orders for contravening this prohibition. That is a pretty big thing, but we have seen occasions many times over where lawyers apparently, for whatever purpose, encourage their clients to go to court when there is no prospect of success, or for other reasons-for example, delaying their removal from Australia, if that is going to be the final outcome. I think we have all felt that that is unfortunate. I was pleased to support this bill when it came before the government for its consideration before it was brought to the parliament. I do think that it is a move in the right direction and something that will be valuable. It does have, apparently, the support of the courts. From my own experience with the Federal Magistrates Court, I think that that is useful as well. I would like to conclude on this point: I think it is time for the government to consider extending the Federal Magistrates Service-the FMS. It has worked wonderfully well. I think it should be further resourced. I think the Attorney-General should take a case to cabinet to increase its resources so that we can put more federal magistrates on the ground throughout Australia to give people more access. I am lucky to have an FMS in Townsville; but that service is not in Cairns, for example, without the federal magistrate in Townsville going to Cairns. I would like to see federal magistrates based in the major cities of this country, providing an equivalent service across the country. It must be hard for the magistrates to do the travelling that they do at the moment to service the rest of Australia in areas that currently do not have a Federal Magistrates Court. Indeed, if that a second magistrate were placed in Townsville, I am convinced that the current backlog in the Family Court could be reduced down to perhaps three months. That would be a great outcome. I support the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005.",63
91,Mr KERR,MIGRATION LITIGATION REFORM,"We tag the worse of our motives with cheerful words. We use ‘collateral damage' and various other euphemisms to disguise meaning in the attempts we make to have others understand the world according to our views. The word ‘reform' is always put forward with the connotation of being positive. It is difficult to stand up and say, ‘I oppose reform.' Reform is one of those things which are inherently virtuous, so attaching the title of ‘reform' to legislation is something that the government does in order to colour the way we see it. There are a number of measures in this legislation which deserve the support of this parliament. There is no doubt that streamlining the process of judicial review is something which all members of this House ought to encourage and do all we can to facilitate. There is no doubt we ought also to discourage those who wish to pursue unmeritorious applications knowing them to be so. But after those broad propositions, which everybody in this House would assent to, we come to areas where there are legitimate bases for disagreement. The foundation for my contribution to this debate focuses on the attempt of this government to prevent courts hearing the substance of matters to address the merits of plausible arguments that could be made in favour of a person whose circumstances are such that they require the attention of a court, either because there has been an expiry of time, and their rights are therefore entirely removed by this legislation, or because their advisors and those who would normally act for them have become intimidated by the potential burden of costs that they may be forced to wear. Let me go to the first point, about time. It will not be unknown to members of this House that I acted in the landmark litigation that prompted this legislation: the case of Plaintiff S157. That litigation was a response to legislation, passed by this parliament, which attempted to exclude the High Court's original jurisdiction to review decisions made in migration areas, by the use of a device called the ‘privative clause'. The High Court imaginatively dealt with the problem it was confronted with by saying that it was not unconstitutional for the parliament to exclude the High Court's review of privative clause decisions but the term ‘privative clause decision' meant a decision validly made, and where a decision was invalidly made-that is, made with a lack of jurisdiction-it would never have become a privative clause decision, and the court could review it. The court added, further, that were the parliament to extend the definition to apply not only to purported decisions but to decisions which were tainted by jurisdictional error then it would be beyond this parliament's power, because the High Court is invested under section 75(v) of the Constitution with original jurisdiction to supervise the administration of law in this country and has a constitutional responsibility to discharge that jurisdiction. The court took the same approach to the time limits. It held that those time limits were not in conflict with the Constitution but that they did not apply in the case of decisions infected by jurisdictional error. Since that decision of the High Court the government has set its mind to try and undermine the effect of those particular holdings. Clearly, the warnings of the High Court-to the effect that the government could not take away the High Court's constitutional jurisdiction-have meant that the government have not pursued the course of trying to deal with the substantive issue. Instead the Commonwealth have sought to impose fixed time limits that cannot be extended. The problem with doing so is twofold. Firstly, Mr Justice Callinan-in agreement with the outcome but in dissent in relation to the point-has indicated that a clause which excludes, by provision of a time limit, the capacity of the court to review a migration decision will be unconstitutional because that amounts to an effective bar to the court's jurisdiction. So one of the High Court justices has already addressed the substantive issue that the parliament is currently addressing and has indicated a view that-particularly as persons dealing with migration related issues often lack sophisticated legal skills, may be held in detention and may be unable to access legal advice conveniently-a short time limit is simply constitutionally not open to this parliament. The other six justices did not need to decide that substantive point, and it remains to be argued. But, now that it has been dealt with in this direct way, the court will have to address what appears to be a direct inconsistency between the court's jurisdiction under section 75(v) and this parliament's instruction, were this legislation to pass. A constitutionally guaranteed jurisdiction cannot be removed in this way. Sections 73, 74, 76 and 77 of the Constitution provide in detail the circumstances in which parliament can legislate on the types of matters enumerated in section 75 of the Constitution. Section 77(i) of the Constitution is a conclusive indication that it is not within the power of the parliament to grant or withhold the jurisdiction conferred on the High Court by section 75(v). In Abebe v Commonwealth, decided in 1999, the High Court held that section 77 of the Constitution is the source of the authority to impose a mandatory time limit on the Federal Court. But, in respect of that jurisdiction, Chief Justice Gleeson and Mr Justice MCHugh, at paragraph 526, said: On the other hand as 77 law may validly confer or invest jurisdiction in respect of some only of those rights, powers, privileges and liabilities and may even limit the remedies which are available to a person affected by a breach of those rights. If section 77 is a source of the parliament's authority to impose a mandatory time limit on the Federal Court, then not only is section 77 not a source of power for a time limit in respect of the High Court but it is also a very clear indication that the structure of chapter III of the Constitution prevents the use of any other power to modify, cut down or limit the matters governed by section 75. Obviously it cannot be conclusively known by this parliament how the High Court will address this legislation, were it to be passed; but it does strike me as an extremely bold claim that the parliament can say that a power constitutionally vested in the High Court can be removed, such that the High Court cannot examine the legality of administrative decision-and it is not as if the High Court itself does not have means, under its own rules, to impose reasonable time limits on the management of these cases. Under rule 25 of the High Court Rules 2004, recently adopted, an application for certiorari should be brought within six months or such other lesser period as may be prescribed by law. Of course, it might be responded that this is just such a provision as prescribed by law. But the High Court, under rule 4, has the capacity to enlarge timeextend time-in any instance where it is just to do so, where the merits of the case demand it, whether before or after the expiry of time. So the rules passed by the court-made by the court itself-envisage flexibility in this area; so too with mandamus and the other writs that are available under the original jurisdiction of the High Court. It is well arguable that the Constitution envisages that in this area-in the supervision of the legality of administrative action by the executive and by the parliament as authorised-it is not open to the executive to put forward measures, and have them passed by this parliament, which would effectively cut down the entitlement of the High Court to exercise that jurisdiction. Another point that I think should be raised relates to the injunction, which is under section 75(v) of the Constitution-part of the ‘Original jurisdiction of the court'. The injunction gets little attention but undoubtedly will get attention in future if this legislation is passed. The pleadings in Plaintiff S157 v Commonwealth did not seek an injunction. However, the majority judgment of Gaudron, MCHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ drew attention to this in these terms: The other aspect of s 75(v) that should be noted is its conferral of jurisdiction in matters in which “an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth”. Given that prohibition and mandamus are available only for jurisdictional error, it may be that injunctive relief is available on grounds that are wider than those that result in relief by way of prohibition and mandamus. In any event, injunctive relief would clearly be available for fraud, bribery ... or other improper purpose. Again it strikes me as entirely improbable that the High Court would say that measures of the kind that seek to restrict the original jurisdiction of the court could not go by way of injunctive relief should the decision that challenged have been affected by fraud, bribery or improper purpose. It seems to me quite improbable. And no time limit has ever been prescribed in a statute or in the High Court by the rules for such injunctive relief. Of course, the same applies in the case of habeas corpus-another remedy that may be sought under some very limited circumstances relevant to the Migration Act. So there are very fundamental constitutional questions that we are asked to address by an executive that has put forward a range of relatively sound measures to facilitate the hearing of these matters, at first instance, in the magistrates court but then tacks onto it an attempt to limit the capacity of the courts to supervise the conduct of the executive beyond that prescribed for in the High Court rules and in other legislation. In submissions given to the Senate committee in relation to this matter, it was accepted by the department in evidence that no similar provisions exist in Commonwealth legislation and that no similar provisions can be identified in any state legislation. So we are seeking to do in this area of law what is not done in any other field of administration. In a most contentious area, where people's status, freedom and other rights are directly affected, we are seeking to do that which we would not do in much more trivial areas. Obviously these matters will receive further attention in the Senate. Legal submissions will be put and argument had. But why this government persists in putting forward legislation which is not consistent with respect for the rule of law and the obligation of the High Court to discharge its constitutional jurisdiction to ensure that the legality of administrative action is complied with is something that I find difficult to understand. I turn to two other provisions which trouble me. I turn first to the provisions which go is to the possible imposition of costs orders in relation to those who encourage legal proceedings where there are said to be no reasonable prospects of success. As a practising lawyer I know that this is an extraordinarily difficult area. In the teeth of the last election I was approached by a person who had heard that from time to time. I act pro bono in public interest advocacy matters. I looked at the file and it was a confused mess. At that point, in the teeth of the election, I simply did not have time to do more than that. I provided some advice and I suggested duty pro bono barristers in the state he came from. He took that advice but unfortunately he got no assistance from them. Everybody took the view that there was no possible merit in that case. It was too confused and they could not see an outcome that could be favourable. That case is now one of the leading authorities. He won, representing himself before the Federal Court of Australia. It is a leading case not in immigration law but in the intersection between the AAT and the industrial courts in relation to a question of whether or not a decision that was adverse to him in relation to a dismissal prevented him pursuing the matter of unfair dismissal in the industrial court. That was a salutary lesson to me, and I think it ought to be a salutary lesson to anybody who thinks that a legal practitioner can neatly categorise the percentage chance of success. What does it mean to say that, for migration litigation to have no reasonable prospect of success, it need not be ‘hopeless' or ‘bound to fail'? I never pursue matters that I believe to be hopeless or bound to fail, but sometimes I see a glimmer of real argument that is open. It might be innovative and it might conflict with existing authorities, as did the case submitted in Plaintiff S157which won. How is a lawyer to deal with matters where he is told that he is at risk of costs against himself personally if he pursues a case which is not ‘hopeless' or ‘bound to fail' but which he knows has only modest chances of success? I see it as my duty to take such cases, broadly, particularly if it is a matter where the well-being of the community is not disadvantaged and the interests of that individual are enhanced. Refusing to take such cases conflicts with the whole ethos of the law. Normally, the ‘no reasonable cause of action' test, as applied in Day v Victorian Railways Commissioner in the High Court and in General Steel Industries v Commissioner of Railways, demonstrates the great caution the courts have in striking out matters where there is a possible argument. Why should the courts approach these things in such a way in every other area but put lawyers potentially at risk of costs in injunction cases were they to pursue matters which ordinarily they would pursue-matters that are not unethical and not improper, and indeed where it would normally be regarded as their responsibility to their client? (Extension of time granted). There seems to be an inconsistency in proposed section 486E of the bill, which commences speaking about a person not encouraging another person to commence or continue migration litigation in the court under two circumstances-that is, if: (a) the migration litigation has no reasonable prospect of success; and (b) either: (i) the person does not give proper consideration to the prospects of success (ii) a purpose in commencing or continuing the migration litigation is unrelated to the objectives which the court process is designed to achieve. It then makes the addendum: (2) For the purposes of this section, migration litigation need not be: (a) hopeless; or (b) bound to fail; for it to have no reasonable prospect of success. In its terms, these provisions do not seem to apply to lawyers acting for a client, because lawyers acting for clients are not encouraging other persons to commence or continue litigation. But then there is this provision which appears to contradict the substance of clauses (1) and (2). Clause (3) says: This section applies despite any obligation that the person may have to act in accordance with the instructions or wishes of the litigant. This is plainly directed at the lawyer. If you look at the substantive provision, you can see that it does not affect them. Either it is bad drafting and the government will need to change it to give effect to its intention or the provision is such that it will catch lawyers and was intended to. I do not believe that lawyers should be put at risk for doing what is their professional and ethical responsibility, and simply that. Nor do I believe that these provisions should apply to those who provide services pro bono or who provide kits along the lines that we do for divorce, which can be bought. We are a community that values the entitlement to the provision of legal assistance. In allowing me to conclude the member for Kooyong has been most gracious. I thank him and I thank the Deputy Speaker.",64
92,Mr GEORGIOU,MIGRATION LITIGATION REFORM,"Kooyong) (5.23 pm)I wish to speak on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005, which has a number of components ranging from the direction of ... ; or migration cases to the Federal Magistrates Court, the imposition of absolute time limits on migration appeals and measures to deter unmeritorious cases. There are a couple of other components which were touched on by the member for Denison, but I do not want to cover all of the matters contained in the bill; I just want to focus on a couple of aspects. I think that we all can agree that facilitatcited ing and streamlining the efficiency of the judicial system is a laudable objective. As a matter of principle, I strongly support measures that will minimise abuse of the legal system by using it for improper purposes and ensure that the courts can devote their time and energy to discharging their vital responsibilities. How this principle is to be applied to immigration law in particular does require careful attention. In this area the courts do play a vital role in protecting the rights and welfare of particularly vulnerable people: people with little or no English; people who have had traumatic experiences in their countries of origin and during the course of dangerous journeys to Australia; and people who have been detained for lengthy periods in Australia in remote locations without ready access to legal advice and assistance. In this context one aspect of the bill does give rise to concern about unintended consequences-that is, the imposition of a time limit on appeals. Essentially, the time limits are that an application to a court has to be made within 28 days of an actual notification of a decision and, subsequently, the applicant may make an application to the court to extend that by a further 56 days. So the total time in which an application for an appeal can run is 84 days. I think it is undoubted that unmeritorious applications may be indicated by late applications, but this is not an infallible indicator. The imposition of a nonextendable time limit on the right to seek judicial review, regardless of the merits of individual cases, creates a substantial risk of unfairness and injustice, with potentially very serious consequences for those affected, including their removal to places where their welfare and safety are in jeopardy. The experience of the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, which has assisted thousands of asylum seekers and migrants over very many years, is telling. The centre a range of circumstances which have resulted in applications falling outside a time limit and which are completely unrelated to the merits of the application. These include applicants who did not know that they had a right of appeal; applicants who lacked access to appropriate legal advice about their right of appeal and the consequences of, and the prospects of, the success of an appeal; applicants who were unable to pay for legal advice-and there is a significant shortage of competent pro bono assistance in relation to demand for legal advice; applicants who often spoke little or no English and lacked access to qualified interpreters; and some applicants who had received poor advice from their migration and legal advisers. Amongst asylum seekers and refugees in particular there is a high prevalence of mental illness, which is something that I will come back to later. The populations most affected by such circumstances are those who are detained in immigration detention facilities, some of which are quite deliberately placed in positions remote from the capital cities, where sources of legal and other assistance are mainly situated. These may seem like fairly straightforward and obvious observations, but I think they are cast into relief by the case of Cornelia Rau. This is something that I think we do need to consider carefully. Consider the impact of this bill on a detainee with mental health problems like Cornelia Rau, who was imprisoned for six months in a Queensland prison and for four months in the detention centre at Baxter. Given that such a person has been advised of an adverse decision, under the proposed legislation she would have a maximum of 84 days in which to make an appeal to the court-12 weeks. Assuming that she was advised of the decision and could comprehend it, she would have a maximum of 12 weeks to recover from a mental illness sufficient to realise that she needed legal advice, start using her correct name and make an application to the court. Outside this time, even if she had come to her senses and sought review, she would not have been able to do so because she would have been outside a time limit of 84 days that is totally inflexible. I have raised this matter with the Attorney-General, and he has been kind enough to advise me in the following terms: You have concerns about the operation of these proposed amendments in relation to persons with diminished capacity. These proposed amendments do not deal expressly with the notification of a decision to a person with diminished capacity. However, under the proposed amendments, whether or not a person has received actual notification would be a question of fact to be determined by a Court on the basis of evidence before it. In all the circumstances of a particular person's mental capacity may be a relevant factor for a Court in deciding whether a person has been notified. That is essentially the only qualification. If somebody gets notified and subsequently finds themselves, for reasons of psychiatric illness, unable to activate an appeal, then they run out of time within 84 days. I think this needs to be very closely considered by the government as the bill proceeds through this debate and into the Senate. I note that the member for Denison said that there were no other similar provisions in Commonwealth legislation and that there was always a provision for the court to have some discretion. I am not a lawyer and I certainly do not have the member for Denison's capacities or knowledge of the law but, in those jurisdictions which I have examined where time limits are imposed, courts and tribunals have discretion to grant extensions and have well-established principles to assess whether extensions are warranted. Examples are the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975, the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 and the Child Support (Assessment) Act 1989. Given the very serious issues at stake for people seeking review of decisions under the Migration Act, the government needs to examine very carefully the need for depriving people of the safeguard that is available generally to people operating within Commonwealth legislation. As I said at the outset, I am in favour of stopping unmeritorious litigation. The focus of this bill is litigation brought by individuals against the government. This is undoubtedly a valid area of concern but it is only part of the problem. I think it is worthwhile looking at litigation which, to use the terms of the bill, was initiated or continued only because of what was an unreasonable position adopted by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. case, a There have been some examples of this lately. In recent months a number of long term immigration detainees at Baxter have taken legal action to obtain independent psychiatric assessments of their medical health and to review the adequacy and appropriateness of their treatment. On the face of it, each detainee's request for independent assessment was completely reasonable because they had obtained expert external opinions to the effect that they were seriously unwell and that the treatment they were receiving was inadequate or inappropriate. The outcome in each case vindicated their claims and raised serious questions about the willingness of the department of immigration to fight the issue through the courts. In one case, in December last year, the matter was heard in the Federal Court for eight days before the department of immigration agreed to obtain the urgent psychiatric opinion that the man was seeking, which led to his immediate transfer to a psychiatric facility. The department litigated this case for eight days and then accepted that there was a need for urgent psychiatric intervention before the case was concluded. That may be a straw in the wind but last month the department was once again in the Federal Court asserting that it was entitled not to obtain independent psychiatric assessments of two detainees, despite receiving opinions from external psychiatrists and a general practitioner that the treatment that the two men were receiving was inadequate or inappropriate. As was extensively reported in the media last week, the Federal Court decided on 5 May that the Commonwealth had breached its duty of care in relation to the treatment of the detainees' psychiatric conditions. In the event both men had been transferred to a psychiatric hospital before the court published its decision, one man in the course of the proceedings and one man after the case had been completed but before the decision had been brought down. The judge, in his judgment, stated that had the men not been transferred he would have ordered them to be. He said: The transfers so late in the day may practically have brought these ... applications to an end. They in no way addressed the regrettable need for the applications to be made. I do not know the precise definition of ‘unmeritorious' but it would not seem to me that this action on the part of the Commonwealth was meritorious. I think it is important that some of what was a very good and worthwhile judgment by Mr Justice Finn be put on the record. I will quote from the judgment in S and the Secretary, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, given on 5 May: Given the known prevalence of mental illness amongst the over 100 long-term detainees at Baxter, and the likely needs of S and Mthe applicants, interestingly namedthe level of psychiatric service made available to S and M was, and remained, clearly inadequate. … … … The Commonwealth neglected to take steps to inform itself of this inadequacy. Its conduct contributed to the progressive deterioration of the applicants over several months ... The Commonwealth entered into a complex outsourcing arrangement for the provision of mental health services which left it to contractors and subcontractors to determine the level of services to be supplied ... The service provision was so structured that there was a clear and obvious need for regular and systematic auditing of the psychological and psychiatric services provided if the Commonwealth was to inform itself appropriately as to the adequacy and effectiveness of these services for which it bore responsibility. There has to date been no such audit. The judgment says it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the aptness of the Commonwealth's own arrangement ‘is open to real question'. The judge says: I have found ... continuing failures ... to take appropriate steps to arrange psychiatric assessments after medical referrals and to implement adequately treatment plans that had been prescribed. Notwithstanding the receipt of medical opinions from two outside psychiatrists and a GP challenging the treatment plans prescribed at Baxter for S and M, the Commonwealth continued to rely upon the latter without, on the evidence, feeling it necessary to obtain competent, independent, third party advice that it was reasonable to continue to do so. Importantly the outside opinions were to the effect that the conditions at Baxter were themselves a contributing cause of the mental illness of S and M; that Baxter was unable to provide the level of care now required by S and M given their conditions; and that Baxter was an inappropriate treatment environment for them. ... Those opinions could not be said to be unreasonable. They put the Commonwealth on notice that it needed to take reasonable steps to satisfy itself that it remained reasonable and appropriate to continue to rely upon the treatment plans prescribed at Baxter. This necessitated in the circumstances that independent advice be obtained. This was not done. It is a moot point whether other detainees will face the regrettable need to bring legal action to ensure that the Commonwealth discharges its duty of care to people in immigracount tion detention. I hope not, but that will re- debate. quire the implementation, I believe, of a range of measures including the following: obtaining independent psychiatric and physical assessments of all the individual detainees about whom concerns have been raised by mental health and other professionals closely involved with them; acting upon the issues identified by the Federal Court; implementing recommendations of the Immigration Detention Advisory Group-for example, the conduct of research into the mental health problems of long-term detainees; and, requesting an interim report as soon as  inquiry's term of reference to examine and make findings on the systems and processes of, and cooperation between, relevant state and Commonwealth agencies in relation to the provision of mental health services. I hope that the government and the Attorney-General will consider the issues raised in this debate as the bill progresses through the House and the Senate. I hope that there is a more rigorous approach to litigation mounted by the department of immigration and that there is an improvement based on recommendations of the Palmer inquiry and that there be changes to the delivery and scrutiny of mental health services to people detained in immigration detention centres.",68
93,Mr RUDDOCK,MIGRATION LITIGATION REFORM,"Firstly, I thank those members who have participated in this debate-the member for Reid; the members for Wentworth, Lowe, Herbert and Denison; and the member for Kooyong, who has just spoken. I assure my colleague, in case he is about to leave, that I will look seriously at the points he has raised-as I always have. I may answer some of those points, and there may be areas in which my comments will satisfy you. Obviously in relation to these matters I am very conscious to take into acthe contributions of members during The Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005 consolidates the government's efforts to implement a comprehensive package of migration litigation reforms. Substantial progress has already been made. I must say that there have been many twists and turns in relation to these matters over time, but in May we provided an extra $34.2 million over four years in the 2004-05 budget for the appointment of eight additional federal magistrates-in addition to magistrates who have taken up their appointments-to have more magistrates handling the migration load more efficiently. We are concerned, however, about the increase in the number of migration cases in the Federal Court in recent years and the very low success rate of this litigation. I think one of the reasons that we do have people in detention of the sort that the member for Kooyong has drawn to our attention is the length of time that people are in detention-that is, the length of time that matters can go unresolved and without finality. The government and, I might say, former governments have been concerned to ensure that litigation by unsuccessful applicants does not unduly extend the time that they are here in Australia. The fact is that unsuccessful visa applicants today represent a substantial proportion of the workload of the High Court, the Federal Court and the Magistrates Court. The reforms in the bill, together with the additional resources provided to the magistracy, will assist courts in dealing with migration workloads and improve access to the courts for all those who have matters which are of merit. There are a number of key areas of reform in this bill that are designed to improve migration litigation. Firstly, the bill directs migration cases to the Federal Magistrates Court and limits the jurisdiction of the Federal Court. The Magistrates Court was established to deal with high-volume, shorter and less complex matters and is a suitable forum for most migration cases. Secondly, the bill provides identical grounds for relief in the High Court and lower federal courts and so will assist the courts in quickly identifying and stopping applicants early in the process who are seeking to relitigate matters which have already been the subject of a judicial determination. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has advised that currently one-third of all its judicial relitigation. view applications come from repeat judicial review applicants. Thirdly, the bill reimposes uniform time limits in migration matters. The government have been careful to draft time limits that are regulatory in nature, in accordance with the High Court's views on the parliament's power to prescribe time limits. Currently the Migration Act contains no extendable time limits. The case of S157 has rendered these largely ineffective. This bill will reimpose time limits and provide them to be extended to a maximum of 84 days. Fourthly, the bill improves the efficiency of the court processes by providing that the High Court can remit migration cases directly to the Magistrates Court and do so on the papers without an oral hearing, facilitating the current practice of single judges hearing most migration appeals from the Federal Magistrates Court except in circumstances where it is appropriately done in the full court, and requiring applicants to disclose any previous judicial review applications in relation to the same migration decision. Lastly, the bill deters the institution and continuation of unmeritorious court proceedings by broadening the grounds on which federal courts may summarily dispose of unmeritorious cases, strengthening the courts' powers to make personal cost orders against people who encourage initiation or continuation of unmeritorious litigation, and requiring lawyers in migration cases to certify that an application has reasonable prospects of success. Of course, the government recognises that there is a distinction between unsuccessful and unmeritorious litigation. Some unsuccessful cases can, of course, raise arguable claims. However, in 2003-04 the government won over 90 per cent of all migration matters decided at hearing. This rate of unsuccessful cases gives rise to concerns-including within the courts, I might say-about the high levels of unmeritorious I want to comment generally in relation to contributions made in the debate on this bill. I am pleased that the opposition accepts that there is a problem with the current migration litigation workload that needs to be addressed. I am also pleased that the opposition supports the government's initiative to channel most of the migration litigation to magistrates courts. The opposition has raised in the debate an issue that has been raised in a number of other forums-that is, the public release of the migration review report. As I have previously advised, the report was prepared for the government's consideration and for the purposes of a cabinet decision. For this reason, and in keeping with the long standing practice on both sides of the House, the report has not been and will not be publicly released. Certain factual material in the report has, however, been publicly released. On a more substantive issue, the opposition, while seeming to support the general principle of cost orders, has suggested that the bill goes too far in this regard. The opposition has suggested the bill targets not only lawyers working for profit but also pro bono lawyers who feel the need to fight cases because of human rights concerns and community groups who provide assistance to people involved in migration litigation. The bill does not target anyone. The government is not trying to penalise lawyers acting ethically and in accordance with their professional obligations. The government is not trying to penalise community organisations who act responsibly. However, in the light of the high rate of unsuccessful migration cases in recent years, the government is concerned to ensure that lawyers and other advisers do not encourage the commencement and continuation of unmeritorious proceedings. The prosecution of such cases gives clients false hope, wastes the courts' time and is often used only to extend people's residency in Australia on a bridging visa. The bill also imposes an obligation on persons, including lawyers and migration agents, not to encourage the commencement or continuation of unmeritorious litigation. A person runs the risk of a personal costs order against them only if they contravene the obligation not to encourage unmeritorious cases. The court has first to consider whether or not there was a reasonable prospect of the particular migration matter succeeding. If the court decides that there was no reasonable prospect of success, then the court has to consider whether the person who encouraged the litigation did so either without giving proper consideration to the prospect of success or for a purpose unrelated to the objectives of the court process. Only if the court is satisfied of this will it consider whether or not to make a personal costs order. I repeat what I said in my second reading speech: It is grossly irresponsible to encourage the instituited tion of unmeritorious cases as a means simply to prolong an unsuccessful visa applicant's stay in Australia. It is equally irresponsible for advisers to frustrate the system by lodging mass-produced applications without considering the actual circumstances of each case. The opposition has suggested that somehow the bill is changing the High Court's original jurisdiction. This is not the case. The High Court's original jurisdiction under the Constitution in relation to migration cases is unaffected by this bill. The High Court is the apex of Australia's judicial system. It is the court of final appeal and responsible for constitutional cases. It is the government's view that the High Court should not be burdened with applications that are more appropriately handled in a lower court. I also note claims made by the opposition during the debate that some provisions of the bill may be unconstitutional. I am confident, on the advice given to me, that the bill will withstand any judicial challenge on constitutional grounds. I note also that the bill was referred by the opposition to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for inquiry. The government will consider that committee's report when it is before the Senate. I would also like to comment on some of the issues that are not covered in the bill that is being debated but which the opposition has raised during the debate and, I might say, one matter raised by my colleague the member for Kooyong. I note the assertions made by the opposition spokesman that certain policies of the government have caused a significant increase in migration litigation. I also note that he has not produced evidence as to these assertions, specifically including the assertion that the Refugee Review Tribunal members take a hard line given their limperiod of tenure. The government's success rate in migration litigation is over 90 per cent of cases that proceed to hearing. Such a high success rate in litigation I think refutes the claim that case management processes are poor. It also does not follow that the government's policies encourage a significant increase in the volume of litigation. I note that applicants for protection visas receive advice and assistance at a number of stages, including through the IAAAS and also the pilot legal advice scheme that operates in New South Wales. The Refugee Review Tribunal was created by the Labor government in the Migration Reform Act 1992 and commenced operation in July 1993. That government intended that members appointed to the Refugee Review Tribunal have only limited tenure, with a maximum of five years. This is consistent with appointments to other statutory bodies-that is, they are for limited periods. I might say, given the recent experience with the numbers of appeals that have to be dealt with and given what is happening to the tribunal at the moment, you would have had people with lifetime tenure sitting around and wondering what they were going to do. The government is of the view that there should not be judicial review of administrative decisions. The privative clause has been interpreted in a way which has meant that that was not possible. I would simply make the point, and I think this is relevant to of the comments that the member for Kooyong has been making, that the fact that the government is imposing time limits is not unreasonable in itself when you consider that our view-and it was supported by an earlier parliament-has generally been that there should be no judicial review of administrative decisions under the Migration Act at all and that the purpose of providing administrative review was to effectively cover the field and bring finality. This is the point I would make on time limits: time limits are not a purported privative clause mechanism designed to restrict the scope of jurisdictional error or alter the grounds of judicial review in any way. The purpose of the mechanism is clearly to set out the jurisdiction of the courts, in part to exclude the possibility of seeking judicial review of a decision before merits review has been exhausted and to restore meaningful time limits in which a person may seek judicial review of that decision. There are other examples of non-extended time limits, which include section 167 of the Customs Act, which provides that an action for recovery of any sum paid as customs duty in respect of goods must be made within six months of the date of the payment. There is no provision for an extension of this decision. Section 108B of the New South Wales Industrial Relations Act 1996 provides that time for making an order in relation to a contract that has been terminated ‘must be made not later than 12 months after the termination of the contract' and the commission does not have jurisdiction to extend the time. Section 39 of the New South Wales Impounding Act 1993 provides that ‘the time limit for making an application for review of an impounding decision is 28 days from the date on which impounding was notified'. There is no provision for extension in this section. Time limits do not apply if the some owner was not notified of the impounding of the item. I might say-and I have said this to the member for Kooyong-that if you look at this bill there are provisions relating to matters of competency where, in appropriate cases, a person's ability to receive notice of decisions can be tested. If a person were found to be mentally incompetent, the person's capacity to determine whether or not they had actual notification is a matter that a court may well be able to examine. The 84day time limit, of course, runs from the date of actual notification. I think those are important points that need to be made. In relation to the reference to the matter of Cornelia Rau, what happened is unfortunate, but I do not think it relates to immigration policy or detention policy. It really is an issue of identification. The real question is how Australians can be readily identified. That is a matter that people might need to turn their minds to. The people involved in dealing with these issues have faced some difficult questions. People are very quick to rush to judgment in these matters, but if you recognise that the principal problem we are dealing with here is a question of identification it puts the whole issue of detention policy and immigration policy into a more appropriate perspective. I commend the bill to the House and hope it will have a speedy passage elsewhere. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Laurie Ferguson's amendment) stand part of the question.

96,Mr COSTELLO,NOES,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Budget. I announce tonight is framed for the future-the future opportunities of our young people, the future care of our aged, the future health services that our citizens will need and demand, the security of the nation, and the future growth of the Australian economy which is necessary if we are going to realise these goals. The economic management of the Australian Government affects the lives of all our citizens. Economic management matters. It matters because the lives of our citizens matter-the decisions we make affect their mortgages, their businesses, and whether they can find a job. I bring this Budget down at a time when more Australians are in work than ever before. Our unemployment rate has fallen to a low unmatched for 28 years. This is not an accident. This is not a fluke. This is the outcome of sound economic management. Things could have been very different. But the aim of economic policy is to grow an economy and create jobs. We should now aim for an economy where every Australian who wants work can find it. At a time when more Australians are participating in work than ever before we want 7.30 pm to spread that participation further. We want to encourage more people to join the work 2005-2006 force. Tonight I announce the largest ever program designed to assist those on welfare move out of welfare and into work. Although in the short term it will cost money, in the long term it will strengthen our economy. And the Budget includes measures to prepare our country for the great demographic change now taking place that will reshape our society over the next 10, 20 and 30 years. Tonight I announce details of the Future Fund-an investment fund-which will help us prepare for the coming changes. Also tonight I will announce tax cuts for business and tax cuts for individuals to drive growth in our economy. Mr Speaker, this is the 10th Budget. I have presented to this House. Before that the last Budget of the Labor Government was in deficit-a deficit of two per cent of GDParound $19 billion in today's terms. The Budget. I announce tonight is in surplus-a surplus of one per cent of GDP-$8.9 billion. It is the eighth surplus Budget. I have presented. Ten years ago the Australian Government carried net debt of $96 billion. By 30 June next year we will have reduced that net debt by $90 billion. We are paying off Labor's debt and soon we can begin saving-saving for the future, saving for the ageing of the population, saving the opportunities of future generations. Welfare to work Over the last nine years, unemployment has fallen far in Australia but we still have many people of working age, under 65, who are not in the work force. Unemployed people looking for work are entitled to the unemployment benefit, Newstart. But there are many other people of working age who receive income support without any obligation to look for work. And the number of people on these benefits is growing very fast. For example, the number of people on a Disability Pension is about 6.5 per cent of the Australian work force. The number increased by around 21 per cent over the five years to June 2004. The number of people on Parenting Payment for single parents is around 4.3 per cent of the work force. The number increased around 18 per cent over the same period. People who are unable to find work deserve support from the taxes paid by those who are working. But those who are working deserve to know that others capable of work are at least looking for work in return for their income support. If more people are able to move from welfare to work then this will help them with higher incomes and better participation in mainstream economic life. It will also reduce the obligation on other taxpayers whose taxes pay for the welfare support. Our proposal for reform announced tonight is to start on 1 July 2006. From 1 July 2006 those on Parenting Payment will be expected to look for at least part-time work when their youngest child turns six and is ready for school. Tonight I am announcing a massive increase in outside school hours child-care which will assist those parents. Of course if they are unable to find work they will keep their payment. Those on Parenting Payment at present will keep it. Those coming on to Parenting Payment after 1 July 2006 will continue to receive it while their youngest child is under six and then move to enhanced Newstart when that youngest child turns six. Changes to Disability Support Pensions will also come into effect on 1 July 2006. Those on Disability Pensions at present will not be affected by any of these changes. But from 1 July 2006 a person capable of part-time work will no longer be entitled to a Disability Pension if they are capable of working more than 15 hours a week at award wages. The object of these changes is to protect the genuinely disabled but to encourage those capable of part-time work to look for it. The largest category of disability at present is musculo-skeletal injury-principally bad backs. A person in this category may be unable to hold down a full-time manual job but they may be capable of part-time work, especially non-manual work. Of course if they are unable to find it they will continue to receive income support through enhanced Newstart. But they will have an obligation to look for work. In order to assist people to look for work, rehabilitation services will be increased by 41,700 places. Education and training opportunities will be increased and schemes to assist employers to employ people with disabilities will be expanded. More than $2 billion will be spent on services over four years to assist these groups find work. The cost of these services will exceed the reduction in welfare support over the next four years. But in the longer term as more people join the work force it will make the economy significantly stronger. In the future we are going tionately fewer people of working age, under 65, compared to those of retirement age. We need to encourage as many people of working age as we can to join our work force. In order to improve incentives for people to move out of welfare into work, tonight I am announcing a tax cut for low-income earners. The 17 cent tax rate which applies between $6,000 and $21,600 will be cut to 15 cents in the dollar. This change will take effect on 1 July 2005. In addition, the rate at which a person in part-time work loses their entitlement to income support under Newstart will be reduced. Instead of 70 cents in the dollar withdrawal it will be 60 cents after they have earned $250 per fortnight. This will introduce an enhanced Newstart. For people with disabilities, we are introducing a new comprehensive work capacity assessment. And we will use it to refer them to the employment services they need. A new $80 million Pre-Vocational Participation Account will support people with disabilities by providing services that will allow them to quickly become job ready. For parents and mature aged job seekers, we are providing additional assistance through a new $48 million Employment Preparation Service. This will allow Job Network providers to provide skills training to equip these clients for a job. For the very long-term unemployed, there will be a new Wage Assist program with wage subsidies to employers, delivered through Job Network. But those who have a pattern of job avoidance can be required to undertake full-time work for the dole. to have propor- Skills and training Mr Speaker, a skilled and adaptable work force is critical to boosting the productive capacity of our economy in the years ahead. Skills are not only important to businessthey increase the ability of employees to find satisfying work. And the chances of doing that are better today than they have been for three decades. As our economy changes the nature of work may change but a strong vocational and technical education system will better equip employees to upskill and adapt. In this Budget. I announce an extra 4,500 pre-vocational training places for people interested in a career in a traditional trade, and an additional 7,000 School Based New Apprenticeships so more students can begin their apprenticeship while continuing their school studies. And, as we promised during the election, this Government will establish 24 Australian Technical Colleges for 7,200 year 11 and 12 students. This will allow young Australians an opportunity to learn the best trade skills. It will enhance the prestige of technical education. We should value trade training as highly as any other form of post-secondary education. At a time when we have low unemployment we will help meet immediate labour shortages by increasing our skilled migration intake by 20,000 places in 2005-06 to 97,500. Business will be supported in identifying their needs for skilled migration, and identifying those who can provide it. Along with our $5 billion investment through the vocational education and training agreements, these initiatives represent a comprehensive approach to meeting Australia's skills needs now and into the future. A sustainable first-class health system The Australian Government is budgeting to spend $45 billion on health and aged care in 2005-06 compared to $20 billion in 199596. This funding includes Medicare rebates, the Medicare Safety Net, payments to the states for state hospitals, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Home and Community Care and aged care. As a result of scientific advance and the ageing of the population, no area of spending will grow faster than health in the coming decades. Our population is entitled to first-class health services. But we will only be able to afford them if we get health costs on a sustainable financial basis. Pharmaceutical and Medicare benefits Mr Speaker, Australians continue to have access to new improved drugs under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Over 70 new drugs have been listed since the last Budget, and access to a further 55 have been expanded. This Budget will continue special funding for the life-extending drug Herceptin to treat breast cancer-at a cost between $50,000 and $100,000 per patient per year. To sustain the affordability of new drugs the Government will ensure significant price reductions when the first new brand of an existing medicine is added to the PBS. At present no matter the cost of a prescription drug the price charged to a concession card holder is $4.60 and to general patients $28.60. Some of these pharmaceuticals cost hundreds of dollars, some cost thousands. After 52 scripts in a year the concession card holder is entitled to free scripts for the rest the year. Sometimes this has led to hoarding. So from 1 January 2006 the PBS Safety Net will increase by two scripts per year each year until 2009. For general patients, the Safety Net threshold increases will be the dollar equivalent of two prescriptions per year. Mr Speaker, the Government will also raise the Medicare Safety Net thresholds to the levels the Government originally proposed. Setting the thresholds at these levels will help ensure the sustainability of this important Government initiative. It is only under this Government that a Safety Net will exist at all, covering 80 per cent of out-of-pocket, out-of-hospital Medicare costs over the thresholds. The Medicare Safety Net is expected to pay over $1.1 billion in benefits over the next four years. Around 1.5 million Australians are expected to receive benefits in 2006. The Government has also made significant investments in Medicare which have made GP services more accessible and affordable, and sustained an increase in bulk-billing rates across the country. The Medicare rebate for GP services was increased to 100 per cent of the schedule fee on 1 January 2005 at a cost of $2.3 billion over five years. The changes I announce tonight ensure that future generations can continue to receive first-class health care services. Small steps taken today will help to put the health system on a sustainable basis for the future. Mr Speaker, in this Budget the Government is providing new investment to tackle two priority areas of health-cancer and dementia. Cancer Cancer is a cruel disease. We all know of someone who has it, or has died from it. It is the largest underlying cause of death in Australia. This Budget includes a major package to improve cancer care through bowel cancer screening, dedicated cancer research, training of cancer nurses, and increased funding for palliative care. However, the best way to beat cancer is to prevent it. Screening and prevention initiatives are therefore an important element of funding in this Budget. The Government will have a two-year campaign to raise national awareness of skin cancer and encourage action to prevent it. We all know that smoking causes cancer and heart disease. While smoking rates have declined in recent years, far too many young Australians continue to smoke-43,000 teenagers becoming regular smokers each year. Tonight I am announcing a new Youth Campaign, which will commit $25 million over four years to discourage young Australians from ever taking up smoking. Dementia Mr Speaker, this Budget makes dementia a National Health Priority. The $321 million package will enhance the quality of life of dementia sufferers and their carers. It includes 2000 new at home places dedicated to people with dementia, which will provide them with individually planned and coordinated nursing care and support services to help them remain living at home for longer, in familiar surroundings. As life expectancy increases, dementia will become more common. Accordingly the package will offer more opportunities for dementia-specific training for carers, community and residential care workers, and people working in services such as the police, transport and emergency services. Recognising the contribution of carers Carer Payment is available to a person on low income providing constant care for a person with a disability or a child with a found disability. Carer Allowance is available where a person provides daily care to a person with a disability. In recognition of the contribution these people make, tonight I announce as I did last Budget an additional $1,000 to be paid to 90,000 people who receive the Carer Payment and an additional $600 payment to 300,000 receiving the Carer Allowance. These are people helping those who cannot look after themselves. We value the work they do. They deserve this recognition. It will cost $317 million in this year. It will not affect the carer's social security entitlements and it is tax-free. Superannuation savings Mr Speaker, this Government is committed to providing Australians with greater choice and flexibility in their retirement incomes. Last year I announced a new scheme for lowand middle-income earners under which a Government co-contribution would be paid into superannuation to match an after tax dollar contribution from a person themselves. Last year I also announced a plan to reduce the superannuation surcharge for middleand upper-income earners. The surcharge was introduced in 1996 when Labor left a large Budget deficit. We have now paid off most of Labor's legacy. We have previously tried to reduce this surcharge but the Labor Party has blocked it in the Senate, so tonight I announce the complete abolition of the surcharge from contributions and termination payments made or received from 1 July 2005. This measure will save taxpayers $2.5 billion over the next four years. Investing for the future Mr Speaker, through prudent management proof the Budget the Government has been able to run a succession of Budget surpluses. This has allowed us to retire most of the $96 billion debt we inherited on coming to office. Australia's performance in reducing debt is the envy of many countries around the world. Our task now is to begin saving for the future to meet the costs of our ageing population. One way this saving will be done is through a Future Fund. It will begin to fund the liabilities we have already incurred but not yet made provision to pay for. Earnings will accumulate in this Fund and it will be safeguarded by legislation. Whilst the Fund will invest the money allocated to it, no Government will be able to draw money out of it until it is sufficient to meet all the funded liabilities to which it is dedicated. A statutory independent board will be created to manage the Fund. Funding transport links Mr Speaker, the availability, efficiency and cost effectiveness of infrastructure is crucial to our economy. Given the large distances between our major population centres, transport infrastructure is particularly crucial. It is an investment in our future. Accordingly, in last year's Budget. I announced AusLink, the national land transport infrastructure programme to upgrade Australia's road and rail transport systems. Since that Budget the Government has announced an additional $1.2 billion in funding, bringing the Government's total contribution to transport infrastructure to $12 billion between 2004-05 and 2008-09. Under AusLink the Government will spend $815 million on the Hume Highway, $765 million on the Pacific Highway, $546 million on the Bruce Highway, $186 million on the Geelong Bypass, $94 million on the Port River Expressway in South Australia, and $170 million on the Mandurah Bypass and Kwinana Freeway extension in Western Australia. We will also be committing $755 million to rail lines along the Eastern Seaboard in conjunction with the Australian Rail Track Corporation. The Roads to Recovery Programme will be continuing with $150 million over 5 years. And to minimise dangers on our roads, the Government will also provide $90 million to continue the Road Safety Blackspot Programme. Making business competitive Mr Speaker, we have a strong economy. Businesses are growing. As we go forward, we want our businesses un- to be as productive and competitive as they can be. And that means government-at all levels-should address impediments to business activity. Tonight I announce $1.8 billion of tax cuts to enhance the competitiveness of Australian business. From midnight tonight, the 3 per cent tariff on imported business inputs which do not have substitutes manufactured in Australia will be abolished. This will save business $1.3 billion over five years. And the Australian Government will continue to support business to get full relief from state government stamp duties and business taxes that were to be abolished by the GST. I also announce changes to the tax treatment of certain legitimate business costs which are currently not recognised under the law. These are so-called ‘blackhole' expenditures. These changes recognise pre-business expenses and encourage new investment. Personal tax cuts Australians deserve the lowest possible taxes consistent with responsible budget management and the provision of efficient government services. After we balance our budget, reduce Labor's debt, and fund our services we should reduce taxes as far as is prudent. Mr Speaker, tonight I announce further personal income tax cuts worth $21.7 billion over four years. These tax cuts will assist low-income earners, boost disposable incomes, reward participation and hard work. They are in addition to the $14.7 billion in income tax cuts provided in last year's Budget. From 1 July this year, the 17 per cent marginal tax rate will be cut to 15 per cent. The 42 per cent tax threshold will increase from $58,000 to $63,000 on 1 July this year and to $70,000 on 1 July next year. The 47 per cent threshold will increase from $70,000 to $95,000 on 1 July this year and increase again to $125,000 on 1 July next year. These changes ensure that more than 80 per cent of taxpayers face a top marginal income tax rate of 30 per cent or less over the forward estimates. And from 1 July 2006, the top marginal rate will apply to only 3 per cent of taxpayers. If the threshold for the top marginal rate had been indexed to inflation since 1996, on 1 July 2006 it would have stood below $64,000. Under the measures I announce tonight it will stand at $125,000. The cut in the lowest rate of tax benefits Seniors too through the Senior Australian Tax Offset. International engagement Mr Speaker, Australia's economic prosperity will be enhanced by the strength of the economies in our neighbourhood, and our effective integration and engagement with them. We want to reduce remaining barriers to trade, including through free trade agreements. We have signed the historic agreement with the United States and other agreements are in prospect. Mr Speaker, we have proven to be a good neighbour. Australians are a generous people. Australians responded in a typical spirit by opening their hearts and wallets to the victims of the Boxing Day tsunami. Many Australians were directly affected by it; we were all touched by the extent of human loss and devastation. The Australian Government also contributed to the relief effort. Our $1 billion aid contribution towards the economic and humanitarian rehabilitation of Indonesia is our single largest ever aid contribution. Our assistance goes beyond the immediate reconstruction needs of Indonesia. It represents a programme of long-term sustained cooperation and capacity building between our two countries. In light of these events, the Government will develop a Tsunami Warning System to provide 24-hour surveillance for accurate and early detection and warning in the event of a tsunami threatening either the west or east coast of Australia or South West Pacific nations. This measure will cost $68.9 million over the next four years. Our involvement in Indonesia is part of the Government's commitment to our near neighbours and region. We remain active in ongoing programmes to restore law and order in the Solomon Islands and to improve governance in Papua New Guinea. Funding of more than $840 million is committed for these purposes in this Budget. Beyond the region, we remain committed to the stabilisation and reconstruction of Iraq. This Budget provides $511 million over four years to continue Australia's contribution to this task. National security Mr Speaker, this year's Budget continues the Government's strong commitment to Australia's national security. The attack on Australia's Jakarta embassy in September last year highlighted the need to protect our representatives overseas. We will provide $522 million for protective security, including enhancements at Australia's overseas diplomatic missions. We are also committing funds to enhance border protection, including new technologies such as ePassports and biometrics, to help border authorities to verify travellers' identities quickly and reliably. We will also commit $239 million to strengthen Australia's intelligence capabilities, in areas such as counter-terrorism inves- tigations and language skills development Taking into account measures announced tonight, the Government will have committed $5.6 billion over the eight-year period from 2001-02 to improve security, both at home and in our region. Economic outlook Mr Speaker, the Australian economy is set to continue its impressive performance. The outlook is for solid economic growth, low unemployment and moderate inflation. In year-average terms, GDP growth is expected to be 3 per cent in 2005-06, after passing through a period of more modest growth in 2004-05. The rebalancing of economic growth from domestic to external sources is expected to continue. World demand for mineral exports has increased prices and delivered higher incomes to Australians. Significant investment by mining companies and strong world demand is expected to substantially boost export growth in 2005-06. The unemployment rate is forecast to remain around its 28-year low. This strong economic performance is not an accident. It requires sound management and a commitment to ongoing reform. It requires businesses and consumers that are confident about Australia's future. And it requires prudent policies that lock in our achievements for future generations. Conclusion This Budget is about sharing the benefits of strong economic management not just with more Australians, but with all Australians. It is about:- increasing participation in the work force; - increasing and building skills; - rewarding effort; enhancing security; and - funding the future for Australians. I commend the bill to the House. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Debate (on motion by Mr Beazley) adjourned. BUDGET DOCUMENTS 2005-06",77

Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2004-05 provides additional funding for agencies to meet: - expenses in relation to grants to the states under section 96 of the Constitution and for payments to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory; and - non-operating requirements in the form of departmental equity injections.

NA Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 (2005)",87
103,Dr STONE,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration) (8.15 pm)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposal No. 2 (2005) The tariff proposal that I have just tabled contains alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that will remove the three per cent tariff applying to ‘business inputs' that are the subject of a tariff concession order. A tariff concession order provides concessional tariff rates for imported goods when there are no substitutable domestically produced goods. Goods subject to a tariff concession order, which are known as ‘business inputs', attract a tariff rate of three per cent. The government's removal of that three per cent tariff will align the treatment of ‘business inputs' that are the subject of a tariff concession order with the duty-free treatment already provided to consumption goods that are also the subject of a tariff concession order. This change will reduce business input costs, increase the international competitiveness of Australian business, and encourage investment in efficient and sustainable industries. The measure will be effective on and from 11 May 2005. Debate (on motion by Mr Sercombe) adjourned. House adjourned at 8.17 pm NA The following notices were given: DR NELSON to present a Bill for an Act to introduce business, industry and community leadership in the flexible provision of skills training education for young Australians through granting financial assistance for establishing and operating Australian Technical Colleges, and for related purposes.
