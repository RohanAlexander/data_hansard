3,Mr SPEAKER,AND FORMER SENATORS,"I thank the House. NA Hansard 1990 (SECOND PERIOD) Representatives passed on 1 June 1990, the House of NA  Speaker, I raise a matter of privilege that is based on an article written by a Tom Burton. It appeared at page 35 of the Sydney Morning Herald dated Saturday, 14 July 1990, and I produce a copy of the newspaper, together with an extract from that newspaper which I trust will be authorised as a legitimate extract from the newspaper and the newspaper returned to the library. The Sydney Morning Herald of that date was printed and published by John Fairfax Group Pty Ltd of Jones Street, Broadway. I am advised that the editor as at 14 July 1990 was a Max Prisk. The article is entitled 'The murder story that won't go to press'. Its first two paragraphs read: For quite some time. I have been sitting on a about a (Federal) Cabinet minister, one of Mr Bigs of business, and what looks and like a very grubby murder. I have spoken to various witnesses but none, understandably, is keen to be named, let alone prepared to go to court to testify to the veracity of their claims. Documents corroborate some of claims, but almost all are hearsay. Unfortunately, because of Australia's defamation laws, the story remains privy to me. Mr Speaker, I am raising this matter at the ,earliest opportunity. After all, this is the first sitting of the House since Mr Burton's allegations were published.. I cannot of course, vouch for the. veracIty of the - llegations-nor could many, if not all in this House-but they are extremely se;ious allegations. Prior to the enactment of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 they would by precedent no <;loubt have constituted a contempt of ParlIament and a breach of parliamentary privilege. 1!1 this respect, numerous precedents of thIS nature are referred to in chapter 19 of House of Representatives Practice by Mr Browning and in chapter 10 of the English text Parliamentary Practice by Erskine May. The precedent is clearly established on page 145 of Erskine May: Reflections upon Members, the parti?ula- i-­ dividuals not being named or otherwise mdlcated, are equivalent to reflections on the House. This passage succinctly expresses the issue involved here. I have discussed the matter with the Clerks, who are of the view that section 6 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act may mean that allegations of this type would not now, following the enactment, be treated as a contempt. With very great respect, I disagree. Subsection (6) says: Words or acts shall not be taken to be an offence against a House by reason only that those wor.ds or acts are defamatory or critical of the Parhament, a House, a committee or a member. In other words, if the allegations are only defamatory or critical, there is no contempt for the purposes of that Act. I might also add that at common law these comments would not give rise to a cause of action for defamation for the simple reason that the words used do not even in a constructive sense identify any particular person. I submit to you, Mr Speaker, that the allegations are of such a serious nature as to be more than merely defamatory or critical and therefore warrant investigation by the Committee of Privileges. Apart from Mr Burton's first paragraph, in which he alleges that he knows, inter alia, 'a story about a Federal Cabinet Minister and what looks like a very grubby murder' in his second paragraph he writes that' he had spoken to various witnesses. I assume that those witnesses are not the alleged Federal· Cabinet Minister or the alleged ' Mr Big' and therefore he must mean other persons. He writes - hat these various witnesses had made claIms about this alleged murder and the supposed involvement of a Federal Cabinet Minister but that they would not go to court to testify to the veracity of their claims. Mr Burton also writes that there are in existence documents which 'corroborate some of these claims'. The words used by Mr Burton leave it squarely open to the clear interpretation that these witn-sses claim that the Minister ei ther commItted a murder was an accessory to a murder, or was in-olved in a conspiracy to a n;turder. Allegations such as these are certamly not mere criticisms and therefore under the ambit of the section to which I referred; they are allegations of crimes of the highest order. I submit that section 6 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act does not preclu<;le the referral of this matter to the CommIttee. The allegations are far more than defamation and criticism because, firstly, they are allegations relating to one or more serious crimes of the highest order. Secondly they are such that, if proven, they would lead to the disqualification from the Parliament, among other thing.s, of the alleged Minister involved. ThIrdly, they clearly amount to a reflection, not a mere criticism. It is surely nonsense to suggest that an allegation that a Minister was involved in a very grubby murder amounts to no more than mere criticism. In other words, the allegations are a - lur of the most serious nature upon Cab met Ministers and therefore this House. The words of section 6 of the Act make it clear that that section is to have limited operation. This is apparent from the words appearing in that section-'by reason only'. I consulted the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. It is silent on the intended width of the section. I submit to you Mr Speaker, if you consider this matter,' that the Act cannot tie the hands of this Parliament in such matters by reas0!1 of the force of section 49 of the ConstItution. For the reasons I have explained these allegations add up to far more than defamatory or simply critical comments. These allegations, while they remain unanswered, taint, blacken and besmear all members of the Cabinet. Before moving the motion I just add that it also seems to me that the allegations are either a figment of the imagination, a beat-up based on gossip, or true. The seriousness of the allegations means that they cannot go unanswered. The matter has to be clarified by appropriate investigation. I should add also that upon the inforjoint mation available there could be a suggesrian tion that the common law offence of misprision of a felony or the statutory offence of an accessory after the fact been committed. This reinforces the genthe eral point that I am making-that the allegations are of such enormity House should and must take action to ensure that this reflection is cleared one way or the other. Rather than moving motion I would ask you, Mr Speaker, to take away the matter that I have put before you and consider the matters that I have referred to in this outline.",9
4,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the honourmembers able member for Kooyong. My underEast, standing of section 6 of the' Act is that the changes made were to strike out general slurs against members of parliament as a class and substitute slurs against able individuals. But the honourable member for Kooyong has raised a number of combers plex issues. I will consider the matter report back to the House when it is propriate. NA",11
5,Mr HAWKE,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"I inform the House, as a matter of courtesy, that the Treasurer will be absent from Question Time today due to his ungether derstandable involvement in the Budget process. Questions normally addressed the Treasurer should be addressed to Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, except if there are any questions in regard to the Prices Surveillance Authority, which will be handled by Mr Crean. NA NA",11
6,Dr HEWSON,PYRAMID BUILDING SOCIETY,"I remind the Prime Minister that since this Parliament last met 220,000 investors in the Pyramid Building Society have had their money frozen, in many cases their life savings, and will now have to be baled out by the Victorian taxpayers at an unknown final cost. I refer the Prime Minister to the press statement issued by the VictoTreasurer and the Attorney-General on 13 February 1990 stating that deposits in the Pyramid Building Society were sehas cure. Was the Government informed of financial difficulties of Pyramid prior to 13 February 1990 and did the Government receive prior notice that this press that this statement. was to be made?",11
7,Mr HAWKE,PYRAMID BUILDING SOCIETY,"To the best of my knowledge, the answer to both parts of a the question is in the negative. ' MIDDLE EAST: TRADE",11
8,Mr LINDSAY,PYRAMID BUILDING SOCIETY,Can the Minister for Trade Negotiations inform honourable what action has been taken to increase Australia's trade with the Middle particularly in view of the loss of export earnings which will result from the the imposition of sanctions against Iraq?,11
9,Dr BLEWEIT,PYRAMID BUILDING SOCIETY,"I thank the honourmember for Herbert fochis question. I am confident, of course, that all memof this House support Australia's imand position of comprehensive economic apsanctions again Iraq in line. with the United Nations Security Council decision of 6 August. We need to recognise that one result is that as Australia is a signifitrading partner of Iraq it will forgo substantial export earnings, particularly in the area of wheat. Thus it is imperative that the Government and industry to take every possible effort to open up new and expanded trade opportunities to and find new markets for Australia, parthe ticularly in the Middle East itself. The trade delegation I led to Iran two weeks ago is an excellent example of the kind of cooperative effort between business and government needed to explore such opportunities. This delegation of was the first joint Australian-Iranian commission since the Iranian revolution and was the largest trade delegation we have yet taken to the Middle East. At close of the meeting Australia and Iran had initialled a new trade agreement prothe viding· a framework for the conduct of future bilateral trade between countries. We are able to announce that Australian businesses had, around those trade negotiations, negotiated agreements which would increase our annual export earnings by at least $100m. The Australian Wheat Board signed new contracts for the sale of another 225,000 tonnes of wheat, which makes Iran now our largest export market for wheat. New contracts were negotiated for the supply Energy. of 24,000 tonnes of mutton and we expect to double our 1991 coal exports to Iran to 800,000 tonnes. Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd signed a contract for sion of consultancy and feasibility services for the Sangan iron ore deposit developadult ment project in north-east Iran. Following those consultancies, if they are successful, are prospects of further investment project. Significant progress was also made negotiating an agreement potentially worth $400m for provision by the Australian sugar industry of assistance to develop Iranian sugar industry, and I know that will be of special interest to the honourand able member for Herbert. I am optimistic that further trade benefits. will flow the trade commission and we will contions tinue to explore similar opportunities bilateral trade increases in the Middle East. Finally, I would like to express sympashowed thy to the family of one invited member of the Australian trade delegation to Iran who visited Kuwait en route to Teheran and has been unable to leave there the Gulf crisis broke. Our thoughts are with him, his family and his friends of course, they are with every Australian caught in this terrible crisis. NA",11
10,Mr TIM FISCHER,ENERGY RESOURCES,"I refer the ister for Resources to his claim that tr-lia is a net exporter of energy. To what 37 extent does that claim include uranium trade energy? When will the Government abolish its three-mine-now two-mine-pol. icy restricting uranium mining? Finally, the to what extent does that claim rely on Australia maintaining its coal exports in face of a downturn in the world economy which may well arise as a result of our two the Middle East crisis?",12
11,Mr GRIFFITHS,ENERGY RESOURCES,"I thank the Leader of the National Party of Australia for his question. I note the Prime Minister has proposed some reforms to Question Time, but I do not believe that they extend to directing questions to the wrong Minister. In fact uranium policy, as the National Party Leader is well aware, is a matter for the Minister for Primary Industries and NA  proviployment, Education and Training whether he has seen recent reports about illiteracy in the Australian community. Can the Minister advise the House whether there are any lessons for Austrain that lian schools' curricula?",12
12,Mr DAWKINS,ADULT ILLITERACY,"I thank the honouron able member for his question. There have been recent reports on adult illiteracy which have highlighted problems being the experienced by perhaps as many as - ne million Australian adults, of both Enghsh non-English speaking backgrounds, but at the same time there have been from some quite nonsensical misrepresentaof these suggestions. Indeed, one for suggestion was that one million Australians could not sign their name- The research undertaken by Ms Rosie Wickert that this is quite untrue. In fact, it showed that of those who attempted to sign their name, 98 per cent could do so, and that is without including the right since honourable member for New England, whose inclusion would take the figure to as, about 101 per cent, I suppose. Similarly misleading allegations have been made about school education. Indeed, the shadow Minister for employMinment education and training, the Aushono-rable member for Goldstein, has claimed that Australia's literacy levels are evidence that the Australian schools system is in fact failing.",12
13,Mr SINCLAIR,ADULT ILLITERACY,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask the honourable gentleman to withdraw an imputation that he included in his remarks which gives little credit to him and reflects, I would say very much, against the whole of the Labor Party. I take offence at the remarks and request their withdrawal.",13
14,Mr SPEAKER,ADULT ILLITERACY,"If the Minister was reflecting upon the right honourable member for New England, he should withdraw the remarks.",13
15,Mr DAWKINS,ADULT ILLITERACY,"If he takes offence, I withdraw the remarks. I was only suggesting that h- could sign his name. Mr Fife- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I ask that you call on the Minister to withdraw unreservedly.",13
16,Mr SPEAKER,ADULT ILLITERACY,The Minister did withdraw unreservedly. The Minister is now answering the question. Mr Fife-On the point of order: the Minister went on to offend by repeating what he said.,13
17,Mr SPEAKER,ADULT ILLITERACY,"I called upon the Minister to withdraw. The Minister withdrew equivocally. I asked him to withdraw unequivocally, and he did. He then continued to answer the question. The Minister has withdrawn the remarks, and is now answering the question.",13
18,Mr DAWKINS,ADULT ILLITERACY,They are very touchy today.,13
19,Mr SPEAKER,ADULT ILLITERACY,The Minister might get on with answering the question.,13
20,Mr DAWKINS,ADULT ILLITERACY,"I will, Mr Speaker, because I want to deal with the suggestion of the honourable member for Goldstein, one of his increasingly hysterical remarks, that these suggestions about adult illiteracy in Australia are evidence of a failing schools system. In fact, what all of the evidence shows is that the longer one stays at school, the less likely it is that one will suffer problems of illiteracy. Indeed, the groups which are most likely-Dr Bob Woods-Wow! How long did you stay?",13
21,Mr DAWKINS,ADULT ILLITERACY,"But the honourable member for Goldstein seems to suggest that the longer one stays at school, the worse will be the problems in relation to literacy. What Rosie Wickert's study shows is that the groups which have the greatest illiteracy are those who are over 55-that is, those who were at school, if at all, a long time ago, not recently-and those who have had six years schooling or less. Indeed, what we know is that schooling is a positive factor in terms of improving children's literacy-or anyone else's, for that matter. But, of course, the Opposition is falling into its old habit of knocking the education system, knocking the school system, and, particularly, knocking those who do such an enormous job of working within the Australian education system, which is one of the finest in the world. We have seen enormous improvements in the Australian school system in recent times. Commonwealth expenditure has increased five-fold over the last 15 years. Year 12 retention rates have almost doubled in eight years. The standards reached by Australian students in schools today outstrip the achievements of students just a generation ago. If honourable members opposite want further evidence of the important achievements of the Australian school system, I can advise that we have just sent three teams to participate in olympiads in mathematics, chemistry and physics. I am delighted to be able to tell the House that the Australian team in the mathematics olympiad won two silver medals and four bronze medals and another four bronze medals were won in chemistry and physics. I think it is about time that the Opposition recognised the important achievements of the school system and of the many excellent students in Australia, rather than continuing to knock the system. The Government is intent on further improving the quality of Australian schooling and it is for that reason that we are in the process of establishing a national project on the quality of teaching, a project which has now been supported by the major proposed participants, that is, teachers and state and non-government school systems. Adult literacy is an important question, particularly in the context of award resystems structuring and. the need to improve the skills of the work force. It is an issue which has to be addressed by unions, emto ployers, State governments and the Fedform eral Government. Within the next couple of weeks or so I intend to make a general protect itself. statement about the issues of language and literacy. It will not help if knockers on the other side of the House ignore the complexities of this issue and look for facile explanations in an attempt to furcredit ther denigrate the school system. What we do know is that low levels schooling, low levels of skill generally, levels of health and other indicators poverty are also indicators of low levels of literacy amongst adult Australians, as has been revealed by another important piece of research on this issue. I ask Opposition and the shadow Minister to force. join with the Government as we attempt to deal with this serious problem which afflicts a large number of adults in Australia. What they need is our assistance, not our denigration. MIDDLE EAST: AUSTRALIAN NA",13
22,Mr MACK,NAVAL FORCE,"I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. Is it a fact that the Australian frigates despatched to the Persian Gulf are not equipped for the type of tions likely to be required of them? Is it a fact that the missile decoy systems fitted to the frigates are not adequate to counter agree with you? Anglo-French Exocet and French-Italian Otomat missiles used by Iraq? Further, it a fact that the Australian frigates could terjecting. be equipped with effective missile defence at short notice?",14
23,Mr BILNEY,NAVAL FORCE,"The force which has· too been sent to the Gulf is a very capable force. It is not to be assumed that it will be operating in isolation. Whilst the ious operational arrangements remain be worked out with the other contributors to the force, it is certainly not the case that we are despatching those frigates without some form of extra cover to that which they have at the moment. I do not think it would be wise of me to go into chapter and verse about what those ships can deploy, but in the case of the support vessel, HMAS Success, the Government has already taken steps provide it with additional cover in the of the RBS-70, a very capable system which will enhance its capability to In relation to the other two matters, I think the best way of putting this is to say that they are extremely well trained crews. They have taken part with great recently in exercises to test the very equipment that the honourable member of refers to. The upgrading of that equiplow ment is proceeding apace as they go toof wards the operational zone. They leave Fremantle in just over 24 hours and by the time they get there, their capabilities to defend themselves, already great, will the be even further enhanced as part of that NA",14
24,Mr JOHNS,ANTARCTICA,"Can the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories explain what actions the Government is taking to protect the Antarctic environment?",14
25,Mrs KELLY,ANTARCTICA,The Government is totally committed to achieving a ban on all mining and related activities in the Antarctic and I would hope that the Opposition would join us in that call for a ban operaon all mining in the Antarctic.,14
26,Mr HOWARD,ANTARCTICA,Is that so? Does Griffiths,14
27,Mr SPEAKER,ANTARCTICA,Order! The ho-our­ is able member for Bennelong will cease in,14
28,Mrs KELLY,ANTARCTICA,"We consider that the Antarctic environment is too fragile and important for scientific research to be put at any risk at all. The Government believes that the best means of achieving varan effective ban on mining is through a to binding and comprehensive protection agreement, and it is only through such an agreement that Antarctica can be totally protected. Therefore, following agreement between France and Australia, we will be putting a joint pr,?posal to a spe-ial arctic treaty meetmg to be held m ChI.le later this year. That proposal we hope will be successful and, over the last 12 months, we have achieved quite significant progress by getting the support of other treaty partners. Nevertheless, we recognise that it may take some time to negotiate an effective ban. Therefore, Australia believes that it should take action itself. Last week, Senator Evans and I announced that we will introduce legislation into this Parliament which would ban mining in the Antarctic territory, plus the adjacent continental shelf. It will ban Australians elsewhere in Antarctica from any mining at all. We believe that this will ensure that there is no mining in our area of Antarctica. We are convinced that the proposed legislation will effectively prevent mining and all related activities in almost half Antarctica, and I emphasise that this is the sole aim of the legislation. This landmark legislation demonstrates that the Hawke Labor Government is committed to fully protecting the Antarctic environment which we hold in trust for future generations. I would hope that the Opposition joins us in agreeing to this ban.",14

33,Mr RONALDSON,OIL PRICES,I refer the Prime Minister to the statement by the Minister for Resources on Sunday that a sustained increase in the oil price would hit Australia very quickly and adversely. I ask the Prime Minister: What additional effect would this have on unemployment and inflation in Australia over and above AI?t- the increases which would have occurred anyway as a result of the Government's disastrous policies?,15
34,Mr HAWKE,OIL PRICES,"Mr Speaker, let me briefly make some background comments which I think are relevant to the honourable member's question, and then go to what he asks specifically. I think it is appropriate that we all understand-I know that all honourable members opposite do-that, in taking the decision that we have as a government and that I thankfully see has the wholehearted support of the Opposition, and I appreciate that, we are going to pay an economic price. But, across the House, we believe it is a price that is appropriate to be paid. With respect to the particular part of the question concerning the impact of variations in oil prices, I make this backof ground comment: the estimate of the loss to the world community from the phasing down of supplies from Kuwait and Iraq, in round terms, is about four billion barrels a day. There are two facts which are relevant to consider in relation to that loss. Firstly, at the time of this crisis emerging at the beginning of this month, fortunately, the stocks held by the rest of the world were at near record levels. It is estimated that those stocks could be run down by approximately one million barrels a day and there would still be a relatively comfortable stock buffer. On that basis, there would need to be an additional production of the order of three billion barrels a day-Mr MCGauran-Three million, not three billion.",15
35,Mr HAWKE,OIL PRICES,"Three million barrels per day, to make up for that shortfall. There are indications, of which I am sure the honourable member is aware, that that is quite capable of being achieved both within Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC countries. I make the point that in the absence of any further deterioration· in the situation, it is not beyond the realms of possibility that the four million barrels a day can be made up. This uncertainty, of course, has been reflected in what has happened with oil prices. Immediately prior to 2 August, when Iraq invaded Kuwait-and we express these things, as is known, in United· States dollar terms-the price of oil was approximately $US20 per barrel. It jumped and, at one point, peaked at about $US30 a barrel; it has subsequently gone back and is now in the area of $US26. That indicates the extreme volatility of this situation, but it is our hope that the additional production will be forthcoming and, together with the run-down of stocks, that will have the impact of the level.of oil prices not going significantly and unsustainably above the pre-existing level of $US20 a barrel. I make two further points in response to the honourable gentleman's question. As far as Australia is concerned, it is the case that in net terms we are, to the tune of several billion dollars, a net exporter of energy. In that sense it could be argued that in overall economic terms there could be an advantage to Australia. Of course, the real problem for Australia would be that if there were a continuing and significantly higher level of oil prices that - ould adversely affect the level of econ-mlc activity in other countries. That, m turn, could impact upon the demand for our commodities and generate an adverse impact here. I am encouraged by the fact that, as I understand it, we have the wholehearted support of the Opposition for what we have done. I simply give the honourable member and the House the guarantee that, fortified by that support, we will, as a government, responsibly try to m-ke every appropriate decision-not only m regard to the crisis itself, but also in regard to responsible economic management-calculated to minimise any possible impact upon the level of activity in this country. NA Mr O'Neil proceeding to address a question to the Minister for Land Transport-",15
36,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"Order! The honourable member for Grey has just put the Chair in a difficult position, in that to ask a Minister a question requiring him t.o outline the policy of the Government IS out of order. Australian National is a statutory authority. The honourable member for Grey might wish to recast his question. NA",16
37,Mr MACKELLAR,MIDDLE EAST,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has the command structure of the multi-nation naval force in the Gulf yet been established? Will the Prime Minister assure the House that Australia's contribution to that force will not enter the zone of interdiction, or the operational area, until Australia has agreed to the command structure and the consequent rules of engagement?",16
38,Mr HAWKE,MIDDLE EAST,"I thank the honourable member for Warringah for his question and make these points in reply. As far as the Australian naval forces are concerned, at this point, following discu-sion with our friends in not only the Umted States of America but also other states, there is understanding and agreement that the role of the Australian ships will be limited to identification, contact, interrogation a-d warning. That is understood. In the dIScussions that have been going on there are four areas which conceptually are being identified: the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Oman the Indian Ocean approaches and the Red Sea area. I say directly to the honourable member that it appears that it is regarded as most appropriate and the most useful involvement of our forces-that is, the two frigates with the supply ship being further out-that they be in the Gulf of Oman area. Within the next few days there will be a meeting at a location which has not as yet been definitely determined at which the representatives of the various naval forces will work out the best way to coordinate the roles of these forces. I have publicly indicated that t-ere will be n.o upgrading. Indeed, at thIS stage th-re IS no request before us for an u-gradmg ?f the Australian role. I have saId that, m the circumstance of any request for an upgrading of that role, that w-uld require a further decision by the Cab met. I have indicated that were we to m-ke such a decision I would undertake wIde consultation. I indicate, throl!-h the honourable member, to the OpposItion g-nerally that I would regard it as appropnate to have consultations with the Lea-ler of the Opposition were we to consIder any such upgrading. Mr MACKellar-What about the rules of engagement?",16
39,Mr HAWKE,MIDDLE EAST,"Rules of engagement are still being finalised. At the time. I made - t clear that we were in the fortunate P-SI­ tion of being so far away-the steammg time was about 22 days-that we had a considerable period in which this could be done. There is complete satisfaction within the Navy as to the time being taken about this. I can assure the honourable member-I know what his main concern would be-that by the time our ships reach the area of potential danger and where they will be operating these rules of engagement will be firmly finalised. We will also have had the opportunity of these discussions with other nations-there are now a number of them-which have forces engaged there. So our own rules of engagement will be clear. Very importantly, the nature of the relationship with the other forces will be clarified so that there will be the possibility of maximising both the effectiveness of our contribution and, of course, the safety of that operation in terms of what is potentially a gerous situation viz-a-viz not only Iraq but also the ships of a number of nations operating in a relatively confined area. NA",17
40,Mr ONEIL,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"Mr Speaker, this is a very important subject; so I am glad that you have given me two goes at it. Thanks very much indeed. The Minister for Land Transport would be well aware of the huge problems with the Australian National passenger rail services and of the concerns not only of the workers but also of their families. Will the Minister advise us of the future of Australian National (AN) passenger rail services in South Australia?",17
41,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,I hope the Minister will not announce policy.,17
42,Mr ROBERT BROWN,AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,"I think that all honourable members on both sides of the House are aware of the fact that a very significant proportion of the constituency of the honourable member for Grey is intimately involved with the rail industry. The question is deserving of a little more consideration from the Opposition than it is currently giving it. I appreciate the fact that the question has been asked by the honourable member for Grey. People who are familiar with the nature of intra-regional passenger services in South Australia know that essentially three services are being operated by Australian National. The honourable member for Grey is more directly concerned with the Iron Triangle service around to Whyalla from Adelaide. Another service is the Blue Lake service from Adelaide to Mount Gambier and the third one is the Silver City service, from Adelaide to Broken Hill. Recently a submission was put to us from AN suggesting that those three services should be closed, and we are in the process of giving consideration to that. I want to assure honourable members that no decision has been made. We have to take into consideration the circumstances surrounding the operation of those three services. The fact is that of the cost of OlJerating those services less than 20 per cent-17 point something per cent-is recovered. The present occupancy of those three services averages dan- about 50 per cent. Were we to fill them completely, we would still only' recoyer about 35 per cent of the cost of operatmg them. It becomes perfectly clear that in circumstances where we are offering services to passengers and they choose not to use them, we' must consider whether we are justified in continuing those services. The total revenue obtained from the three services is $l.4m, the total operating cost about $7.8m. We would discuss any proposals for the closure of those services with people who might be, and are, concerned about it. I appreciate the interest that has been shown by the, honourable member for Grey, who has attempted to keep in touch with the developments all the way along the line. I assure him that I will continue to keep him informed about it. There is also some question about those services which operated before their transfer to AN in 1975. If there is any need on our part to consult with the South Australian Government, we will do that. There is a problem if we are to continue to operate them. For example, we will have to replace about 10 of the Budd cars, the passenger cars, that operate on those services. Each of them costs about $2m, so it would cost about $20m to replace them. If we replaced them, the deficit would be increased because we would be additionally responsible for the interest charged on that amount. I will keep the honourable member for Grey informed. I understand his concern and I will make sure that any developments are brought to his attention. NA",17
43,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,WOOL,"Does the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy intend to amend the relevant legislation or authorise the Australian Wool Corporation to make a compensation payment to those wool growers who normally would have sold their wool prior to 30 June fleet? 1990 but who, due to unprecedented flood rains, were unable to do so and were, therefore, subjected to a higher wool tax and a lower minimum reserve price?",18
44,Mr KERIN,WOOL,"A lot of effort was made by the wool industry to enable all growers who wanted to do so to market their wool before the new floor price and of tuna. the wool tax rates became effective on 1 July. Among those efforts was the holding of that special wool sale on 29 June. As far as we can make out, about 144 wooltuna growers in New South Wales and Queenslian land-mainly Queensland-were unable further because of the floods to carry out shearing and market their wool in May and June as they would normally do. About 11,500 bales are involved, as far as we can estihigh mate. The Wool Corporation has examined ways of providing financial assistance these people by applying the previous tax and price levels. It is unable to do so under present provisions of the Wool Marketing Act. I have given quite a lot of consideration to this. There has been a lot of correspondence between the Wool Corporation and me and, recognising the unique coincidence of the floods, the lower floor price and a higher wool tax, I have sought the Prime Minister's agreement to the introduction of an amendment to the Act. The amendment will be restricted to flood-affected wool. We have to be very careful that we do not open this for other events because this was a unique and very specific incident. I do not consider it appropriate for a commercial marketing body to have the ability to make special payments on an ongoing basis. I expect the amendment to the Act to be made in this parliamentary sitting. NA",18
45,Mrs CROSIO,JAPANESE TUNA FLEET,Can the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy inform the House of any details about the recent incidents involving Japanese tuna fishing vessels and how these incidents will be dealt with in consideration of the access to Australian waters by the Japanese tuna,18
46,Mr KERIN,JAPANESE TUNA FLEET,"I thank the honourable member for Prospect for this question. I had no idea that she was so interested in tuna. I suspect that the honourable member for Grey put her up to it because he the and the honourable member for Eden Monaro make my life miserable because As the honourable member for Prospect says, there have been two recent incidents involving apparent under-reporting of the catch by Japanese vessels in Austrawaters. I am not prepared to give substantive detail about those assertions at this time because they are presently before the courts. However, I am willing to say that the cases show the level of surveillance that we apply to foreign interests fishing in our waters. Our requirements for catch reporting and the to arrangements for monitoring and surveillance of Japanese vessels fishing in our zone will be ainended because of the two cases that the honourable member referred to. Our relationship with the Japanese is crucial to the successful global management of southern bluefin tuna which, as honourable members will know, is a very valuable resource which has been under threat of commercial extinction due to over-fishing in earlier times. It is a migratory species and we have to enter into bilateral and trilateral negotiations order to try to manage this resource. Australian and Japanese scientists and fisheries managers have not always agreed on the amount of restraint needed. But it is quite clear that we must be able to have confidence that the global quotas agreed to by Australia, Japan and New Zealand are being adhered to. That is why any under-reporting of catch is extremely serious and could threaten the eventual survival of the fishery. I have been in contact with Japanese authorities regarding the assertions about these two vessels. We are working hard to establish the facts and to ensure. that all of their people are aware of the importance of providing accurate catch reports. The opening of this year's bilateral negotiations for access by Japanese tuna vessels to the Australian fishing zone has recently taken place. I am confident that, whatever the outcome of the two cases before the courts, we will achieve an agreement which will protect the status of the southern bluefin tuna resource and thus protect' the industry and our national interests which are affected by that resource.

47,Mr CHARLES,MASTER BUILDERS ASSOCIATION,I ask the Minister for Science and Technology to explain to this Parliament how he can justify his ideologically based snub of the Master Builders Association in backing out of a commitment to open its major conference in June because he had to share the platform with a speaker who holds views on industrial relations which are different from his own.,19
48,Mr CREAN,MASTER BUILDERS ASSOCIATION,"I am not too sure what this question has to do with science and technology, but let me say to the honourable member, in case he does. not know, that I am consistent. When the Master Builders Association contacted meand asked me to open its conference, I agreed on the basis that I understood that there would be some input from my ministerial portfolio perspective, relating to the housing and construction industry, on the ishighly sue of how we were skilling the work force, how we were using award restrucin turing to improve efficiencies in the work force and how the industry was to work more cooperatively with the trade union movement. About' a week before. this conference was to take place, I was contacted by the Master Builders Association. Its representatives said, 'There mIght be some embarrassment for you because-we did not tell you this-we have someone coming along from the United States who happens to have a reputation for smashing unions, not consulting them'. I said to them, 'That puts me in a very difficult position. Thanks very much for not telling me'. In any event, I said, 'Tell me who else you have speaking at this conference on industrial relations and positive practices'. Not one person from the trade union movement was invited to address that conference. I might say that I am not of the trade union movement, whatever one might like to think, currently.

50,Mr CREAN,MASTER BUILDERS ASSOCIATION,"The point is that if that mob wants to score points, it can. I have indicated in no uncertain terms to those people that I do not appreciate the. circumstances in which they put me. I have indicated that I am not going to hold this against the industry; indeed, I .have had many amicable discussions with the Housing Industry Association and with others in the building industry. I have indicated also that I am prepared to speak with the president and the executive officer of that association and to go through my concerns. I make the further point that after my discussions with the organisations,. they accepted' the difficult position that I was put in. Both sides accepted that that was not desirable. They understood my position and accepted it. In those circumstances, I do not believe that those who leaked news of the situation had the best of motives in terms of fostering future relations. But I am prepared to work with the industry because I think that it has a constructive role to play. One can look at what the building industry unions have done to improve the industry's efficiency, through cooperation-",19

55,Mr CREAN,MASTER BUILDERS ASSOCIATION,"The difficulty with Opposition members is that they want to ask questions but they do not want to be informed. The Master Builders Association is an important part of the building industry. If its members have a proper understanding of the issues that need to be addressed, I do not see how they can ignore a positive, responsible relationship with the trade union movement. It was absolute stupidity on their part to invite, as the sole speaker on industrial relations, someone from the United States of America who has no understanding of industrial relations in this country, but no-one from the trade union movement. I should also indicate for those who are interested that, during my term as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, there was an international request-it was not just an ACTU perspective-from the international trade union movement, including that of the Soviet Union, which said that this mob who had been invited was not an appropriate group to try to improve industrial relations in this country. I would say against that background that the only people who are out of step are the members of the Master Builders Association-not me and not the trade union movement, which has carried on a constructive relationship with that industry.

57,Mr JOHN SCOTT,MACHINES,My question is directed to the Minister for Transport and Communications. Is the Minister aware of persistent reports that poker machines are to be installed at Adelaide Airport? Can the Minister advise the House of the correct position?,20
58,Mr BEAZLEY,MACHINES,"I agree with the honourable member that it can certainly be characterised as such. The Federal Airports Corporation now has complete commercial control over activities at the airports and it is required to have concern for what is the state of legality of any particular enterprise in any particular State in which it operates. I understand that it is giving consideration to that particular proposal; when I last checked it had not concluded its deliberations. It is free to operate commercially wIthin the framework of the law that exists in any particular State. It has a charter from the Government which urges it to be profitable and to operate in an effective commercial way. So any views that it had in this regard no doubt would be to some extent dictated by that. I will, however, check into the detail of where that matter now stands and inform the honourable member of any conclusions that may have been reached. NA",20

60,Mr SPEAKER,CONDUCT OF QUESTION TIME,"I think the honourable member for O'Connor might recall that when we originally resumed after the election I indicated that the House is divided into' Government and non-Government members and I would call one side and then the other side. For the allocation of the call, members who are not members of the Government are all considered to be in that one category. To be specific for the honourable member for O'Connor, I will call the honourable member for North Sydney in a place that is allocated for the Opposition. AIDS: DRUG TREATMENT OPTIONS",20
61,Mr HOWE,CONDUCT OF QUESTION TIME,"Mr Speaker, I wish to correct part of the answer I gave to the House on 31 May 1990 in response to a question without notice from the honourable member for Lilley concerning the availability of the drug azidothymidine (AZT). On advice from my Department I informed the House that Wellcome Australia Ltd had not then submitted an applicfltion to the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee to widen the availjourned. ability of the drug. On 1 June 1990, after the House had risen, it was brought to my attention that such an application had been received on the morning of my answer. This application referred to Retrovir, the brand name used for the drug and not to AZT, which caused the delay in advising me of its arrival. Today's sitting journed. provides me with the first opportunity to advise the House of the correct situation. NA .

Mr Speaker, in moving this motion today I want to take this first opportunity available to me to inform the House of the view the Government has taken of the situation which has arisen in the Middle East over the past three weeks and of the measures we have adopted to' meet that situation. O- 2 August Iraq invaded Kuwait. That action has provoked one of the gravest international crises since the Second Worid War and it has challenged us to define the way in which the world community will cooperate in the years ahead. Over the past few years the frightening rigidities of the Cold War have dissolved and the threat of global war between the superpowers has receded. The task for all of us has been to construct a new world order which will guarantee that the end of the Cold War will bring an era of peace. That cannot be taken for granted. In the Cold War, regional conflicts were contained by the care that each superpower took to avoid confrontation with the other. But now, as the threat of global war recedes, the risk of major regional wars may, paradoxically, have increased. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is, tragically, clear proof of the new dangers which exist, just as those of the Cold War thank-:fully fade into history. Those dangers are not unique to the Middle East. Wherever we find big armies, national rivalries and reckless leaders we will find a risk of major war. It is not inconceivable that those conditions could emerge in the Asia-Pacific region in the coming years. We need, therefore, to work out how to manage these dangers wherever they may arise. In doing so we are casting back to the era before the Cold War began-those twilight years of optimism between the end of the Second World War and the fall of the Iron Curtain. We find ourselves looking again to the United Nations to uphold the rule of law as the principle of international relations over the rule of force. The Cold War often made the United Nations look impotent and irrelevant. As the Cold War fades the United Nations has moved back to the position its founders intended for it. In drafting the United Nations Charter the founders of the United Nations drew on their vivid and bitter experience of a world sliding into chaos-the failure of the League of Nations in Manchuria and Abyssinia, the appeasement of fascism in Europe and the catastrophe that followed. The world has changed a lot since 1945 but I think that the lessons of the 19308 which underpin the· United Nations Charter still hold true today: that international disputes must not be settled by force; that national borders must be respected; and that those who use force must not be permitted to prevail. Those lessons establish principles that engage our real t-ngible interests, not just our sense· of ng-t and wrong. The security and prospenty of the world and the security and prosperity of Australia will depend in the years ahead on the strength of those principles. The strength of those principles in the years ahead depends absolutely on the support we give them today. This is the broad framework within which the Government has considered Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and Australia's response. Within that framework Iraq's actions are cause for very deep concern. That concern arises from the nature of Iraq's leadership, from the capabilities of its armed forces and from the nature of the region itself. Iraq's Government has over many years proved that it is willing, and even eager, to use armed force to achieve its national goals. Those goals encompass nothing less than the domination of all its neighbours, Iranian as well as Arab, and the accumulation of greater and greater power at the expense of them. Any who doubt that analysis of Iraq's intentions should ask Iraq's neighbours themselves in the Gulf and in the Middle East generally. The Iraqi Government's ambition has. been matched by its ruthlessness, including to its own citizens. In the war with Iran it inflicted years of suffering and hundreds of thousands of casualties on the people of Iraq for a few miles of ground that it has now surrendered. In Kurdistan the Iraqi Government gassed its own people. The Government of Iraq is not only very ruthless and very ambitious but also very powerful. It has one of the largest armies in the world, well equipped and battle hardened, and a large air force. It has a large force of ballistic missiles, a massive chemical arsenal and a program to develop nuclear weapons within a few years. That power is based on oil. The Gulf remains the hub of the world oil market. Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia alone hold nearly half of the world's oil reserves. That is a very important aspect of this situation for two reasons. The first is that Iraq's power would increase dramatically if it could control Kuwait's oil assets and even more if it could control Saudi Arabia's. With increasing power would come increasing ambition, making Iraq even more dangerous than it is today. The second is that any nation which controlled the oil industries of Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia would be able to dictate oil prices. There can be no doubt what Iraq's pricing policy would be and there can be no doubt what that would mean for the world's economy and for Australia's. We may be a net energy exporter but we import oil. The markets for our exports depend absolutely critically on the economies of our customers. I do not intend to go into the merits of Iraq's grievwait, ances against Kuwait, nor of its claims to Kuwait's territory. They are irrelevant to the current case. No matter how strong those claims might be there can be no justification for asserting them by armed force. As I emphasised to the Iraqi Ambassador when he called on me yesterday, if Iraq does have grievances they should be addressed through proper internationally recognised and peaceful procedures. I turn now to review the steps taken by Australia and by the world community to meet the challenge posed by Iraq's actions. The Government has condemned the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in the most direct terms. The Opposition has done that also and I welcome that. I hope that this House, speaking as it does in a very special way for all Australians, will express its condemnation through the motion that we are proposing. The fact that the vast majority of Australians agree in condemning Iraq's invasion is important but how much mor{j important is it that governments and people all over the world have felt the same concern and have expressed the same condemnation? That vital consensus has been reflected in the United Nations where the Security Council has not only been able promptly and unanimously to pass resolutions condemning the invasion; it has also been able for the first time to go beyond that to adopt mandatory and comprehensive economic sanctions designed to compel an Iraqi withdrawal. Australia is committed to implementing those sanctions with full vigour. As I said, that will not be without cost. Iraq has been a major export market for Australia. But we have ho choice. Economic sanctions are an essential element of the international effort to restore peace and stability to the Middle East. The economic and security costs of shirking that responsibility are much greater than the cost of the sanctions themselves. But the sanctions will not do the job by themselves. They will act slowly but surely to force Iraq to give up Kuwait. In the short term there has been an urgent need to deter Iraq from taking even more territory. In the days after its invasion of KuIraq built up huge forces on the border with Saudi Arabia. All the evidence pointed to a plan to invade Saudi Arabia and to seize the Saudi oil fields which lie close to Kuwait on the shores of the Gulf. To respond to that rapidly emerging threat it was necessary to act quickly. At the request of Saudi Arabia the United States deployed forces swiftly to deter further Iraqi aggression. After an historic meeting of the Arab summit other Arab states quickly followed, providing forces of their own to help defend Saudi Arabia from Iraq and endorsing the United States' contribution. This operation appears to have succeeded in deterring an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia, and those involved deserve credit for it. I want to be absolutely clear about this. In the absence of such action I believe it highly likely that we would be faced now not with a military stand-off, deeply worrying and dangerous though that is, but with actual hostilities-not to mince words, war. This action has therefore provided a framework in which sanctions can do their work. But to be effective the sanctions also need to be enforced. I want now to describe the decision my Government has taken in deploying ships of the Royal Australian Navy to the Gulf region. As I have had cause to say, and as is, indeed, obvious, this has been a very serious decision. I have left it up to this point in my statement today because I have wanted to place Qur decisions in have the context in which we made them, that is, in the light of our assessments of the broader international framework of the particular charaCteristics of the Iraqi regime and. of the Gulf region, and of the significance of all of these for Australia. Australia values its alliances but we recognise that increasingly we will have to look to our own security. As a self-reliant country, in 'the years ahead we may need to depend more and more on the principles of the United Nations Charter to protect our interests. We are not sending ships to the Gulf region to serve our allies; we are going to protect the international rule of law which will be vital to our security however our alliances may develop in the future .. After carefully assessing Australia's interests, the nature of the job to be done and our ability to do it, the Government decided to deploy two guided missile frigates and one replenishment oiler to participate in the enforcement of the United Nations embargo against Iraq. Many other nations have reached or are considering the same decision. So far the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Canada and the Netherlands have announced that they. will deploy ships to act in support of the embargo against Iraq, while Italy, the Federal. Republic of Germany, Greece, Spain, Belgium and Portugal are considering what role they can play. In joining this group, Australia is acting within the United Nations Charter to assist Kuwait, at its specific request, to exercise its right of self-defence under Article 51 through the implementation of United Nations economic sanctions. Like most members of the group, Australia believes that the establishment of a United Nations force acting under the United Nations flag, as provided explicitly by Article 42 of the United Nations Charter, would be the best framework for the enforcement of the United Nations economic sanctions, and we are working hard to achieve that. . There are as well a number of alternative mechanisms available under the United Nations umbrella to enhance direct United Nations involvement in the operation of the force. These are being explored. But we believe that the interests of the United Nations itself, as well as the dynamics of the situation in the Gulf, require that we work within the very clear legal framework provided by Article 51 until these issues have been resolved. We believe that to refuse to participate unless a fully fledged United Nations force was established would make it less likely that such a force would be established and more likely that the economic sanctions and the United Nations itself would fail in meeting Iraq's aggression. Our ships are being sent to the Gulf region with a clear mission-to assist in enforcing economic sanctions. The Government has defined the way in which our ships will operate in fulfilling that mission-as I have said, identification, contact, interrogation and warning. Discussions are now under way with other participants to establish coordination procedures and areas of operations. The operational role of our ships will be reviewed if necessary to ensure that they meet the aim of the deployment but our discussions so far have confirmed that their current roles will allow them to fulfil their mission with a sensible minimum of force. Any change to the role proposed for the Australian ships would necessarily involve the widest possible consultation. As I said during Question Time, I indicate, of course, that such consultation would include discussion with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I should make it clear here that our ships are not being sent to the Gulf region to attack Iraq. They will engage Iraqi armed forces only in self-defence. Our ships are well suited to the role we are asking them to fulfil. They are the most modern ships in our fleet, equipped with state of the art weapons and sensor systems, and they are manned by crews as good as any in the world. The same type of ships, some 50 of them, are serving with the United States Navy, and some of them are in the Gulf region at the moment on similar tasks to those that our ships will perform. Nonetheless, we must acknow-edge that the deployment of the ships is not without danger, and this has been reflected in the conditions of service for personnel on the deployment which were approved by Cabin-t last week. Apart from this deployment in support of the United Nations sanctions, the Government will continue to pursue diplomatic approaches to the problems in the Gulf. We do not seek conflict-absolutely the opposite. (Extension of time granted) We will support any constructive diplomatic effort to resolve the crisis, but that cannot be through turning a blind eye to aggression and it cannot succeed without the maintenance of pressure on Iraq. Our Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, will leave tomorrow for Europe, where he will con/suIt the Chairman of the European Community before then visiting Cairo, New York and Washington for discussions on the crisis, returning to brief Cabinet before the end of next week. It is, of course, difficult to say how the crisis in the Gulf will develop from here. Logic should dictate that the Iraqi regime, recognising it has aroused the anger of the whole world, that it will not be allowed to succeed and that it will pay a high penalty for its adventurism, will withdraw from Kuwait and allow the restoration of the legitimate Government there. I earnestly hope that that might happen, and that it might happen soon, but the behaviour of Iraq's Government gives no ground for optimism. In particular, we are all appalled by the action of Iraq's Government in detaining foreign nationals, including Australians, against their will, and, in particular, the contemptible practice of placing them as human shields around Iraq's arsenal of offensive weapons. In the language of the motion that I have put to the House, this is an outrage against all the norms of international law, international conduct and human decency. Any mistreatment of these people will be a stain on Iraq's Government forever. About 150 Australians are among those being held in Iraq and Kuwait against their will. The Government, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and in cooperation with our friends, is doing all it can to help and advise these people. We cannot simply, by some action of our own, restore their freedom but we can and we will take every action open to us consistent with our principles to persuade the Government of Iraq to do so. The only solution to the crisis created by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and to release all foreign nationals. We hope that it will happen but we cannot assume that it will happen soon. The embargo will take time to work. It would be wrong of me to hold out hope of an early breakthrough. What we need is clarity of purpose and firm resolve. Before concluding, I want to make it plain that we do not condemn the people of Iraq; we condemn the actions of their Government. The peoples Qf Australia and Iraq are not inherently hostile to each other. There remains at this fundamental level the basis for cooperation once the present crisis is satisfactorily resolved. The responsibility for resolving the crisis lies totally in the hands of those who have brought it about-the Government of Iraq. The language of the motion which I propose be adopted by the Parliament is crystal clear. It embodies in plain terms all the elements of attitude and approach to the crisis which I have described as being appropriate for Australia. It reflects our convictions as a people and our interests as a nation. Australia is geographically distant from the crisis, but our interests are real and they are important. We have a real stake in supporting proper norms of international behaviour between nations in the post-Cold War world which is emerging. We have a real stake in doing what we can to prevent the Middle East from being engulfed in a widening conflict, and we have a real stake in the affairs of a region which provides the vast bulk of one of the commodities most vital to the health of the international economy. Mr Speaker, our policy must continue to be governed by a clear-headed recognition of those interests and by careful and responsible consideration of the means open to us to protect them. The adoption by the Parliament of this proposed resolution will send a valuable signal, a signal of clarity and of firmness in Australia's attitude and approach to this extremely important issue. I commend the motion to the House. Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveagreed to: That so much of the Standing Orders pended as would prevent t-e Leader of t-e Opposition speaking for a penod not exceedmg 30 minutes.",22
67,Dr HEWSON,MIDDLE EAST,"The Opposit-on parties are pleased to support the motIon that is before the House. We also welcome the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in support ,?f the motion. It is an important declaratIon by the Government of what it believes are Australia's interests in the Middle East crisis and its rationale for the response it has made. On Sunday I called for such a parliamentary statement from the Prime Minister. I was concerned that there was an urgent need for such a statement in order to determine the precise nature of our involvement-in particular, to clear up confusion about the role of our naval forces and the structure of conimand; to detail our diplomatic initiatives aimed at' ensuring full United Nations (UN) involvement; to determine whether and how our involvement could escalate; and to clarify the priorities and objectives of Australian policy, with or without that involvement. These issues are of deep concern in the Australian community and I am pleased that the Prime Minister has now sought to clarify some of them. I want to make it very plain today that the Federal Opposition sees this crisis as one of the gravest tests for the international commuhity since 1945. How this crisis is resolved will affect the nature of international relations and the security of independent states for years to come. There are important turning points in history when countries simply must stand up to bullies. Unless that is done, more people will become the victims of those bullies and the minimal standards on which international order depends will not survive. I believe that the current crisis in the Middle East has brought us to one such turning point in history, particularly as we have now entered a new p'hase in international relations with the ending of the Cold War. The failure of the international community to meet this challenge could have disastrous consequences. To be sus- let Saddam Hussein succeed now would be to ensure a catastrophe at a later date. Australia has clear and important stra- . tegic and economic interests in the outcome of this crisis. There are important standards of international law and international conduct which must be upheld. There is, of course, our direct and immediate concern about the fate of those Australian citizens held against their will in Iraq and Kuwait and whose fate now hangs in the balance. We have a. national economy which is highly vulnerable to a flattening of world economic activity as a result of rising oil prices. We have significant trade interests in the Middle East which are threatened by this crisis. For all these reasons the Federal Opposition wants to support the Government and to build a united national position. There is too much at stake in terms of Australian interests and Australian lives for petty political point scoring. Our commitment to that goal has been apparent throughout this crisis and we reaffirm it today in our support for this motion. Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait the coalition parties have presented a clear view of what is at stake for the international community ahd for Australia. Our view is based on a realistic assessment of why this crisis arose and what it' means. It has a simple cause-namely, the premeditated, unprovoked and unjustifiable invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. A bankrupt country of 16 million people which has just ended an exhausting eight-year war with Iran and which has hostile relations with four of its six neighbours is now prepared to bring the Middle East to the brink of a major war. Its leader is a man who has reportedly used poison gas against his own people, has personally executed some of his closest colleagues, and is prepared to use foreign nationals as hostages. The consequences of Iraq's actions are readily understood around the world. The sovereignty of an independent state has been violated, the security of neighbouring states has been jeopardised and the whole political structure of the Middle East and of the developing world generally has been challenged by Sad dam Hussein's brutal rejection of the legitimacy established international borders. The UN Charter, the provisions of internatidnal law and the accepted norms of international conduct have all been breached by Iraq. The threat to the supply and price of oil and thus to the world economy is clear and real. The capacity of the United States to play its traditional stabilising role in the Middle East is at risk, and basic human rights under the Geneva Convention are being violated by the abhorrent use of foreign nationals by Iraq as human shields to protect its military installations. In meeting these fundamentally important challenges, the signs are hopeful. The immediate international reaction to the invasion of Iraq was marked by what is in the post-1945 era an unprecedented degree of solidarity. The UN Security Council has acted swiftly to condemn Iraq, call for its withdrawal from Kuwait, and approve for the first time in 23 years mandatory sanctions under chapter VII of the UN Charter. Concurrently, a second front was built against Saddam Hussein to deter further aggression by him and to buy time for the UN sanctions to work. President Bush, supported by many other nations, has drawn a line in the sand. Saddam Hussein now clearly knows the stakes involved if he uses force against other neighbouring states. President Bush and the US Administration have risen to this challenge responsibly and correctly. The President has set a new standard for crisis management in the new internationalism of the post-Cold War era. He has skilfully enhanced US authority. At the same time he has helped to carefully coordinate an international diplomatic and economic response. In a situation that is full of uncertaintional ties and risk, President Bush has mixed caution with determination and consultation with decisiveness. The weight of world OpInIOn, including in the Arab world, is firmly opposed to Sad dam Hussein, but the real test in confronting his aggression will not be the extent of world opposition to him, but its durability. The of UN economic sanctions need time to work, but time can also undermine international cohesion. The role of some key countries such as Jordan remains uncertain. Balancing these pressures will be a serious test of international statesmanship and the will of the international community. The Opposition's commitment to developing a united Australian national position at this critical time has been apparent since the crisis arose. We have encouraged the Government to shun the easy option of turning a blind eye to this crisis and of leaving the United States to do the world's dirty work. We have welcomed the Government's commitment to reject such an option. We were quick to support the sanctions which the Australian Government has announced in respect of an embargo on oil imports from Iraq and Kuwait, action relating to Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets in Australia, and a ban on the sale of defence equipment to Iraq. We were quick to support Australian action to implement UN trade sanctions on Iraq and Kuwait, but emphasised that no one sector of the Australian community should bear an unfair share of the burdens which such action may entail. We were quick to indicate our support for appropriate Government action to ensure the safety of Australian citizens in the Middle East. On 9 August I indicated the Opposi:tion's strong support for US action in defence of Saudi Arabia. We stated our view that the US should not be expected to bear the military burdens of deterring Iraq on its own and that Australia should not act passively in support of our interests and those of the West. We therefore supported the Government's decision on 10 August to send Royal Australian Navy vessels to the Gulf as part of an internatask force to make UN economic sanctions effective. But we wanted details of the precise commitment and we cautioned that any escalation of Australia's role should be the subject of a separate , decision. The constructive and supportive role lates which the Opposition has played through this crisis has not meant, of course, we have been uncritical of the GovernMinister, ment's handling of the issues when considerM that such criticism has been justified. A national - onsensus. in this sis will be forthcommg only If the Govresponse ernment is clear, considered and consistent in its policy. We believe that, in some respects, these standards have not been met. In pointing them out and refocusing Government attention on them, I believe that the Opposition has played a congave structive role in support of the bipartisan policy we hope will be possible. Our port for this motion today, therefore, subject to the following qualifications which we have reiterated since the crisis arose. First, we have been concerned at some of the processes whereby the Government has determined its response to this crisis. The Opposition believes thAt the prospects for building a national consensus on decision would have been enhanced if Government had seen fit to consult the Opposition on it. The Government not consulted the Opposition once on Australia's response since the crisis arose; nor has the Prime Minister been in touch with me informally. I regret that this been the. case because I believe that makes it more difficult to build on issue the bipartisanship which the Oppostating sition wants to promote. The decision to commit Australian ence forces to one of the most dangerous crises since 1945 was one Minister himself described as the most serious he has taken in his period fice. It is certainly the most important commitment of Australian forces for past 20 years. It was one on which we believe it was in the national interest consult the Opposition prior to and lowing its announcement. I am pleased that the Prime Minister, acknowledged Question Time today that he will consult the Opposition in the future. A second concern we have had with the· Government's handling of this crisis reto the confusion and doubts that have arisen about the nature of Australia's involvement in the military situation that in the Middle East. Unlike the Prime I do not believe that such conwe fusion and doubt arose without good cause. The Government's muddled thinkcriing on important aspects of Australia's had a good deal to do with creating the current uncertainty. The categorical nature of the Prime Minister's announcement on 10 August of Australia's naval deployment and the subsequent clarifications of it by Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Robert Ray understandable cause for community confusion. That confusion related to the supmISSIOn of the Australian warships; is whether they would be involved in physical interdiction; the legal qasis for such interdiction; the command structure under which the ,ships would operate; and the responses of other Western countries. These were all aspects of legitimate concern for the Opposition and the wider Australian community. I believe that many this of them need never have arisen had the the Government thought through more carefully the operational and legal complexihas ties of the situation. The Government soon found itself twisting ,and turning on such issues. On 10 August the Prime Minister indicated has that Australian naval ships 'would enforce it the blockade', but Senator Evans and oththis ers later qualified this commitment by that the ships would not 'physically interdict' shipping, although Ausdeftralia supported the legal right and appropriateness of the United States and which the Prime others to do so. We are concerned that the Government in ofhas been backing off from statements which the Prime Minister made when he the announced the commitment of Australian forces on 10 August. We believe that the to wording of this motion, particularly that folon page 3 concerning the mission of the Australian warships in the Gulf, reflects in uncertainty and compromise. We do not believe that the public disserision in the ranks of the Labor Party on this issue has been helpful in building a national consensus on Australia's commitment. For this reason we welcome the fact that the Government's position on some of these issues was clarified by the Prime Minister today, but there are other important questions which remain unanswered. Under what conditions, if any, will our naval ships be authorised to use force? Can they do so in their mission 'to enforce the blockade'? The Prime Minister needs to explain more adequately what he means when he talks in his statement of our ships fulfilling their mission, 'with a sensible minimum of force'. Are there geographic limits to their operations? Under what rules of engagement and under whose command will they operate? What will be their role in the event that open military conflict begins? What role, if will the ships play in supporting military contingency planning in Saudi Arabia? Will they have any role in relation to the situation of Australian nationals trapped in the region? These are questions to which the Australian community and particularly the men of our Navy ships en route to the Gulf deserve clearer answers from the Government. Thirdly, we are concerned about how the Government will be working most effectively to ensure that United Nations involvement in this crisis will be maximised. This will be crucial in galvanising a genuinely international consensus against Saddam Hussein and defeating his aggressi ve designs. The Opposition believes there is considerable scope for the Government to spell out its diplomatic activities in this regard and to outline the extent to which such UN involvement will influence its policies in the Gulf. For example, how will the UN endorsement of military action in support of its sanctions, or the absence of such endorsement, affect the role of our ships? Let me emphasise that these three areas of concern about aspects of the Government's decision-making in this crisis should not detract from the fact that its decision to impose economic sanctions and to deploy ships in support of an international task force have been strongly advocated and supported by the Opposition. That is the basis on which we are pleased to support the motion before the House today. Let me state clearly what the Opposition sees as Australia's priorities in the crisis in the light of the most recent developments. We must fulfil our national responsibilities in support of UN economic sanctions against Iraq and we should support appropriate international action, military and otherwise, to ensure that they are effective. In that task we must be prepared for a long, tough and drawn out task. We must clearly define the operations of out naval forces in the Gulf, the precise purposes of their deployment and the any, command structure under which they will operate. We must use all the diplomatic and other influence we have to ensure maximum UN involvement in resisting Iraqi aggression. We must explore every avenue with the UN and our allies, especially the United States and the United Kingdom, in guaranteeing the safety of our citizens in Iraq and Kuwait. In fulfilling all these responsibilities clearly and consistently, the Government can be assured of our slJPport, just as we have supported it in its major decisions to· date. Mr Speaker, we have heard a good deal over the past year or two about the emergence of a new era in international relations. The more enthusiastic advocates of that view assured us that the end of the Cold War represented a fundamental break with the past, that the era of power politics in military competition were giving way to a new internationalism based on economic interdependence. It was even possible for an international debate to be generated recently as to whether the end of the Cold War represented such a complete victory for Western liberal democratic values that it constituted the end of history itself. The events of recent weeks have removed much of that optimism and complacency. It is, of course, easy to be wise after the event but it was always unrealistic to believe that changes in superpower relations somehow made the pursuit of national interest and the use of military force obsolete. This is particularly so in relation to the Middle East. When I addressed the Zionist Federation of Australia on 21 May this year I noted: . . . the old divisions have given way to the hope of a new, less ideological and perhaps less dangerous era in international relations. But I also emphasised that there were new and continuing dangers. I said: Europe's winds of democratic liberalism are not yet blowing in the Middle East. Instead we are witnessing a continuing high level of nationalist intransigence and a regional arms race of considerable proportions, particularly in countries such as Iraq. I cite those comments, not in any smug or self-justifying way, but simply to point out that recent developments are not some kind of aberration. They are the result of a consistent pattern of military build-ups and territorial ambitions in the Middle East. The international community faces a stark choice between a future of anarchY in international relations or one based on ties of interdependence. The path to a diplomatic settlement must always be kept open, but the penalties for aggression must always be real. The analogy that some have tried to establish over recent weeks between the situation in the Gulf and that during the Vietnam war is a mistaken one. The more appropriate analogy is with Korea in 1950 or Manchuria in 1931. What we have in the current crisis is an unambiguous and unjustifiable use of force in one of the most strategically and economically important regions of the world. Australia's interests are directly involved. The crisis is a timely reminder, if indeed one were needed, that Australia's interests in an interdependent world are global. This crisis reaffirms that any Aus!ralian defence or strategic policy that is tnward looking or exclusively regional is fundamentally mistaken and unrealistic. We are not a warlike people. We do not want to place the members of our Defence Force in harm's way far from home. The Middle East is a dangerous and difficult theatre for military operations. We would prefer not to have our forces on active service there, but we would not be true to our national traditions and we would not be recognising our real national interests if we pretended that what is going on in the Gulf did not concern us or if we found excuses for inaction. That has been the basis for the consistent position which the Opposition has taken throughout this crisis. Finally, we can debate various aspects of this issue in the Parliament for a long time. In the wider community, a similar debate is going on. But at the end of the day, those who live most directly with the consequences of our action are the men and women of our Defence Force. They are undertaking this important commitment with the full support of the Opposition and with our full confidence in their capabilities. To· them and to their families, we wish success and a safe return. I commend this motion to the House.",27
68,Dr BLEWETT,MIDDLE EAST,"The global tensions that have been precipitated by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait have prompted many comparisons with the Europe of the 1930s and the tragedy of appeasement. The parallels are obvious: a greed for conquest that cannot be sated by territorial concessions-I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is not Saddam Hussein's first act of aggression; assurances, promises and pledges to mediation while the plan of aggression is mounted-the actual planning for the campaign against Kuwait appears to have been in hand for some two months; the puppet governments with their invitations to invasion that disappear as soon as the Anschluss is accomplished-where now is the provisional free government of Kuwait? Above all, the echoes of Neville Chamberlain's anguished cry, and I quote him, 'Why military involvement because of a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing?'. It is to that last point that we must now respond for we know that the world paid a terrible price for not responding to that quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we knew nothing, for not taking effective international action to preserve Czechoslovakia in September 1939. Of course, it was hard to take internahuman tional action then; it is no easy task to take it now. But if there is any lesson wait applicable from the 1930s to the dilemcrisimas and complexities of the Middle East in the late twentieth century, it is that that task must be taken up; that the decisions must be made by the internatained tional community; that capitulation to aggression offers no prospect of long term peace. The Govenlment has made plain its challenge. complete rejection of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as a flagrant breach of internations tional law and a serious threat to interute national peace and security. Iraq's subsequent actions, purporting to annex Kuwait and then threatening to use innodatory cent foreign nationals caught up in the Gulf crisis as hostages, have demoners strated clearly Iraq's contempt for interout nationally accepted norms of behaviour of states. We welcome the fact that, on these basic issues, the Government commands biparin tisan support in this Parliament. In ing to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), it seems he was critical of some of our processes-and we take that on board-and he requires clarification of part of the operational role. In so far is possible, the Minister for Defence ence and Personnel (Mr Bilney) will dress those issues. But, across the board, the stand of the Government commands in the support of the Opposition and for that we are much appreciative. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has made plain why Australia has such an this .effect. . important stake in developments in the Gulf. I should like to elaborate on his remarks. First and foremost, we must cognise that Australia's security and perity ultimately depend in large measure on the maintenance of and respect for established framework of international principles embodied in the United Narope tions Charter and in a series of internayear, tional treaties. Iraq's behaviour is all the more fensible, given its claims to respect its tions. obligations as a member of the United Nations and its position as a party to rights and other relevant international conventions. Iraq's invasion of Kuis the first serious test of international management in the post-Cold War world. President Sad dam Hussein, in defying the United Nations Security Council hard and threatening foreign nationals dein Kuwait and Iraq, is challenging the international community to maintain its resolve. Our view is that all responsible nations must respond firmly to this This explains our firm position on sancand our prompt decision to contribships to the multinational naval force. These actions are a tangible demonstration of our commitment to see the manresolutions of the United Nations Security Council implemented fully. Othwho might be tempted to take a leaf of Saddam Hussein's book in the future would do well to take note of the strong, speedy and effective international response on this occasion. It is very much this broad international context that listenAustralia's action should be seen. While Australia has had differences with Iraq from time to time, we have a significant commercial relationship with that as country, and it has to date been impeccSciable in the payment of its debts to AusadtFalia. We continue to enjoy productive and substantial relations with other states the Gulf region. It is absurd to suggest that we have any aggressive intent whatsoever with regard to Iraq, and we reject any assertions by the Iraqi authorities to Trends in international relations in the past two years or so might have led some reto the view that world security was now prosassured. In the wake of great improvements in relations between the United the States and the Soviet Union and the remarkable transformation in Eastern Euand the Soviet Union over the past there may have been a temptation towards complacency. The Gulf crisis is a indesalutary warning against such temptaWhile Australia has warmly welcomed these positive trends, our situation in complex Asia-Pacific region has reminded interests. us that the new international order presents us with great challenges as well great opportunities. What has happened in the Gulf is a clear indication of the down side of a more multipolar world where some middle powers might see our scope to extend their influence, freed from the constraints of a bipolar system domiinternational nated by the United States and the Soviet Union. In this more uncertain world order, the role of the United Nations becomes even more important for Australia and the rest of the international community including the United States and the Soviet Union. tions. The Gulf crisis has demonstrated unprecedented cooperation within the United Nations among the permanent five members of the Security Council. The constructive contribution made by the Soviet Union has been particularly welcome this regard. The result has been a series of unequivocal Security Council resoluthreatened tions which should leave Iraq in nodoubt about international condemnation of its actions. International consultations taking place now about the potential of chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter and the actijoin vation of mechanisms such as the United Nations Military Staff Committee also have important implications for the agement of the international security vironment through this decade and the next century. It is particularly significant that the countries in the Gulf region themselves are having recourse to these procedures, and that United Nations achigh tivities are not seen as inconsistent with attempts among Arab states to resolve the dispute. It is also significant that key Arab tries, despite their differences over other issues, have rallied so quickly to the defexert ence of Saudi Arabia. We appreciate that. - o- some countries in the region, the deCISlOns taken in relation to the Gulf crisis have been difficult and courageous, and we respect them the more for the hard decisions they have taken-just as we pect that their respect for Australia been enhanced by the promptness with the which we have moved to support their The Gulf crisis has also demonstrated as the importance of having a realistic appreciation of Australia's leverage and influence. While we can make a significant contribution, it is clear that to achieve objectives we must work in close concert with regional countries in the wider community. This requires an intensive and skilful diplomatic effort which, in this case, is being backed up by practical assistance through our contribution to the proposed multinational naval force and our other efforts to ensure internationalcompliance with the sancTo date, our policy attention has been directed towards several goals. First, we have been exhaustively pursuing the release of Australian and other foreign nain tionals who have been prevented from leaving Kuwait and Iraq an,d who are now with new restrictions including the possibility of being used to shield key Iraqi installations. A- the Prime Minister has made clear, Australia regards the use by Iraq of foreign nationals in this way as despicable and totally inconsistent with Iraq's international legal obligations. We with other countries in rejecting Iraq's attempts to intimidate members of the international community who are acting manresponsibly pursuant to the United Naentions Charter and the United Nations Seinto curity Council resolutions. At the same time, we naturally wish to avoid any actions which raise the already temperature of the crisis. Nor are we prepared to speculate publicly about tlle situation of Australians and other foreign nationals in Iraq and Kuwait. To do so counmight prejudice their safety and welfare and play into the hands of those trying to leverage in order to deter countries from actions to implement United Nations sanctions. Ensuring the early release of our citizens trapped in these countries and, pending this, doing what we can to minimise exthe risks to them and reassure them of has the concern and support of their fellow Australians thus remains a central element in our policy thinking. We have welcomed especially the help of Radio Australia, which has established a special Middle East service, the British Broadcasting Corporation and the British Embassy in Kuwait in this regard. A second priority has been to refine arrangements for our particIpation in the multinational naval force in the Gulf, including pursuing options to secure more specific endorsement for this activity. We have expressed our firm preference for a further Security Council resolution under article 42 of the United Nations charter as a way of increasing pressure on Iraq to discharge its international obligations. We are pleased that a number of countries have either firmly committed naval vessels to the multinational force in the Gulf or have indicated that it is beiI).g considered as a serious option. Members of the Western European Union are discussing this matter in Paris this eveningCanberra time-and we hope that this consultation will clarify the position of several western European countries on participation in the multinational force. A third priority has been to ensure that Australia has taken every reasonable step to comply with United Nations sanctions against Iraq. As the Prime Minister has noted, this has involved substantial costs to Australia but must again be seen in the light of the mandatory obligations under the United Nations charter. We very much appreciate the cooperation we have received from relevant sectors of the Australian economy, incluQing agricultural producers and business people. We also hope that our actions in response to United Nations sanctions would enhance our standing in the Middle East, where we have important commercial links. Given the pressures upon us created by the crisis, we have naturally focused on what has to be done in the short term to protect and promote Australia's interests. At the same time, we recognise the importance of looking ahead. It is, of course, very difficult to make any confident predictions about how the crisis is likely to evolve over the next few weeks. We can, however, at this stage make some preliminary observations. Iraqi forces are digging in in Kuwait. There have been no significant Iraqi withdrawals. On the contrary, the indications are that Iraq is further entrenching itself militarily in that country. A sudden move by the Iraqis into Saudi Arabia or elsewhere cannot be ruled out although, as the defensive military deployments of the United States of America and other countries in the region gather momentum, the cost of such Iraqi aggression is likely to increase substantially. The international pressures on Iraq are increasing. United Nations economic sanctions seem to be holding up reasonably well and recent threats against foreign nationals in Kuwait and Iraq have further alienated international opinion. Iraq's responses to date suggest that it may be prepared to try to sit it out in the hope that international resolve will weaken. We believe that hope is ill-founded. Saddam Hussein's diplomatic manoeuvring, including the transparently cynical attempts to link a solution to the Gulf crisis with the problem of the Israelioccupied territories and to use Westerners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait as bargaining chips, suggests also that he is trying to buy time. The prospect of some form of reconciliation between Iraq and Iran, welcome as it is in: other respects, adds another dimension to the present situation. I am confident, however, from my discussions in Iran that the Iranians would in no way facilitate the breaching of United Nations sanctions despite this detente with Iraq. All this manoeuvring by Iraq is complicating efforts to resolve the crisis, but should not distract the international com- . munity from the fundamental principles at issue. So far, the international economy has adjusted relatively well to the Gulf crisis with moderate oil price rises to date. Nevertheless, some countries, particularly Jordan, will suffer real economic hardship as a result of sanctions against Iraq. In other parts of the world developing countries will feel the pressure of higher oil prices as well. There will also be continnQw uing international ne-vousness about possibility of escalatIon of the confltct which might seriously disrupt further Middle East oil supplies. Apart from the grave problems being encountered by the Western nationals Iraq and Kuwait, the presence of such very large community of other foreign nato tionals in or fleeing Kuwait, in particular, as well as Iraq, creates a massive humantheir itarian problem. Jordan is now bearing the brunt of this. Indeed, the great burespecially dens on Jordan resulting from the present situation deserve sympathetic internaas tional consideration; All these elements come together in very tangled web. A significant developinternational ment in one area can have rapid and Iraq's aggression. unpredictable consequences elsewhere. We cannot set out· clear prescriptions at this stage about how we are going to deal a range of contingencies that might undecade fold. To do so would be ill-advised- not least because it might' limit our latitude for manoeuvre - ous motion It is also essential that we work in close concert with the international community in responding to the crisis, paying partichave ular regard to the concerns of the countries most directly affected. In these circumstances, Australia will continue be guided by its fundamental internamade tional obligations, and by our interest maximising the pressure on Iraq to withson) draw from Kuwait and to refrain from tions (Dr Blewett). any further acts of aggression, while doing all that we can to minimise the prospect of armed conflict. In all of this I can assure the House that, together with the Prime Minister the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), Senator Evans and I remain. closely involved in the management of Australtroops is's response to the crisis. The Departfore ment of Foreign Affairs and Trade is heavily engaged through its task force our embassies abroad, especially that of Baghdad. In this connection, honourable members will know that our consul in Baghdad, Mr Brian Rowe, yesterday made the journey to Kuwait CitY where he is trying to contact and assist members t-e of the Australian community there. I would like to take this opportunity to express the gratitude of the Government and of all Australians to the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and in Trade who are working tirelessly around a the clock under very difficult conditions protect Australians trapped in both Iraq and Kuwait. It will be our objective, with continuing assistance, to keep the Parliament and the people of Australiathe families of those who are effectively trapped in Kuwait and Iraqfully informed as we can. The plight of our people trapped in Kuwait and Iraq remains constantly before us as we ata tempt to honour our commitment to the community'S response to TIM FISCHER (Farrer-Leader of the Mr National Party of Australia) (4.01)with On this tenth day of sitting in a new it is almost unbelievable, and bitterly disappointing, that the motion the Parliament must deal with is a very serirelating to the Middle East, and sending Australian military forces to the Middle East in circumstances which been detailed by previous speakers. On behalf of the National Party of Australia. I record our support for. the motion to and the broad thrust of the comments by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in the Leader of the Opposition. (Dr Hewand the Minister for Trade NegotiaOn an historical note I would like to point out to the House that here we are, in 1990, considering this motion and it was in April 1965-25 years ago-that and Robert Gordon Menzies, as Prime Minister, stood up and made a similar statement in respect of sending Australian to Vietnam. Twenty five years be that-1940-was the year the great bulk of Australian troops went forward and from Australia to participate in World War II. Twenty five years before that, in 1915, there was the landing at Gallipoli by the ANZACs and all involved in that. We come to' this motion today with that historical background but with an· appreciation of the gravity on this occasionas there was, indeed, gravity on all previous occasions-when an Australian military commitment has been made. It is a 'no joy' commitment, but it isa correct commitment. It is a commitment which should not be' lightly entered into. Therefore, I welcome the fact,' that on the first available day of sitting of Parliament the Government has responsibly brought this matter before the Parliament. Those sailors already heading towards the Middle East, and Australian soldiers loading in Fremantle tomorrow, have a right to know that they do so with the best wishes of the vast majority of not only the government of the day but also the Parliament of the day. In this context I also extend our thoughts and support to the families of the contingent. I know there are mixed feelings on this occasion. Of course they have those mixed feelings, but they also have an appreciation of the duty which calls forward their loved ones in response to their commitment to the armed forces of Australia. I also welcome and support the conditions of service announced by the Government ,for ""the service personnel involved. I know that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), who will speak soon, will give more detail, but these conditions include full cover under parts 2 and 3 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act; a Gulf allowance of $45 a day to be paid when serving in the operational area, and $30 a day when temporarily outside the area but still away from Australia; exemption from income tax on salaries and allowances while away from Australia; eligibility for either a ence service home loan or Australian Defence Force home loan assistance; and the eligibility of personnel serving in the operational area for Australian service medals and individual awards as appropriate. I believe in broad terms, as does Senator Jocelyn Newman, that the response by the Government in respect of these conditions-as we have examined them to date-has been adequate and appropriate and, of course, they will need to be reviewed depending on what unfolds in this Middle East situation. I also strongly support the comments of the Leader of the Opposition, particularly about wanting exact clarification of what our contingent will be doing in the Middle East. Those in command will need, to know the geographical limits of their operati<;>ns, the rules of engagement and under whose command they will operate, tl;1eir role in, the event that open military confli-t begins, the role if any the ships will play in supporting military contingency planning in Saudi Arabia, and their role relating to the Australian nationals trapped in the region. I emphasise the importance of an adequate command structure. There could be nothing worse than sending our, contingent forward without absolute clarity on the command structure and information as to where our contingent fits in the overall command structure of the international force involved in the Middle East. Generals make mistakes, admirals make mistakes and politicians make mistakes, particularly about operational warfare. Whether referring to Gallipoli or Vietnam, history is strewn with events that demonstrate that quite adequately. This Parliament and this Government must do all they can to avoid making mistakes, to head them off. At this time the best contribution we can make is to erilphasise the importance of an efficient, effective and clear-cut coinmand structure associated with our contingent: With no joy and with a degree of gravity I tell the House that it is in that context that horrific mistakes can be made and accidents can occur. More than that, errors can be made which lead to defloss of life. I do not need to underscore that further. I hope that the Ministers and the Government will take the necessary steps ,to ensure an adequate command structure. It is our hope that a full-scale shooting match will be avoided and a proper resolution arrived at, including the return to Australia of all Australians currently in Iraq and Kuwait. We feel for them in their current situation. Another aspect I wish to touch on relates to the trade sanctions imposed by the Govern-ent. The Prime Mini-ter r-­ ferred to thIS matter w-en movmg hIS motion in the House. It IS true that .burvirtue dens will arise from those trade sanctIons. Indeed the wheat industry, the rice dustry - nd other industries will be ularly affected. I point out to the Minister for Trade Negotiations that because of trade sanctions. there have already lay-offs at Echuca in the electorate of my Deputy Leader, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), because a specific rice order for Kuwait cannot now ceed. I support the Government's decision trade sanctions but no one sector of economy should bear the burden of those sanctions. The Government has a comthey mitment to ensure that no one ries the burden, but it has yet to detail how it will give effect to that commitMiddle ment. I was saddened that there was specific reference in the Prime Minister's speech to that commitment and that mension of the trade sanctions. I commend the Minister for Trade gotiations on the progress made following . the recent visit to Iran and the additional contracts agreed to, efforts made and breakthroughs that occurred during that particular trade mission. But let it be clear: the gains in Iran should not in some oblique way be seen as compensation losses in other areas relating, for example, to the trading performance of the Austrathe lianWheat Board. It is early days. It is too early tify what those losses will be in the longer, medium and short term. Nevertheless, that commitment is there; it was given by varlian ious Ministers during the first crisis. We serve notice that the coalition will be closely monitoring that commitment. Indeed, just a few days ago the Leader of the Opposition said that emphatically in a comprehensive statement about the Middle East. It is difficult to predict what will pen in the Middle East in respect of the horrific invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. \yhatever happens, I appeal to the Austrasituations lIan people to give forth their support' every practical' way they can to the indiare vi duals this Parliament and this Government are sending to the Middle East by of today's motion. It is very important that those going forward as part of in the Australian contingent feel that they particcan enjoy the support of the community at large. I refer not only to the sailors and the the soldiers but also to other personnel been travelling on those ships. I also wish well the member of the Parliamentary Press Gallery, Australian Associated Press correspondent Terry proO'Connor, and Sydney Morning Herald photographer Jack Picone, both of whom on have been allotted to this contingent in the the best traditions of the profession to report back to Australia on the events as occur. Let us hope that they do not sector carhave too much to report. There are 26 Australian soldiers in the East already, quite apart from the no Australian soldiers who are joining the third ship. Thirteen ,of those soldiers have dibeen with the United Nations Military Observer Group on the Iran side of the NeIran-Iraq border for some time. They have been rotated and have been carrying out good work. Following the most recent developments on the Iran-Iraq border perhaps the requirements placed upon them will be less. There are also 13 Australian soldiers with the United Nations Truce for Supervisory Organisation in Syria and elsewhere performing other duties with UN. We should recall that two years ago an Australian Army captain was killed in Lebanon when involved in similar to quanwork. We must not underestimate the gravity of the circumstances unfolding in the Middle East not only for the Austracontingent going but also for the Ausweek of this tralians already there. In supporting the motion before the House and the comments of the Leader of the Opposition quite ate clarification in seeking the quite appropricircumstances, it is just unbelievable that in 1990 we have to contemplate this action. But we have no hapchoice if indeed we are to preserve the rule of ordered society in the world today. From time to time in the history of man, arise that are awesome in their in magnitude. Whilst fear and apprehension an inescapable element of the present situation, history tells us that to do nothdistrust ing is to act in utter defiance of all that we consider essential in an ordered world society. We must act, the world must act, and Iraq's tyranny must be overcome.",31
69,Mr BILNEY,MIDDLE EAST,"Kingston-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (4.14)It is a pleasure to note the very warm and genuine support given by Opposition speakers to the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). I warmly endorse the remarks of the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer). In the last few days there has been a certain amount of questioning, outside the Parliament, of our decision to commit members of the Australian defence forces to the international task force now assembling in the Persian Gulf and nearby. That is a healthy thing in a democracy. I can imagine what would l1appen in Iraq. If one questioned that commitment one would quickly lose one's head. It gives me an opportunity to set out again the reasons why we have sent the Adelaide, the Darwin and the Success to that multinational force in the Gulf. The first issue that needs to be tackled in connection with some of the criticism made is that our deployment is some sort of hasty, ill-considered, adventurist response, embarked upon after a telephone call late at night from President Bush. That is very far from being the case. In the week preceding that in which the decision was made, Cabinet discussed the invasion of Kuwait and agreed that it might well become necessary for Australia to take action to enforce United Nations economic sanctions against Iraq. Subsequently the most senior members of Cabinet considered President Bush's request for Australia to join in an international effort to enforce those sanctions and decided that it was in the best interests of Australia to do so. A couple of groups of people-I think not large-are opposed to our involvement. One group comprises people who are opposed to the use of military force in any situation. That is a position which commands respect. But a second groupwhich in my view commands much less respect-comprises those who so deeply the United States that they judge everything that the United States does as being a cup of poison. Those people could not bring themselves to work with America in any shape or form and could not be described as objective. Some of them raise the cry, 'No more Vietnams'. Aside from some very obvious differences between this situation in the Gulf and that in Vietnam, to draw that kind of historical parallel may mean becoming completely paralysed by the fear of repeating the errors of Vietnam and risking the repetition of historical errors which were far more grave. Both Government speakers have spoken of the lessons of Abyssinia and Czechoslovakia and reminded us that appeasement has been demonstrated as a strategy which one follows at great peril against dictators who are prepared to test their power to the limits. Others may try to suggest that the situation in the Middle East has nothing to do with Australia and, perversely, that it is Australia rather than Iraq which is interfering in the affairs of other nations. However, our forces threaten no-one except a belligerent tyrant and his expansionist armies and then only with the intention of seeing that sanctions endorsed unanimously by the United Nations are enforced. Why should we challenge Iraq at all? The prime argument is the moral argument to protect the rights of small nations from the belligerent actions of larger neighbours. We cannot remain aloof from the risk that weakness and indecision now could encourage Iraqi expansionism to a point where the weapons of war which that country, almost solely, is prepared to use-chemical warfare-could become a much broader threat. It has been neces-· sary to ensure that our own forces ate equipped to deal with that particular horrific threat. Those who propose that we do nothing . to thwart Saddam's ambitions are - ery gravely underestimating his motives. Seizur.e of the Kuwaiti oil fields, and the possibility of seizing those of Saudi Arabia, which latter possibility I hope is now averted, would enable Saddam Hussein to tighten his grip on world oil supplies and put Iraq in a position to da-age very seriously the world economy. Hlgh on the agenda of Saddam Hussein one also sees the destruction of the state of Israel. The pursuit of either of those objectives must be resisted forcefully now to prevent international conflagration in the years ahead. In that connection perhaps it is instrucas tive to remember how Saddam liquidated members of the Iraqi ruling group to prevent rivals challenging his power and then sent hundreds of thousands of men and boys to their deaths in a war with Iran to secure control of a small area of marshy ground. It is a bitter irony that there has now been an unholy peace with Teheran and that all those deaths, all that destrucoperational tion, all that impoverishment, were for nothing. We are dealing with a leader who is armed with some of the most destructive weapons known to man-chemical weapons-which Australia has taken a lead in attempting to see banished. Iraq under Sad dam Hussein is not constrained by the moral conscience which is shared by other countries in the world. That is the rationale for Australia's involvement. It is pleasing to see that, as a government, which is accountable for its decisions and accountable in this place, it enjoys the support of the official Opposition and, indeed, of most Australians. I turn now to two other areas. I refer first to the conditions of service under which the 600 members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) who are embarked on their ships will serve and, secondly, to take up some points made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia about the operational role of the Royal Australian Navy's ships on their way to the Gulf. The Prime Minister undertook that the conditions of service which would apply to those who went to the Gulf would be from Australia. 'commensurate with the serious nature of the deployment'. It was very much part of the Government's wish that those confor ditions should be made clear and anbe nounced well before the force left Australia and certainly before it arrived in the opance erational area in the Gulf. That has been done. That gives security and certainty not just to the ADF members but also to their families and loved ones to enable them to proceed secure in the knowledge of their entitlements as members of the force going to that dangerous area. Briefly, those conditions of service are follows. The Government's first decision was that all ADF personnel who were allotted for service in the Middle East, including those mentioned by the Leader of the National Party who are on exchange serving with the United States and United Kingdom units deployed to the Middle East, will be regarded as being on operational service once they reach the area. I point out that that operational area has not yet been completely defined but it is only a matter of days before it will be defined. That service will be deemed to have commenced from the date of leaving Australia or overseas bases, in the case of those members deployed with other units. Until reaching the operational area, those personnel are regarded as being on 'hazardous· service'. Under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, 'hazardous service' provides a favourable standard of proof for entry to peacetime VEA benefits which relates to compensation for illness or injuries arising from that service. 'Op-erational service' in the operational area, which will be set out in schedule 2 of the VEA, will provide members with cover under parts II and III of the VEA, which includes hospital and medical cover and an invalidity pension in the event of injury, together with a widow's pension to the surviving spouse of a deceased member. It also provides access to a service pension at age 60 for men and age 55 for women. An additional allowance, called the Gulf allowance, of $45 a day will be paid when serving in the operational area and $30 a day when temporarily outside the area but still away Those salaries and allowances will be exempt from income tax. On allotment operational service ADF personnel will eligible for either the defence service homes loan or the ADF home loan assistscheme and, in the case of the latter, the six-year qualification period will be waived. All of these conditions are in addition to standing provisions such as seagoing allowance, hard lying allowance, flying allowance and overseas living allowance, which will continue to apply. Personnel serving in the operational area will also be eligible for Australian service medals· and individual awards as appropriate. To put the matter in a nutshell, whatever may be one's opinion of this deployment-I have made clear mine, Opposition members have made cl-ar theirs-there would be no disagreement, I am certain, in the minds of the Australian community that the conditions prevailing when the servicemen went away should be the very best available and that is, in fact, what the Government has carried out. I will now deal briefly with matters raised by both speakers from the Opposition side; namely, the operational role, command structure, and so forth. The Government decided that the role of the ships in the Gulf would be one of contacting vessels attempting to proceed through the Gulf-obviously in support of the sanctions that are agreed upon in Resolution 661 of the United Nations Security Council; to identify those vessels; to interrogate them as to their purposes; and to warn them if their purposes appear to be in contravention of the sanctions. The ships are also, as is standard practice, entitled to act in self-defence in the of hostile action against them. Rules of engagement along those lines are being developed, but they will not be made public for what I am sure everybody in this House would regard as the very sensible reason of not wanting to telegraph our punches, our tactics or what we mayor may not do to the opposition. Clearly the Australian ships will be serving as part of a multinational force and the command and control arrangements will have to be developed with reference to the other parties taking part in that multinational force. I should mention, though, that it has been decided that the Australian ships will remain under Australian national command. A naval planning conference-not a political conference, but one taking place at service level-is to take place next weekend in the Middle East. That will finalise the technical details of command and control and when those arrangements are finalised they will apply to our vessels as well. I add a couple of points so far as Australian personnel ate concerned. The Navy is taking steps to make sure that the families of the men serving in the Gulf are kept very closely in touch with developments there. That is something of which the Navy has made a bit of an art form. All of the people nominated as next of kin will be informed directly of the addresses to which they may write and how they can get urgent messages to the ships. They will be kept in regular contact and given practical and emotional support through the personnel services organisations which the Navy has, so that the families of these men will not be forgotten. I conclude by saying that, like other speakers, I wish godspeed to the men who are going to the Middle East. Our thoughts are with them and their families. We are not forgetting the Australian officers already serving in the Middle East in our embassy in Baghdad who have an extremely difficult role to play. I commend the motion to the House.  has been indicated by the Leader of the event Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the Opposition supports the motion before the House. It is our hope that we can stand united in support of what has been moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). In so saying, I record that many of us feel that there is, in the minds of some, an underestimation of the danger that is involved in this activity. No-one should underestimate the dangers inherent in the operation and the commitment of forces to the Middle East. Beyond the dangers, the legality, the force and the wisdom of the commitment, the biggest test will be sustaining that commitment through the difficult period that is ahead. I say at the outset that I accept unequivocally that the action first taken by the United States was correct, but I perceive that the United States became involved in the manner it has for two reasons: firstly, in order to deter Iraqi ag-ression; secondly, in order to enforce Umted Nations sanctions following the invasion of Kuwait and following a request from the legitimate government of Kuwait to implement those sanctions-that is, Chapter VII sanctions imposed by the United Nations. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr BUney), who spoke before me, referred to some criticism within this country, and perhaps elsewhere, of the decisions that nation states have taken in this instance. I have read of some people proclaiming that it is an illegal act, that it is a wrongful act, et cetera. I recognise that public international law, in many ways, is like beauty-in the eye of the beholder-and that there is a looseness about international law that is not applicable to our form of domestic law. But that is not the case in this instance. There is a clarity and force of law supporting what has been done. Those who are arguing the case of the correctness of this action-some of whom used to argue against the correctness of a commitment to Vietnam-ought to be instilling in the minds of many the fact that a proper legal process has been followed in this instance. They should not allow the woolly thinking and woolly interpretations that are being proffered that this is an illegal, immoral or wrongful act. Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter has clearly been breached by Iraq. It states: All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or usein this instance it applies to both threat of force, in terms of Saudi Arabia, and use of force in terms of Kuwaitof f?rce against the territorial integrity or - al Independence of any state, or in any manner l-consistent with the Purposes of the United NatIons. There has been a military occupation and military invasion of a member stateKuwait. That breach of Article 2 (4) of the United Nations Charter has triggered Article 51, to which the Prim- Minister referred. It is well to read the terms of Article 51 for they speak with very great clarity in these circumstances. In partthe part I delete does not affect the part that I quote-Article 51 states: Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain international peace and security. I will take a couple of those phrases from the Article because it has been said that, notwithstanding that Chapter VII sanctions have been implemented by the United Nations, forces for good, as I will term them in this instance, should have waited until United Nations forces were in place. Article 51 says that nothing in the present Charter shall: . . . impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations. . . There has been an armed attack against that member state. The United Nations has passed resolutions in its Security Council in an unprecedented manner. Notwithstanding that, the Charter says that even if one cannot get the situation and the stock in place, one has an inherent right to individual and collective self defence. Of course, it would say that. Why? Because in· international law there has always been an inherent right to individual self-defence and, indeed, collective self-defence. The Charter simply puts that in place. It is really saying, 'Look, it matters· not that there will be a delay in doing things under the Charter elsewhere. Nothing that we are requiring elsewhere in this Charter should prevent you from acting individually or collectively in your self-defence if there is an armed attack'. I urge members of this Parliament who are dedicated to concepts of freedom, justice politiand rule of law to recognise that, at international law, there has been a clear and established breach and to treat as nonsense the seemingly well-honed arguments that there ought to have been a delay in sending our forces until a United Nations force went into place. The nonsense of that proposition is parent. Some 11 or 12 years ago, I stood at the dispatch box as Minister for Foreign Affairs and announced Australia's commitment to a peace-keeping force in Namibia. How long did it take to get that force in place? Ten years. Admittedly, the offering of that commitment was not triggered by the sanctions and opportunities provided under the United Nations charter, but that is how long it can sometimes take to work one's way through the United Nations' councils to get a particular force in place. In this matter, there was a need for immediacy and resolutions were passed unanimously in the United Nations. If they mean anything, they have to be enforced. After all, Security Council Resolution 661 imposed a world-wide ban on trade and financial dealings with Iraq and Kuwait and called on all states, including non-United Nations members, to act in accordance with it. What does one want to do? Does one want to pass these resolutions and treat them as mere puff, mere verbiage, as not deserving of impelling and compelling action, or does one support them? The answer is obvious-one supports them. The force of that argument is borne out even more when one realises that, following the passing of Resolution 661 calling for a worldwide ban on trade and financial dealings-which is what we are seeking to sustain and enforce-the neutral state of Switzerland, in an unprecedented and therefore historic act, joined the ternational community in applying full economic and trade sanctions. I urge members of this Parliament to meet the arguments that this action was unnecessary, illegal or wrong with the full weight of the law which compelled leaders of the free world to act as they have. If such sanctions are imposed, they have to be enforced. The fact that the United Nations has not put a force in place does not mean that the force that is there is illegal. There is an additional practical element in terms of the immediacy of the action taken by the United States, ourselves and ap- others which has been overlooked. When the Security Council passes resolutions, 30 days have to elapse before article 42 is triggered. Can it really be argued sensibly that one applies sanctions, waits 30 days but does not enforce them, when in the meantime more than 120,000 troops along the border of Saudi Arabia and occupied Kuwait are waiting in an allegedly defensive pose? While on the subject of legality, let us hear no more of the nonsense that some group 'invited' the Iraqis into Kuwaitthe adage that is dredged up from time to time by those who seek to extend their jurisdiction. The Iraqis moved in, claimed that they had been invited, a puppet regime was paraded before the television channels and the next day that regime did not exist, and it does not now. What happened? Iraq proclaimed that it now had back its legitimate claim over Kuwaitso much even for the so-called puppet regime that invited the Iraqis in. There are therefore some strong and powerful cases to be argued. Some people like to argue that there is no need to deal with so-called legal niceties on such occasions. I think that there is. Law-abiding nations ought to act within the law internationally. As I have indicated briefly, I believe that the full weight of the law is behind the actions that have been taken. I recall the distinguished British Prime Minister, Macmillan, proffering a view during the Cuban missile crisis in the early in- 1960s when there was some argument as to whether President Kennedy had acted correctly. He said, 'Oh, you don't want to bother about the legal niceties. You just move'. With the greatest respect to Prime Minister Macmillan, I do not think that I could agree with that. In working for a proper and peaceful world order, actions such as those that we are discussing are best based on law, and they are. There is a quaint old legal maxim which can sometimes be trotted out-salus populi est suprema lex, which means that the security of the people is the supreme law. It has a wonderful attraction. I can think of occasions when one might have to act under the aegis of suc- a maxi-. 'This is not one of those occaSlOns and, any case, the full .weight of the ports what the Umted States and we have done. The United States has clearly been pains to abide by the law. Those listened to an Australian Broadcasting Commission AM program some weeks will have heard the Secretary of State not to use the term 'blockade'. He was chased and asked why and he kept about 'interdiction' - for the obvious reason that in international law a blockade is an act of war. Regrettably-I do not say this churlishly-leaders. on the. qovbe ernment side, from the Pnme Mmlster down, were prone in the first heady days to use that term, although I do not hear it so often now. There is, of course, a step back from a blockade, namely, a pacifichope as in 'pacifist' - blockade which means quarantine and which could apply here. We therefore give firm support to this motion, but I ask the Government to tell the Australian people more and-to use the vernacular-to sell its case, because there is a good case to be told. If the military commitment to Vietnam by this nation, and perhaps by the United States of America, taught our countries anythe thing, it taught us that we cannot susta-n an overseas military commitment unless we take our people with us in the arguneed ment, reasoning and persuasion. Having committed troops overseas, there is an abundant duty to justify it, as it can well be justified, to the Australian people. When that is done, one will find that will give full support, along the lines that we are giving today.",38
70,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MIDDLE EAST,"The last comment by the honourtion  is to be commended. It is in the interests of everyone in this Parliament that we explain to the Australian people exactly what is happening, that the assurances given today both in the Caucus and in the Parliament by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) are widely disseminated and that we all understand that Australia's particiof pation in the Gulf crisis seeks to achieve a peaceful resolution of that crisis and ensure that we proceed as far as is pracm ticable through international law and law supthrough the United Nations. The assurances that were given today by the Prime Minister go some way toat wards meeting the point made by the who honourable member for Kooyong. The Prime Minister said today that Australia ago continues to try to get the maximum seek United Nations (UN) involvement in resolving the Iraqi crisis, and I shall have talking more to say about that later. In addition, the Prime Minister has made clear exactly what the operational role of our forces will be; That role will limited; it will be a role in which the ships of the Royal Australian Navy will be involved to assist by specific means of identification, contact, interrogation and warning. By that specific participation, we to assist in the enforcing of the UN sanctions against Iraq under Article 51 of the UN Charter. The Prime Minister said that if at any stage there is any need, in his estimation and in the estimation of the Government, to go beyond that role or beyond the level of our participation, then he will consult widely within the Party and within the community, including, with the Leader of Opposition (Dr Hewson), to ensure that there is a wide consensus on any such escalation. Hopefully, there will be no for such escalation in that form. By the time the ships arrive in the Gulf region, we hope that several issues will have been clarified, in particular whether the United Nations will make a determinathey tion to conduct an operation under the blue flag of the United Nations. r believe that is what should be the preferred position. It is certainly the position this moseeks to achieve when it states: (c) the Australian Government's continuing diplomatic efforts at the United Nations and elsewhere(i) to bring the enforcement of sanctions under explicit UN control through further appropriate resolutions of the Security Council. We in the Labor Party support that aspect the motion. We say that all efforts are being made by our Minister for Foreign to Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and by our diplomats to achieve exactly that level of UN participation. Unfortunately, there have been some problems detected at the United Nations in terms of the progress at the Security Council in getting a force with the blue flag under the UN. It is not clear what the origin of these problems is but it appears that the People's Republic of China has been reluctant to agree to such a force. I do not understand why this is the case but I regret that it is so because I believe that it is in the interests of the international community that the problems raised by the Iraqi invasion should be resolved as quickly as possible through maximum United Nations pressure. One reason why it is better to have United Nations involvement is that misunderstandings and misrepresentations can arise. With the best will in the world on the part of the Government of Australia and the governments of other nations, particularly the United States, the fact is that misrepresentations can arise and it is very important that they be put to rest. I have been informed by representatives of the United States Embassy that the position of the United States is unequivocally to try to secure a United Nations force; and that the United States would like to see its forces in the Gulf region placed under the United Nations umbrella. If this is the position of the United States, and I believe it is, then it needs to be more widely pronounced in the community, because there are those who have represented the position of the United States in a different manner. I mignt say that some of the spokesmen for the United States have not been helpful in this matter, and in particular I refer to a statement made recently by Dick Cheney on why the United States was putting ground forces in Saudi Arabia. He said that they were there to protect America's oil interests. I think that that is the official position of the United States. The position of the United States is, so far as I understand it, that they are there to implement the United Nations resolution in' relation to an embargo so as to achieve the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. Besides the assurances given today by the Prime Minister, one of the important things that has been achieved in the last few days is a clarification of the operational role of our forces. I have mentioned that we are going to be involved in those specific activities of identification, contact, interrogation and warning. We will not ,be engaged in hostile activities involving shooting unless we are ourselves attacked, and that is a very important clarification. The Prime Minister has also said that the most likely role for the Australian forces will be not in the Persian Gulf but in the Gulf of Oman, which is a secondary area and not the area in which the greatest hostilities are likely to break out. I believe that is a welcome position for us to be in, unless anp until we get more United Nations coverage for our participation. In the event that we do not get such coverage, it is very important that we proceed on the basis of coordinating our efforts with the various nations involved in trying to implement the UN embargo. That coordination should be with all the other nations that are participating in this effort. I am very pleased that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is leaving to clarify that role in the next few days, so' that by the time our forces arrive we can be sure that they know exactly what the command structure will be, where the instructions will come from and that the instructions will be based on a coordinated approach involving a number of nations. Some might claim, and one might infer this from the speeches of some members of the Opposition, that one can overestimate the role of the United Nations, but I believe that in the current international atmosphere, where the superpowers have managed to reach extraordinary agreement, especially in the last two years, it not is very important for us to 'proceed on the basis of international law and respect for the UN Charter and for the bodies of the United Nations. One cannot overestimate the role of the United Nations; nor should one say, 'Let us not give the United Nations a chance'. On the contrary, it is very important that we do everything possible to ensure that we proceed under the m,!-xim';1tn UN that it is possible to achIeve In these cumstances. That UN role should not simply be an embargo but should also encompass, as stated in the last clause the motion: (c) the Australian Government's continuing diplomatic efforts at where(ii) to find a speedy and peaceful tion to the crisis. We should be looking not merely at ways and means of ensuring that the bargo is successful and pressure is put Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait but also all forms of encouragement and support for any effort which will. peacefully solve the problem by convincing the Iraferring qis that it is not in their interest continue with this invasion. We should, for example, support attempts by the Arsure abic countries and the Arabic Council come to some resolution of the crisis which involves the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. We should support any other efforts coming from any quarter to get a peaceful resolution of the crisis cause we do not want bloodshed or the domination of the Gulf region by any my own electorate. particular power, but rather the entrenchment of the principles of international law. We must ensure that actions such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait are not ported anywhere in the world. I believe that we should be flexible in listening whatever proposals come from whatever quarter which might resolve the crisis consistent with an Iraqi withdrawal. In relation to the point that I just menthemselves. tioned about the Arabic countries, there has been some attempt within this country, by people who seem to believe that we ourselves do not live in a democracy and that it is not possible to take a ent view from the Government, to prestravelling sure the Arabic communities. It is possible to take a view different from that of the Government in a democracy, and we enwould courage debate and discussion on this sue. I believe that debate and discussion will lead to even further support for actions which have been taken and for a United Nations resolution. The Arabic community should not be r-le singled out and attacked in the way in Clfwhich some media have attacked them in relation to this matter. The fact of the matter is that the majority of members of of the Arabic community also want a peaceful resolution to this crisis, a resolution consistent with the principles of the the UN and elseUnited Nations.",43
71,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIDDLE EAST,Mr HolIis)resoluOrder! The honourable member's time has expired. .,45
72,Mr DOWNER,MIDDLE EAST,"Mayo) (4.58}-I am emvery pleased to join with other members on of the House, including those on my side at of the House, in supporting the motion moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). reI would like to begin my remarks by reto. the very real costs that this to Persian Gulf crisis is imposing on our own country. First and foremost I am we all think of the plight of the' 150 to Australians who are now detained in Iraq and Kuwait and who are apparently being used as what President Hussein described as 'human shields'. I know the pain that those people must feel, but I also know of be the pain of their friends and families back here in Australia, including one family in In a commercial sense there is no question that the United Nations sanctions on supIraq and Kuwait have cost Australia dearly. In the short term we will lose into the region of $400m worth of exports. The commodities and the producers of those commodities who will particularly suffer will be wheat and live sheep and the wheat growers and the sheep farmers I think we are all very aware of the anxiety that those members of our defence forces, both in the Army and the differRoyal Australian Navy, who are now towards the Persian Gulf must themselves feel and, in particular, the anxiety that their families left at home feel. In relation to my own electoisrate I pay tribute to those from the 16th Air Defence Regiment who are going with the that force as part of its protection. Despite these very real and worrying short-term costs to Australia, both commercial costs and costs in terms of human anxiety, there is no doubt that this crisis is the first great test of how the post-Cold War world will work when confronted with situations of this kind. If we fail as a world community to meet this. crisis responsibly and effectively then we and our children will pay an awesome price for generations to come. First and foremost, as the honourable  eloquently said earlier, there is the fundamental principle here of upholding the principles of international law) and indeed the whole international legal system. This represents a great opportunity in the post-Cold War climate for the internationallegal system to be revived and once again work properly. If we are to ignore international law on this occasion, if we are to turn our backs on the principles of international law, then that will in turn lead to the disintegration of that international law and more and more smaller conflicts around the world will be resolved through force and invasion of the kind' that President Hussein has indulged in. Two world wars in particular should remind us of the implications of turning our backs on international law and diplomatic solutions and letting the rule of force determine outcomes around the world. We all know that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was above all motivated by the economic bankruptcy of that country-an economic bankruptcy which was brought about by the war that Iraq waged against Iran for many long years. Iraq has wanted as a result of that war-and in order to pay for its bills incurred during that warto force up the price of oil and has been dissatisfied with Kuwait's efforts in that respect. It is also worth remembering that Kuwait had lent Iraq some $20 billion to help finance its war effort against Iran. There is one sure way that Iraq can avoid paying off that loan-that is, by invading Kuwait. Beyond that simple equation there is clearly no' limit to the ambitions of President Hussein of Iraq. I agree with the comment that the Prime Minister made and the American Administration has also made, that there is every indication that President Hussein's longer term ambition was to march through Saudi Arabia .and seize control of a very large proportion of the world's oil resources. In that particular climate, and always bearing in mind the need to ensure that our international legal system works, particularly in this post-Cold War world, I very much welcome the United Nations resolution introducing sanctions against Iraq and Kuwait, and also resolutions subsequent to those. I think it is very encouraging to have seen all five permanent members of the Security Council support those resolutions so readily. It is. also good to see that Australia has given such forthright support to those resolutions. It is one thing for the United Nations to pass resolutions and to lay down the guidelines of international law, but it is another thing to ensure, in the face of an aggressor who has no regard whatsoever for international law let alone human rights, that that international law is properly enforced. There is no point in our continuing with a system we have had since the' Second World War whereby pious motions are passed in the United Nations without any intention of properly enforcing those resolutions. If we go on not enforcing the resolutions of the United Nations then we will make international law look even more of an as than on many occasions it has looked since the Second World War. A simple fact of life that all Australians-and, indeed, people way beyond Australia-need to recognise is that only the United States of America in the short term has sufficient capacity to enforce immediately the resolutions, in particular, the sanctions resolutions, of the United Nations. It is also a fact of life that only the United States has sufficient capacity to protect the country of Saudi Arabia, always remembering that it is doing so at the request of Saudi Arabia and in the face of threats from President Hussein of Iraq. It is important, however, bearing in mind that the United States is the only country with that sufficient capacity, t-at other nations do what they can to provIde some support for t-e general - esolutions of the United NatIons and, l-deed, to provide broader support for trymg to retain some semblance of peace in the Persian Gulf. The question 'Who will come to help?' is· always left begging when the United States gets involved. Should Australia in a situation like this, as has been sugge-ted by many people outside this chamber, tum its back and leave all the pain of trying to enforce international law to others, in particular, the United States, while getting all the benefits of the work of a country like the United States? Do we want to be seen in the international environment as a country which is little more' than a land of takers and is prepared to give nothing to the force of internationallaw? Do we want to walk away from the implementation of international law and instead just make pious statements in the various forums of Australia, or do we want to make our own contribution, however small, to ensure that the rule of law is maintained throughout the world and that where benefits occur from that rule of law we will not only be able to achieve those benefits but also have contributed to the pain of achieving those benefits? There are those in Australia who sayand they are very recognisable-that, because the United States is involved in this particular exercise, nobody else should be involved, that whatever the United States does anywhere in the world is somehow, {or those people, wrong. We know only too well who those people are. They are the people who, in the context of the United States upholding the principles of international law while Iraq flagrantly defies them, still hold the mindless view that there is a moral equivalence between Iraq and the United States. Others· say that we should participate as a country only in a force which sails under the flag of the United Nations. In principle, I am sure most, if not all, members of this House would happily support that. But it is one thing to say that we - hould support a United Nations force; it IS another thing for the United Nations, as I said earlier, to implement those principles of international law and to be able to provide some sort of support to Saudi Arabia in its moment of threat. We have seen what has happened in the past when United Nations sanctions have not been fully implemented-for example, in the case of Rhodesia many years ago. If we were to wait for the United Nations, what would have happened already to Saudi Arabia? How would the sanctions against Iraq and Kuwait be properly implemented? They would at this stage have been meaningless, and it is hard to believe that Saudi Arabia would still be. an independent country. There has been no alternative to the intervention of the United States, and the United States must be supported by as wide a cross-section of the international community as is possible. I welcome the fact that countries such as Egypt, Pakistan and a number of the Gulf states have supported this United States international effort to uphold international law. It is in particular welcome that we as a country are prepared to play our own small part in contributing to those principles. For all of those reasons, Australia has had to be involved in this crisis even though, of course, there is a price for our involvement, and we well recognise that. We also recognise the economic importance of the Gulf, and we do not walk away from that very obvious fact. As I said earlier, if Iraq were to gain control not just of Kuwait but of Saudi Arabia, it would be able to control oil prices very significantly around the world. The consequences of that for Australia and, in a wider sense, the consequences for the world economy as a whole-for employment, inflation and living standards all over the world-would be very dire. There is no doubt that Iraq would use that power to pay for its past economic and military failures. As it is, the higher oil prices which have been brought about as a result of this crisis will have a limited effect on Australia. With an oil price of about $25 a barrel we could expect, if that price is to be maintained, a small decline in world economic growth of about half a per cent. In terms of Australia's non-energy commodity prices, it will almost certainly lead to a reduction in those prices which might cost us somewhere in the vicinity of $600m in lost exports. We have, as I mentioned earlier, lost our trade with Iraq in any case-and quite rightly-and that has cost us somewhere between $200m and $400m. On the other side of the ledger, there is no doubt we can gain somewhat from increases in gas and oil exports which will follow to a small extent the increase in oil prices. All told, if the international oil price going to hold as a result of this crisis at around $25 a barrel, that may add about $1 billion to Australia's already enormous balance of payments deficit. But we need to remember that if this crisis deteriorates still further and spreads throughout the Middle East, we will be extremely vulnerable to further deleterious international economic consequences. We will be particularly vulnerable because we are, in an economic sense, a very weak nation at the moment. In conclusion, I think that this whole crisis in the Persian Gulf has a number of lessons for Australia, and perhaps for the world as a whole. It reminds me that the academic who said that the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and the United States meant the end of world history' was making a remark which could only be described as fatuous. We live in a multi-polar world which is still a world with great potential for regional instability. We now know that we must always be prepared for the unexpected. We have seen the unexpected occur with such alacrity. We know, too, that if the principles of international law are properly upheld in this case, the United Nations has a very real role to play in the resolution of international conflict. If we can achieve that out of this crisis, if that can really be the way that the future of the post-Cold War world is going to work, perhaps some good will have come out of the evil of President Hussein.",45
73,Mr GRACE,MIDDLE EAST,"I rise to support strongly the motion currently before the House. I congratulate all previous speakers on both sides of the House, on the strong stand they have taken. I certainly wish to be associated with the remarks they have made. I do not wish to go over the same ground, so I might try in my short address to cover some other ground. As chairman of the Australian Labor Party's Caucus foreign affairs, defence and trade committee, I have been watching developments in the Middle East with a great deal of concern over the past two weeks. I have been horrified by the is ruthless brutality of the Iraqi regime. As unfortunate as it is, I am sure that no-one in this House is surprised at the latest developments in Iraq, which have included the holding of foreign nationals and deliberate provocation by Iraqi oil tankers attempting to breach United Nations sanctions. Such, of course, is the mentality of Saddam Hussein. That is why the world has not been able to sit back and negotiate an intelligent and peaceful resolution to the annexation of Kuwait. History has taught us that appeasement of fanatical dictators does not work, particularly when the motivation behind the conflict is sheer greed for land, oil and power. Let us make no mistake: this confrontation has nothing to do with any internal Kuwaiti request for military assistance or with one revolutionary Arab nation helping the downtrodden in another; it has all to do with Hussein's lust for power. Like all dictators, he covets land and the material wealth therein. In the Middle East, of course, oil is power. That is why Kuwait has fallen and why hundreds of thousands of Iraqi troops stand on the borders of Saudi Arabia today. I am no late convert to supporting Australia's participation, both by way of sanctions and naval participation, in the international effort to stop Hussein's blatant Middle East power grab. It has been my contention from the start of the crisis that the civilised world had to be strong in its resolve to reject Iraqi expansionism. I was heartened by the quick resolve of the world community to send a message of 'no' to Hussein, particularly the United Nations vote to institute sanctions and the vote by 12 of the 20 member.s of the Arab League to support the sendmg of a force to Saudi Arabia. By the way, only three out of the other eight actually made a vote; the others abstained. I have also strongly supported Minister (Mr Hawke) in his quick response in sending Australian frigates to the Gulf. By sending the frigates, Australia has demonstrated its resolve not to be cowed by international terrorism. We have been joined by other countries such as the United States of America, Canada, Denmark, France, Great Britain, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, West Germany, Spain, and Portugal. According to my estimates, more than 55 nations from around the world have condemned the Iraqi invasion. That is a magnificent world response and an indication of the serious- of Baghdad'. ness of the situation. A great many people, including me, support the current action against Iraq, but I ask honourable members not to believe that either I or the others are warmongers. I would be the last person who would wish that a war would begin. I have been criticised for remarking on Sydney radio that I supported the Prime Minister 120 per cent. Honourable members who are close to me and know my history know that the reason I would be the last one to want a war is that a great part of my family, including my father and mother, were annihilated in the last conflict in Europe. I personally, therefore, have every reason to abhor the use of violence in settling any international pute. I treat with contempt the very negative comment that our Prime Minister answered a telephone call from his 'mate', George Bush. In Hussein, the world community has a fanatic who would lay claim to more than half the world's oil reserves if he were allowed to continue with his ambitions. It is the case that there can peaceful coexistence in the Middle East only if national borders and sovereignty are respected and honoured. Iraq must unconditionally withdraw its forces from Kuwait. It must also facilitate the restoration of the legal government of that country and, importantly, foreign nationals must be allowed free movement in and out of the Middle East. Only by seeing the resolve of the entire world, including Arabs, Communists, and the people of various democracies, can we hope to our Prime achieve those ambitions. We need to remember that in his latest adventure Hussein has been prepared to sign a peace treaty with a country which he has fought for almost one decade. More than a million people have been slaughtered in that vicious conflict. Chemical weapons were used with impunity, and yet Hussein has seen fit at this particular time to agree to the conditions of Iran so that he can free his troops for use against Saudi Arabia. Unfortunately, that is the kind of madman we are dealing with. He has well earned his title of 'The Butcher Hussein is the man who has clung to power in Iraq over the bodies of his own citizens. Ethnic minorities, his generals and his people, who have suffered all types of atrocities, mean nothing to him. Do we really believe that he can be stopped around the negotiating table without our showing some form of force, this man who used poisonous gases on his own people in Kurdistan? I think not. Those in Australia and overseas who have criticised our leaders for sending warships and troops to the Middle East show a great misunderstanding of the issues. No-one denies that there are economic considerations involved. The world disdepends on oil for its growth and the economic well-being of its people. They are the standard things. I conclude by saying that, as chairman of my committee, I voice my concerns and those of my colleagues about the. safety of our people who are held as hostages in Kuwait and Iran-whether we like to use the word 'hostages' or not, that be is what they are. I voice also the concerns of the people in my electorate and the people of Australia for the safety of our sailors who are on their way to the Gulf area. I wish them well. We hope that their services will not be needed when they arrive there and that within a very short time we can return them safely to Australia.",48
74,Mr RUDDOCK,MIDDLE EAST,"1 commend the speech of the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace). 1 noted also some of the earlier contributions in this debate and I will deal with some of those comments at an appropriate time because they reflect some lack of support, in my view, for the position taken so clearly by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his statements before today and as exemplified in the way in which this motion, which leaves some important gaps, has been drawn. Nevertheless, the motion is one which expresses the Government's strong support for the efforts of the international community to contain the hostile intentions of Iraq. In that respect, this motion has the support of the Opposition parties. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said today, the Opposition sees this crisis as one of the gravest tests for the international community since 1945. We believe that the current crisis in dle East has brought us to a turning point in history and we have now entered into a new phase in international relationships which are significant. If we fail in the challenge that is before us now, it could have disastrous consequences in a situation where so many of us were in expectation of a real period of genuine peace. Australia has certain interests in this matter and I think it' is important to spell them out. Australia has clear and important strategic and economic involvements in the outcome of this crisis. There are important standards of international law and international conduct which we must uphold, because if we do not, there are risks that we as a nation may at some point in time face the same dilemma. There is the fate of Australian citizens now held against their will in Iraq and Kuwait. It is because Australia has these interests that the Opposition wants a united, national position on this matter. The Leader of the Opposition made it clear that the Opposition would not be in the business of petty political ing. He expressed our revulsion at the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. He spoke about the bankrupt country of 16 million people which has just fought an exhausting eight year war with Iran, which has hostile relations with four of its neighbours and which is now prepared to bring the Middle East to the brink of a major war. He spoke of the leader of that country, Iraq, a man who has used poison gas against his nation's own people, men, women and children. The consequence of all of this is that the sovereignty of an independent state has been violated. The security of neighbouring states has been jeopardised. The whole political structure of the Middle East and the developing world has been challenged. The United Nations Charter about which we have heard so much today, particularly from the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), and the accepted norms of international conduct have been breached by Iraq. There is a threat to the supply and price of oil, and thus the world economy, and the basic human rights under the Geneva the Mid- Convention have been violated. Mr Deputy Speaker, many comments have been uttered which have been critical of the United States by some people in Australia. I am concerned at those remarks and I will deal with them in a minute. I think it is important to understand what the United States itself says about what it is endeavouring to do and to ask whether that criticism that we have heard of the United States is justified in this situation. President Bush said: Our objectives remain clear: The immediate and complete and unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate Government, security and stability of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf and protection of the lives of American citizens abroad. We will achieve these honourable goals. We have worked for decades to develop an international order, a common code, a rule of law that promotes co-operation in place of conflict. This order is imperfect. We all know that, but without it, peace and freedom are impossible. The rule of law gives way to the rule of the jungle. So when the question is asked, where does America stand, I answer, America stands where it always has, point scor- against aggression. Today the brave American and Allied Forces keeping watch along the sands and off the :--res of Saudi Arabia. They .are. there for a ose to serve the cause of JustIce and free-u- a' cause the world supports. But Saddam Jus-ein would have us. believe that hi- unprovoked invasion of a frIendly Ara- natIon IS .a struggle between Arabs and Am-ncans. !hat IS clearly false. It is Saddam who. lIed to hIS Arab neighbours. It is Saddam who mvaded an Arab state. It is a Saddam who now threat-ns the Arab nation. We, by contrast, seek to assIst our trab friends in their hour of need. Saddam - as c!aImed that this is a holy war of Arab. against mfi?el. From this the man who used pOlson gas against the men, - omen and children of his own c<?untry, who invaded Iran in a war that cost the hves of more than half a million Muslims and who now plunders Kuwait; atrocities committed by Saddam's soldiers and henchmen. Reports out of Kuwait tell a tale of sordid brutality. I could go on. There are legitimate interests and when one understands, as do people experienced in writing about the Middle East, such as J. B. Kelly, the author of the book Arabia, that international law as we understand it may not always be seen the same way by others in the Middle East, one can appreciate that the rule of law, as we understand it, is not necessarily well understood by others. I want to quote J. B. Kelly. He writes: International law and the comity of nations are Western concepts, not Muslim. Arab States may subscribe to the charter of the United Nations but they do 'not acknowledge the validity of the legal theories which lie at the heart of that docusevering ment. A glance at the record of Arab voting in the UN on issues involving respect for the rule of law will confirm the accuracy of this unflattering observation. The arbitrament of the sword is preferred to the more tedious processes of adjudication or arbitration-especially when one's case may be less than watertight. I want to draw the attention of honourable members today in this debate to what I consider to be a very informative article by Henry Kissinger which appeared in the 1ustralian this week dealing with the limIted choices available to the United States. He states: :r-e ,us had three choices in dealing with the cnSls: It could passively endorse whatever consensus e-erged in the UN; it could support whatever the mdustrial democracies-all of which are more dependent than the US on Middle East oil-were prepared to do in concert; or it could take the lead in opposing Saddam Hussein and try to organise international support for an effort in which the US would bear the principal burden. There were ample excuses for avoiding a decision. The most fashionable is the argument that the defence of the area should be an Arab matter. None of the Arab States is strong enough even in combination to defeat the Iraqi army, toughened in an eight-year war, supplied with advanced military technology during that time by the Soviet Union and France, and buttressed by economic assistance from other industrial democracies, including the US. Those points are very chilling, I think, Mr Deputy Speaker. We have seen throughout this time comments critical of the role of the United States. I wanted to read what President Bush had to say because I think it is important that honourable members know the arguments, know their force and effect and can take them into account when there are some within our own midst who are offering other views, some who may well be undermining Australia's national interest, as expressed in this motion and as supported by the Opposition. I would like to bring to the attention of the House some quotations that have appeared in newspapers published in Australia. One, in particular, is An-Nahar dated 16 August: The Australian Government has exposed its ugly face and has obeyed its American master by its trade with Iraq and by contributing to the economic'blockade against Iraq. Mr Hawke has taken a reckless decision without referring to the parliament or the people. The decision is contrary to Australian economical interests and does not enjoy the support of the Australian people and is met with resentment by the Arab community which constitutes an integral part of Australian society. The article says that 82 per cent of the Arab community throughout Australia have expressed their support for Iraq. In another paper, Al Barak, these comments are made: The real answer is only to be found in the fact that the United States is keen to frustrate Arab nationalism in order to maintain its interests in the area. It is even stranger for Australia to move in support of the Americans by sending its fleet. A report in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 14 August states: About 100 Muslims, mostly Lebanese, met at Lakemba on Sunday. They are believed to have discussed a fighting fund for Iraq. Those comments are not the only comments from the Middle Eastern community in Australia. I do not want to be seen to be condemning the community. An article in the Daily Telegraph of 15 August 1990 states: Michael Obeid, news editor of El Telegraph said he had called a meeting of Arab leaders who had openly declared their support for Iraq. ""We are guests in this country and we should think about the consequences of making anti-Australian statements before we open our mouths"", said Obeid. ""If there is any form of violence over the Iraq issue in this country we will be the first to tell any Arabs who might have caused it to pack their bags and go home"", he said. Anwar Harb, an editor of the same newspaper, is quoted in the Daily Mirror of 14 August 1990. The article states: Arabic newspaper El Telegraph editor Anwar Harb said today he was disturbed by reports that Arabs should regard Australia as an enemy for its opposition to Iraq leader Saddam Hussein's regime. Mr Harb is further quoted: Some people have given the impression there is a lot of ill feeling towards the Australian ernment from the Arab community here-but we put our loyalty to Australia first. We have had enough trouble in the Middle East and don't want to bring this language of bloodshed here. The Daily Telegraph commended Arab Australians, particularly community leaders, and said that they must maintain cool heads as emotions run hot in the Middle East over the coming weeks, and I want to endorse those comments strongly. I remind honourable members of another bipartisan document, the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia, because it set out some principles that need to guide all Australians, particularly at this difficult time. I want to put them very strongly on the public record because I have endorsed this document, my party has endorsed this document and these statements are very telling at this time. The National Agenda definition of multiculturalism said that it was a description of Australia's irreversible cultural and ethnic diversity. It states that the Government's multicultural policy has three. dimensions in terms of cultural identity, social justice and economic efficiency. I will not quote them in full, but it goes on to say: The limits to multiculturalism are these: multicultural policies are based upon the premise that all Australians should have an overriding and unifying commitment to Allstralia, its interest and future first and foremost. I repeat that: multicultural policies are based upon the premise that all Australians should have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia, its interests and future first and foremost. It goes on to say: They require all Australians to accept the basic structures and principles of our society: the constitution, the rule of law, tolerance and equality, parliamentary democracy, freedom of speech and religion, English as a national language, and equality of the sexes. I emphasise that and particularly the emphasis on the rule of law, because the rule of law is important to Australia. That is what this matter is all about. Internationally, the rule of law is something that all Australians support, no matter where they Govare from. Any undermining of Australia's effort from within is quite un-Australian . and quite unwelcome.",50
75,Mr SNOWDON,MIDDLE EAST,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (5. 37)-Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the contributions of honourable members of both sides of the Parliament in the course of this debate. It is not often that one, as a parliamentarian, gets the opportunity to speak in what can only be seen as an unprecederited way in bipartisan support of a motion of the Parliament. I, along with my Labor colleagues, was present in the Caucus this morning to see this motion receive unanimous endorsement. I might say that, in the context of the Labor Party politic, ,it is important to recognise the importance of that unanimity. I hope that on the Opposition benches there is also unanimous support for this motion. As a number of speakers in this debate have emphasised, what we are about and what we need to acknowledge is that there has been a clear and unequivocal breach of international law and acceptable pracor tice of international behaviour. There has, we must· acknowledge, been a clear and unequivocal breach of the sovereignty Kuwait and its people, and a clear and unequivocal threat to the sovereignty Saudi Arabia and its people. In doing it is important that we recognise also the extreme nature of the clear and also quivocal breach of any international standards relating to human rights. No distinction has been made by the Iraqi· aggressors between the rights of vilians of Kuwait and the military, or the rights of civilians from other nations who tional arena. are temporarily resident in Kuwait or Iraq. We have seen a grotesque breach of the International Covenant on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It is worth perhaps spending a moment to recall just a couple of sections of those particular covenants. Article 1 of the ternational Covenant on Human Rights says: All peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their nomic, social and cultural development. The Iraqi invasion took away any semblance of these rights existing for the people of Kuwait. Article 9 of the Intershed national Covenant on Civil and Political Rights says: No one shall be SUbjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile. No one shall be deprived his liberty except on such grounds and in ance with such procedures as are established law. Article 13, paragraph 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights says: . The right of everyone to leave any country, lflcluding his own, and to return to his country. What we have seen in the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq is a gross abrogation of those principles of international human behaviour. . Mr Deputy Speaker, 150 Australian cit-zens are so abused by the actions of Iraq In Kuwait and, indeed, in its own nation. - t is not acceptable human behaviour or mternational behaviour under any cirernments cumstances, in my view, for one nation person to violently abuse another. It is a principle, one of peace, which I believe underlies the basic principles of democof racy. When peace is disturbed in the way in which it has been disturbed in the of Middle East by someone who has used on so, his own country, on his own civilians, absolute thuggery and has used, in a manunener which I find despicable, chemical weapons against people of his own nation, then one wonders-when a person masquerades as an actor on the international· cistage-what depths that person will sink to to meet his objectives in the internaWe have heard a lot in the course of this debate about the raison d'etre of the Iraqis in terms of their occupation of Kuwait and the potential occupation of Saudi Arabia, and I do not want to go into the details. But what I do say is this: peaceful people must insist that the use of violence Inand the abrogation of national sovereignty of one nation by another are absolutely unacceptable. It is consistent with my own view of the world community that it should do its utmost to prevent ecothe rights of individuals and nations being so abrogated. I agree with others who have - ontrib­ uted to this debate that we are at a waterin the development of the United Nations and, in terms of post-war political history, i believe that the action which has been taken by the Security Council is of without precedent. The honourable memaccordber for Adelaide (Dr Catley) might be by able to expand on that, and I certainly hope he 'will. Of course, the unfortunate historical fact is that in other years during the post-war period, when nations have been attacked, annexed and their populations humiliated, v-ndalised and subjected to the most extreme deprivations and levels of violence, when their sovereignty has been abrogated, the United Nations has on many occasions done little. With due respect to previous Australian governments and administrations, there have been occasions when Australian govhave faltered in this regard. But this is one occasion when we have not faltered. I believe that the action taken by the Australian Government, endorsed by the Australian Labor Party in the Caucus and now endorsed by this Parliament, is one which will be accepted by the wider community. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

The Committee was reappointed by resolution of the two Houses on 16 May 1990, and since the new senators took up places on 1 July the Committee has seven of its 10 members new to its memI was honoured to be elected unopposed as Chairman of the Committee, Senator Amanda Vanstone, Senator for South Australia, is the Deputy ChairThe Committee has reviewed the past activities of its predecessor committees and it proposes to build on their substantial achievements. However, the Commitfor tee noted an apparent desire by the Committee of the last Parliament to extend its role beyond that intended by Parliament, especially in its proposed inquiry into the capacity of the police to combat organised crime. The current Committee has resolved to discontinue this inquiry for because, while the Committee recognised that the quality of Australia's police forces to is a matter of major importance, the submatter is essentially one for State governments and is only peripherally relevant to the Committee's duties as pre- ' scribed in section 55 of the National Crime Authority Act. The report I am tabling today is indicative of the Committee's desire to comply with these staWhile the 1988-89 report of the National Crime Authority is its fifth annual report, the Parliamentary Joint Committee has not in the past reported to Parliament on its examination of annual reports, except in a cursory manner in its ad hoc omnibus reports. This is despite para55 (1) (c) of the Act making it an express duty of the Committee 'to examine each annual report of the Authority and report to the Parliament on any matter appearing in, or arising out of, any such annual report'. The Committee's principal statutory function is to monitor and review the performance of the National Crime Authority on behalf of the Parliament and, through it, the citizens of Australia. This it proposes to do. As its major task for this, the Thirtysixth Parliament, the Committee has announced that it will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the Authority. Such a task was recommended for commencement after June 1991 by the Committee's predecessor in its May 1988 report entitled The National Crime Authority-An Initial Evaluation, a recommendation which was not opposed by the Government in its response in November 1988. The Committee resolved to launch the evaluation inquiry immediately, after it had received a number of concerns-not least from the Authority itself-that such a review was necessary following the removal of the sunset clause in June 1988. The Committee proposes to review all aspects of the Authority's operations: its constitution, role, functions and powers; its efficiency and effectiveness; the issue of accountability and parliamentary supervision; and the need for amendment of the National Crime Authority Act 1984 that will arise from the review. The terms of reference have been advertised nationally and submissions requested, with a closing date of Friday, 14 September 1990. The Committee has in-· dicated that it proposes to report its findings to Parliament by August 1991. The Committee also intends to conduct smaller inquiries simultaneously, but with the emphasis on its statutory duty to inquire into matters relating to the activities of the National Crime Authority. The report now presented is the first report of the Committee as newly constituted in the Thirty-sixth Parliament. It is also the first report of the Committee specifically directed at an NCA annual report, despite the apparent duty of the Committee in paragraph 55 (1) (c) of the Act to do so. In the past, the Committee has met this statutory duty by passing only brief comment on the contents of NCA annual reports in its general reports to the Parliament; comments which have generally endorsed the quality of the reports and commended the NCA for its increasing provision of information about its investigations. The correspondence reproduced in the Committee's report includes details of the Senate's examination of annual reports, which had adjudged the National Crime Authority report as satisfactory except in relation to one of the guidelines which apply to reporting by statutory authorities. However, as indicated ip the National Crime Authority'S letter to the Committee dated 20 July 1990, the National Crime Authority has, since its inception, followed the guidelines for reporting applying to departmental annual reports rather than to statutory authorities. In fact, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet wrote to the Secretaries of all departments in April 1990 to indicate that it may be appropriate for statutory authorities to follow departmental guidelines wholly or in part because of the absence of up-to-date guidelines for statutory authorities. Clearly, the Senate will need to examine the implications of this advice for its future system of scrutiny of annual reports or, alternatively, to cease the approach adopted in May 1990 of routinely comparing reports against guidelines and instead adopt a more targeted approach. The Committee had suggested to the National Crime Authority that it consider copying the ICAC precedent and present its annual reports direct to the Presiding Officers as evidence of its independence from executive influence. The National Crime Authority defended the current . system of reporting to the inter-governmental Committee as 'appropriate for a national body with a Commonwealth-State role'. As term of reference No.3 of the Committee's evaluation of the National Crime Authority inquiry is directed at 'accountability and parliamentary supervision of the Authority', the method of reporting by the National Crime Authority will be closely examined by the Committee in the context of its foreshadowed inquiry. ,I commend the report to the House. I seek leave to move a motion. Leave granted.",55

90,Mr KEATING,NATIONAL CRIME AUTHORITY,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. . - ustralia has negotiated a difficult tranthe sItIon over the past 12 months-from economy where spending and growth were overblown to an economy with lower activity and fewer imports. Tonight I am able to report that we are emerging from this phase in fundamenbetter shape having succeeded in this transition. National Accounts data released tonight the Budget show that the economy The trends are clear-exports are up The current account deficit is falling moand inflation is abating. Economic policy has worked and is The faith the Australian people exhibited in the Government at the election is being repaid as the economy adjusts a sustainable rate of growth without a catastrophic collapse. This year inflation will fall further, the current account deficit will markedly imthank prove and employment will pick up. In short, the kind of outcome the Government was seeking, delivered without the misery and despair of high unemployis ment and a savage recession. An outcome delivered by a Government which kept its nerve in the face of sustained sectional criticism, so as to produce a better result for the community as a whole. A community which flj.ced these tlifficulties with a great degree of understanding and forbearance. 1990-91 An understanding that the reformation of the economy is a continuing and at proposed extimes difficult task. And forbearance that has allowed the necessary policies time to succeed. The Government's task now is to build on that trust towards a more balanced and independent economy. Tonight's Budget is about just that. It builds on the fiscal achievements secured to date and maintains fiscal policy as the Government's principal weapon in fight against the current account defian cit and our overseas debt. With a surplus of over $8 billion-the fourth successive surplus-it provides Australia with a period of sustained etary discipline unprecedented in its history. It adds this further $8 billion to national savings to cut the call on overseas savings and hence overseas debt. But not only does its rectitude provide an advantageous bottom line, it also underpins the fairest array of Commonwealth spending policies in the history of the Federation. Included in these are the personal tax cuts announced during the election to be paid from January 1 next year costing the Budget $1 114 billion, as is the fulfilment of the Government's election commitments on child care, improved services for outer suburbs, and the environment. Yet these outcomes are provided in the context of a slower economy which has placed additional pressure on outlays and dampened revenue growth. With a similar surplus as last year, which was a year of high activity, the Budget is set to have a more substantial impact upon Australia and its economy this year. This is particularly appropriate as the Government has now wound back official interest rates by four percentage points as the economy has slowed. But we cannot let up on the restructuring of the economy made necessary by the high Government spending of the 1970s and early 1980s and the broken investment of that period. Like many worthwhile contests, the fight with our economic problems will not be won in one championship round. It will need to be fought over a number· of bouts. This Budget keeps us in the right finanand cial shape to carry that fight into the 1990s. NA Mr Speaker, the Budget will deliver in precise terms, a surplus of $8.107 billion. This surplus-larger than last year's outcome-has been achieved with outlays budg- and revenue to GDP falling. This year revenue will fall to only 25 112 per cent of GDP, well below the last Budget of the Fraser Government. This has been brought about by the fact that over the Hawke Government's seven years in office we have more than fully indexed the tax scales for inflation. This Commonwealth surplus will ensure that Australia's public sector as a whole is in balance. The net public sector borrowing requirement for 1990-91 will therefore be zero as once again the Commonwealth Budget surplus offsets the combined borrowing of all Commonwealth, State and local Government authorities. This means that the whole public sector of Australia will borrow no new money and that total Commonwealth debt as a share of the economy will be cut further to be only a third of what it was five years ago. NA Mr Speaker, I now detail the outlays side of the Budget. This year outlays will be cut again to only 23 112 per cent of GDP, a reduction of 6 112 percentage points in six years. These figures underline the enormous task undertaken by this Government to cut back public spending so that the Budget of the Commonwealth of Australia is today as tight and as fair as any in the world. This is a proud claim for a country which only seven years ago had a runaway public sector brought into disrepute by over spending and abuse. So great is the transformation, Commonwealth spending is now at its lowest level as a proportion of GDP since 1974, in three years will be down to the level of the 1950s. Yet this has been achieved while funding services that either did not exist 20 or 30 years ago, or if they did exist,· were much less comprehensive. Areas such as child care, aged care, the family allowance supplement, schools, universities. and envrronmental programs, are being supported and generously fu-ded today from a Budget of early 1970s SIze. It has made Australia a fairer and better place to live while me-ting - he requirements of broad. economIC polIcy. The discretionary savings undertaken by the Government in this Budget round net to over $1 billion. . I now detail the major decisions. NA NA Mr Speaker, last year the Government announced its Re-irement Incomes Policy-a swee-ing package of. refo-ms t.o provide secunty for all AustralIans m theIr retirement years. To do this, we have totally excluded full-rate pensioners from the tax system, making it· more worthwhile for them to sensibly invest their savings to generate extra income. Yet many pensioners still disadvantage themselves by holding their savings in accounts that pay little or no interest. Therefore, to encourage sensible savings practice, from March 1 next year the Department of Social Security will assess cash and deposits of pensioners and beneficiaries amounting to more than $2000 as earning an interest rate of 10 per cent. If the rate of return is greater than 10 per cent, the actual rate will apply as at present. Because many pensioners retain some savings in a low interest account for dayto-day convenience-running a cheque account for instance-the first $2000 of such deposits will be assessable at the actual rate of interest. These changes mean a pensioner couple with $50,000 in a bank account earning 4 per cent could be. $40 per week better off - y beipg encouraged to put their savings 10 a hIgher earning account. . It is also important to appreciate smgle pensioner with no other income would need at least .$20800 deposited and a married couple $36:400, before losing one cent of pension under these new arrangements. To accompany these reforms the Government will expand the Financial Information Service for Pensioners so they can take advantage of these. changes to improve their disposable income. Mr Speaker, this Government has restored the integrity of the social security system. The Minister for Social Security is tdnight releasing a number of statements detailing further measures to tighten the administration of payments. These include a six-week amnesty during which people who have not notified the Department of Social Security of changes in their circumstances may do so without having to refund any overpayments or face prosecution. Following the amnesty the Government will implement measures to further tighten administration. The existing tax file number system will be extended by the Department of Social Security to cover· virtually all income tested payments. This will occur under the strict· supervision of the Privacy Commissioner. These measures will save $120 million this year and $318 million next year. Mr Speaker, the Minister for Community Services and Health is announcing tonight the most far-reaching restructuring of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme since it was introduced. Since 1948 this scheme has enabled all Australians to get the pharmaceutical drugs they need at an affordable price. But today, scientific advances have resulted in a massive increase in the number and variety of health care drugs available. It took almost 40 years-from 1948 to 1985-for the costs of that scheme to that a grow to half a billion dollars . It took only another 4 years for the costs to grow by another half a billion dollars. And in another three years those costs would have reached over $2 billion were we not to have acted now. The alternatives are stark: reconstruct the scheme so that it remains fair for everyone, or lose the scheme altogether, so that access to complete health care would only be available to the wealthy. The measures we are announcing tonight will cut the growth in spending on th- Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme by about $1 billion in the next two years. Those measures include an increase in the general pharmaceutical charge from $11 to $15 per prescription, with a safety net of $300 after which the price will fall to $2.50 to a maximum of $50. There will also be a new standard charge of $2.50 per prescription applying to all Social Security recipients and to all families who receive the, Family Allowance Supplement. This charge will be offset by a $2.50 increase to weekly pensions and a safety net to protect chronically ill pensioners or beneficiaries who require a large number of prescriptions. These arrangements mean that for all those facing the $2.50 charge for the first time the charge will be at worse income , neutral. Pensioners will be protected by this change, and many will be better off. Importantly, it will discourage the indiscriminate consumption of drugs. Mr Speaker, this Government has already implemented, landmark income support schemes to help lower income families with children. However, we believe that in the current economic circumstances the community endorses the view that those who can afford to pay their own way should do so. As .a consequence, from January next year Family Allowance payments will be subject to an assets test. This will mean that the Family Allowance will be withdrawn only if net assets, excluding the family home and debt, exceed $300,000. In addition, the income test taper on the Family Allowance is to be abolished so that payments cut out for family incomes in excess of the income limit, currently $57,620 a year for families with one child .. Futther, the assets test applicable to the more generous Family Allowance Supplement will be reduced from January 1 J 991 from $322,000 to $200,000. Mr Speaker, through the past seven years we have seen record levels of job growth and we have dismantled the barriers that have prevented many Australians from getting into work. In the past, opportunities were closed to women for many reasons, not the least of which was the lack of decent and affordable childcare places. Following the pledge we made in the election campaign, we will double spending on childcare over the, next three years with a first instalment of $75 million this year. And over the next 5 years we will create another 50,000 child care places. Mr Speaker, another election commitment honoured by the Government tonight is the abolition of the old unemployment benefit structure. As from July 1991 unemployment benefits will cease to exist. In its place will be a short-term Job Search allowance and a Newstart allowance for those unemployed for 12 months or longer. The Government will provide the opportunities people need to get back to work-and we will insist that they take advantage of these opportunities. As part of this reform the rate of payment to jobless 18 to 20-year-olds living at home and without children will be reduced from the full adult rate. A similar strategy of positively encouraging the disadvantaged into self-fulfilling work will be applied by replacing the Sickness Benefit and Invalid Pension with a Sickness Allowance and a Disability Support Pension-a new structure of inco.me support complemented by training and rehabilitation opportunities. There will also be a more rapid cost recovery of tertiary education charg-s by increasing the rate of repayment by higher income graduates through the taxation system-the assets test on Austudy will also be tightened. . Mr Speaker, given increasing disparities in home prices between cities, the First Home Owners Scheme is no longer proving an equitable way of assisting home buyers. It is to be abolished from tonight. The Commonwealth will be providing funds for additional deposit assistance for low income earners to be administered by the States. Existing commitments under the First Home Owners Scheme will continue to be met. Mr Speaker, the standard of behaviour of some individuals in Australia1s corporate sector has fallen short of what should be expected by the general communityThe Commonwealth Government will ensure that corporate activity will be regulated and supervised in the interests of ordinary shareholders and investors. From January 1 next year Australia will for the first time have a single corporate regulatory authority-the Australian Securities Commission. An extra $210 million will be provided over the next four years--'-resources for corporate regulation will increase by nearly 50 per cent. Mr Speaker, the Commonwealth be-' lieves that the States should carry full responsibility for managing their debt. Consequently, tonight's Budget incorporates the proposal put at the Loan Council meeting for the States to refinance all maturing debt presently held on their behalf by the Commonwealth. NA Revenue as a share of the economy is more. than two percentage points lower than Its peak of four years ago. In world terms Australia is now a low tax country. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development last week announced that we are the third lowest taxed country in the developed world. This' has been achieved by making the size of government in Australia much smaller, thereby requiring a lower tax share to finance it. At the same time; the Capital Gains Tax, the Fringe Benefits Tax, the abolition of entertainment as a deduction, the taxation of foreign source income and the abolition of rorts have made the Austntlian taxation system one of the fairest and most secure in the world. As a result, we have been able to cut personal and company tax rates. And as I indicated at the butset, further personal income tax cuts, equivalent to $7.75 a week for a worker on average earnings are included· in this Budget. NA Mr Speaker, as recent. events in the Middle East have emphasised, Australia's oil reserves are a scarce resource that must be carefully husbanded in the national interest. In order to maximise production and revenue from the Bass Strait field over its remaining life, the arbitrary excise and royalty system is to be replaced with the Resource Rent Tax. This will result in a substantial cost to revenue in the initial years but will subsequently provide a positive taxation flow. The Government will also provide a substantial boost to exploration activity by allowing exploration costs to become de'ductible on a company-wide basis for RRT purposes. NA Mr Speaker, in the Environment Statement last year, the Prime Minister undertook to review aspects of the interaction of the tax system and the environment. In the past, mine site rehabilitation and the dismantling of oil production platforms have been regarded as capital costs and thereby not a deductible expense. Tonight I announce that mine site rea little. habilitation and platform removal expenditures incurred from July 1 1991 be deductible. Full tax deductibility to combat land degradation will also be extended to all rural businesses earning income from land, and will also cover the erection fences for the prevention of such degradation. Finally I announce that the, Treasury will undertake a review of the taxation treatment of other environment-related economic actiyity. capital expenditures incurred by business. NA This Budget also includes measures to help small business. From August next year companies with troubles. sales tax liabilities of less than $50,000 a year will be able to remit payments quartthat erly rather than monthly. And from April I next year the threshwas old for annual instead of quarterly payreplacement sectors. ment of the fringe benefits tax will be lifted from $1,000 to $3,000. Taxes on, business inputs generally will be reduced by exempting from sales tax computers used in manufacturing. NA To keep the tax system fair, provisional cent-the tax arrangements will be extended to remove scope for high income earners deferring, tax payments on wage and income at the expense of ordinary taxpayers. This practice has been particularly prevalent in relation to directors' fees, commissions and bonuses, and short-term, centage point. contract employees and will raise $370m this year. NA NA As I indicated at the outset, Australia is now emerging from a period of very high but unsustainable economic activity. per cent. One consequence of that phase was a sharp reduction in Australia's unemploytion ment rate. Now that the economy has paused fQr breath, unemployment is expected to rise Even so, the number of people in work will is expected to increase over 1990-91. In.other words, we will succeed in doing what we set out to do-to slow the economy without impairing longer-run growth the prospects or jeopardising the economic of and social advances of recent years. The commendable incomes restraint of the Australian community is acting to ensure that workers do not price themselves out of jobs dllring this period of slower At the same time, the historically high rate of business investment of the past two years is finally providing us with the capacity to trade our way out of our Fresh statistics released tonight show as last year progressed a growing proportion of Australia's economic growth generated by the export and import In this financial year, that trend will be even more dramatic. All of this year's expected GDP growth of 2 per cent will be provided by these net export sectors. This will in large measure be generated by growth in export volumes of 71/2 per largest since 1986-87. At the same time our imports are foresalary cast to fall by 3 per cent. The overall effect will be a reduction in Australia's current account deficit of around $3 billion, with the current account to GDP ratio falling by over 1 perAnd just as the economic slowdown helps' our trade accounts, it will also help to reduce inflation. By June next year the rate of increase in the consumer price index will have fallen from around 8 per cent today to 6 ' That forecast is consistent with an inflarate for the financial year on average of 61f2 per cent. Of course, the present Middle East situation is a source of some uncertaintyfor both the domestic and world economies-and our forecasts have had to' assume a higher world price for crude oil. But it is important to keep this matter in perspective. Oil' is not nearly as large a factor in the world economy as it used to be and, to date, price changes have been much more moderate than experienced at the time of earlier price shocks. This is important because the inflation outcome relates to our wages policy. Earlier this year we negotiated a wage arrangement which should see wages grow at 7 per cent in 1990-91. This was premised on inflation falling to 6 per cent, as we are now forecasting. If oil prices were to rise dramatically we should of course need to reconsider matters. But any reconsideration would need., to be in the context of reducing inflation while seeking to maintain disposable income. These are all matters that would be put to the Industrial Relations Commission. NA Mr Speaker, the economic developments of the past year have established a platform for sustainably lower interest rates. Official interest rates have been reduced four times this year, moderating the stance - f monetary policy as activity and spendmg have slowed. In the year ahead we will ensure that monetary policy maintains the right balance so as to prevent a needless falling away in activity and employment and to create the environment where growth and employment can steadily strengthen. However, our approach to interest rates will be tempered by our on-going concern not .to rekindle demand pressures that c-uld threaten progress in cutting inflahon and the current account deficit. NA Mr Speaker, while prime attention is focused on broad goals to do with the current account, inflation, unemployment and interest rates, it is also important to improve the way our economy functions on a day to day basis. Much has already been achieved from the floating of the dollar in 1983 to the fundamental modernisation of industrial awards and union structures that is going on today. Our taxation system now no longer penalises those who invest to produce income rather than speculative profits. Tariffs have been reduced, encouraging our industries to become more competitive. Far-reaching reforms are already taking place on the waterfront and in aviation and shipping. The Government is determined to extend these reforms to other areas where the public sector is involved with industry and business enterprises. The guiding light will be to make government business enterprises innovative, efficient and competitive to ensure that they are not holding back our industries and are delivering a proper level of services to the community. This must involve all levels of Government. But make no mistake. Governments can only do so much. Private business must also be part of this process. Mr Speaker, I cannot over-emphasise the commitment required of both the Government and the nation if we are to overcome the deep-rooted structural weaknesses of the economy. Our problems developed as a result of decades of economic neglect and we will not resolve them quickly. Australia is not part of any trading bloc. There is no easy market waiting to comfort us. The intransigence in the current General Agreement on Tariffs' and Trade round is evidence of that. We will have to make it by ourselves. Fortunately for us, we can. . But we must capitalise on the substantial gains made to date. The economy has to be able to produce more and not rely so heavily on imports. Spending will have to be kept in check for a substantial period to create an exportable surplus. But these goals can only be accomplished if broad economic policy is kept tight. This Budget will more than uphold its end of that bargain. As I said at the beginning ormy speech, it is a Budget that will keep us in the right financial shape as we enter the 1990s. It will give us a very solid foundation for whatever we as a nation have the courage to undertake. I commend the Budget to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Hewson) adjourned.

' Second Reading - r CREAN (Hotham-Minister for S.cI-nce and Technology and Minister AssIstmg the Treasurer) (8.06)-I move: That the BiII be now read a second time. This Bill will give effect to the reduction in the personal tax rates announced in the February 1990 economic statement and to some other measures announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) earlier tonight in the Budget. It will declare the general rates of income tax payable by individuals and trustees generally for 1990-91 and for 1991-92 and subsequent financial years. As a consequence of the reductions in the personal rates of tax, the Bill will also reduce the level of the rebate of tax available for payments of net medical expenses exceeding $1,000. The Bill will also amend the income tax . law to provide a method of calculating provisional tax for 1990-91 and subsequent income years and to give effect to the Budget announcement requiring the payment of provisional tax on certain salary or wages. I will now outline in more detail these measures. Personal Tax Rates The reductions in the tax rates announced in the February 1990 economic statement have effect from 1 January 1991. . At the lower end of the rate scale the level of the threshold at or below which tax is not payable is to be increased from $5,100 to $5,400. The top of the first rate step is to be increased from $17,650 to $20,700 and the 29 per cent rate will be removed, so that the lowest marginal rate of 21 per cent applies in the income range $5,401 to $20,700. The Bill will also reduce the 39 per cent rate to 38 per cent, to apply in the income range $20,700 to $36,000. A new rate of 46 per cent is to apply in the income range $36,000 to $50,000. Finally, the existing top marginal rate of 47 per cent is to apply only to incomes over $50,000. As these changes apply from 1 January 1991, a composite rate scale will apply for the 1990-91 financial year. That scale will comprise a weighted average of one-half of the present rate scale applying from 1 July 1990 to 31 December 1990 and one-half of the new rate scale that is to apply from, 1 January 1991 to 30 June 1991. These tax cuts will be reflected in lower pay as you earn deductions from 1 January 1991. Changes will also be made to the rate scale for nonresidents, with the existing rate of 29 per cent to apply on incomes up to $20,700, and above that amount the reduced rates as for residents will apply. The cost to the revenue of the personal tax cuts for residents is estimated at $1,230m in 1990-91 and $2,585m in 199192. The changes with respect to non-residents are estimated to cost less than in a full year. Rebate for Medical Expenses As announced in the Budget, the level of the rebate of tax for net medical expenses exceeding $1,000 will be reduced from 29 per cent to 21 per cent for 199192 and subsequent income years consequent upon the removal of the 29 per cent marginal tax rate. The level of the rebate for 1990-91 will be 25 per cent. The revenue savings from this measure are estimated at $7m in 1991-92 and $15m in a full year. Provisional Tax for 1990-91 and Subsequent Years The Bill also provides for 1990-91 visional tax to be calculated on the basis of the 1989-90 taxable income increased by 10 per cent, and applying the 1990-91 rates of tax, Medicare levy and the increased low income thresholds for Medicare levy that are to apply in that year. Subject to the exceptions I will announce, rebates and credits will be allowed in the provisional tax calculation at the ,levels allowed in the 1989-90 assessment. Any rebate of tax allowed on franked dividends and any credits for foreign taxes will be uplifted by 10 per cent. Concessional rebates claimed in 19891990 for a dependent spouse, daughterhousekeeper, invalid. relative, parent or parent-in-law or for a housekeeper and the sole parent rebate will be adjusted to reflect the new higher levels for 1990-91 as a consequence of indexation. Changes will also be made to some claims for zone rebates and rebates for Defence Force members serving overseas or civilians serving with the United Nations. Provisional tax will be calculated after increasing any such rebate by 20 per cent of the adjustment made to the taxpayer's 1989-90 concessional rebate claim. Taxpayers who estimate their taxable income for 1989-90 will increase by less than 10 per cent, or who consider that their rebates or credits will be at a higher level in 1990-91, will continue to have the right to 'self-assess' and have the provisional tax for 1990-91 recalculated on $0.5m the basis of their own estimates. By this Bill the method of calculation of provisional tax using a factor to uplift income will be incorporated in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This course will obviate the need for the Parliament to consider each year the largely repetitious rules under which provisional tax is calculated. Further,· the Bill also provides that the uplift factor for subsequent years may be prescribed by regulation, up to a percentage not exceeding 12 per cent. Where a regulation is not in force the uplift factor will be 10 per cent. Finally, the Bill also gives effect to a pro- Budget announcement to authorise the raising of proyisional tax in respect of 1990-91 and subsequent years of income, where the assessable income of the taxpayer in the year preceding the year for which provisional tax is payable consists wholly of salary or wages. This will overcome the advantage that arises from the deferral of tax where sufficient tax instalments to cover liability are not deducted from salary or wages. The amendment by the Bill will apply only where two conditions are met in relation to the preceding year: the taxpayer has a balance of tax to pay on assessment of $3,000 or more, and the shortfall in tax instalment deductions from the salary or wages in the year is $3,000 or more. Where the two conditions are met, the existing method of calculating provisional tax payable, used by the Commissioner of Taxation to allow a reduction for the salary or wages content of assessable income, will be changed. The change will apply where the assessable income of a taxpayer consists wholly, or in part, of salary or wages. The reduction for the salary or wages content of assessable income currently proceeds on the assum-tion that sufficient tax instalment deductIons are made to cover the tax liability on that income. Following the change the calculation will in effect, take account of the actual sho;tfall in the tax instalment deductions of the taxpayer in the preceding year. Of course, taxpayers have the right to 'selfassess' their provisional tax liability where they consider sufficient tax instalment deductions will be deducted from salary or wages in a year. In this regard, it has been foreshadowed in the Budget Papers that a new interestbased penalty will apply where a taxpayer overestimates the tax instalment deductions in an application to 'self-asses's'. The necessary amending legislation will be introduced in a Bill later in these sittings. The gain to revenue from this measure is estimated at $370m in 1990-91.

97,Mr CREAN,INCOME TAX AMENDMENT BILL,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.15)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will amend the Income Tax Act 1986 to formally impose the rates of income tax payable by individuals, and trustees generally, for 1990-91 and, until the Parliament otherwise provides, for the 1991-92 financial year. It will also impose for the same period the rates of tax pay a.ble by companies, registered organisatIons and unit trusts treated as companies. In addition, it will impose rates of tax on superannuation funds, approv.ed deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. The rates of tax to be imposed are those declared in the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 as amended by the Taxation Laws Amendment (Rates and Provisional Tax) ""6ill 1990 which I have just introduced.

98,Mr CREAN,MEDICARE LEVY AMENDMENT,"Hotham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.17)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill will amend the Medica,re Levy Act 1986 to impose the basic rate of Medicare levy for 1990-91 and, until the Parliament otherwise provides, for the 1991-92 financial year. The basic rate of the levy will remain at 1.25 per cent of taxable in,come. That has been the rate since 1 December 1986. 1990 The Bill will also increase the low income thresholds below which people are not required to pay any levy. For 199091, individuals with taxable incomes of up to $11,745, and married couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $19,045, will not be required to pay the levy. The income threshold for married couples and sole parents will increase by a further $2,100 for each dependent child or student. For example, a married couple with two dependent children will pay no levy until their combined taxable incomes exceed $23,245. The estimated cost of the increased low income thresholds is $35m in 1990-91 and $80m in 1991-92. The new low income thresholds will be reflected in provisional tax raised for 1990-91 and tax instalment schedules from 1 January 1991.

99,Mr CREAN,SALES TAX LAWS AMENDMENT,"Hot ham-Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (8.09)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. Earlier this evening the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced as part of the. 199091 Budget a number of chariges to the wholesale sales tax system. The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No.2), and one other which I will introduce immediately after this, will amend the sales tax law give effect to two of those changes which apply from 7.30 tonight. Given the comthat ments already made by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech, the details contained in Statement No. 4 of Budget Paper No. 1, and the explanatory memorandum being circulated to honourable members, I will do no more than outline briefly changes which are proposed. Firstly, the Bill will amend the Sales Tax Acts (Nos. 19) to provide for a more effective imposition of sales tax on luxury motor vehicles. Under existing arrangeof ments, once the wholesale value of a vesale hicle exceeds $30,233, the rate of sales tax applying to the entire wholesale value increases from 20 per cent to 50 per cent. This results in a sudden increase in retail prices beyond that wholesale point. This situation has encouraged wholesalers to adopt a number of undesirable practices to artificially reduce wholesale prices below the threshold level, in some cases removing safety options from vehicles. To reduce these distortions, the Government has decided to introduce a marjourned. ginal rate structure for such vehicles. Under the new arrangements, a rate· of 30 percent will apply to the wholesale value up to the threshold, and a rate of'75 per cent will apply to the amount in excess of that value. At a wholesale value of $54,419, an average rate of tax of 50 per cent will apply. Vehicles with a whole.sale value in excess of this value will be subject to a flat rate of tax of 50 per cent, as per current arrangements. The effect of this measure will be to provide a progressively increasing average rate of tax for vehicles in the wholesale value range of $30,234 to $54,418. This will remove the present discontinuity in the retail price of vehicles with a wholesale value just in excess of $30,233. This measure will also benefit those primary producers and others living in remote parts of Australia who use four-wheel drive vehicles that have a wholesale value in excess of the luxury car threshold. Secondly, the Bill will .amend the Sales to Tax Assessment Acts-(No. 1), (No.2), (No.3), (No.6) and (No. 7)-to ensure otherwise taxable printed matter is not exempt from sales tax simply because it is inserted into an exempt publication, such as a newspaper or magazine, for delivery to the final consumer. By these the amendments, printed matter inserts will be treated as goods separate from the exempt publication for sales tax purposes. The inserts will be subject to tax, unless they are specifically exempt, at the time their final wholesale sale or deemed on a sale value equal to the sale value specified under the existing sales tax law for goods applied to a taxpayer's own use. This proposal will ensure that all printed promotional material i,s subject to sales tax irrespective of who prints it or how it is delivered to the final consumer. 1 present the explanatory memorandum by and commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Fife) adchase or build, or commence construction of, a dwelling on or after 22 August 1990. The Bill also fixes 30 June 1991 as the cut off date by which applications for assistance under the First Home Owners Act must be received by the Secretary to the Department of Community Services and Health. The Bill additionally deals with two minor amendments. Firstly, it amends section 38 of the First Home Owners Act, to create an offence related to the recklessly making of false or misleading statements in connection with applications under the Act, in addition to the existing offence of knowingly making such statements. Further, it deletes certain references which are unnecessary duplications of provisions which can be found in the Crimes Act 1914. Secondly, the Bill corrects some anomalies which occurred when references to migration law in the First Home Owners Act were amended by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act 1989. The second minor amendment corrects drafting oversights affecting applications since last December. These oversights have resulted in inequitable treatment of certain migrants-generally from New Zealand, some of whom are long term residents here-in the application of the scheme's income test. The proposed amendment will enable the Department to review such applications. The first hom:e owners scheme (FHOS) was introduced on 10 October 1983 to assist low to moderate income first home buyers into home ownership, to stimulate construction of new dwellings and to create new jobs. When FHOS was announced, housing activity was at a 20year low: only 105,000 dwellings were commenced in 1982-83; housing finance was in short supply and it was rationed. This often resulted in 'cocktail' arrangements whereby home buyers had to take out a second mortgage at a higher interest rate-thus driving up the overall cost of finance. In its first year of operation, FHOS assisted over 54,000 households into home ownership and was a key element in a remarkable recovery in the housing industry. Housing commencements increased by almost one-third, to about 137,000, in 1983-84 and some 40,000 new jobs were created. Since inception FHOS has helped over 360,000 households into home ownership at a cost of around $1.53 billion. As I foreshadowed earlier, the nature home ownership assistance has changed over the last few years and so has the economic environment. Housing activity has fallen to a more sustainable level lowing the record level of 175,000 commencements reached in 1988-89. The Australian financial system has been progressively deregulated, which has ensured an adequate supply of housing finance and enabled lenders to develop loan products which are more responsive to the needs of lower income borrowers. The overall supply of housing finance has increased from $7.2 billion in 1982-83 to $18.8 lion in 1989-90. . At the same time, greater emphasis has been placed on the efficiency and effectiveness of home ownership schemes under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA). The 1989 CSHA not only represents the most significant reform of public housing funding but also has laid the foundation for a significant increase in funds available for home purchase loans by inclusion of private sector funds. As a result of these reforms and the development of shared home ownership schemes under the CSHA, home ownership has been extended to include people on lower incomes. The success of the close cooperation between the States-Territories and the Commonwealth in the home ownership area has led to a considerable increase in the number of families benefiting: from 16,000 in 1987-88-$720m-to over 32,000 in 1989-90-over $2 billion. The market share of State housing authorities has more than doubled: from about 4.5 per cent in 1987-88 to over 11 per cent in 1989-90, or some 30 per cent of the first home buyer market. Since 1983 some 124,000 households have received home purchase assistance. However, despite the development of innovative financial arrangements, insufficient savings capacity continues to be a major barrier to home ownership for soine lower income people. Lack of savings capacity can in some cases preclude potential home buyers from accessing State home purchase assistance (HPA) schemes. of To some extent, the first home owners scheme has been used by home purchase assistance recipients to bridge the deposit gap or assist in meeting the entry costs, foland some home purchase assistance schemes are designed on this basis. However, wide variations in house prices across Australia have made it increasingly difficult to maintain and develop an equitable and efficient national scheme such as FHOS. Essentially, under the current home ownership arrangements the same target group is benefiting from both FHOS and bil- home purchase assistance but the two programs are administered at two levels of government. In order to streamline the administration and remove the duplication in this area, the Government has decided to cease the first home owners scheme and provide funds to the States to link deposit assistance with existing home lending schemes. The new arrangements will be administered directly by the State and Territory housing authorities and will ensure a fairer and more equitable distribution of these funds to lower income earners. The Commonwealth will develop broad guidelines· against which States will develop more flexible deposit assistance tailored to family needs and local market conditions. The new arrangements will thus provide State and Territory housing authorities with an impetus to further develop their home purchase assistance schemes. The new deposit assistance arrangements are envisaged to come into effect from 1 January 1991 provided agreements can be reached with State and Territory governments over the next few months. It will receive total Commonwealth funding of $14m in 1990-91 which will increase to $30m in 1991-92. The new arrangements will be incorporated into the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. The first home owners scheme ceases from Budget night. Home buyers who are already receiving assistance under the first home owners scheme will, of course, continue to receive the assistance to which they are entitled. People who have entered into a binding contract to buy or build a home, or have commenced construction, before 22 August 1990, and who are otherwise eligible for assistance under the first home owners scheme will have until 30 June 1991 to lodge their applications. FHOS assistance will not be available to those entering into contracts on or after 22 August 1990. In 1990-91 some 11,000 families which have already acquired a home will receive FHOS assistance for the first time and ongoing assistance will be paid to a further 140,000 families. The Government's housing program is a key part of its social justice strategy. is the Government's policy to maximise access to affordable and appropriate housing. Since coming to office, the Government has delivered effective services in greatly increased numbers to assist thousands of people throughout the community: 360,000 households have been assisted under FHOS; over 124,000 home purchasers received assistance under CSHA; public housing stock increased by 39 per cent; and 1,450 services were provided under the supported accommodation assistance program for transitional housing support. The Government is also aware of the importance of adequate medium and long term accommodation to the successful movement of homeless young people towards independence. In responding to the needs of these young people, as highlighted in the findings of the Burdekin report, a $100m package of assistance, over 4 years, was announced last year. The package included substantial increases in funding for youth housing, in order to provide assistance for an additional 6,000 young people. . The ,new CSHA agreement was renegohated m 1989 and, as I said earlier, represe-ts the most significant reform of pubhc housing funding since the CSHA was introduced in 1945. The new arrangement will provide an unprecedented level of funding and forward commitment for public housing: $1.028 billion was provided in 1989-90 and at least that amount was guaranteed for each of the three years 1990-91 to 1992-93. The housing area is now high on the Government's list for major reform. Current problems and projected demographic trends will change the pattern of housing demand, and we need to come up with imaginative housing solutions. The Government is determined to ensure that all Australians have access to affordable and appropriate housing, in the right locations, and that this continues well into the twenty-first century. The national housing strategy, which I recently established, will examine innoIt vative ways of providing secure, affordable and appropriate housing, within a broad economic, social and demographic framework. It will also examine longer term proposals for remedying fundamental structural problems in the housing market. The strategy creates a major opportunity to evaluate trends in home ownership and provides a framework to examine the effectiveness of the current range of assistance schemes and policies. I commend the Bill to the House. I now present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Fife) adjourned. SELECTION COMMITfEE",68

101,Mr SNOWDON,MIDDLE EAST,"Northern TerritoryParliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications) (8.38)-I am pleased that the Minister for senior mem- Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) is in the House because in some ways what I have left to say is directly relevant to his portfolio, given that he is responsible for defence science and personnel matters. When this debate was interrupted prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner state of and prior, I might say, to a very important speech by the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-another very important Budget achievement by the Hawke Government-I was addressing the issue of the performance of previous Australian governments and, indeed, the world community towards the issue of the invasion and occupation of nations around the world Time allotted 30 minutes. and the fact that currently we are seeing an unprecedented level of activity in the area of cooperati(:m amongst t-e nations of the United - at1ons, and specIfically Security CouncIl. It is a matter of historical record we have not, in my view, performed adethe quately in this area in the past and there are nations which should have been able to get the support - f count-ies like tralia and the Umted NatIOns Secunty Council when their borders were penemembers trated and their countries occupied and people suffered at the hands of the invadlive ing forces, and we failed to do so. On this occasion, as I have said previsafe ously in the course of this. deb-te, it is pleasing indeed to see the bIpartIsan support for the motion by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the role that the Security Council and the United Nations generally has taken in this debate. That happy ocsaying that the response inIt this currence has come about because we hope that the level of international tension has surrounded the relationship between munity support. East and West in the world for so long has reached such a level that there is no need for the concentration of military force and build-up in the area of military affairs that had been the case in the 1960s and 1970s. Sadly, in my view, the invasion by Iraq of Kuwait and the threat to Saudi Arabia have, temporarily at least, put paid to notion that we can look forward to an unprecedented era of world peace and harmony. I hope that following the actions taken by this nation, in conjunction with and as a result of the resolutions passed in the United Nations, we will see enough pressure placed on Iraq to ensure that with so much vigour. that period of peace and tranquillity after which we all strive will come upon us we will not have to witness conflagrations of the type seen elsewhere in the world previous years because of the greed, inhumanity and the outright brutality some members of the human race. As a community which values freedom and the dignity of humankind, we should do our utmost to protect those values. - y view, the response of the United NaUnited tIons has been praiseworthy. It goes with by out saying that we should do all that is feasible, all that is possible, to ensure a the peaceful resolution of this conflict. One of the frigates which is on its way that to the Gulf now, the HMAS Darwin, bears name of the capital of the Northern Territory. This time last year, during the Kangaroo 89 exercise, I went on board AllsHMAS Darwin and met many of the crew. I do not know whether any of those crew are on this voyage, but along with other Defence Force personnel who in northern Australia, the northern Australian community and particularly the people of Darwin, I wish those sailors a voyage and a speedy and safe return. I applaud the move by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel to ensure that the conditions of service for those people involved in tHis Middle East deployment are appropriate. goes without instance by the Minister, indeed the Government, that has been one which deserves full comWhilst there has been generally bipartisan support in the debate for the Government's actions, some issues which have been addressed need to be addressed further. One of those issues is the freedom of people to say other than what the Government wants. I note that the honourable member for: Dundas (Mr Ruddock) made the special mention of this. I would just say that in embarking on this deployment of our naval forces to the Middle East, we must also protect the rights of those who may wish to express a contrary view to our own. That is, after all, the essential freedom that we are seeking to protect",72
102,Mr SINCLAIR,MIDDLE EAST,"New England) (8.43) and The statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) this afternoon has many in more implications and a far greater conthe sequence for Australia than the rather of passe Budget Speech we heard an hour and a half ago. The implications of the Prime Minister's speech relate to the commitment of In Australian forces in accordance with a Nations resolution. I would start saying to the Prime Minister that he would do well to follow the priorities of the President of the United States in addressing the issue. Australia's first commitment must be to its nationals and to our national interest. To my mind, in the setting down of the Prime Minister's motion I would have thought that concern for the welfare of those Australians today held hostage against their will in Iraq and Kuwait would have been at the top of the priorities. The second thought that I have-and it concerns me-is that for all that every speaker has referred to the well-being of those personnel who are going to serve in that dangerous area, sadly, the motion makes no reference to them. From my point of view, ,their well-being, their safe journey and, of course, their safe return are of equal priority. There is no doubt that the commitment of Australian forces to an area where there is a threat of hostile conflict is a very difficult decision. Indeed, in the circumstances of the possible conflict in which they may be involved, it is made all the more hazardous because of the unfortunate use by Saddam Hussein, against all bounds of morality or human decency, of chemical and biological warfare. That he has been prepared to use these weapons against his own Kurdish people is something that can bring him nothing but contempt, and it is that contempt that i feel for the man and his actions in the Middle East After I have reconfirmed my very real sympathy for those whose relatives and friends are in the Middle East, and certainly those who are today held hostage, I want to address three areas in relation to the issue. To them. I would say that everyone in this House would wish them a safe return and, hopefully, the capacity to be able to leave Iraq peacefully and without restraint. To those who are going to fight the conflict there, I certainly wish them well. The first matter that I want to address is the whole question of the United Nations. In the .fifth part of the motion there is reference to United Nations sanctions. A few moments ago I heard the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) talking about the United Nations. We need to remember that the United Nations sanctions, having been passed, have the force of law in this country. We are signatories to the treaty which constitutes the United Nations. As I see it, the United Nations is never more on trial than it is today in the circumstances surrounding the invasion by Iraq of Kuwait. As we know, the predecessor of the United Nations, the League of Nations, failed in Abyssinia, failed in Manchuria, failed to restrain fascism in Europe, and as a result it collapsed and World War II was the consequence. Let us realise today that sadly that, too, could be the consequence of the failure of the United Nations in the Middle East. There are, df course, some circumstances which we all need to be conscious of and take pride in. We should be thankful that the conflict between the two major powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, is, we hope, forever at rest. With the fall of the Berlin Wall we enter a new phase of relations. We should remember that but for the fact that the Soviet Union was absent from the Security Council during the passage of a resolution with respect to a force of the United Nations, there would never have been a United Nations force in Korea. We should remember that the reason why the united vote of the Security Council on the two resolutions with respect to Iraq is so different from any other resolution that has come forth since World War II is that in this instance the Soviet Union has been prepared to act as we all believe the Charter of the United Nations requires, that is, in concert to seek to prevent conflict. It concerns me that on this occasion, having passed those two resolutions, one condemning Iraq and Sad dam Hussein and the second applying mandatory sanctions, we still have not received from the United Nations firm directions as to the way in which those sanctions are going to be applied, nor firm directions as to the way in which the forces that are being gathered together are going to be applied. It is my view. that - he United Nations Security Councd, havmg pa-se- those two resolutions, now has an oblIgatIon to pass a third resolution, and that is to set up a United Nations force. Australians have performed magnificently under the concept of a multinational force organisation, as they did in the Sinai, but there is little doubt that questions raised today by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) which relate to the nature of the command, the obligations of the Australian· force and the degree to which there is a command structure over that Australian force are matters for the United Nations to answer. We should remember that even such outspoken critics as Prime Minister Thatcher of the United Kingdom have accepted the obligatory character of those mandatory sanctions. But it is no use applying mandatory sanctions unless we go to the next phase and work out in what way force is to be applied. I certainly do not see that it is for the Australian Prime Minister or any other head of state to lay down directions as to just what is to be done. Yet, in paragraph 5(b) of this motion, the Prime Minister has said that the decision to send ships of the Royal Australian Navy to the Middle East, has been made 'to assist-by means of identification, contact, interrogation and warning'. I suggest that it is for the United Nations to determine how those mandatory sanctions are going to be applied. I also suggest that the United Nations' chance for survival lies in the peaceful resolution of the conflict between Saddam Hussein and the rest of the world. Unless there is a capacity for the United Nations to bring together those many countries that have expressed concern about and condemnation of Sad dam Hussein I fear the result is not going to be as' we all would wish. I do n<;>t, nor would any thinking mem-er of thIS chamber or indeed any Austrahan, want to see Australian forces sent to the Middle East to be involved in conflict, but .we should recognise that the United Nattons has not gone far enough. The United Nations has put a toe in the water and has not been prepared to commit itself. Unless it is prepared to commit itself and get behind those who are prepared to attempt to apply those mandatory sanctions, the result could well be to the detriment of the United Nations itself. It is my view that the Secretary-General the should be involved as requested, and that the United States should not just be left to undertake the dirty work of the rest of the world. I am delighted that Australia has seen fit to exercise its legal responsibilities. But do not let there be any nonsense. It is the consequence of our being a signatory to the Atlantic Charter, a consequence of our being a member of the United Nations, a consequence of the Security Council having applied mandatory sanctions, that we have no alternative but to be there. We should not have any of this nonsense of thinking that in some way we could opt out. We cannot, and I think we have to accept that. The next thing that I wanted to address briefly was my concern about the nature and character of the forces that are involved. I disagree totally with the concern expressed by the independent member for North Sydney (Mr Mack) earlier today about the competence of the ships. There is no doubt that the three ships have been purpose designed. But we should understand that they are not designed to undertake a mission on their own. Selfsufficiency is okay, but let us be realistic. This Government, in the course of its defence program, has not maintained a commitment to self-sufficiency in the equipment that it operates, and I suspect that in that respect the ANZAC frigates will be even less competent than the FFGs, the Charles F. Adams class, that we have sent to the Middle East. Indeed, it is of interest that the background published by the United States Information Service on 15 August 1990 talks about Australiaamongst 60 or 70 other countries and their commitments to condemn Sad dam Hussein-by saying that Australia will take part in combined naval effort. It worries me that there seems to be a suggestion that there has to be additional army personnel aboard HMAS Success. I would not want any threat to HMAS Success, but I would put to this House the thought that the purpose of each of those vessels is to work not on its own, but in a fleet context. The American ships of a similar design to the FFGs-our HMAS Darwin and the HMAS Adelaide-are working in a fleet configuration, and so too should our ships. HMAS Success is a ship designed to provide backing to those ships operating in a fleet circumstance. HMAS Success should not be standing off in isolation. HMAS Success must work in conjunction with a fleet and should not be allowed in any circumstances to be violated because of her incapacity to meet particular circumstances. So let us recognise that, the sooner we get a United Nations command structure and the sooner we allow those vessels to operate in concert with others, the more those vessels will be able-with their highly trained and excellent Royal Australian Navy personnel-to operate in the manner and form to which they are trained and with the safety that those sonnel deserve. The next factor that I wanted to mention briefly is my concern that those exporters who traditionally have exported Australian commodities to the region should not be called on alone to bear the net cost of any action taken by the Australian Government in accordance with the application of those mandatory sanctions. There is a net cost. The statement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) on 8 August was very unsatisfactory. It was generally obfuscating the fact that there is a net loss as a result of the decisions that the Australian wheat growers face; there is a net loss that exporters of live sheep there is a net loss which exporters of tralian dairy products face; and there is a of this House. net loss that a number of other exporters face. As far as I am concerned, no single exporter should be called on to bear a disproportionate cost. It is a burden for taxpayers of Australia in their entirety and for this nation as a whole. From my point of view, we will be looking towards the Australian Government to meet that responsibility. The final thing, in the time available, that concerns me is the fact that we need to register that these are not the only Australian armed personnel serving abroad. The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) referred to a number. of those commitments. There are, in addition, some United Nations personnel in South America. Of course there is the Australian Police contingent in Cyprus. While I was pleased to hear the Minister at the table, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney), talk about conditions to apply to those who are going on this mission to the Middle East, I· would hope that exactly the same circumstances apply to all those who serve with United Nations forces, wherever they might be, on Australia's behalf. Sadly, a young man who was resident not that far from where I live was killed in the Middle East, and there is certainly a hazard faced by any Australian working perwith the United Nations force, wherever that force might be. I would say to the Minister that while I commend the Government for ensuring that adequate entitlements are applicable to those who are sailing on their present United Nations mission, exactly the same entitlements must apply universally to Australians I serving wherever they should be. There is no doubt that all Australians' hearts go out to those who are going to face the hazards of the Middle East. The situation there is difficult, tenuous and unpredictable. Yet Saddam Hussein has breached every tenet of responsibility of civilisation and international law. The condemnation that the United Nations face; made of him is certainly supported by Ausme, as I am sure it is by every member",73
103,Mr LINDSAY,MIDDLE EAST,"This afternoon in the precincts of this place a meeting occurred of the Australia-United States of America Parliamentary. Group, and it resolved unanimously that the Australia-United States of America Parliamentary Group condemns the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq; calls on Iraq to immediately withdraw its forces unc.onditi-nally from Kuwait; calls on Iraq to. Imme-hately release without harm all foreIgn natIOnals; and supports the actions taken to date by the Australian and United States governments. The terms of that motion passed unanimously by the Australia-United States Group· are very similar to the .terms. of this motion before the House. ThIS motion condemns the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq; it demands that Iraq withdraw its forces from Kuwait and restore legitimate government in Kuwait; it implores Iraq to protect the lives of hostages it has seized; nent? and it pledges that Australia will join with other nations in upholding the rule of law so that aggression may be defeated and the sovereignty of nations preserved. We in this House know that without international order the rule of law will give way to the law of the jungle, and that freedom and peace in the world will be in. peril. Let no-one doubt that Iraq's conquest of Kuwait stands as a challenge to the economic independence of the West and, stripped of camouflage, it represents a declaration of war against Western power. Let there be no doubt that Iraq's invasion is the most serious challenge to the economic stability of the world since World War II. Therefore, nations which uphold the rights of man must defeat this aggression, and we ask the rest of humanity to join our cause. The security and stability of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf are paramount; the protection of the lives of hostages seized by Iraq is paramount; the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi forces is paramount, and so, too, is the restoration of legitimate government in Kuwait. I know that most Australians are reassured by the guarantee of President Bush that these honourable goals will be achieved. The Government of Iraq represents an abomination of human standards of behaviour. We know that its leader Sad dam Hussein, is not constrained by a-y of the precepts of human decency and conduct. He attacked Iran. He invaded a previously friendly Arab state-Kuwait. He has used poison gas against the citizens of his own country-men, women and children. Countless Muslims have lost their lives to the maniacal pursuit of power by Sad dam Hussein. His troops now loot Kuwait. There have been reports of rape and murder, and unrestrained brutality is sanctioned as official Iraqi policy. I wonder which country is next on the list of Saddam Hussein. Will it be Saudi Arabia? Will it be the Gulf states? Will it be Syria? Surely the people of Iran do not seriously believe that Hussein's currently friendly overtures to them will be permaWhat of Turkey? It has been said that Turkey is a much more likely candidate for Iraqi aggression than Israel. There is now a life and death dispute between Turkey and Iraq over the waters of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, which are as crucial to Iraq as the Nile is to Egypt. Turkey is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and NATO has pledged to defend Turkey if it is attacked by Iraq. Indeed, the brave and resourceful people of Turkey have shown enormous courage in their highly principled stand against Iraqi aggression. The Arab and Islamic nations of Egypt, Morocco and the Gulf Cooperation Coimcil states have placed their armies and air forces shoulder to shoulder with other United Nations forces to enforce the United Nations sanctions. Like other civilised nations they are resolved to stop Iraqi aggression. Australians opposed to the Government's decision to join the United States naval task force in the Persian Gulf are living in a world where no other countries appear to exist. .We cannot live among the family of man and then turn our backs when the going get.s tough. Many of those who oppose the bipartisan decision to commit the Australian Navy do not understand the nature of the situation we now face. Like Neville Chamberlain speaking of Czechoslovakia in 1938, they imply that Australia should not be concerned with the events in a faraway country of whose people we know little. Especially in the post-Cold War world Australia must not stand aside and look on as the United States, Great Britain and other nations shoulder the grave responsibility of ending the mad dream of Saddam Hussein to build a new Babylonian empire at terrible cost not only to his Arab neighbours but also to the United States, Europe and South-East Asia and at great cost to Australia. As a recent editorial said: The danger is not only a spiralling price of and fuel but a world recession which could set back any hopes of recovery in this country for years. Australia's hopes for such a recovery are directly linked to the fortunes of critical economies such as those of the United States, Japan and western Europe. An Iraq left in control of Kuwait's oil and free to move on Saudi Arabia's supplies at will could shatter those hopes with devastating consequences for the international economy. This would be true not only for those overseas countries that too many Australians are led to believe have nothing to do with us, but for ordinary Australians, who would lose jobs, homes, and businesses. When Iraq made its first attempts to seize Kuwait in 1961 it had only about 75,000 troops at its disposal and poor weaponry. In 1990 the picture is very different. Iraq has more than one million soldiers, thousands of tanks, hundreds of modern aircraft and it has-and would usechemical weapons. Hussein has intermediate range ballistic missiles, in other words, a means of delivering horrifying weapons of mass destruction. In 1984, 1986 and 1987 a team of four experts working at the direction of the Secretary-General of the United Nations went to the Middle East to test claims that Iraq was engaged in the use of chemical weapons. One member of that team on each occasion was Australian defence scientist, Dr Peter Dunne, Chief of the Protective Chemistry Division, Materials Research Laboratory, Department of Defence, Melbourne. As the chemist in the team, Dr Dunne's task was to examine bombs and identify chemicals used in them. He and the team found in 1984 that Iraq was using chemical weapons, but they could not come up with final proof. In 1986 they got their proof and a horrified world learned that Iraq was engaged in chemical warfare against Iran using mustard gas and nerve gas through aerial bombs, artillery shells and mortar shells. It was the worse example since World War I that a nation was using chemical weapons. Again, in 1987, Dr Dunne and his team established that Iraq was sending nerve gas rockets against the Iranians. The shocking effects of chemical weapons are well documented. Mustard gas is petrol lethal-it causes vomiting, blistering of the skin, eye irritation and short-term blindness. Nerve gas, when inhaled or absorbed through the skin, attacks the nervous system and can cause agonising death within 15 minutes. Other types of chemical weapons have equally horrific results. In a hot environment such as that experienced in the Middle East it is extremely difficult to combat the ghastly effects of chemical weapons, even when wearing protective garments and. masks. Unless civilians have a very high level of protection they are always the innocent victims of chemical warfare, and this cre - . ates tremendous loads on hospitals and medical teams in the regions coming under attack. Dr Dunne found it absolutely disgraceful that Iraq was proven to be using chemical weapons for at least four years without official reprimands or sanctions. In other words, Iraq thumbed its nose at the rest of the world. A chilling example of the total ruthlessness of the policy of Sad dam Hussein occurred in the town of Halabja in March 1988, when chemical weapons used by Iraq caused an estimated 5,000 casualties in a 48-hour period. What made this act even more horrendous was the fact that Halabja is in Iraq. Halabja is similar in size to Bendigo in Victoria. Mr Deputy Speaker, imagine an Australian government launching an attack on the citizens of Bendigo or some other Australian town or city. It is too incredible even to contemplate, but in Iraq it did happen. The United Nations' reports on Iraq's use of chemical weapons have never been disputed. No-one has questioned their validity. All the oil rich countries are, like Kuwait, viewed by Sad dam as ripe for conquering. Iraq and Saudi Arabia are the only two Arab countries in the Gulf where native citizens are in the majority. Iraq, under Saddam, if left alone, would never be content with Kuwait. Saddam Hussein would march on to greater dreams of conquest and thousands would die as he steadily gained control of more and more of the world's oil supplies. What of Israel? Israelis have learned to live with the constant threat of being surrounded by enemies who have vowed to exterminate them. Sad dam is no idle threat-he would wipe Israel off the face of the earth. On 2 April this year he said he would incinerate Israel with fire. An all-out attack on Israel with chemical weapons is the Israelis' terrible fear and it could so easily become reality. Israel has I?een keeping a very low profile during the events of recent weeks, but its forces are understandably on a high state of alert. Jerusalem's restrained reaction will assist the efforts of the United Nations at this time. A recent comment in the New York Times by former Editorin-Chief, A. M. Rosenthal, states: Win or lose in his gamble for control of world's oil, Saddam Hussein's next major target East. will be Israel. If he wins, he will turn to the attack against Israel. He will lead the final Holy War as the one, true Muslim conqueror, crying destruction to the Jews and death to all who question his vision, course and glory. But he sees himself in danger of defeat and disgrace in the Gulf, he will try another road. He may back off in the Gulf but soon try to rally Arab world to him with a war cry against Israel. Either scenario is too frightening to con- - ltimate template. As Les Aspin, Chairman of the hkely to be - ouse Armed Services Committee, argued 10 the Washington Post recently, Sad dam Hussein must be not only defeated but also removed otherwise we will have go back again when Sad dam Hussein has atomic weapons. Time is running short in this debate. in South Again, I refer to a comment by A. M. ably Rosenthal, the former Editor-in-Chief of t-e New York Times. I quote his summatIOn of Saddam Hussein: Now Saddam Hussein has made the mistake showing the West that tyrants cannot be peased, not with money, guns or lies. That is the mistake all tyrants make. And that is how they are brought down-but only if truth finally brings courage. The West and the nations in the United Nations require that courage to persist in their fight for right, in their fight for freedom and in their fight for the maintenance of peace. I join with other Australians in praying for the sailors of Australia on those ships, that they may do their duty with honour and that they may return safely to these sacred shores.",76
104,Mr CONNOLLY,MIDDLE EAST,"It is a sad reflection on the state of humanity that within a few short months of the breaking down of the Berlin Wall, when at last, since the days of 1945, we have seen the great powers reach a status of relationship which we all hoped was going to give to the world a new dawn of peace, once again we are thrust into' the cauldron of a potential war. I am probably one of the few members of this House who has actually lived in the Middle East. I have some small pretension of being what they call 'an Arabist'. There is no more geopolitically complex area on earth in which any nathe tion could be involved than the Middle The events we have seen in recent weeks, brought on by the activities of Arabs Saddam Hussein, using the armed naked if force of his republican guards to cross the borders of Kuwait and capture that· small the but very rich oil sheikhdom, presents us with a massive challenge. But let nobody be under any illusion that .the course to peace will be easy, or that it is short, or that it will be without cost. I repeat what I said: the complexities to of the Middle East are something quite dIfferent from what we normally experi--ce either in terms of European geopolItIcal events of the past or even of events East Asia. They are immeasurmore complex. Putting it quite simply, there is not one border around the territory of Iraq which of is accepted by that state. Why? Iraqis apclaim-and historically· they are rightthat all the Iraqi borders were. determined by the British and the French In the carveup of the Turkish empire after the Great War. Irrespective of that, the simple reality is that the boundaries of Kuwait were established by the Treaty of Muhammara in 1921. They were supported by the League of Nations. They have been endorsed by the United Nations. In the last few weeks they have been further endorsed by the Security Council of the United Nations. Australia, as a nation which since its inception has been a founding member of that international body, is duty-bound to support the decisions which it makes and, by extension, to support our ally, the United States of America, in the action it has taken. I find it disturbing, but perhap- understandable, that some elements in Austra:!Ian society hide behind the flag of the United Nations as if that alone is the fulcrum of all that is right and just, ignoring what honourable members on both sides of this House have said, namely, that time is of the essence when one faces an aggressor. While the Opposition and, no doubt, Government members, hope that ultimately we will see the Security Council go the next step and endorse an international peacekeeping operation in the Middle East, in the meantime decisions have been taken to cut off Iraq from its capacity to export oil and to import from the rest of the world, not because, as Hussein would say, we want to starve Iraqi women and children, but rather because it is absolutely essential in the cause of long-term international stability that no medium power, especially in the context of the breakdown of the traditional bipolar axis between East and West, should now see the opportunity as ripe to move in and take over, to be the aggressor and, what is worse, get away with it. As I said earlier, we must live with the complexities of the Middle East but we must also understand them. Any examination of the events of the last 10 years demonstrates this so clearly. We had the war between Iran and Iraq-again essentially over border demarcation disputes. At one stage Israel was supporting Iran. Strangely, the United States was supporting Iraq supplying high level intelligence through satellites and so forth. The record will show that only a few weeks ago, when Iraq went to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and demanded an increase in the price of oil, Saudi Arabia supported that proposal. This merely demonstrate the point I am trying to make: we are dealing with an extremely complex set of issues. But none of that complexity is to be seen as a means for protecting or in any sense supporting the fundamental fact that without provocation Iraq's republican guards crossed the border of a sovereign state and invaded Kuwait. It was that act which signalled the need for international reaction. It is sad but understandable that the Middle East itself took so long to respond. The states of the Middle East, divided as they are by these many complex issues and interrelationships between those states and many of the royal families that dominate those states, should have responded earlier. This is an element in this very complex equation which Western politicians and certainly the media tend often to ignore. Perhaps the classic example of this is the position of King Hussein of Jordan. I know Jordan well. I respect the Hashemite Kingdom, but it is in the most invidious position of all. On the one hand, it has been traditionally an ally of Iraq, but on the other it has been a traditional ally of the United Kingdom and the United States. If Aqaba is available to be used by Iraq as a port for resources from the rest of the world, the entire United Nations exercise in trying hermetically to seal off Iraq will fail. But King Hussein rightly says, 'You cut off trade with Iraq, my people will starve'. Again, that is a legitimate point of view in this particular situation from his perception. But he equally has to face the fact that when he had the Palestinians breathing down his neck, it was the kingdom of Saudi Arabia which came to his aid. I am making the point that we have layer upon layer of relationships which have permeated through the desert sands for thousands of years and we must not imagine that in 1990 we can face all of this complexity and .make it sound so simple. Whether a person is in Arabia, South East Asia, eastern Europe or anywhere else on this earth, the fundamental principle of the United Nations must hold: aggression by one state against another cannot be tolerated. We cannot allow one national leader, such as Saddam Hussein, with his record in recent years-he has been likened to Adolf Hitler-to invade a small neighbouring nation. It is worth pointing out, as have previous speakers, that with the possible exception of Cambodia there has been no event since 1945 when one human being has used gas and biological warfare against another, not just against the soldiers of an opponent but against ordinary civilian men, women and children whose only problem in life was to be a minority which opposed the dictatorship of the Iraqi Baat Party. Let us never forget that one of the fundamental principles of Baatism is Pan Arabism; it is about uniting the Arab nation; about ignoring all the boundaries which, as I have said, the Arabs claim were put there by the British and the French, and creating one great nation. What we see from Sad dam Hussein is not unique. In many respects he is merely following in the footsteps of Gamal Abdel Nasser who, honourable members may recall, in the 1950s thumbed his nose at the West and took over the Suez Canal. He put himself forward to the Arab world as the great uniter of the Arab nation. He even joined Syria to create the United Arab Republic. At various times over the last 30 years we have seen all sorts of combinations and permutations as those nations have jostled for position. At one stage or another, as we see at present with Iraq, we have a regime which effectively has got itself offside with every single one of its neighbours. Even Syria, whose international record in recent years has not been without reproach, now finds itself willing to join a United Nations multinational force-the details of which we do - ot yet know-to play its part in controlhng the activities of the Iraqis. The problem now is that we have forces on the ground. Our strategists will no doubt tell us that the United States, Arab and other forces-especially the Egyptians-are now more than enough to face up to the one million-odd men which Saddam Hussein has at his disposal. Anyone who has been to the .Middle East at this time of the year would know that the only word to describe the climate is hot-130 degrees in the shade. There is great difficulty in getting water and when a person gets it, it tastes awful. In that desert environment we are nowplacing 50,000 or 100,000 men. We have to ask the questions: How long can they survive under those conditions? How long will their physical capacity allow them to be competent soldiers? Add to that the other dimension as to whether Saddam Hussein would ever use his chemical biological weapons against those forces. If any honourable members have ever worn a swimsuit in the Middle East sun, they would know what it feels like to put on an anti-gas suit when it is 130 degrees in the shade. I hate to think what the result would be, apart from literally melting in the heat. So we are facing fundamental problems of time and geography, as well as resolve; but resolve we must have because if Saddam Hussein gets away With this, there is no question that there will not be one government in the entire Middle East which will be safe. Sadly I say tonight that whatever the outcome of this dispute, the Middle East will never be the same again. The mob in many of these countries, which is a very potent political reality, at this stage is in favour of Saddam Hussein because they see him as a strong Arab leader. They see him as the only person standing up against the alleged incursions of the United States and its allies, especially Israel. These are the public problems we are facing in expressing our opposition in the context of the realities of Middle East politics. That does not alter the fact that the Middle East and its oil are vital not just to the United States but to""western Europe, Japan and the trading capacity of the entire world. There are times when we really do have to stand and stand firm. This is one of those times. I will use a quotation of Saddam Hussein who, in Baghdad on 4 November 1982, said that the time will finally come when a politician realises he is losing more than he is gaining and he will establish peace. Whatever the outcome, Saddam Hussein will lose. But one thing is certain: the world must win.",79
105,Dr CATLEY,MIDDLE EAST," Mr Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to support this motion. I do so with reference to the self-interest of the Australian people. Clearly, a number of world order, moral and legal interests are served by containing the aggressive aspirations of the militaristic Iraqi regime. Mention has been made of these by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other speakers and I concur with the general thrust of the debate so far. Let me concentrate rather on our self interest. If Iraq's seizure of Kuwait had gone unchallenged, Iraq would likely have then acquired Saudi Arabia and the smaller adjacent states of the Persian This would have left a single authority in control of about 50 per cent of known world oil reserves, and that 50 per cent which is the cheapest to recover. The stated ambition of the Iraqi President is to increase the price of traded oil. One of his major criticisms of both the Kuwaiti and the Saudi royal houses, notwithstanding their recent behaviour, has been their refusal in the past to increase Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) oil prices to a level where Saddam Hussein could recoup his Iraqi war costs and make a further profit. That Kuwait and Saudi Arabia bankrolled much of the cost of that war-which Iraq started in 1980-seems to have been forgotten, together with the one million lives lost. 'What have you done for me lately?', indeed! Saddam Hussein would then have used possession of a large portion of OPEC reserves, with Libyan and other assistance, to massively increase oil prices. He would justify this in terms of a redistribution of wealth to poor Arabs, some of whom are believing this tale. He may even believe that he is the Arab's Bismarck rather than their Hitler. The effect, however, would be exactly the same. We know what it would look like from the crises of 1973-74 and 1979-80. In each case a war-Israeli-Arab in 1973 and IraqIran in 1980-led to a rapid rise in oil prices following the formation of a cartel, or shortages of oil, or both and a world recession quickly followed. The mechanism is fairly simple to follow: oil is a major source of energy for many Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries; input prices of industries therefore rose; inflation thus took off; capital and finance left industry to pay OPEC for oil; economic growth fell; labour was shed. Economic disruption was widespread but worse amongst those most heavily dependent upon oil imports. In the first ripple of both these oil shocks, Australia actually benefited. In 1973-74 the value of the Australian dollar rose sharply to reach$US1.53 and about Gulf- 400 yen. A similar occurrence materialised in 1980 when, again, I am afraid that our political structure was anticipating a huge minerals boom for Australia during the 1980s. What we got in fact in the medium term-and not so medium at that-was in both instances a sharp recession. Although some of our economic sectors, notably energy exports-and we are, of course, a net energy exporter-are boosted by Middle East oil-related crises, most sectors of our economy are adversely affected. Our major markets and sources of capital are dependent, and in Japan's case heavily dependent, on imported energyparticularly oil. The disruption caused by oil crises dries up both our export earnings, because our export markets decline, and our sources of capital, since they are drained off to pay for Middle East resources. In the event of such a crisis as occurred in 1973-74 and 1980 recurring in this year and the following year, we could expect a similar kind of increase in inflation, balance of payments problems and unemployment. For the last seven years we have been trying to internatio-alise th- .Australian economy and make It competitive. Factor shares, as we have heard earlier this evening in the Budget Speech, have been altered in such -. way as - o place our economy in a posItion to achieve the same kind of high growth trajectory that has been common to our northern neighbouring economies for the last decade or so. We are about to engage in some further reforms to transport, our trading structure and telecommunications in particular in order to accelerate this process of transition. We have also been supporting, through the Cairns agreement, the development of a free trade world economy. In this process we have been having some successes, not only in European markets but also - n east Asia and, spectacularly of late, in the former Soviet bloc. The success of Iraq's bid to seize control of a major portion of the world's tradeable oil reserves would be an absolute disaster for all these processes. It would set back the process of establishing the new rules of global order, including global economic order, in a post-Cold War world. It would set back the enormous economic progress of many of the states of east Asia, notably Japan and the four little tigers, and also the newly emerging, newly industrialising countries of South East Asia whose fortunes, as a group, are still heavily dependent on the oil route from the Middle East and from the Gulf in particular. It would of course set back the restructuring of the Australian economy, after some of these successes which have been achieved so painfully over the last half-decade. The stakes involved in the Gulf, because of the importance of the oil reserves and the tanker trade, are so great that they present a challenge not only to the legal and moral standards of state behaviour but also. to the foundations of world economic order. It is because the stakes are so large that Saddam Hussein risks so -':lch. - he treasure to be won by acquiSltlons IS huge-Kuwait's reserves alone may have been worth $200 billion. Not bad for 24 hours work! They help explain the almost total absence of any serious appeals to morality or sentiment from Baghdad. But, cOlwersely, what Iraq would gain, and has gained, the world economy stands to lose, and Australia would be disrupted shortly thereafter, as I have described. If we trace the events of the last few weeks, the following checkpoints emerge. Firstly, Iraq uses its vast military power and, with almost no serious excuse, seizes Kuwait with its $200 billion worth of oil reserves-not to mention other reserves in other places. Secondly, because of the fears that this arouses about future oil supplies, . the price of oil increases by about 50 per cent to $30 per barrel. Iraq's bonus has . already lifted to $300 billion-another $100 billion in seven days. The wide-· spread expectation of recession sweeps through the world's trading economies. Thirdly, United Nations endorsed economic sanctions against Iraq in the form of an import and export boycott are established. The United States leads the organisation of a force designed to enforce these sanctions and to protect Saudi Arabia. Fourthly--'-and this is the important point to note in the sequence of eventsthe price qf oil starts to drop and begins to stabilise at somewhere between its initial price of $20 per barrel and the peak price of just over $30 per barrel. If the United States had not undertaken to defend Saudi Arabia by deploying air and land power, and if the naval forces had not been quickly deployed to enforce the otherwise unenforced UN sanctions, this stabilisation of the principal traded energy source in the international economy would not have occurred. Orderly distribution of oil in the world market is now proceeding despite the exclusion of the Iraqi and Kuwaiti fields from that process by virtue of the sanctions which I have already described. Other countries, including and particularly Saudi Arabia, are increasing output and the world oil reserves which were in any case at a pretty high level are now being run down at a fairly slow rate. Australia was in a position to be an early contributor to this stabilisation gram of the world economy. In part this explains the haste with which the decision had to be made to join this collective enterprise in order to stabilise the the principal traded energy resource of the world economy. As a result the world economy may escape the serious disruption to trade, output, price and employment levels that Iraq's resource grab was intended to produce. Saddam Hussein certainly knew the effect of seizing about 50 per cent of known oil reserves. Indeed, his intention was to utilise this serious situation in order to bring about a very rapid redistribution of world resources to our disadvantage and his personal and, presumably, state advantage. The purpose of this is presently unclear since most of the previous acquisition of resources by the state of Iraq has been utilised for military hardware. Let me say at this point that some in the media and some in the Opposition, indeed, have quibbled at the way in which this Government acted promptly to assist in the stabilisation of this situation in a. manner which I have already. described. What did they want? A plebiscite, or perhaps a special conference of the Liberal Party to endorse it? The Labor Caucus passed this motion this morning, and passed it with no dissenting voice. Labor has been satisfied that its processes have been followed. Who else is to be the judge, gentlemen of the media? A national referendum of the Democrats? Prompt action was required; prompt action requires decisive leadership and this Government provided it. Instead of applauding this promptness which was used to fortify otherwise unenforced UN sanctions which we may all applaud and to buttress the position of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) countries and Arab League states which are now getting involved in the process of trying to defend Saudi Arabia and the Gulf and to get Iraq to disgorge Kuwait, some critics in Australia refuse to admit and recognise the realities of the geopolitical implications of the struggle which we are engaged. On the one hand talk emerged of bowproing to the United States' money interests in order to prop up an artificial regime. What nonsense. Almost every boundary in the Middle East, as the preceding flow of speaker, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) very clearly pointed out-'-and I agree with much of what he had to say-that has not been drawn by the coast, by the sea, has been drawn by colonialism of one sort or another. Are none of those boundaries to be respected? On the other hand it is said that we have not told our service personnel the precise terms of engagement. Let me remind the House that it takes three weeks to get to the field of activities. During those three weeks there is plenty of timeand the process is already under way-to define clearly the terms of engagement. Was it intended that we hold a series of seminars until Iraq had finished with its annexations in the Gulf and· then try to dig out Iraqi forces from fortified positions? We have had the opportunity in concert with like-minded states from both NATO-the Atlantic alliance-and the Arab League and under the auspices of the United Nations to prevent this disruption of the world order and of. our economy at the source of the problem. This is an opportunity that has not been presented so easily in the past, and we seized it. If ever self-interest and morality combine neatly, this is such an instance. We must now hold onto the line which we have collectively established with other like-minded states in the Middle East and ensure that the position is sustained. It is in such a spirit that I commend this motion to the House and to my fellow Australians elsewhere.",82
106,Mr TUCKEY,MIDDLE EAST,"When I arrived during the comments by the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley), I thought for a minute that we were talking about the Budget. I found that nevertheless, towards the end, he got in back to his subject. The honourable member seemed to want to create the inference that there was some conflict of interest or of support within the Liberal Party of Australia on this issue. I was about to commence my speech by saying how pleased I was to be standing here tonight in the rather unusual role of supporting a Government initiative. I was going to add that I probably felt more strongly and was more supportive of the Government than some Government backbenchers. I thought that it would be right to identify the Australian Democrats in this matter, but honourable members should not try to construct a second facade of the day. Some hours ago, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) attempted to give us a facade about good economic management. Please do not try to give us a facade about the Liberals being. divided. The Leader of the Liberal Party,' the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) immediately, properly and responsibly made it clear to Australians that we supported the Government at a time when a few other people, particularly those on the Government benches, were running around saying that we did not have the appropriate meetings. I made that opening comment because I was concerned that the impression might be created that there was a conflict of interest. Of course, that is far from the truth. I support the motion and would like to give some of my reasons. I do not like bullies. I do not like politicians who get around in military uniform. I have a total commitment to freedom and to the right of people not,to have someone who just happens to have superior military forces and has no other message for the community walk into their country. It might be arguable that Kuwait was not - ntirely a democracy as such, but marchmg in from an adjoining country with guns and tanks is no way of establishing one, and we all know that the action was not taken with that intention. A- for .Australia's involvement, let us get .It straIght: Australia is part of the free SOCIal and economic world and it had no choice but to accept its obligations to be part of the mechanisms for protecting that world. I am old enough to remember what happened in Europe and to remember appeasement, the talk about 'peace in our time' and such comments as, 'Let the Nazis have that little bit of Europe because that is all they want'. We well and truly know that that policy does not work. . I am encouraged in this time of great concern by the fact that, for the first tirne in my memory, for all intents and purposes the superpowers are on one side. It is always the little countries that start major wars-history proves that. It is amazing how those little countries have always managed to divide the superpowers. We have found one on both sides, and that has been a major problem. I am delighted to see that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), who at one time was Minister for Defence, has walked in at this stage of my speech. I have said the obvious' things that most people have said and have not yet touched on hostages. Keeping hostages or using foreign civilians as shield- for military installations is, as has been said time and again, a breach df the Geneva conventions. I would put it more simply-it is a war crime. A message has to go from the international authorities to Saddam Hussein and his Parliament which have made their blatant announcement. That message is that if-I hope that it will not happen-the current situation escalates and deaths are caused and if we can assume that these people are not bluffing, they must be tried as war criminals. I hope that the death penalty still applies in these circumstances. Such an action is outrageous. It is a war crime and we must view it as such. I welcome the Minister for Transport and Communications to the chamber because my main purpose in being here was to discuss a significant factor which has been highlighted by this situation, that is, the Government is backing away from the two-ocean policy. That was highlighted clearly by the Government deciding not to give a major refitting contract for a submarine project to Western Australianot because Western Australia needed the money or the work but because it would' be a major step towards creating the facilities that were necessary to sustain a navy on the west coast. I blame not only· the Government but, more importantly and more disgracefully, the Services. It is clear that they feel more comfortable in Sydney. They did not really want to go to the west. In an article in a newspaper a fellow was reported as saying, 'We will lose half our crew if we have to send them out to the isolation of the terrible west'. What do we have a Navy for? As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) informed us today, the invasion took place on 2 August. He correctly claimed that the. Government responded almost immediately. Today, on 21 August, the ships got to Fremantle, where they should have been to start with. I do not just say that because it so happens that the conflict is in the Middle East. All the Government's advice and information show that the conflict was always going to be in the Middle East or to the immediate north of Western Australia. The Cook Islands are not planning to invade Sydney. There might be some troubles in Fiji, but the Fijians are not coming to Brisbane. I have never heard of penguins from the Antarctic wanting to take over Melbourne. The simple fact is that the threats to Australia and the conflicts in which we might be involved are all closer to Western Aus-· tralia, and history supports that belief. During the last world war, it became necessary to create bases all along the west coast. Taking my words to their obvious conclusion, lone can see that even Perth is too far south for our forces to protect Australia properly or to make Australia quickly able to participate where its responsibilities demand participation. I do not know why the Government has backed away from this proposition, but it now has a classic example. It is fortunate that Saddam Hussein did not put all his resources into sea-going equipment and decide that he wanted the north-west shelf, because he would be three-quarters of the way here before our equipment got around from Sydney. That is a fact. .. The two-ocean policy was introduced by the Minister for Transport and Communications,. with my total support. The Minister was right, but the policy is being allowed to fade away. There is nothing positive about that. I hope that my comments go on the record and that the message gets to the people responsible. The sailors and soldiers have to take a lot of the blame. It is a disgt1ace when people who take on a militarr career start to consider where they wOEld be most comfortable. That is an outjage. I am not just saying that because I think it; I have read comm'thts in the press by Navy personnel, partiCUlarly over the submarine refit, that matte clear what was a major consideration ih keeping the work in Sydney Harbour, which is about the least appropriate place to do the work, for a thousand ecological and other reasons. The reality is that the Services did not want to be shifted from Sydney. Soon they will not want to go to a war. This point must be understood-the potential for conflict for Australian forces lies closest to the Western Australian coast. That is where substantial facilities should be established. The Navy had better get the message if it has not got it already. It is just abo.ut to go to a place where hostilities exist. The ships have not left Australia yet. It is 16 or 17 days since the decision was made in Australia to send those ships. I have made that point because I think we will never get a better example of how wrong it is to back away from a policy that was put in place and certainly deserved commendation. I do not know what the Minister can do about it but I hope he and some of his colleagues sitting here today go back and say, 'We had better get that particular proposal back on track because it is in the national interest'. That is my main concern. In conclusion, I should like to add, as many have, my support and concern for those people whose relatives, friends, husbands, et cetera, are trapped in Iraq or Kuwait. I also express my support for the families and friends of those troops who have gone to do for Australia what is necessary in this situation. I trust that no more shots are fired but I certainly would support the Government if in time it felt, along with the United Nations, that that was the necessary solution. We cannot have wha! h-s happened. We cannot say, as we did m 1938, 1939 and 1940, .'Just giye hiI!l little bit more;. th-t might satisfy .hlm . There is no sahsfymg people of this nature They go on collecting smaller countries· with their military might until such time as there are none left. Whether we like it or not, we are very much a liquid-energy dependent nation. In fact, I have made the point time and again in my own State, where people now think they can save the environment by burning all the gas, that our kids will it for· mobility. We are getting another lesson there. When we have a stationary energy producing facility we will use coal or uranium if we have any sense, and we will use it in the most environmentally acceptable way. But if we burn gas just because it is an easy way out of an environmental problem, we are doing our families and our great-grandchildren a great disservice. In Australia we cannot move without liquid or gaseous fuel. Our great agricultural industry cannot be run without liquid or gaseous fuel, and I make the point that it is impossible to have a dictator of the likes of Hussein monopolising that by force of arms. The Government was right and the Opposition was right to support it promptly and in the fashion that it did. Unfortunately, our other policies have not allowed us to act as promptly as we should have. Thank goodness we are not facing a conflict that would have made this situation a disaster. We have to get that twoocean policy back in place and the facilities have to be created in Western Australia to support the ships that are necessary to give us an active role where the dangers exist: that is not off Sydney and it is not south of Melbourne. Mr RONALD EDWARDS· (Stirling) (9.54)-I rise to support the motion and to make some remarks that will elaborate on what I believe is a very significant contribution by the Government and by the. Pri.me Minister (Mr Hawke) on this major Issue. It is seldom that honourable !'l1em-ers rise in this place at a time that IS .qulte as potentially dangerous as this. thmk many people celebrated in recent times the worldwide reduction in tension and we saw the good efforts of President Bush and President Gorbachev, showing that the world had become a safer place. We saw barriers go down in eastern Europe and we saw people celebrating their newfound freedom. All this gave us reason to believe that the world was a kinder, healthier, happier and more optimistic place. I think many of us also believed that we would have from that peace dividend the opportunity to do some significant things on a worldneed wide basis with respect to environmental management and hunger. I trust that we can still get to those goals but, as is so often the case with world events, there is a dark side to some natures and there is a dark side to some emerging situations. What we have in the Middle East at the moment is one of those very dark sides, and I think many people in thi- place feel a sense of foreboding. We had a contribution from the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), and I think it did a disservice to the work of the previous Minister for Defence, now the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), who is in the House at the moment, and the current Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). This debate has not been characterised by partisan contributions and I do not propose to make mine particularly partisan. However, I think it does need to be acknowledged that, arising out of the Dibb report, there was put before the Australian people a White Paper on defence. What we saw was a significant change in Australia's defence strategy and defence structure and a recognition of what Australia could do. I suggest to the honourable member for O'Connor that he needs to understand that Australia is now better equipped in terms of its defence management than it was in. the past because we have identified more clearly our defence needs and our capacity to meet those defence needs. It is interesting that in the seven years of Labor, where we have had very tight Budgets and there has been decreasing I expenditure across the board, we have managed still to retain a viable defence profile. That suggests a lot about the skill and management at ministerial level and, following that, at the operational level of the forces themselves, and I want to put that on record. I think it is very significant. It needs to be understood too that when we are talking about the dispatch of frigates w- are not talking about a rapid deployment force. Clearly, if we were talking about a rapid deployment force some of the remarks made by the honourable member for O'Connor would have had application, but the frigates are not a rapid deployment force; we are talking about another matter. I know that the honourable member for Swan and Leader of the House is speaking in the debate so I will not traverse much more of that, but I did want to get on record very clearly that the role at the policy level has meant that Australia is now well prepared in a professional sense to make the commitment it has made. In talking about the conflict in particuof lar, one thing that has been missed by many commentators is that fundamentally what Iraq wanted to do was to kill the banker-and in its case the banker was Kuwait. It owed Kuwait a lot of money and, in simple terms, what Iraq wanted to do was to wipe out that debt by wiping out the regime in Kuwait. That goes back to the sort of adventurism we have seen historically where if one rode down the main street and knocked over the bank, one knocked over the town. I think that encapsulates the thinking of Hussein in terms of this adventurism in the Middle East. It also needs to be emphasised that those actions were seen for what they were, both in Australia at the government level and certainly in the United States (US). What is perhaps not understood by some in the community is that those first few days when the Americans committed their forces on the ground in Saudi Arabia were very dangerous days for those people initially committed. They were incapable in a large sense of sustaining any major attack by Iraqi forces, but they were there to show the flag and to start that deployment of US forces. Fortunately, time has enabled the US forces to build in number and to build in strength. We are now seeing a very substantial deployment of US forces, and it is necessary that that ground deployment is there. As well, there is the question of the naval deployment in the Persian Gulf. It is important to emphasise that Australia is part of an international commitment and an expression of international outrage at what has happened. That is a very important element to focus on here. We have inherited the good diplomatic work of recent times. The Soviet Union, the United States and many other countries are joining forces. It needs also to be added in this context that we are seeing the Arab countries joining forces with the United States, Australia and other countries, condemning President Hussein and being prepared to commit forces to follow that condemnation. That is a very important development and I think it shows that the world at large has a recognition what is at stake. What is at stake is a very substantial threat to the world. I make another point that I think is relevant. We noticed that President Hussein tried to shift the debate around by suggesting that really it was just a question of trying to get the Israelis to behave themselves. He suggested that now that the democratically formed government of Kuwait that had requested the Iraqis to invade it had restored some sense of stability in Kuwait the important thing now was to deal with the terrible Israelis. He said that if the Israelis would give up the so-called occupied territory we could return to normal trading and stable relations in the Middle East. The world understands that for what it is. It is just another lie in the arrangement of lies that President Hussein has put up. I am pleased to see that other Arab countries have joined this international role, thus showing that they dg. not accept Hussein's argument. They also understand that their countries could well have been the next ones to be subject to threat. The lie that was put about by President Hussein needs to be seen for what it is, a substantial lie. It also points to the fact that has been expressed many times by the Israelis th-ms-lves---:-the d-fficulty have in dealIng .1fl theIr regIOn and. - he importance they p-ace upon recog-ItH;m of their right to eXIst as a country In Its own right and as the democratically elected government of Israel. It is very important in this debate that we do not forget the role of Israel. I focus further on the Australian commitment. I think I can follow the remarks of colleagues in this House who have said that they hope that the Australian commitment can go without suffering any loss of life or damage. We would hope that there is no need for that level of activity and involvement. I wish to make a point about the media's coverage. It is one thing that particularly disturbs me. There were many people who made professional decisions to go into the armed forces, in this case, the Royal Australian Navy. I find it particularly petty and annoying to see a mother farewelling her husband on the dockside with her children only to have a microphone put in front of her and a reporter to ask, 'How do you feel?'. It is pretty obvious how she feels. She feels upset and very distraught because she is going to be separated from her husband for a lengthy period. Quite honestly, it is cheap journalism. That is the time when those people deserve some privacy, to feel their grief and their anxiety and not have to become part of the general tissue that the media want to make by saying, 'Well, tonight we have a mother on television weeping as she is waving farewell to the ship'. Of course, that is the case. It has been the case too many times for Australian families. Ninety thousand Australians lie buried in Europe. We have had that circum-tance before. What is particularly annoymg now is that the media want to make a cheap shot out of it. Members of the me-is then try to talk to sailors, who are ObVIOusly feeling uncertainty and doubt, ?nd take advantage of them by asking, How do you feel? Do you feel scared?'. Of course anyone facing uncertainty feels apprehensive, but we have to recognise tha- - hese people have made professional declSlons which surround the uncertainty. they It is a bit like my expressing a bit of uncertainty about election outcomes, but that is a way of life. That is what we accept.",84
107,Mr BEAZLEY,MIDDLE EAST,But you don't cry about it.,89
108,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,MIDDLE EAST,That is right; we do not cry about it. Balmain boys and others do not cry about it. Mr Hawker-You have got a marginal seat.,89
109,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,MIDDLE EAST,"Yes, I have a marginal seat. We need to understand that. We do not undervalue the quality of the defence personnel, the same as we do not undervalue the quality of the police personnel. That is part of their job. It is a credit to people that, knowing that, they go into these jobs. This Government has done a lot in terms of standards of service and support for people. That is why it is important. At some stage the statement might well be made, 'Now it is your turn to make that commitment'. We ought to make sure that we have professional people and that they are properly resourced. That has been happening in recent years. A lot of people think that when we talk about standards of support and service in our defence forces they are just words. We need that qualitative support because at a particular time someone has to face that very challenging decision that these people have had to face. The fact that they faced it and they will go about their job very professionally is understood by us. I hope that it is understood by the media. I am sure that it .is understood by the 'community at large that we are very fortunate to have such people who are prepared to make that commitment and to be skilfully led. These people are not sent off willy-nilly without a care or without any consideration. This process was thought through at the level of Government and was thought through very carefully. The decisions were made very sensibly and solidly. Honourable members will notice that today's motion points to a number of elements of the decisions that were taken and that is important. Australia is prepared, along with many other countries, to make a substantial commitment in a very dangerous area of the world and to say to Hussein and the people around him that it is not on, that we are not prepared to stand back and let him make the rules that suit himself. As has been said by many others, we have to understand that we are dealing in a very dangerous situation with someone for whom the normal rules of conduct are thrown aside. The normal rules of conduct would be seen in the treatment of foreign nationals. The fact that foreign nationals are now hostages is one example of where those normal rules of conduct have been brushed aside. I would have thought that another normal rule of conduct is that one does not use one's armed forces on one's own people. We have seen Hussein do that in relation to the Kurdish people. Clearly scant regard is being paid to the normal rules of conduct. The important thing is that we, as part of the civilised world, have to set down rules. This motion pays attention to those rules and it recognises that those matters of behaviour and principles are things need to be pursued. At the end of itthere will be an end-and because of the commitment that has been given by people there will be a very satisfactory end from the point of view of the Western world and the world at large. What we need to say to people like Hussein is that he is not going to be allowed to pursue this conduct without there being some price, - ome retribution. All of us in this place, and the community at large, recognise the serious situation that is confronting Australia and the world. The decisions that have been taken are serious decisions. The Government has thought them through. I am pleased to see the quality of'remarks that have been made in this place by members contributing to the debate. This Parliament is a very proper forum for this sort of debate to take place. If could express the hope of everyone it would be that there will be a peaceful settlement along the lines that this motion Western world. sets out. Accordingly, I am pleased to commend the motion to the House.",89
110,Mr CADMAN,MIDDLE EAST,"1 commend the Government for the decision that it took. There has been criticism of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and what appeared to be his singular role in making the decision to send an Australian force to the Middle East. That .criticism did not lack substance. That is the Prime Minister's prerogative. I cannot believe that without consultation, even with his Minister for Defence or his Minister for Foreign Affairs, a Prime Minister would make that sort of decision. It is his role and duty where he sees that circumstances need a quick response to state very clearly Australia's interests and intention. I want to make that clear at the beginning. I will have some criticis.Q1s of the Government later but I think we need to understand that part of the problems that we are witnessing in the power play to gain access to oilfields is part of a competition that has been taking place over the last four or five years between a number of leaders in the Middle East. For some time Egypt was considered to be the leader of all of the. Arab factions, the strongman of Middle Eastern politics, the that strongman of the Arab world. Gradually-I guess it started with the Camp David Accords-Egypt was somewhat ostracised by the rest of the Arab world. From that point on the ascendancy of Syria became obvious. Syria's so-called peacekeeping role in Lebanon is a euphemism for what appears to be a grab for extra territory. The Syrian President has the capacity to deliver strong messages and to be able to back up his claims with a very extensive military force. The recent events, I believe, appear to be a bid by Iraq to take that primacy position in Middle Eastern politics and to make the claim that Iraq is the prime Arab state. It is a foolish bid by somebody whose balance and grip of safety and security has to be questioned and who has demonstrated his instability and I willingness to take up both a religious and political cause, a cause that is little understood here in Australia or by others in the So the three players in the more moderate and perhaps strong politics of the Middle East have not been so much the radicals of the Palestine Liberation Organisation or the .Colonel Gadda-s but have been alternatively Egypt, Syna and noW Iraq. The pride that seems to attach to this role of being the premier Arab state is extremely dangerous because it appears that threats to human life and all techniques of terrorism can be disregarded if the stakes are' high enough. So the dangerous situation of competition and personal pride, particularly at the moment, is fuelling the stances that are being taken by President Hussein, and they are demonstrations of .his wish to stand above all Arab leaders. The grab for world resources that has taken place since 2 August has been horrific and very worrying to freedom-loving democratic nations. So strong has been that claim and so forthright have been the statements of the President of Iraq that countries such as Jordan, through its King, have been bluffed into complying with the wishes of the President of Iraq. Jordan has been considered for some time to be a friend of the West, and the strength of the claims by Iraq Can be judged by the willingness of King Hussein to act as an envoy to President Bush, to be equivocal in his statements and at later stages to be prepared to support President Hussein. It appears that there has been some reversal in the role of Jordan in the last few days. The Australian Government's quick reaction is a worthwhile endorsement of the initiatives and decisions taken by President Bush. The tampering with world re-, sources and the willingness to blackmail the rest of the world into submission to what appears to be a fait accompli cannot be regarded as anything but sheer terror'ism and brute force against a small na,tion. The annexation of Kuwait, an advanced Arab state, is sheer barbarism. , ,The mixture of fanatical religious - ith politics is extremely dangerous and 1S obvious in a few states in the Middle Ea-t. Regrettably, a small proportion of reSIdents of Australia endorse it. Those people ought to be denounced and it ought to be indicated to them that attitudes and ambitions they take for granted as part of the Middle Eastern politico-religious activity have no place in Australia, and never will. If they have doubts about that, maybe their best place of residence is not Australia. That aside, Australians are concerned about friends, families and fellow Australians who are currently in Kuwait under some sort of loose house arrest, approaching a hostage situation. They are frequently referred to in the press as hostages. They are not free to leave, and noW we see the movement of personnel to act as a further buffer or measure to prevent any military action or any limited military operations by the United States, the United Nations and the free world. That is deplorable. It is a barbaric attitude that I do not think we have witnessed since the Second World War; It leads me to be slightly critical of the terms of the Prime Minister's motion before the House today. I know that we on this side agreed to the motion and I know of the negotiations that have taken place but it seems to me that the Prime Minister, having taken that firm action, is somewhat moving away. His action in supporting the Americans was justified by its acceptance by nation after nation in the United Nations, by the swing of public opinion and support around the world, by increasing support within the United Nations, and by the change of heart of·a .number of important Iraqi neighbours in the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, those nations gradually supporting the actions of the United States. It appears now that the Prime Minister is somewhat moving away from his initial action, which was so worthy, to be prepared to refer any further actions to the Caucus room before he takes a decision. I think that is a stepping back from responsibility and from the role Austrabelief lians want to see him play. A Cabinet decision, yes, but a Party decision in this instance is not warranted. The speed with which things may need to be done and decisions taken do not warrant such an approach. The members on the left of the Australian Labor Party should be well warned that their claim to be heard at this point could really start to damage the unity that has been so far expressed by democratic nations of the West in their reaction to the problems in the Middle East. In his motion the Prime Minister gave great attention to the legalities of the. United Natiops sanctions. He also backed away from any indication that he would support a blockade in international legal terms but has limited his statement to indicating that Australian forces in Middle East will have the role of identibe, fication, contact, interrogation and warnsome ing, enforcing against Iraq article 51 of the United Nations Charter. Australia, the Prime Minister says, will continue its diplomatic efforts. That is be commended because in the long run the diplomatic efforts are the. ones that will bring results. But to what extent those diplomatic efforts need to be endorsed a preparedness to be firm, to stand for principle, to say that we would not dorse an unwarranted attack on an innoman cent small nation to gain access resources and the extent to which we are prepared to back our repugnance. at such a decision may be critical factors in the resolution of the problem. There are difficult days' ahead. The tralian community will watch with real concern the changing events in the' dle East. That concern is especially sharpmaybe ened by the fact that within the last 12 tionallaw. months we have seen a massive change of attitude and outlook by the Eastern bloc, Transport the Soviet Union and its satellites. In minds of most Australians, that throws into sharp contrast the need for a more peaceful way of approaching negotiations and contact between opposing forces. It amazing to see the Soviet Union giving its support to the actions of the United Nations and in so doing providing inforwe mation to its former foe, the United States, about the weaponry, tactics and strategies likely to be used by Iraq. That is wonderful to see, yet somebody who is so committed to ideology and religious fervour, so bound up with his own sense of self-importance and pride, is prepared to risk the freedom of the world for a short, self-serving goal. Australians want to see this matter resolved and they encourage the Government to use diplomacy. They are concerned about the future of their families. People in my electorate have young members of their family in Kuwait. I understand their deep concern; it is really worrying. They cannot get decent information. They do not know what the outcome is going to be. These young people the do not know whether they are going to in a metaphorical sense, bound to installation to protect that installation with their life against attack by the United States. So that is their worry. I guess the real concern at the end of to the day is that this matter will drag on for many months and in fact years to a point where the lack of resolve on the part of the Western allies is such that by Hussein eventually has his way. That a would be the worse result because that enwill only encourage him or another madof a similar outlook to further their to claims by doing similar things. We had ,a rash at one stage of aircraft hijackings to express a. political viewpoint. It took a long time before people were able to ,resolve. the way in which that Ausshould be dealt with. It was dealt with by force and by international law. Maybe the Midresult for Kuwait will be a resolution by force but certainly by interna",90
111,Mr BEAZLEY,MIDDLE EAST,"1 would like to make a couple of points at the outset and then discuss in a bit more detail the motion that is before us. The first thing that I state, as someis body who was once Minister for Defence in this country, is that my thoughts very much go out to the men on the ships as send them to the Middle East-and they leave tomorrow finally from Australia-and their families. The men have had excellent training. They have had further training over the last few days. They go with ships as well equipped as they can be by a country like ours to deal with the sorts of problems they may confront. ,Nevertheless, in wartime, ships at sea will always face dangers and those dangers will have to be overcome. 0,n occasions that means there are casualtIes, and on occasions they succeed. All we know as we send the men off is that they have the very best equipment that those ships are capable of carrying and that they are, the very best trained sailors that this country, has sent into a conflict zone for very long period of time. The second point, which is totally unrelated but it needs to be made because this is a' conflict and a problem with vigne!tes which, need to be highlighted, concerns, as many speakers have said' in this debate, the utter barbarity of the sition of the Government of Iraq vis-a-vis foreign hostages. It is the behaviour of people deliberately placing themselves outside the community of nations. Of course, it offends traditions of correct ternational practice with which we are all familiar. It also offends another tradition of which Saddam Hussein ought to be familiar, and that is the duty of a host to protect a guest, whether or not that guest happens to harbour hostile intentions or be regarded with hostility by the host. That is an obligation Arab' communities have imposed on themselves and accepted down the years, and it is one of the most attractive features of Arab civilisation. Sad dam Hussein not only stands for all that is worse, as far as what we in' our societies would understand is the correct mode of international behaviour, but he offends the spirit and principles of the societies out of which he has come. He is truly an outlaw. The third point that has come up is the role of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in decision making prior to the commitment of these Australian ships and also the question of command and related arrangements. The first thing I think ought to be noted is the sanctions, which, was the initial, decision taken by this Government. Support for United Nations'sanctions was given by the Cabinet. That was f?llowed in succeeding days by consult ahon by the Prime Minister with members of the security committee who could be contacted about the prospect that Australia might decide to enforce those sanctions by committing those ships. When all members of that committee and the Prime Minister came to an agreement on what ought to be done, a phone call was received from George Bush. It was not in response to George Bush's phone call that these decisions were taken, but in rea sponse to the independently developed assessment by the Australian Government of its own obligations and requirements to protect Australian: interests and international law. The question of command arrangements has been raised and apswered by po- Ministers on this side of the House; suffice it to say that it is a situation requiring alacrity and they are circumstances where people are not absolutely certain who they are going to be operating with because inmany nations are in the process of taking these decisions at this time. With the conditions under which colleagues operate and impose on themselves, it is not easy to arrive rapidly at a conclusion on those matters. All people involved in this acknowledge that there is a requirement to come to those conclusions and are doing their very best to arrive at those decisions. There are a number of points that should be made in the short time that is available to all speakers in this House and therefore is also available to me. A couple of things about this situation need to be highlighted. Our first obligation is to make these affairs understood by a contemporary generation. In this debate so far and in the general community there have been many false analogies. The falsest is comparison of the situation we now confront with that in Vietnam. I do not have time to go into that in detail, but anyone who asserts that has no comprehension of history. The history of that particular conflict, the circumstances of the commitment of Australian forces and other forces to that conflict, and the situation on the ground, were all different. Nobody who has the remotest historical understanding of that could conceivably come to the conclusion that there is anything analogous in this situation. That some members of the academic community have managed to do that casts severe doubts on the credentials they, but no-one else, assign themselves; The second point is that some more accurate historical analogies have been drawn-those. in relation to questions of behaviour in the 1930s. I do think are· some similarities and valuable lessons there, but I rather do fear as I consuit daughters on these matters that these things are not well understood by a connot temporary generation. So we who are inof volved in this process in this Parliament· must understand that we have the oblisanctions gation to educate a generation anew if we are going to draw the right lessons from this particular conflict. The first thing that needs to be understood by the community at large is that small nations live by respect for international law. The actual state of relations between states in our international community is essentially anarchy. In those. sorts of circumstances the most likely outcome of any conflict or any decision is going to be an outcome in favour of the wilful and those who wilfully exercise power. Unless they are checked by an honest conviction among other states that the actions they undertake must be resisted, and they are checked by those states who have those convictions who are prepared not only to simply state them but to act in accordance with them and to prevent the buccaneer and bandit from taking matters into their own hands, the power will be theirs. In these circumstances, the ability of nations to act collectively is absolutely critical. Without necessarily referring to any particular special local circumstances-and they always have to be understood-the basic principle that in international affairs we uphold territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations, and we are prepared to see that protected whether the nation is capable of defending itself or not, must be accepted and upheld. It has to be particularly ingrained in a nation like Australia which is not· by any means either a world power or necessarily a regional power. It is not always possible in these circumstances for nations to act collectively. They have to some degr-e to act individually with reference to the collective. That has eminently happened here. The United Nations has acted swiftly, as it has indeed in a number of areas over the last couple of years. All those hopes that people held there for the United Nations when it was initially created and seemed so dashed by my experiences in the 30 years afterwards are actually beginning to come .to fruition, only in this matter but in a number other areas. The United Nations acted effectively in imposing sanctions. Those will bite, but not immediately. Debate interrupted. NA",92
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Mr Nehl)Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",94
113,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT,I require that the question be put forthwith without debate. Question resolved in the negative. NA Ministerial Statement Debate resumed.,94
114,Mr BEAZLEY,MIDDLE EAST,"The fact is that nations must be prepared to act to uphold those decisions which are takencollectively and in this particular case Australia, along with a number of over nations, has .acted to do that, properly citing section 51 of the United Nations Charter, a very important section to nations like Australia because it gives us the capacity to call for other people to come to our aid, and we must respect it when other countries call for others to come to their aid when they confront situations of serious trouble. We have acted in accordance with that. Separately, the United States did, too. Everybody likes a free kick at the United States. Let us understand this absolutely and fundamentally about this crisis. With all the resolutions in the world, with all the effective sanctions imposed, nations that are wilful and with power can still act and create political facts on the ground which enable them to dominate subsequent political discussion. If Iraq had exercised the capa-it- it had at one point to roll up the SaudI ollfields, we would be confronting a very different political situation today. That it did not was a result, not so much necessarily of the way in which we and - thers. of our size acted but of the way m which the United St-tes reacted. It said, 'You step over that line and you will experience awesome difficulties'. As a result of that, there was an opportunity for a stiffening of the politi-al environment around the globe and m the region to deal with the operations of the international bandit. As we sit and contemplate the circumstances in which we find ourselves, it needs to be remembered that we are not alone in our views and we are not alone in the context of developments in regional politics. A number, indeed a majority, of nations in the Arab community have recognised the behaviour of Saddam Hussein for what it is and are acting accordingly to defend their colleagues in this regard. Another point that needs to be understood that is very important to us-and there is a lesson we all need to learn from that-is how important defence self-reJiance is. In the final analysis we prevent other people from creating political facts about us by being able to resist them. The Kuwaitis, unfortunately, are in the position where they are debating this particular matter with the Iraqis, with the support of all the rest of us, from the point of view of a government in exile. It is much easier, it has to be said, to uphold one's territorial integrity if one has managed to resist one's would be attacker at the borders, and to a considerable extent nations these days require a self-reliant capability in order to be able to do it. Prudent nations advance their - elf--eliant capability, firstly, by establishproblems Ing It and, secondly, by having friendships. Alliances are not irrelevant· to a strategy of self-reliance. They are not irrelevant to ourselves; they are not irreleyant to the Saudis; and they were not trrelevant to the Kuwaitis. Alliances are important and they are worthwhile keeping intact. I think a further point needs to be understood about our position. It was never intended th-t a self-reliant strategy was solely an issue of continental defence. We made absolutely clear as we announced it that we would retain the capacity to be able to operate elsewhere and we are well served by the nature of Australian geography in being able to do that. We required for ourselves the capacity of long distance operations to deal with the problems that we confronted around our coastline and to our approaches and that enables us to act further afield. I guess the proof of the pudding is - n the eating, in the ships that we have managed to send away on this occasion. A further point that needs to be made, and it will be my final point, is the question of the state of the globe and what might be anticipated as a result of this crisis. Many speakers have alluded to the fact that the world has change<;l. Changing superpower relationships have been very important in this case. That is true. When I was Defence Minister I spent a very long time trying to convince people that one way or another the issues of the central balance were not necessarily of major importance to .us in Australia. They could be and they might not be. But what was absolutely critical to us was t,hat developing in the nations of the Third World were military capabilities that a generation ago had been associated only with superpowers-the ability to deliver weapons of mass destruction by ballistic missiles and the changing nature of regional balances that occurred when states chose to include those within their armouries. One of the tragedies of the situation is that the nations of the world that looked at the developments in Iraq over the last decade did not point out the sorts of that would be emerging in the Third World generally by the example set by the apparently successful use of weapons of mass destruction and the apparent political advantages that would grow for a regional power that developed for itself effectively strategic weapons. An awful lot of the bluff that Iraq has been able to deliver to its neighbours in' the Middle East has been a product of its ability to develop those weapons. In many ways the peace movements of the world have been off the main game for the last decade. The fact is that the superpowers, even in their periods of high tension, have largely always acted responsibly, with a full understanding of the capabilities of their weapons. The same cannot be said of other nations who have developed the same sorts of capabilities and included them within their inventory, albeit on a smaller scale. We would do well to remember the fact that these examples have now been set and are being understood and studied in regions of even more significance to us than the Middle East. That will always be a factor in Australian debate. We will always require in Australian political debate an understanding of the need for small nations to defend the rule of law and be protected by it, the need for self-reliant strategies, and the need for an association with good and reliable friends.",94
115,Mr MACKELLAR,MIDDLE EAST,"1 welcome the chance to take part in this debate. I agree with a number of the comments made by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley). It is becoming ever more clear that whilst we all applaud the lessening in superpower tensions, in fact, for countries like Australia and many other countries around the world, the difficulties that could confront nations like our own may well be increased by the lessening of the superpower tension. I think this is just one of the first examples. It is rather ironic that so soon after the world was applauding the changes that had taken place, suddenly we are confronted with Realpolitik and the absolute use of force in a way which brings home to all of us the need to be conscious at all times of the major responsibility of any government of any nation, and that is to protect the security of that nation. I regard the decision by the Australian Government to supply forces to the multination force as a proper one. I say in passing that I would have hoped that the decision was made a little differently from the way it was made. I think that it is terribly important for all those who are members of the forces that will be present in this area to be strongly of the view that the Australian Government in to to and the Opposition are behind them in their presence there. That goal would, I think, have been more ably served if the decision had been a full Cabinet decision in the first place. I just mention that in passing because I do believe now that the Parliament is making a decision today which should strongly underline the bipartisan view that the decision that has been taken is supported across the Parliament. When we look at the situation that we are confronting at this stage, we see that there are very great differences in the manner of behaviour of the protagonists. One of the things that we need to come to grips with is the attitudes which are displayed by people of different backgrounds and different cultures. One only has to look at the history of the Middle East to realise that attitudes towards human life, attitudes towards treatment of one's fellow human beings are very different when they are exercised by a person like the leader of Iraq at the present time. What is being tried, which is a disturbing development, is an effort to unite the Arab world against the Western world. Unfortunately, there is evidence that that effort is bearing some fruit. I would hope that we can use every endeavour to break down that effort, because the last thing that we would like to see or we should have is the lie perpetrated that this action by a combined forces is simply an anti-Arab action. It is not. . It is an action designed to forestall the naked exercise of force by a strong country against a very weak country. I would hope that nationals or former nationals of the countries' involved who may be living in Australia do not confuse nationalism with the reality of what has occurred, and I would hope that people in Australia of Arab background would not allow themselves to be duped by anysl:lggestion that the action taken by the Umted States or any of the countries involved in the multination force is the result of an anti-Arab feeling amongst them. There are some actions or some instances in relation to this exercise which I think we should look at fairly carefully. One of them, of course, related to the question I asked in the House earlier today when I asked about lines of command and rules of engagement. I think it is terribly important that those matters are cleared up well before the Australian force reaches the zones of engagement or the zones of interdiction and those areas where they could be involved in armed action. There is nothing more unsettling for people involved in these services if they are unsure as to those particular matters, and I am reassured by the declaration of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the House today that those matters are being attended to at the present time. I was glad to hear the Minister at the table, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), talk about Australia's capacity to take part in long distance operations. I think that what we are, if nothing else, is a member of the world community rather than just a regional community, and any defence planning which restricts itself to a regional geography is out of touch with the nature of threats or possible threats that can front Australia in the future. Whilst I think it is important that this matter is underlined, I do have some concern about the reality of our capacity· to place the forces there that we see before us. I think it is an indictment on Australian defence planning that in fact our supply - essel has to have aboard it an army contmgent to provide it with some sort of air cover. I think this is a grave indictment of adequate defence planning because, hopefully, in the future, naval vessels will have the capacity to defend themsel ves against air attack without the necessity to take on board elements of other "".lilitary services. In this regard, would mstance the circumstances which our patrol boats face at the present time. I think there is at least an argument to suggest that they should be better armed than they presently are to take into accoun,t possible situations in which they may find themselves involved in the future. I think that this particular example may be instructive for future defence planning when we are looking at what is appropriate in terms of properly arming those elements of the Australian services that we have available. All in all, there is no doubt in my mind that Australia should have taken the decision that has been taken. I strongly support it, leaving aside the manner in which it was taken. I think that it is incumbent upon all of us to stress the fact and to combat those people within Australia who would put forward the lie that we are merely responding to the request from the United States, rather than acting in our own interest. I think this is something which needs to be stressed and stressed again because, if it is not combated at the earliest opportunity, it may become accepted wisdom amongst those who would oppose Australia's commitment to this multi-nation force. Again, I think that we should be bending our diplomatic and other efforts to ensure that the multi-nation force is expanded to include more countries than are presently there, and I am confident that this will occur. All in all, we are faced with a situation which is perilous to those conpeople who are present in that region of the world. It is, to put it at its lightest, a matter of the utmost regret that innocent civilians should be taken away and used as hostages by this man and his government, and put in positions of extreme danger simply at his whim. It is against, in my view, all the tenets of. proper international behaviour, and it demonstrates very clearly the ruthlessness of the Government of Iraq, and is something which almost, apart from anything else, should justify those of us who believe that this naked use of force should be opposed. Mr Speaker, there has been quite a long debate about this matter today .. I think it I is appropriate that it should be debated. I think it is very appropriate that it should be a bipartisan situation, because those people who are sailing into these dangerous waters in dangerous areas need to know that the Parliament of Australia is strongly behind them. There are lessons that can be learnt, both from the manner of the decisiontaking and also in terms of the preparedness of the vessels and armaments involved, and I hope those lessons will be properly learnt.",96

The following answers to questions were circulated: Community Recreation and Sporting Facilities Program (Question No.4) Mr Andrew asked the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 9 May 1990: (1) Was the Community Recreation and Sporting Facilities Program designed initially to run for three years. (2) Were the funds set aside for the program intended to be distributed evenly throughout the duration of the program. (3) Did the sum distributed for the second year of the program, namely the sum announced in November 1989, conform with the sum originally allocated for that year. (4) Did the total sum distributed in 1990 expend the allocation for the three year program; if so, will additional funds be allocated for the third year or will the program be terminated after only two of the planned three years.",98
120,Mrs KELLY,PAPERS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) No. The notional allocation for this Program was $4m in 1988-89, $5m in 1989-90 and $4m in 1990-91. (3) No. The sum announced on 6 December 1989, namely $6,502,498, is the total value of grants approved by the then Minister at that time. Funds are not paid to grant recipients at the time of approval. They are paid on a recompense basis after work has been undertaken. Expenditure in 1989-90 is estimated to be $4m. This includes expenditure on projects approved in 1988-89. (4) No. As funds are distributed on a recompense basis the Program will continue into 199091 (estimated $6m) and 1991-92 (estimated $2.7m). (Question No.5) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 9 May 1990: (1) Has the Australian Wheat Board depressed domestic wheat prices by $30 to $35 per tonne as compared to prices which would have been achievable under the previous domestic formula; if not, has the Board sold wheat at any price that would have reduced the net return to wheatgrowNA ers below that achieved under the previous domestic pricing formula. (2) Does the Government intend to encourage the Australian Wheat Board to use the proceeds of the grower levy to compete in the domestic market in apparent pursuit of market share rather than satisfactory returns to wheat growers whom it is obliged to serve. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (l) The Australian Wheat Board (A WB) is required, under its legislative objectives, to maximise net returns to growers who deliver wheat for pooling. Under the wheat marketing arrangements introduced in 1989, wheat growers have a choice of several options when deciding to dispose of their wheat. Essentially, they may deliver it to a pool operated by the AWB, sell it for cash to the AWB or sell it to another buyer of their choice. Pool returns are well publicised and, indeed, most growers used this option last season. On the other hand the prices applying to cash sales are a private matter between the grower or seller and the buyer-which may be the AWB-and such prices are not made public. Furthermore since the AWB is now required to sell wheat in competition with other domestic traders, it is not appropriate for it to publicly release details of prices related to those sales. Given that this information is commercial-inconfidence the price variations referred to in your question, and which have been previously publicised in the press, have no basis in fact. The press article assumed that the AWB is charging millers the $A equivalent of its daily card prices. That analysis did not take into account the fact that the previous administered price included a margin of $16 per tonne to cover stockholding, carry over, credit and associated costs incurred by the AWB in servicing the domestic market. As such this margin was not a premium which accrued to growers. Wheat Under the current arrangements it is the responsibility of the Board of the AWB to decide the extent and manner of its participation in the domestic market. The restructured Board membership with its greater depth of business and commercial expertise.is well placed to make these decisions and evaluate marketing opportunities as they arise. The Board is accountable to the industry for its operations through statutory consultation arrangements with the Grains Council of Australia (GCA). (2) The Government does not intend to intervene in the management of Wheat Industry Fund which is financed through grower levies. In fact the industry, through the GCA, has been given the major role in determining how the Fund should be used and managed. The AWB now has as one of its objectives the provision of a choice of marketing options to all Australian grain growers, but especially wheat growers. From the outset the AWB has indicated its intention to utilise its increased commercial trading powers and play an active role in the domestic market for both wheat and other grains. It has rightly recognised that a failure to accept this challenge could result in the weakening of its position as Australia's major wheat marketer with a consequent impact on its export powers. The Fund provides the capacity for the A WB to participate in a commercial manner in the total grain market environment to achieve the above objective. However, the AWB has stated publicly that it does not intend to become the world's largest grain trader. Rather it aims to provide wheat growers with the best possible return but at the same time recognises that this may require it to adopt a significantly expanded role in the industry. (Question No.6) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, upon notice, on 9 May 1990: Has the Australian Wheat Board decided to sign a long-term freight contract with West rail Western Australia without calling tenders, as occurred in New South Wales, or negotiating a nominal reduction in rail freight, as occurred in Victoria; if so, what action does he propose to ensure that the Board meets its legal obligation, expressed in section 5(a) of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989, to maximise the net returns to Australian wheat growers who sell pool return wheat to the Board by securing, developing and maintaining markets for wheat and wheat products and by minimising costs as far as is practicable. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: . The Australian Wheat Board (A WB) has signed, In conjunction with Co-operative Bulk Handling Ltd, the Grain Pool of Western Australia, the Western Australian Farmers' Federation (WAFF) and the Pastoralists and Graziers' Association (PGA), a five year agreement with Westrail for the car-iage of wheat and other grains in Western AustralIa. The agreement was negotiated between the parties and tenders were not called. It is relevant to note that the WAFF and the PGA are the signatories representing producers and are also m-mbers of the WA Grain Freight Steering CommIttee. Freight rates set under the agreement are in line with those set under the former agreement and represent, according to the AWB, in general a nominal reduction in rates. Further, however, Westrail will be required to meet certain performance criteria which will result in a much improved service overall. It is the AWB's responsibility to negotiate such arrangements on behalf of those growers who deliver or sell wheat to the Board. With the authority and expertise available to the AWB they are clearly in the best place to do this, with the aim of meeting the objective of minimising costs. The AWB is directly accountable to the Grains Council of Australia (GCA) and I would expect that, in negotiation of the Westrail agreement, the growers' interests will have been well looked after by the WA Farmers' Federation which is a GCA affiliate. I will, of course, be assessing the Board's performance, by scrutiny of the Board's strategic plans and annual reports. Radio Station VNG (Question No.7) Mr MACKellar asked the Minister for Wheat Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 9 May 1990: Was radio station VNG, transmitting time service signals for surveying, geophysics and navigation, closed in 1986; if so, (a) why was it closed, (b) what was the cost of operating the station in its last full year of operation, (c) what in alternative system did the Government provide for intermediate time service users after the station was closed and (d) if the Government has decided to reinstate the VNG service, (i) on what date is it expected to become operational, «ii) what funding arrangements will apply to cover operating costs, (iii) which Government authority will be responsible for its operation and (iv) where will it be located.",104
121,Mr BEAZLEY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom Australia, is as follows: Although it was originally Telecom's intention to close the Time and Frequency Short Wave Station (VNG) in September 1986 the service was in fact maintained until 30 September 1987 to allow thorough ca-1Vassing of user needs and possible alternative funding. (a) The decision to discontinue the VNG service was made following a review of Telecom's broadcasting activities and an impending Government decision to dispose of the site at Lyndhurst where the VNG facilities were installed. As Telecom's own needs for time and frequency signals are adequately met through its terrestrial network, continuation of the service could not be justified. (b) The cost to Telecom of operating the VNG service in the year to 30 September 1987 was approximately $120,000. However, in this period staff on site were also engaged in dismantling the National Broadcasting facilities. (c) In the absence of any alternative funding to relocate the VNG service a consortium of interested users was formed under the auspices of the National Standards Commission (NSC). Having successfully negotiated for an alternatIve transmitting site at Llandilo in NSW the NSC accepted an offer from Telecom and the Department of Transport and Communications to donate the redundant equipment and arranged for its removal and reinstallation. (d) Time signal transmissions recommenced from the Llandilo site in August 1988.

122,Mr GRIFFITHS,BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Yes, there have been biological agents approved for release in Australia and its territories since 1983.

(2) What facilities or other arrangements will there be for car parking in the South Bank premises.",106
123,Mr BEAZLEY,BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows: (1) A basement was included in the original proposal and is still included in the final plans approved by the ABC Board. (2) Approximately 50 car parking places are planned for the basement. This area will accommodate ABC operational vehicles, together with space for some visitors and staff on shift work. It has also been proposed that a staff car parking co-operative be formed to negotiate bulk rates for spaces in adjoining commercial carparks. Radio Australia (Question No. 12) Mr N. A. Brown asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 9 May 1990: Has the ABC made a decision to move Radio Australia from Burwood to South Bank in Melbourne; if so, (a) on what date did the ABC make the decision and (b) for what reasons did the Board of the ABC make the decision. Mr BeazJey-The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows: (a) In September 1989, the ABC Board accepted a report on the future role and function of Radio Australia. The report recommended that the feasibility of co-locating Radio Australia in the South bank Project be fully investigated. In October 1989 the ABC Board accepted the conclusions of a Planning and Financial Study into the co-location of Radio Australia in the Southbank Project subject to more detailed costings. The ABC Board finally agreed to proceed with the Southbank Project, including facilities for Radio Australia, on 10 May 1990. (b) Both reports highlighted the fact that there were strong philosophical and operational arguments to support relocation. Additionally, the financial viability of the Southbank Project is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of Radio Australia. Radio Australia (Question No. 13) Mr N. A. Brown asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 9 May 1990: (1) Will there be any changes to the broadcasting services provided by Radio Australia after it has moved to South Bank in Melbourne; if so, what changes. (2) How many studios of the type known as control room studio pairs (a) are in the Radio Australia premises at Burwood and (b) will there be in the new premises of Radio Australia at South Bank? (3) In how many languages (a) does Radio Australia broadcast and (b) will Radio Australia broadcast after it has moved to South Bank. Mr BeazJey-The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows: (1) There will be no reduction in the broadcasting services provided by Radio Australia as a result of its move to South Bank. The new technology and facilities to be provided at South Bank will give Radio Australia access to a range of additional broadcasting-related activities and qualitative benefits. (2) Given the high level .of technology being planned for the South Bank building, it is not possible to directly compare existing technical spaces with those planned in the new building. There presently exists in the Radio Australia building five sets of rooms known as transmission control room pairs. At South Bank, Radio Australia will have seven highly equipped rooms, all of which will be capable of operating solo (one person operation) mode or as three sets of pairs. In addition there will be a further three dedicated control room studio pairs. Radio Australia will also have access to facilities primarily designed for domestic radio. (3) Radio Australia currently broadcasts in nine languages. There will be no change in the number of languages to be broadcast as a result of the move to South Bank. The languages broadcast by Radio Australia are the subject of regular review by Radio Australia Management and the ABC Board. Chinook Helicopters (Question No. 14) Mr Moore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 9 May 1990: Following his predecessor's announcement in July 1989 that 11 Chinook helicopters would be sold, (a) have any of the Chinooks been sold, (b) what is the exact sale status of the Chinooks, (c) did Boeing (US) offer to repair nine Chinooks in return for two, (d) how much is it costing to keep the Chinooks in storage, (e) where are the Chinooks being stored, (f) at what sum are they valued and (g) have there been any prospective purchasers; if so, (i) who were they and (ii) if the sale was not concluded, why not. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) No. (b) See my response of 10 May 1990 (Senate Hansard P 242) (c) No formal proposal has been received from Boeing (US). (d) The total cost from July 1989 to 14 May 1990 of preparation for storage and dehumidification of 11 Chinook helicopters was $54 000. Direct ongoing costs are less than $10.00 per day for power to !un the dehum!difiers. There woulbe some indIrect costs attributable to the ChInooks for hangar space and normal base security. These costs cannot be readily identified. (e) At RAAF Base Amberley. (f) The value of the helicopters will be determined by what the market is prepared to pay for them. (g) Because of the commercial sensitivity of negotiations with potential purchasers, it would not be appropriate to disclose their identity at this time. ' Geneva Protocols (Question No. 15) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 10 May 1990: (I) Did the Minister reiterate in the answer to question No. 1188 (Hansard, 21 December 1988, page 3953) that it is hoped that Australia will in the near future be in a position to ratify the 1977 Protocols Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. (2) Since that answer, (a) which States have become parties to the Protocols and on what dates and (b) how many more States have accepted the competence of the International FactFinding Commission pursuant to Article 90 (2) of Protocol I.

(b) As Mr Duffy indicated on 21 December 1988 in reply to a question by the Honourable Member, consultation with the States on the question of a declaration under Article 90 (2) will not take place until after the ratification of the Protocols as a whole. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (Question No. 18) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 10 May 1990: (I) Did Australia on 17 July 1980 sign the 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. (2) Did Australia on 28 July 1983 deposit an instrument of ratification of the Convention with reservations; if so, (a) what are the terms of the reservations and (b) when did the Government last give consideration to withdrawing the reservations:",111
125,Dr BLEWETT,BIOLOGICAL CONTROL AGENTS,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes (2) Yes (a) Reservations The Government of Australia states that maternity leave with pay is provided in respect of most women employed by the Commonwealth Government and the Governments of New South Wales and Victoria. Unpaid maternity leave is provided in respect of all other women employee- in the State of New South Wales and some State industrial awards. Social Security benefits subject to income tests are available to women who are sole parents. The Government of Australia advises that it is not at present in a position to take the measures required by Article 11(2)(b) to introduce maternity leave with payor with comparable social benefits throughout Australia. The Government of Australia advises that it does not accept the application of the Convention in so far as it would require alteration of Defence Force policy which excludes women from combat and combatrelated duties. The Government of Australia is reviewing this policy so as to more closely define 'combat' and 'combat-related duties'. (b) Australia is not yet in a position to withdraw these reservations. Since ratifying the Convention, the Government has been progressively working towards amending policy which would enable the withdrawal of these reservations: - Paid maternity leave is available to Commonwealth, NSW and Victorian public servants. Federal and State awards and the NSW Industrial Arbitration (Amendment) Act, 1980, provide unpaid maternity leave for almost all women employed in the private sector. All of these women are assured of the right to return to the position and wage level they left in maternity, or one comparable. In this last provision, Australia is one of the world leaders. - On 30 March 1990, Australia ratified International Labour Organisation Convention No. 156 which recognises the need for a mC\fe equitable sharing of family responsibilities and the provision of support services and appropriate working conditions for workers with those responsibilities. Ratifying countries are obliged to take account of the needs of workers with family responsibilities in relation to their terms and conditions of employment, vocational guidance and training, community planning and services and social security. The Government is undertaking to implement comprehensively the terms of ILO Convention No. 156. - It is Government policy to work for the progressive opening of additional Australian Defence Force (ADF) positions to women, thereby increasing both the scope and quality of their career opportunities. On 30 May 1990, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel announced that the ADF would no longer apply the exemption \lnder the Sex Discrimination Act which allows women to be excluded from combat related duties, and that ADF women would in future serve in combat-related positions. Combat-related positions are those close to combat operations and include transport, resupply, medical evacuation, intelligence and communications. Implementation of the new arrangements will be reviewed annually by the ADF and a review of the policy will be undertaken in June 1993. As a result of these recent changes to Government policy, Australia will be reviewing the status of its reservations to the Convention. UNESCO Constitutional Amendments ; (Question No. 19) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 10 May 1990: (1) Following an Australian and Canadian initiative at the 24th Session (1987) of the General Conference of UNESCO, did the General Conference at its 25th Session on 14 November 1989 adopt a report from the Legal Committee on the financial obligations of withdrawing Member States.

It is still too early to assess the effectiveness of the NSW legislation, and the Government is also awaiting the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's National Inquiry into Racist Violence. (3) Article 14 of the Convention provides for States Parties to declare their recognition of the competence of the UN Committee on the Elimination 'of Racial Discrimination to receive and consider communications from individuals and groups within that State Party who have exhausted all available domestic remedies. Australia has not to date made such a' declaration, but the issue is one that is on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General for consideration, together with the related issues of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the ICCPR) and the declaration that may be made under Article 41 of the ICCPR. Universal Copyright Convelltion (Question No. 32) Mr Hollis asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 10 May 1990: (1) What meetings have been held or are scheduled in 1990 pursuant to (a) the Berne Convention, (b) the Universal Copyright Convention and (c) the Rome Convention.

Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and . Folklore' (Question No. 33) Mr Hollis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on to May 1990: Did the General Conference of UNESCO on 15 November 1989 recommend that Member States bring the Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore to the attention of the authorities, departments or bodies responsible for matters relating to the safeguarding of folklore and to the attention of various organisations or institutions concerned with folklore; if so, which (a) authorities, (b) departments, (c) bodies, (d) organisations and (e) institutions have had their attention drawn to the recommendation ..",118
138,Dr BLEWETT,USSR,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Yes. The General-Conference recommended that Member States bring the Recommendation on the Safeguarding of Traditional Culture and Folklore to the attention of appropriate bodies in their area. The recommendation was referred to the Department of the A-ts,: Sport, the Envi-onment, Tourism and Terntones (I?A-ETT), smce the information requested falls wlthm the Arts Branch ofDASETT.

Telecommunications (Question No. 38) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 10 May 1990: Since the answer to Question No. \06 (Hansard, 18 February 1988, page 321), has the Government given consideration to amalgamating Telecom and OTe.",118
139,Mr BEAZLEY,USSR,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The possibility of amalgamating the Government carriers Telecom and OTC is one of a number of options for structural change the Department of Transport and Communications is considering as part of its review of ownership arrangements and structural relationships between the telecommunications carriers. Telephones (Question No. 39) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 10 May 1990: Since the answer to question No. 749 (Hansard, 22 August 1988, page 61), what expansion has taken place in the area over which untimed local telephone call access is available for outer metropolitan and fringe urban areas of Sydney.",119
140,Mr BEAZLEY,USSR,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom Australia, is as follows: A- a result of the Ringing In the Changes Par!lamentary Inquiry a number of concessional c-lhng arrangements were introduced in capital cIty and surrounding urban fringe and outer fringe areas. These concessional arrangements were implemented in November 1988. Expanded local call access for urban fringe customers: The local calling area for customers located in the Sydney urban fringe has been extended into the nearby parts of the central Sydney Zone. The expanded local call areas, known as Precinct areas, are located in segments between 16 kilometre and 24 kilometre radius from the GPO. As an example, customers in the Penrith Zone (approximately 45,000) now have expanded local call access to the suburbs of Parramatta, Baulkham Hills, Castle Hill, Carlingford, Granville, Pend Ie Hill, Rydalmere, Bankstown, Carramar, Sefton, Guildford and Revesby which represents approximately 215,000 customers. Similar benefits apply to the Urban Fringe Zones of Gosford, Wisemans Ferry, Windsor, Mulgoa, Camden, Campbelltown, and Helensburgh. Outer Metropolitan customers: Local Call Access Local call access for outer metropolitan customers has not increased since August 1988. All outer metropolitan customers have local call access to all customers located in the central Sydney Zone, customers in the adjacent Outer Metropolitan Zones plus customers located in the adjacent Urban Fringe Zones. As an example the Dural Outer Metropolitan Zone has local call access to: all Sydney Zone customers customers in the Blacktown and Avalon Beach Outer Metropolitan Zones customers in the Gosford, Wisemans Ferry and Windsor Urban Fringe Zones. Outer Metro to Outer Metro Call Rate Ceiling As part of the Ringing In The Changes initiatives a maximum call rate ceiling was placed on calls between non-adjacent Outer Metropolitan Zones. Prior to November 1988 the maximum charge for these calls was 67 cents per 3 minutes: the current maximum charge is 21 cents per 3 minutes. Example-Dural to Engadine.

(5) What is the size of the stockpile at Nabarlek and when will it be expended. Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Yes. To allow the mine site to be rehabilitated and returned as far as practicable to its pre-mined condition. (b) Decommissioning and rehabilitation of the mine site are required under the environmental· requirements of the Special Mineral Lease for the Nabarlek Project. In accordance with the Northern Territory's Uranium Mining (Environment Control) Act, and the authorisations permitting Nabarlek to operate, the mining company concerned is required to update its decommissioning plan annually. The decommissioning and rehabilitation plan was prepared and is developed by the. mining company in consultation with the Nabarlek Decommissioning Working Group, which consists of representatives from the company, the Northern Territory supervising authorities, the Office of the Supervising Scientist, and the Northern Land Council. Reports of the working group are considered by the Co-ordinating Committee for the Alligator Rivers Region. (c) The number of workers required has yet to be determined. . (d) The mining company responsible for rehabilitation will have scientific and engineering staff with the appropriate expertise engaged in rehabilitating the mine site. (e) There is currently no absolute deadline for rehabilitation. Some progressive rehabilitation has already been undertaken and final rehabilitation will <;ommence as soon as operations finally cease. (f) There is no uranium selling authority for Nabarlek as such. The total cost of rehabilitation will be met by the mining company concerned. . (g) & (h) Standards for [(,habilitation at Nabarlek are set by the Northern Territory supervising authorities in consultation with the Nabarlek Decommissioning Working Group, which has direct responsibility for supervising the decommissioning. (2) (a), (b) & (c) The interests of affected Aboriginal groups are represented by the Northern Land Council through its membership of the Nabarlek Decommissioning Working Group and the Co-ordinating Committee for the Alligator Rivers Region, as well as through direct consultation between the mining company and the traditional Aboriginal owners. (3) Tenders have not yet been let for the final rehabilitation works so costings are not yet available. Approximately $1.5m has been spent to date on progressive rehabilitation. (4) As noted in (1 ),(f), the total cost of rehabilitation will be met by the mining company concerned. (5) Of the yellowcake produced there is a stockpile of around 3,000 tonnes remaining to be sold of which some 60 per cent is committed under contract. Apartheid and International' Finance (Ques.tion No. 54) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 10 May 1990: (1) Has the Minister read the book ""Apartheid and International Finance"" by Tony Cole and Keith Ovenden. (2) In view of the Government's part in commissioning and launching this book, does the Government endorse the book's conclusion on page 187 that financial sanctions cause black unemployment, especially among black youths in townships, so leading to alienation and a security problem. (3) Does it follow that ever higher levels of government expenditure for army, police, justice and prison institutions is then required. (4) How many black deaths resulting from security problems may be attributed to the financial sanctions with which Australia agrees.",125
147,Dr BLEWETT,GLOSSARY OF ACRONYMS,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Yes. (2), (3) and (4) On page 187 of ""Apartheid and International Finance"", Tony Cole and Keith Oven den conclude that financial sanctions have had the practical effect of restricting economic growth in South Africa. Their book points out that unemployment, alienation and violence in South Africa have their roots in the pernicious system of apartheid which has systematically wasted and abused the human and economic resources of South Africa. Representative black leaders, including church and trade union leaders, have always acknowledged that the imposition of sanctions, particularly financial sanctions, against South Africa, will have economic and social costs for the non-white population. While such costs are not easily quantified, representative leaders have indicated that the black majority is prepared to suffer the effect of sanctions in order to speed up the process of change, thereby averting further protracted periodsof violence. Chinook Helicopters (Question No. 57) Mr Sinclair asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 10 May 1990: (I) When in service with the RAAF, what was the hourly operating cost of the Chinook heavylift helicopters. (2 )What is the lift capacity in kilograms of the Chinook. (3) What is the comparable (a) operating cost and (b) lift capacity of the (i) Black Hawk, (ii) Sea King and (iii) Wessex helicopters in service with the ADF. (4) What is the cost per aircraft of (a) recommissioning the Chinooks now mothballed at Amberley Airbase, (b) of full modernisation and (c) of partial modernisation to meet current Army requirements. (5) What is the assessed hourly cost. of operation of the Chinooks aft-r (a) full modernisation and (b) partial modernisation to meet current Army requirements. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question; . (I) The last assessment of the hourly operating cost of Chinooks in service with the RAAF was made in 1988. This assessment showed a direct operating cost of $ 707 8 per flying hour.. Direct operating costs cover fuel, lubricants, spare parts, contract and in-house maintenance and crew costs. (2) The maximum internal load capacity of the CH47C Chinook previously in service with the RAAF was 7270kg and the maximum external load was 9000kg. (3) The estimated comparable direct operating costs (1989 prices), and working lift capacities for the Black Hawk, Sea King, and Wessex helicopters are given in the following table. The Wessex helicopter is no longer in service in the ADF. Direct Operating Helicopter Cost/Hour Black Hawk $2500 $5600 Sea King Wessex $5700 The Black Hawk operating cost estimates are based on limited operational data. (4) (a) At the time the Chinooks were withdrawn from service, ten of the aircraft were in flying condition and the eleventh was undergoing a major scheduled servicing. The cost of recommissioning these ten Chinooks is estimated to be $3650 per aircraft. The eleventh aircraft would have to be reassembled before it could be recommissioned. In addition there would be manpower and training costs plus ongoing operating costs. (b) The anticipated cost of upgrading each Chinook ai(craft to full CH47D specification is estimated at more than $lOm. (c) It is not practical to provide an estimate of the cost per aircraft of a partial upgrade as no specification has been developed to define the extent of the work. (5) (a) The estimated direct operating cost of fully modernised CH47D Chinooks is $5600 per flying hour. (b) It is not practical to provide an assessment of the direct operating cost of partially modernised Chinooks. The greater the level of modernisation performed to bring the aircraft toward CH47D specification the greater will be the saving in direct operating costs relative to past ADF experience with CH47C Chinooks. ABC: Gallipoli Telecast (Question No. 59) Mr Tim Fischer asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 14 May 1990: (I) Did the ABC have total responsibility for arranging, filming and producing the live telecasts from Gallipoli to Australia on ANZAC Day 1990. (2) Did ABC staff make several trips to Turkey over a period of nine months to ensure the telecast would proceed smoothly and successfully without any interruptions. (3) Following considerable comment in Aus-ralia concerning the breakdown difficulties durIng the live telecast, is an investigation being made to ascertain exactly where the difficulties arose. (4) Did the problems experienced during the Dawn Service relate to the sound system alone. (5) With respect to the International Service, (a) was th-re in fact no technical problem, (b) was the pIcture received intact at Gore Hill, Sydney, (c) were no prior arrangements made for Working translation from Turkish to English and (d) as a Lift result was the live coverage of the service canCapacity celled by decision of the ABC and an excuse given to viewers. 2900kg 2700kg (6) Were further difficulties encountered in covering the Lone Pine Service; if so, what was llOOkg the nature of the difficulties. (7) What results have been obtained from investigations to date. (8) Given that the Gallipoli video now on sale contains scenes relating only to the. Dawn Service, will the ABC ensure the final Gallipoli video includes comprehensive footage of the Dawn Service, International Service and Lone Pine Service.",126
148,Mr BEAZLEY,GLOSSARY OF ACRONYMS,"The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is as follows: (l) The filming and transmission of the telecast to Australia of the Dawn Service and the Lone Pine Service was the responsibility of the ABC. However, the ABC had no control over arrangements for the services which did affect the quality of the broadcasts. The filming and production of the Interna. tional Service were carried out by Turkish Radio and Television for both domestic and international consumption. It was planned that the ABC would use this coverage and add its own commentary. (2) Yes., Two trips were made to Turkey. The first trip was taken by an Executive Technical Producer for 10 days in October 1989. The sec-. ond trip was taken by a producer for II days in February 1990. (3) Yes. An investigation has taken place. (4) No. The problems experienced during the Dawn Service did not relate to the sound system alone (see answer to question 7). (5) (a) The coverage provided by Turkish Radio and Television was not of a standard that allowed the transmission to proceed. (b) Yes. The picture was received intact at Gore Hill. (c) No. Prior arrangements were made. (d) The decision to cancel the telecast was made on the basis of acceptable programming in Australia. Highlights of the International Service were included in a highlights package of the Dawn Service and the Lone Pine Ceremony screened on Sunday 29 April 1990. (6) Yes. Difficulties arose in Australia. The Prime Minister was due to commence his speech at 7,.31 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. This was to allow a Special ANZAC edition of the 7.30 Report to open with the speech. This arrangement was confirmed on location by the producer at Lone Pine 15 minutes before transmission. However, for reasons unknown to the ABC, the introdu-­ tion and speech took place several minutes earlier. As a result it was necessary for the speeches of the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition to be recorded and then replayed. This was considered preferable to beginning transmission in the middle of a keynote speech. The replaying of the speech precluded coverage of the remainder of the service due to limited time. (7) Several technical problems were encountered during the Dawn Service. The loss of sound on the public announcement system was a n:sult of somebody severing the wires on that system. The system had been installed by members of the Australian Defence Forces Communications Corps and was working effectively up to the start of the service. Fortunately the sound on the television transmission was unaffected. The satellite sound was affected by a temporary loss at the beginning of the transmission. This sound left ANZAC Beach. and Turkey successfully. It was lost during the transmission between Ankara in Turkey and Ceduna in South Austraiia. This sound again fortunately was not critical to the coverage of the service as it was the commentator, Peter Couchman, talking to the viewer from the bellch. The sound problem was quickly rectified and Couchman continued with his presentation. At no time was the sound of the service itself affected here in Australia. The loss of three lights during the telecast pounded an already delicate lighting situation. These lights were lost either through sabotage or misadventure. The crowds at ANZAC Cove prohibited any access for repair. Given that the loss occurred during the service, disruption of that service would not have been possible or practical. In addition, thousands of battery powered candles that were to be distributed at ANZAC Cove by the Department of Veterans Affairs were not given out. The absence of this source of lighting affected the quality of the picture. There were delays in the' service commencing due to the late arrival of the veterans. This created networking problems at the ABC in Australia. There were difficulties associated with crowd control, especially on the beach itself, because of the large numbers of sPectators, a proportion of whom were intoxicated. As a result of problems with the broadcast a full . report on dealing with remote overseas broadcasts has been prepared. (8) No. It was considered that the documentary The Boys Who Came Home' and the coverage of the Dawn Service would be most popular with viewers. The Dawn Service in particular had been the focus of much of the media coverage during the weeks preceding ANZAC Day. The combined duration of these two programs was also within the time limit of two hours which meant that the video could be sold for a recommended retail price of $29.99, and was not therefore priced beyond the reach of many potential customers. Trade Practices Act: Professional Practitioners (Question No. 62) Mr Ewen Cameron asked the Attorney General, upon notice, on 14 May 1990: Since professional practitioners are immune from the terms of the Trade Practices Act would he consider amending the Act to include such professionals so that they were subject to section 52 and 52A; if so, would he further consider renaming the Act the Professional and Trade Practices Act.",127
149,Mr DUFFY,GLOSSARY OF ACRONYMS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The operation of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (TP Act') is subject to the limits of Commonwealth Constitutional power. The TP Act already reaches the activities of professionals, to the extent that those professionals fall within the heads of Commonwealth constitutional power on which the TP Act is based, including the additional operation that is provided by section 6 of the TP Act. For example, conduct by a professional who operates under a comcorporate structure or conduct by an unincorporated professional that takes place in a Territory or in the course of interstate trade or commerce, would be subject to the operation of the TP Act. The appropriateness of the immunity given to professionals under the provision in the TP Act dealing with 'warranties in relation to the supply of services' (section 74(2» is subject to continuing review. Thus, constitutional limits restrict the scope of sections 52 and 52A, so amendment of the TP Act and, in particular those sections, to cover ""professional practitioners"" would not be possible. Therefore, the changing of the title of the TP Act would clearly be inappropriate . Visas for Entry to Spain (Question No. 64) Mr Kerr asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 16 May 1990: (1) Has the. Minister's attention been drawn to the inconvenience being caused to Australian passport holders seeking to enter Spain as a result of conflicting policies within the Spanish government on visa requirements for Australian citizens. (2) Have Australian citizens seeking to enter Spain been advised by Spanish embassies that no visa is required for tourist entry into Spain only to find on arrival that Spanish immigration authorities insist that visas are in fact necessary. (3) Has the Minister's Department made any representations to the Spanish authorities to resolve the problem; if so, what representations. (4) If no representations have been made, what steps will be taken to ensure that Australian zens entering Spain will do so under a consistently applied visa policy. (5) Do Australians travelling to Spain require visas to enter that country.",128
150,Dr BLEWETT,GLOSSARY OF ACRONYMS,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am aware that our Embassy in Madrid has received representations from Australians visiting Spain about difficulties and delays experienced by some Australian passport holders. The Spanish have formally advised us that visas are not required. But procedures for the issue of entry permits on arrival are very inconvenient and time consuming. (2) See above. The Spanish Foreign Ministry advised us on 9 October 1986 that "". . . As from 1 November 1986, Australian citizens holding valid ordinary, official or diplomatic passports will be authorised to enter Spain without a visa, whenever the purpose of their visit is tourism or business and the duration of their stay is less than thirty days"". (3) Yes, repeatedly since July 1987 in formal calls on the Foreign Ministry by the Embassy in Madrid and by official Notes and letters both in Madrid and in Canberra to the Spanish Ambassador. The most recent was a written response dated 6 April, from the Spanish Ambassador stating that the necessary steps have been taken with the Interior Ministry so that the difficulties encountered will not occur again to Australian travellers. However as it is apparent that difficulties are still being experienced, strong representations will continue. (4) In addition to these representations, sular travel advice was issued warning Australian travellers and the travel industry of the potential problems for arrival in Spain, particularly at Madrid airport. (5) See above. Countrylink Program (Question No. 65)",129

Mr Kerin-The answer to the honourciti- able member's question is as follows: (a) The Budget for the Countrylink program in 1989/1990 was $400,000. (b) The program is administered by the Countrylink unit which is located in the Agriculture and Forestry Secretariat Branch of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. (c) The Countrylink unit has an establishment of six staff. (d) Staff in the Countrylink unit are accountable to departmental management. (e) The Countrylink program provides to people living in rural and provincial areas of Australia, access to and information about Commonwealth Government programs and services. (1) (i) The performance of the program is constantly monitored as are all other programs administered by the Department. An internal audit of the program was completed in March 1990 which concluded that the program was effectively meeting the objective of improving access to and in providing information about government services and programs to rural areas. In addition, as part of normal management practice comprehensive reviews of programs are undertaken on a regular basis (usually every 2-3 years). No date has yet been scheduled for a comprehensive review of the Countrylink program. (1) (ii) The results of any such review would normally be made available to the Executive Board of the Department and the Minister. NA (Question No. 66)",129
152,Mr MCARTHUR,AIDS,"the Minister for Community Services and Health, upon a connotice, on 16 May 1990: (1) With respect to AIDS education grants made available to community based organisations during 1988-89, (a) how many grants were made, (b) to whom were they made, (c) are the grants ongoing, (d) to whom are the recipients accountable (e) what criteria are used to determine allocation, and (0 how many programs of national significance resulted from the grants.

Mr Hand-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In general the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs does not distinguish between prisoners, ex-prisoners and other persons in the provisions of its services to the migrant community in Australia. My Department funds co-ordinators at Migrant Resource Centres. The Grant in Aid Scheme funds social or welfare workers attached to ethnic agencies. At present there is no ethnic agency funded under the Grant in Aid Scheme whose purpose is to deal specifically with prisoners and ex-prisoners, nor is there any worker specifically funded to work with prisoners and ex-prisoners. However, workers and agencies and the MRCS would be willing to provide assistance to prisoners and ex-prisoners if they are approached. The Department has maintained no statistics on the number of persons so assisted, or on what assistance was given. The Department has responsibility for deportation and some deportees are prisoners or exprisoners. The Department may provide very limited assistimce-$20 cash and $200 clotheach ing-to destitute deportees, generally as the occasion warrants.

Rehabilitation of Prisoners (Question No. 90) Mr Melham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 17 May 1990: What resources does each of the Department/s or agencies for whi<;h the Min,ister has portfolio responsibility make available to prisoners and exprisoners in New South Wales during (a) the term of their incarceration; (b) the term of their postcustodial probation period; or (c) in the case of prisoners subject tO'fixed terms of imprisonment, the twelve months foIlowing their release from custody to assist in their post-custodial management or rehabilitation. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) Prior to every Federal election the AustralianElectoral Officer for New South Wales writes to the Chief Administrative Officer, Department of Correcti-e Services, Sydney detailing prisoners' enrolment and voting rights and responsibilities, despatching enrolment cards and postal vote applications at the same time, and requests feedback on any problems encountered with polling. The Commission also advises registered political parties that postal vote applications will made available to eligible prisoners, through the Department of Corrective Services. The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 is being amended (effective from 30 September 1990) to define the electoral Division in which a prisoner can enrol and also to provide for mobile polling teams to visit prisons. (b) & (c) The Australian Electoral Commission does not distinguish newly released prisoners from any other voter and does not use any resources in programs specifically directed at them. Commonwealth Prisoners (Question No. 91) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, op 17 May 1990: (1) How many prisoners were incarcerated in NSW prisons during 1989 following conviction for offences against Commonwealth laws, excluding offences committed in the Australian Capital Territory. (2) Is he able to say what percentage of prisoners in NSW prisons during 1989, (a) belonged to the category referred to in part (I), (b) were of Aboriginal extraction and (c) belonged to the category referred to in part (1) and were of Aboriginal extraction. (3) What sum did the Commonwealth Government pay towards the upkeep and imprisonment of the prisoners referred to in part (2). (4) Is he able to say what percentage of the total NSW prisons budget is represented by the sum referred to in part (3). (5) Are Commonwealth funded resources available for the post-custodial management of pris-' oners released from NSW prisons; if so, (a) what resources and (b) which, Federal departments oversee the di'stribution and use of the resources.",139
168,Mr DUFFY,SIERA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) As at 30 June 1989 235 federal offenders were incarcerated in NSW prisons. (2) The publication ""Australian Prisoners '1989"" by John yvalker of the Australian Institute of Criminology records that the total prison population in NSW as at 30 June 1989 was 5261 of whom 415 were recorded as being Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders. Based on the figures of 235 and 5261 the proportion of federal offenders to total population was approximately 4 percent. The proportion of persons recorded as Ab'original or Torres Strait Islanders to total prisoner population was approximately 7 per cent. No persons of Aboriginal extraction were recorded as being federal offenders in NSW prisons as at 30 June 1989. (3) I am advised that the Commonwealth Govbe ernment does not provide any specific purpose payments to any of the States or the NT in respect of corrective services. However, the Commonwealth does provide a significant amount of general purpose (both general revenue and capital) assistance to the States and NT-this is untied and may be used by the States and NT for purposes such as policing or prisons. In 19891990 general revenue assistance was $12 905 million and general purpose capital assistance was $310.5 million-equivalent to around 25 of total State general government outlays. The determination of general revenue grants among the States and NT is based on population shares and the per capita relativities calculated by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. These relativities are set with a view to compensating the States and NT for relative revenue and expenditure disabilities in their recurrent budgets. In determining them the Commission applies a ""Commonwealth Offender Factor"" which measures the differential impact that the number of Commonwealth offenders in State and Territory prisons have on the cost of providing corrective services. New South Wales and Western Australia are the two States assessed as having the greatest needs under this factor-this would be reflected in the overall per capita relativity calculated for these States. (4) In the light of my answer to (3), no. (5) My, Department does not provide resources for any Commonwealth program directed specifically to post-custodial management of prisoners 1 -, released from. NSW prisons and I am not aware of any such program for which resources are , provided by any other Commonwealth Department. .j ANZAC Frigate Program (Question No. 93)",140

(8) Taking into account the cost of all approved variations, is the current estimated project cost in Australian dollars (a) in excess of, (b) equal to or (c) below the amount of the (i) successful bid and (ii) unsuccessful bid. Mr Bilney-The' Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a) The Project Cost in Australlan Dollars to Australia of the ANZAC Ship Project at 14 August 1989, the date the decision was announced, was $3514 million at April 1988 prices. This figure excludes eadier phases of the project costing some $28 million. The Project Cost at 10 November 1989, the date the Prime Contract was signed, was $3594 million, also excluding earlier phases of the project. (b) The unit cost of each ship (excluding design, engineering, administration and other costs not applicable to particular ships) is as follows: $m $m Ship 01 231.914 Ship 06 206.700 Ship 02 214.234 Ship 07 206.060 Ship 03 210.758 Ship 08 205.916 Ship 04 204.387 Ship 09 206.498 Ship 05 207.715 Ship 10 '206.670 The ship unit price did not alter between 14 and elec- August 1989 and 10 November 1989., (2) (a) The project cost to New Zealand, in Australian Dollars, at the date New Zealand lecom'mitted itself to the project was $773 million. ' (b) The ship unit cost to New Zealand at the date New Zealand legally committed itself to the project is as shown for ships 02 and 04 above, namely: Ship 02 $214.234M Ship 04 $204.387M (3) Proposals to vary the contract may be initiated by, the Commonwealth or Contractor. Proposals are investigated by the Joint Project Office and, as appropriate, by Navy and Departmental authorities, in each country. Depending on the financial irnpllct, changes may be approved by the Project Director, or by,officers with higher levels of financial authorisation. The contract change is issued by the Defence Contracting Organisation. (4) Eight contract amendments had be-n issued UP to 1 June 1990. Each has been of an editorial nature and none has affected the ,design or specification of the ship, the equipment fitted or the contract price. (5) No, provided that the change did not affect Australia. Each country is responsible for the cost of changes affecting its own ships or other supplies. (6) No. ' , (7) Yes. (8) The approved project cost includes a number of elements in addition ,to the Prime Contract price. These include the cost of Government Furnished Material, facilities (works), ammunition and administrative expenses which ate a charge to the project. The project cost therefore exceeds either bid. Storage of PCBs (Question No. 94) Mr John Scott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 17 May 1990: (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to reports in the Border Mail indicating that the Minister's Department's Transport and Storage Group stores polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) at Oaklands, NSW; if so, are the reports true. (2) Does the Transport and Storage Group store PCBs at any other sites; if so, (a) where and (b) in what quantities. (3) What containment procedures are used in the storage of PCBs. (4) Are there any regulations or guidelines for the safe handling and storage of PCBs; if so, what are they. (5) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to any (a) breaches of safety measures or (b) accidental spillages with respect to the handling and storage of PCBs. (6) Is the Minister able to say whether PCBs pose a threat to human health; if so, in what way. Mr Beddall-The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. The newspaper reports were based around information supplied by officers of the Department and were largely correct. However, some statements were misleading; for example, such words as secret and dump are not accurate and have created unnecessary concern in the local community. Information on the transport and storage of PCBs at Oaklands was made freely available. In addition, the storage facility was made accessible to the local media and local police and Urana Shire officials. (2) The Transport and Storage Group (TSG) stores PCBs at the following sites outside of Oaklands. The current estimated tonnage of waste material is shown in brackets for each site. Cannon Hill, Queensland (5.7 tonnes) Mt. Claremont, Western Australia (5.6 tonnes) Pennington, South Australia (4 tonnes) Darwin, Northern Territory (1.8 tonnes) (3) PCB waste material is only accepted for storage if the consignment is prepared in accordance with procedures contained in guidelines prepared by TSG for use by Commonwealth Departments and Authorities. In summary, these guidelines provide that all PCB liquids and contaminated material be stored in sealed metal containers in a storage area which is a roofed, enclosure with an impenetrable floor with no drainage outlets. (4) Regulations and guidelines for the safe handling and storage of PCBs are as follows: (a) Guidelines For Commonwealth Departments/Authorities On The Handling, Storage And Transport Of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) issued by the Transport and Storage Group on 2 December 1985. These guidelines were developed in consultation with the Department of Defence, the then· Departments of Arts, Heritage and Environment, Aviation, Housing and Construction, Telecom, the NSW State Pollution Control Commission and the Victorian Environment Protection Authority. (c) The Australian Code For The Transport Of Dangerous Goods by Road and Railpublished in Periodic Gazette No. P 15 of 7 April 1987. (b) State legislation such as the NSW Environmentally Hazardous Chemicals Act 1985 and Chemical Control Orders published under that Act. (5) TSG has reported that,. for ten consignments of PCB waste in excess of one tonne transported to Oaklands since February 1987, no advice was given to the State Pollution Control Commission or to police and fire brigade authorities along the transportation route as provided for in the Commonwealth Guidelines. For each of these consignments, however, a separate escort vehicle carrying breathing apparatus, protective clothing, tools, absorbent material, metal and polyethylene containers and hazard signs was provided. Action has been taken to ensure formal advice is provided to the relevant authorities for all future consignments. The only instance of accidental spillage to have been reported was a leak at the Oaklands store <,>f PCB-contaminated liquid into a drip tray creating a puddle the size of a saucer. The leak was detected immediately and a specialist contractor called into clean up the spillage and prevent further leakage. (6) Advice provided by the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories and the Department of Community Services and Health is that PCBs are recognised internationally as a major environmental contaminant. In humans, PCBs can cause severe skin rash (chloracne), liver damage and respiratory disorders. They may be absorbed orally, through the skin or by inhalation of vapours evolved at high temperature. However, such problems are only likely walled to be experienced by persons who have been regularly and directly exposed to PCBs over a prolonged period. Economic Action Plan (Question No. 97) Mr Cobb asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 17 May 1990: (1) Which Government Departments were involved in investigating and costing the Coalition's Economic Action Plan. (2) Will he provide details of the resources costs involved in the investigation.",141
170,Mr KEATING,SIERA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The costing of the so-called Coalition Economic Action Plan was carried out by the Treasury and Department of Finance, although other Departments and Taxation Office provided some of the necessary data. (2) Given the breadth of the exercise a large number of people were involved but generally, each person only for relatively short periods of time. Accurate records were not kept as the work was being done, but it has subsequently been estimated that work on the outlays proposals within the Department of Finance took about 350 hours while that on the revenue proposals undertaken by Treasury and the Tax Office took about 40 hours. The approximate direct salaries cost was of the order of $9,000. No estimate of the costs incurred by other departments is available. (3) These facts demonstrate as spurious the Opposition's claims that the costings provided by the Government on the so-called Economic Action Plan were prepared on a different basis from that of costings of Government programs. (4) I remind the honourable member that on numerous occasions I pointed out that convention allowed the Opposition to have its so-called Economic Action Plan properly costed by the Departments of Treasury and Finance. The Opposition failed to do so, contributing to its lack of credibility. (Question No. 99) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Small Business and Customs, upon notice, on 17 May 1990: (I) Are tractors imported into Australia duty free. (2) Do tractor components, not. available in Australia, which are imported aUract duty. (3) If the answers to parts (1) and (2) are both affirmative; (a) is the situation anomalous, (b) wh-t effect does the situation have on (i) Austraha's balance of payments, (ii) the Australian tractor manufacturing industry and (iii) employment, (c) what similar situations exist and (d) will the Government take steps to alter the situation; if so, what steps. Mr Beddall-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows; (1) Yes. (2) No. Agricultural equipment components and used exclusively in the manufacture of agricultural tractors enter free of duty. General purpose parts used in the manufacture of other goods would be subject to the relevant rates of duty. In addition, goods not made in Australia, designed for use in the agricultural industry, may enter Australia duty free under By-law Item 46. Defence Planning (Question No. 100) Mr Taylor asked the Minister representing .the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 17 May 1990: What are the potential effects on Australian defence planning of: (a) recent developments in the Warsaw Pact/NATO balance in Europe, (b) Indian naval force structure and developments, and (c) the possible loss by the US of the Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base in the Philippines. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) Recent developments in Europe between the Warsaw Pact and NATO nations are most encouraging. The new and more open political dialogue and preparedness to reach agreements with respect to arms control, verification and disarmament raise the prospect of a more stable global order at a reduced level of armaments. This will enhance the security of all nations and make the prospect of a major nuclear conflict even more unlikely. But we cannot afford to be complacent. The outlook for the Asia Pacific region in the 1990s is Tractors likely to be both more complex and more demanding for regional nations including Australia. This is particularly so in the light of the changing role of the superpowers and the emergence of several other major regional powers, notably India, China and Japan. The basic tenets of our defence policy-self reliance in the defence of Australia, and promoting regional strategic stability and cohesion-are most appropriate to meeting these challenges. (b) The expansion of Indian naval capabilities in recent years has enhanced India's capacity to project military power into the northern and central Indian Ocean areas. It has significantly improved India's ability to protect its own maritime approaches. Despite this maritime build up, India's overall strategic pre-occupation remains the security of its land borders. Australia's interest in Indian naval development principally relates to how it might be perceived by countries of South East Asia and any impact it may have on their security priorities and force structures. It is in Australia's interests consensus and stability within our region and to limit any possibility of involvement by external powers with interests inimical to our own and those of our neighbours. These objectives are pursued by fostering closer security relationships through a range of Government policies as set out by Senator Evans in his Regional Security Statement in December 1989. Defence contributes through a program of regular discussions and exchanges, joint, training and exercises with regional forces, and cooperation in areas such as maritime surveillance and the provision of defence materiel. (c) It is too early to predict the possible outcome of the present negotiations between the United States and the Philippines on future US access to Clark Air Base and the Subic Bay Naval Base. Should US use of those facilities be restricted or denied, the US is likely to retain a substantial strategic presence in the region through redeployment to its own Pacific island territories and, possibly, greater use of other support facilities in the South East Asian and East Asian regions. Australia would be concerned should any significant and early withdrawal of US forces occur as a consequence of the Philippines bases negotiations. The presence of those forces has provided an important element of strategic stability and limited the scope for any adventurism by external powers. Any major change to the US presence would reinforce both the importance of regional countries, inc\uding Australia, being able to provide for their own defence and of working together to promote strategic stability and cohesion. Those objectives are already key factors in Australia's defence planning. Defence: Performance Pay (Question No. 101) Mr Taylor asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 17 May 1990: (1) What is the status of performance pay deliberations in the Department of Defence. (2) Can the case for performance pay in the ADF be sustained in the light of difficulties for such pav for the Senior Executive Service highlighted in the recent report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration; if not, what are the consequences for the general thrust of the Sanderson Report into the Higher Defence Organisation. Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A proposal for the introduction of performance based pay in the ADF has been considered and endorsed by the Chiefs of Staff Committee. The endorsed proposal has been circulated, for information, to all officers who will be eligible for to promote strategic the payment. Further development of the proposal will occur after the Industrial Relations Commission Full Bench Review of paid rates awards, including performance based pay, is completed. When the ADF proposal for performance based pay has been finalised, it will be submitted to the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal for consideration. Meanwhile each of the three Service Offices is developing plans for the administration of a performance based pay scheme. (2) The co-cerns of the Sen-te Stan-i!lg C?mmittee on Fmance and PublIc AdmmlstratlOn, regarding the introduction of performance based pay for Senior Executive Service Officers in the Australian Public Service, are acknowledged. However, the performance based pay scheme for the senior ranks of the ADF will have both incentive and reward benefits. Payments will be determined on the basis of annual performance assessments. Defence Force members are familiar with and experienced in making such assessments which have been used for many years now as a basis for management decisions such as promotions and postings. Performance based pay will extend from Major General and equivalent ranks down to Lieutenant Colonel and their equivalent. The scheme will ,properly reward those who strive for and reach standards of excellence. The thrust of the Sanderson Report into the Higher Defence Organisation will be complemented by the introduction of performance based pay. Aims of the Sanderson Review were to: (a) contribute to improved efficiency and effectiveness of the processes for policy formulation and administration of the Defence Force; (b) reduce the number of senior Service officers, particularly in Canberra, sufficient to generate resources which will facilitate salary restructuring aimed at redressing salary compression, improving retention and providing more adequate rewards for higher responsibility at minimal additional cost overall, (c) replace traditional rank based hierarchical management structures with flatter structures more attuned to modern management practices; and (d) enhance the status and authority of senior officers. Defence Force restructuring that resulted from the Sanderson Report recommendations has now been completed. As Senior Officers exercise their increased responsibilities and authority, .they be adequately rewarded for the higher levels of efficiency and effectiveness they achieve. International Aviation Data (Question No. 102) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 17 May 1990: (I) Are there statutory requirements for the International Aviation Division of his Department to report statistical data to the aviation industry; if so, what are the requirements. (2) How have computer and data resources been allocated for data processing between the (a) aviation, (b) land transport, (c) maritime, (d) broadcasting and (e) communications divisions of his Department. (3) Are there proposals for additional computer and data resources to be made available. (4) Are additional computer resources required to enable the International Aviation Division to fulfil any requirement referred to in part (I); if so, how quickly will the resources be provided. (5) Is the Division experiencing a backlog of work; if so, (a) how long will it take to eliminate the backlog and (b) will any proposed additional resources ensure there is no repeat of the backlog. (6) Is there (a) a five-year lag with respect to annual publication of international aviation statistics and (b) a two-year lag with monthly provisional statistics; if so, does this reflect a low priority accorded by his Department to tourism, Australia's principal export earner. (7) If the situation referred to in part (6) does not reflect a low priority, how does he account for the situation.",143
171,Mr BEAZLEY,SIERA,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) There are no statutory requirements for the International Aviation Policy Division to report statistical data to the aviation industry. However, Article 67 of the Chicago Convention requires the Secretary of the Department to provide data to the International Civil Aviation Organisation on the operations of Australian airlines. (2) The corporate computer resources (minicomputer based systems and applications) have been rationalised in line with the departmental - nformation Technology Strategic Plan and an mtegrated computer facility services all divisions. A workplan is devised each year which considers the requirements and priorities of the aviation, land transport, maritime, broadcasting and communications divisions and resources are allocated accordingly. The allocation of major computer and data resources thus varies from year to year. will In addition to the corporate computing facility, all divisions have access to personal computers to meet their requirements for word processing and local data storage and manipulation. (3) The Department intends to commence the implementation of an Office Automation System and a Financial Management Information System during financial year 1990-91. Both these systems are identified in the Department's Information Technology Strategic Plan. The International Aviation Policy Division has upgraded its computing capabilities over the last 12 months. The Division proposes to take advantage of newer software technology as it becomes available to make more efficient use of the majority of hardware. (4) The International Aviation Policy Division does not have any requirements as referred to in part (1). (5) There is a backlog in production of Monthly Provisional Statistics of International Scheduled Air Transport. A new computing system (both hardware and software) to process statistical data has been installed over the last 12 months to increase the degree of automation in preparing statistical publications. (a) During calendar year 1990 the backlog has reduced from an 18 month lag to a 12 month lag. The Division anticipates that the backlog of publications will disappear before the end of 1990. However, a minimum three month delay in publication will be normal as the airlines are permitted a reasonable time in which to submit data and the Division needs time to process it into a form suitable for publication. (b) With the resources allocated to the system over the last 12 months the Division does not expect the current situation to occur again. (6) (a) The last annual publication is 1985-86. Priority is being given to bringing monthly publications up to date before turning to the annual publications. (b) The last monthly publication is for March 1989. The lag in publication does not reflect the priority accorded by the Department to tourism as the data is only one source of information that the Department uses in analysing tourist flows. (7) The delay in publication reflects the fact that the system used to prepare data in the past was cumbersome, labour intensive and prone to inaccuracies which necessitated extensive manual checking. Following the setting up of the CAA the responsibility for international aviation statistics was transferred to International Aviation Policy Division in December 1988. Since that time the system has been redeveloped into a database application to improve efficiency, accuracy and timeliness of publications. As an example of the new systems improved efficiency eight monthly publications were released in the first three months after the redevelopment was completed. Planned changes to data collection techniques, use of newer technologies and network upgrading will further enhance the systems efficiency. Federal Airports Corporation: Airline Pilots Dispute (Question No. 103) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 17 May 1990: (I) Is the Minister able to provide figures on (a) the loss incurred by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), (b) the charges waived by the FAC, (c) which other areas of operation were affected as a result of the recent airpilots' dispute. If the figures are not available, why not.",145
172,Mr BEAZLEY,SIERA,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes: (a) I am advised by the FAC that it suffered a revenue reduction of approximately $20 million against its budget estimates as a result of traffic reductions associated with the domestic pilots dispute; (b) the charges waived by the FAC and which are to be reimbursed by the Commonwealth amount to $16,423,382.54; (c) it is not clear what is meant by other areas of operation. It has been interpreted as other areas within the FAC. (1) OVERSEAS VISITOR ARRIVALS Quarter March Year US. 83,900 Canada 15,000 UKI 63,500 Other Europe 56,300 Taiwan. 6,300 R. of Korea 1,400 Japan 51,700 Other Asia 2 53,500  cial concessions, including car parking operations and car rentals, were affected by the pilots' dispute. The revenue lost from these operations is included in the answer to part (a) above. In response to the dispute the Corporation took immediate action to significantly tighten its non-essential operating and administrative expenditure and to defer certain non-urgent maintenance expenses. The net result was that the Corporation traded profitably throughout the year despite the reduction in revenue. The Corporation's annual accounts are currently being audited by the Australian Audit Office but it is expected that the full year profit will be in excess of $40 million which is only slightly down on its budgeted figure. Overseas Visitor Arrivals (Question No. 104) Mr Jull asked the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, upon notice, on 17 May 1990: (1) What was the number of overseas visitor arrivals in Australia, for a stay of less than twelve months, for the (a) March, (b) June, (c) September and (d) December quarters in (i) 1987, (ii) 1988 and (iii) 1989 from (A) the US, (B) Canada, (C) the UK, (D) other Europe, (E) Taiwan, (F) South Korea, (0) Japan and (H) other Asia. (2) What was the number of overseas visitor arrivals, by country of origin, in Australia, for a stay of less than twelve months, for the (a) March, (b) June, (c) September and (d) December quarters in (i) 1987, (ii) 1988 and (iii) 1989 from (A) other Europe and (B) other Asia.

173,Mr GRIFFITHS,COUNTRY OF ORIGIN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) My attention has beendrawn to claims that some supplies of imported apple juice may contain residues of the chemical Alar. (2) No analysis of imported apple juice has been undertaken by my Department.

Each party determines the content of its cultural programs in the other. None of the many Japanese cultural events mounted in Australia since 1979, including visual arts exhibitions and tours by performing groups, can be identified as being a response to a specific request by the Australian Government. Requests may have been made by Australian state or local authorities or individual institutions or organisations, but there are no Insti- comprehensive data available In 1988 a number of cultural activities, among them a tour by a Kabuki troupe and an exhibition of ceramics, formed part of Japan's contribution to the Bicentenary celebrations. Although Japan's participation in the Bicentenary was invited by the Government, the decisions on the content of the cultural program were Japan's. The following list is indicative of the range of Japanese activities in Australia over the past eleven years, but is by no means complete since many events are conducted on a commercial or community-level basis and are not reported or known to the Government: 30 dancers from Atsumi Rina Dancing Institute of Odawara City Crafts exhibition-Sodeisha Group Japanese dance troupe Dance Theatre Cubic Traditional Japanese Musicians Tokugawa Collection Exhibition 80 Sumo wrestlers Sekiyama Contemporary Dance School Fashion designers for Adelaide Festival Tenkei Gekijyo Theatre from Tokyo Contemporary Japanese Ceramic Exhibition Kanze Noh and Sankaijuku to Adelaide Festival Exhibition of ceramics from the Idemitsu Art Museum (from the Yayoi era to Edo) Mount Fuji Photo Exhibition Tokyo Youth Symphony Orchestra NA (a) Sought from the Republic of Korea Hanyang Music and Dance Group for Adelaide Youth Music Festival Korean na val squadron to Sydney Korean Traditional Dance Group for Warana Festival Brisbane Korean rugby team Korean cultural troupe for Expo 88 Major exhibition ""5000 Years of Korean Art"" (b) Offered by the Republic of Korea Korean craftswoman in rush weaving Young Koreans choir Korean National Classical Music Institute Korean National Symphony Orchestra Korean National Classical Dancers and Musicians Seoul Youth Symphony Orchestra Korean National Folk Dance Company Korean students Traditional Music Ensemble National Classical Music Institute Dong Rang Theatre Group Korean pianist Shin Soo-Jung NA (a) Sought from Malaysia Penang Combined Schools Concert Band for Jubilee 150 (b) Offered by Malaysia Malaysian cultural group (singers, dancers and musicians) 14 member dance troup Malaysian artist Yusoff Haji Abdullah Troupe of 15 Malay dancers EXPO 88-22 member cultural troupe NA (a) Sought from the Philippines Exhibition of Philippines textiles Mabuhay Dance Company Soprano Lilia Reyes Poet Cirilo Bautista (b) Offered by the Philippines Philipiniana Dance Group University of Philippines dance group Exhibition of contemporary Philippine art Philippines Youth Orchestra Rolling art exhibition Philippines Concert Chorus NA Singaporean pianist Yitkin Seow Art exhibition (20 paintings) to Festival 82 Participation in the Commonwealth Arts Festival NA Cultural group for Indian Ocean Festival Folk Drama Troupe of the Christian Communications Institute of Payup University NA (a) Sought from the USSR USSR State Symphony Orchestra Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra Russian Classical Ballet Bolshoi Theatre conductor Vladimir Vais Conductor Vladimir Verbitsky Conductor Vladimir Ponkin Kirov Ballet principal artists Altynai Asylmuratova and Faroukh Ruzimatov Two Russian classical dancers to perform with WA Ballet in production of Romeo and Juliet Kirov Ballet for 1989 Spoleto Melbourne Festival Pianist Irina Plotnikova Russian puppeteer for Puppet Theatre Festival Satellite coverage of concert of Russian musical works from a Russian city (b) Offered by the USSR Soviet ballroom dancers Juri and Biruta Beaumanis The Moscow State Circus Virsky Ukrainian Folk Ensemble Georgian State Dance Company Siberian Cossack Folk Company Krasnoyarsk Dance Company of Siberia Georgian State Dance Company Russian Classical Ballet Jorge Bolet Bolshoi Opera Exhibition of contemporary artists/sculptors from Leningrad Exhibition of Constructivist works ""Masterpieces from the Hermitage"", Leningrad exhibition NA (a) Sought from Yugoslavia Exhibition of Medieval frescoes and icons Zagreb soloists Folklore dance group Vuk Karadjec Dubravka Tomsic Exhibition Five Centuries of Encyclopaedism on the Territory of Yugoslavia Participation in Expo 88 (b) Offered by Yugoslavia Matica Macedonia Entertainment Group (musicians, singers and comedian) Dinamo football team Croatian song & dance troupe Exhibition of primitive or naive art Exhibition of modern paintings Exhibition of glassware or fibre Liberation of Skopje by Zagreb Theatre Group Zagreb soccer club Dinamo Exhibition of modern art Yugoslav basketball team Buducnost Slovene Octet music group Exhibition of contemporary Yugoslav graphics Defence: Firing Range (Question No. 111) Mr Tuckey asked the Minister for Def-. ence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 31 May 1990: . Does the Minister's Department operate a firmg range on several thousand hectares of leasehold and freehold land between the town of Lancelin and the resettlement of Wedge Island, approximately 130 kms north of Perth; if so, (a) does the Department intend to purchase land, (b) has any Department budgeted or appropriated monies to enable the purchase of the freehold of the lease land, (c) has the Department ever indicated that as a condition of Western Australia being granted Defence contracts the land be handed over to the Department for training purposes, (d) has the Department recognised the need for .the construction of a coastal road north of Perth, (e) is the Department aware of existing dedicated road reserves (i) 17250-Coastal Road, (ii) 17252-Wedge Island and (iii) 17251-Mimegarra Road, and (f) is it possible to relocate the facility at a more remote location? Mr Bilney-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I have been advised that Defence does operate a firing range at Lancelin and that the area is used by the Navy and Army, as well as allied forces. The Lancelin Training Area (LT A) comprises a 929 ha impact area, which is Commonwealth owned, a leased area of 11,894 ha and Crown land declared as a Defence Practice Area (12,900 ha). (a) I have been informed that Defence wishes to acquire the freehold of both the leased and Crown land. (b) At this stage no monies have been budgeted or appropriated for the purchase of the freehold of the lease land. (c) The Commonwealth Government has never made the granting of Defence contracts conditional on the sale of Lancelin Training Area to Defence. (d) My Department is aware of road construction plans. The State initiated discussions in early 1989 between all interested parties (including Defence) to identify the requirement for roads within the region. The State has also employed a private consultant to examine and advise on the requirement. DeJence believes that satisfactory agreement can be reached on road alignments which generally avoid the Training Area. (e) Defence is aware of the existing road reserves and the various local shires' interest in developing a coastal road and other roads through the LTA. (f) Lancelin is the only field firing range in Western Australia which meets Defence needs. For reasons of public safety, Defence wishes to acquire the whole area to reduce the risk of death or injury due to contact with unexploded ordnance or live firing exercises. A public road through the range area would seriously degrade the usefulness of the range for manoeuvre and Ii ve firing. Income Tax Returns (Question No. 112) Mr Moore asked the Treasurer, upon the leased notice, on 31 May 1990: (I) With reference to statements made by the Commissioner of Taxation at page 22 of his annual report for 1985-86 concerning the introduction of self-assessment of income tax, (a) how has self-assessment made better use of the resources of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and (b) has the reduction of about 500 assessing staff, following implementation of the first phase of self-assessment, led to delays in the processing of income tax returns. (2) Has his attention been drawn to the fact that constituents of the Division of Ryan who inquired in late 1989 and early 199.0 at the Brisbane office of the ATO about their income tax returns lodged for 1988-89 were answered by a tape-recorded message which instructed them, if they had not lodged their returns at least 16 weeks ago, not to make inquiries until 16 weeks after the returns had been lodged. (3) Has the average processing time for income tax returns increased since the introduction of self-assessment. (4) What was the average processing time for income tax returns in (a) 1983-84, (b) 1984-85, (c) 1985-86, (d) 1986-87, (e) 1987-88 and (f) 1988-89. (5) What is the expected average processing time for income tax returns for 1989-90. (6) If a taxpayer owes the ATO income tax, will the ATO allow that taxpayer a minimum of 16 weeks before being obliged to respond to the ATO's inquiries.",148
175,Mr KEATING,YUGOSLAVIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) The system of 'self-assessment' was introduced to make better use of the resources of the ATO . The first stage, in 1986-87, involved 'self-assessment' of returns of business individuals, partnerships and companies and freed 400 assessing staff for redeployment to audit work. It also freed a further 96 assessing staff to be able to improve the service at the inquiry centres in the branch offices. The second stage of 'self-assessment' in 1987-88 extended the concept to all other form types, other than for superannuation funds, and freed a further 464 assessing staff for redeployment to audit work. The overall revenue results for the ATO indicate that since its implementation 'self-assessment' has had a positive effect on income tax revenue collection. In relation to individual taxpayers, the revenue benefit from the introduction of 'self-assessment' to December 1989 is estimated to be about $500 million. (1) (b) The first stage of 'self-assessment' in 1986-87 saw an improvement by the ATO in meeting its objective of processing refunds within 10 weeks of lodgement. Despite an overall increase 225 000 in income tax returns lodged over the previous year, the number of refunds issued within 10 weeks of lodgement was achieved in 98.6 per cent of cases compared to 96.5 per cent of cases for returns lodged in 1985-86. In 1987-88, when 'self-assessment' was first extended to salary returns the objective for issuing refunds was set at 9 weeks. This was achieved in 85 per cent of cases. The only direct comparison to the previous year is in the average processing time for all returns. The average processing time for all returns improved from 5.0-5.5 weeks in 1986-87 to 4.5-5.0 weeks in 1987-88. (2) I am aware that in late 1989 and early 1990 the Brisbane Taxation Office was, in one of the informative messages on its telephone system, advising callers of processing delays. The advice was to the effect that many assessments were taking four months or more to issue and encouraged callers to defer inquiries about progress of assessments. The processing delays at the time in question were caused by various factors such as a greater than expected increased workload resulting in the need to process approximately 80 000 more returns than during the previous year. A particularly significant factor was the failure of a large number of taxpayers and tax agents to complete the refund boxes on page one of return forms. This meant that many refund cases were not identifiable and could not be given the top priority afforded such cases in the first half of the financial year. A large proportion of complaints received about delays in processing refunds were found to have resulted from failure to complete the refund boxes. The decision by the Brisbane Taxation Office to use the particular message was aimed at giving callers a realistic idea of the situation, to ease pressure on inquiry staff and to allow priority to be given to special (for example, hardship) cases. availI note that inquiry staff themselves expressed dissatisfaction with having to reduce the level of service that they could provide to taxpayers. (3) and (4) The average times for the years in question are as follows: Average ProcessReturns for financial year ing Time 1982-83 (processed in 1983-84) not available 1983-84 (processed in 1984-85) not available 1984-85 (processed in 1985-86) not available 1985-86 (processed in 1986-87) 5.0 to 5.5 weeks 1986-87 (processed in 1987-88) 4.5 to 5.0 weeks 1987-88 (processed in 1988-89) 6.0 to 6.5 weeks 1988-89 (processed in 1989-90) 6.5 to 7.0 weeks 'Self-assessment' was introduced for returns for the 1985-86 financial year processed in 1986-87. of Since that time there have been other major changes to taxation arrangements which have affected processing times. These include amnesty, job re-design and associated training- For this reason it is not possible"" to isolate the effect 'selfassessment' has had on processing times. (5) For 1989-90 returns, the ATO has adopted the objective of processing 80 per cent of electronically lodged returns within 2 weeks, and 80 per cent Of paper returns within 6 weeks with 98 per cent to be issued within 8 weeks. This should result in a marked reduction in processing times to an average of 5.6 weeks or less. (6) If a taxpayer owes the ATO income tax, or any tax for that matter, he or she should pay the amount owed by the due date. The Commissioner has authority under the law to grant an extension of time to pay if a taxpayer is in financial difficulties. If payment of any tax cannot be made by the due date, suitable arrangements should be made with the ATO by that time. Federal Airports Corporation: Airline (Question No. 113) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 1 Juhe 1990: (1) What were the operating losses incurred by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) as a result of the airpilots' dispute. (2) Have adjustments been made to curtail some of the FAC's planned capital expenditure in respect of its infrastructure program; if so, (a) what adjustments, (b) which capital expenditure programs have been affected and (c) to what (i) financial and (ii) developmental extent have the programs been affected. (3) Will the adjustments adversely affect the overall operations of the FAC.",154
176,Mr BEAZLEY,YUGOSLAVIA,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Some $20 million. (2) During the dispute the Corporation adopted a policy of deferring avoidable expenditures where practicable. This deferral cannot be readily quantified in· the terms of the question as the curtailment was achieved through a multitude of decisions not to proceed with expenditures at the time. There has been no significant or lasting effect upon the major development works underway or planned. Contractual commitments have been met and - projects are proceeding. (3) No. Federal Airports Corporation: Sydney Airport (Question No. 114) Mr J ull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 1 June 1990: (1) What was the (a) nature of and (b) sum involved in each of the unpaid accounts following the transfer of Sydney Airport to the Federal Airports Corporation. (2) Did senior Departmental officials know that claims for the unpaid accounts existed; if not, why not. (3) Were the accounts not identified as being still unpaid until almost a year after the transfer; if so, why did it take so long. (4) Has negotiation of liability been prolonged; Pilots Dispute if so, why.",155
177,Mr BEAZLEY,YUGOSLAVIA,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) All of the accounts had been paid by the FAC in accordance with the transfer arrangements but the Corporation was seeking reimbursement from the Department. . (a) The accounts were for goods and services provided to Sydney Airport immediately before, and immediately after its transfer to the FAC on 1 January 1988. (b) The total break down of the accounts is not readily available, and I am not willing to commit resources to examine several hundred invoices and receipts to obtain the information at this time. (2) The Department's NSW Regional Office received an Invoice/Statement from the FAC in May 1989, but disputed that the accounts were the responsibility of the Department. The matter was referred to senior officers in the Department's central office in September 1989. (3) No. The accounts were paid by the FAC, in accordance with transfer arrangements. The reimbursement to the FAC was delayed in order to establish legal liability for each of those accounts. (4) No. Discussions on liability were held between the FAC and the Department's NSW Regional Office on several occasions. The matter was then referred to the Department's Central Office. Negotiations relied on the transfer principles and arrangements, and culminated in agreement on the apportionment of each of several hundred invoices and receipts between the F AC and the Department. Civil Aviation Authority: Airline Pilots Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 1 June 1990: (1) What adjustments to its program did the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) make to reduce the impact of operating losses during the airpilots' dispute. (2) What adjustments to its program has the CAA made since the dispute to absorb the loss of $60 million incurred during the dispute. (3) Has the Government agreed to forgo a CAA dividend payment; if so, what is its (a) nature and (b) value. (4) Does the CAA expect to make a $33 million net profit for 1990-91; if so, how.",155
178,Mr BEAZLEY,YUGOSLAVIA,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) I am advised that in the face of revenue losses which resulted from the domestic pilots dispute the CAA examined its operating costs and instituted a range of temporary cost savings and cost deferral measures. In selecting those measures the Authority was determined not to jeopardise its major infrastructure modernisation prog-as, training programs or, of course, safety reqUIrements. (2) The CAA has advised that industry activity has now returned to pre-dispute levels and that continuing, substantial productivity improvements flowing from the CAA's equipment modernisation program and various administrative developments are expected. The CAA expects to return to profitability in 1990/91, while at the same time reducing its . mainstream charges to the industry by an average of 2.4 in real terms. (3) The Government did agree to a recommendation from the CAA Board that the CAA not be required to pay a dividend in respect of the Authority's 1988/89 profit. The CAA Board had not, at that stage, considered what level of dend would be appropriate given the 1988/89 trading result. (4) The CAA's latest advice indicates an expected profit on its 1990/91 trading results but less than the $33 million result previously estimated by the Authority. General Aviation (Question No. 116) Mr Jull asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 1 June 1990: (1) What projections of flight (a) frequencies Dispute· and (b) numbers for the general aviation sector did the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) make (i) (Question No. 115) for 1988-89, (ii) for J989-90 and (iii) prior to the airpilots' dispute, for 1990-91. (2) What are the CAA's current projections of flight (a) frequencies and (b). numbers for the general aviation sector for 1990-91. (3) What are the industry projections of flight (a) frequencies and (b) numbers for the general aviation sector for 1990-91. (4) If there has been a drop in the 1990-91 projections, will there be an impact on CAA revenue; if so, (a) what impact and (b) what adjustments have been made. in light of that impact. (5) Have any calculations and adjustments been made taking account of the industry projections; if not, why not.",156
179,Mr BEAZLEY,YUGOSLAVIA,"The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) The CAA does not, for annual business planning purposes, specifically estimate general aviation flight frequencies and numbers. Instead, the Authority uses estimates of annual growth rates in the level of general aviation activity. General aviation activity has grown at an average rate of around 1 per cent per annum over the last 15 years, with actual activity in individual years' changing by up to plus or minus 8 per cent. In light of this, the CAA normally plans on this sector's activity growth being 1. per cent each year unless there are unusual economic or other factors considered likely, in which case the growth estimate is adjusted accordingly. The CAA originally assumed annual growth of 1 per cent for this sector for each of 1988/89, 1989/90 and 1990/91. Actual general aviation growth was 5 per cent in 1988/89 and is likely to . be about 4 per cent in 1989/90. The 1988/89 growth was largely a product of general economic conditions and high levels of agricultural aircraft activity. The 1989/90 growth was largely due to intensive activity immediately following the commencement of the pilots' dispute. Activity by this divisector has been in line with the CAA's expectations since December 1989. The CAA's current expectations for general aviation sector activity for 1990/91 are for a reduction of 2 per cent from the level originally expected for 1989/90, equivalent to 5 per cent below actual 1989/90 activity levels. Such a result would be consistent with long term growth trends, given the strong growth experienced by this sector in 1988/89 and 1989/90. The industry expectations for 1990/91 general aviation activity levels vary significantly across the different parts of the sector. Some groups consider they will experience growth, while others expect different degrees of reduction in activity of up to 5 percent. (4) General aviation aircraft generate well below 10 pe,r cent of the CAA's annual revenues. Accordingly, an adjustment of, say 5 per cent in general aviation' growth rate assumptions has littie impact (less than 0.2 per cent) on the CAA's arinual revenues . The CAA has, since its establishment, applied a policy of extensive; ongoing consultations with the aviation industry about matters such as growth rate expectations as these are an important input into the Authority's business planning and the setting of its annual charges. CAA officers met with individual general aviation organisations early in 1990, specifically to seek views about growth rates for 1990/91. The;se views were taken into account in developing the CAA's charges to take effect from I july 1990, and were discussed with the aviation industry, including six general aviation associations on 29 March 1990.

Taxation Relief for Flood Victims Mr Tim Fischer asked the Treasurer on 9 May 1990 (Hansard, page 116) the following question without riotice: (1) In view of the Treasurer's commitment to providing tax relief for flood tims . . . will he confirm that this includes late lodgement of downward variations for provisional tax in light of the changed outlook for farmers and businesses, large and small, in the regions affected? (2) Will he extend the promised relief to allow rebates on tax already paid by those affected? (3) Can he outline the basis of valuing livestock and fodder donations for the calculation of tax deductions?",156
180,Mr KEATING,YUGOSLAVIA,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that the application for variation of provisional tax is required to be lodged before the due date for payment specified in the assessment or sec. in the instalment notice. However, the Commissioner has power to extend the time lodgement of the application and the tax office will give sympathetic consideration for extensions of time to lodge variations of provisional tax to victims of the floods. (2) In relation to allowing rebates on tax already paid, the Commissioner has advised that, at his discretion, where the taxpayer has paid the provisional tax, and a variation is lodged after that payment, which reduces the amount of provisional tax the Commissioner can credit any overpaid amount in payment of income tax payable or refund the provisional tax overpaid. (3) Taxpayers are entitled to income tax deductions for gifts of $2 or more made to authorised funds. The Government has already announced that flood relief funds established by the Premiers of flood-affected States will be eligible to receive tax deductible gifts. The basis for allowing income tax deductions for gifts of livestock or fodder to authorised funds depends on whether the livestock or fodder previously formed part of the donor's trading stock. Specific provisions exist in the law which revicquire the value of trading stock disposed of, other than in the ordinary course of business, to be included in the taxpayer's assessable income. An example of such a disposal is a gift of such stock. However another provision allows a deduction for an equivalent amount provided the trading stock is donated to an authorised fund. The period this stock was held is irrelevant for the purposes of determining a donor's eligibility for the deduction. Where the livestock or fodder did not form part of the donor's trading stock, a deduction is only allowable if the stock had been purchased within 12 months of making the donation. The deduction is' limited to the lesser of the price paid by the donor or its market value at the time the donation was made.",158
