1,Mr SPEAKER ,ZZZZZ,"Hon. Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 10 a.m., and read prayers. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.4) 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 21 November, on motion by Mr Howe: That the Bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Connolly had moved by way of amendment: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House (1) expresses its disapproval of the Government's failure to change the direction of its social welfare policies to meet the needs of the Australian community; (2) condemns the Government for its failure to create a level playing field for various of annuities and pensions; (3) expresses its strong concern at the wide-ranging cutbacks and complex changes imposed by the Government on veterans and war widows since May 1989; (4) reiterates its support for the Veterans' Children's Education Scheme as being a scheme of compensation and as such falling in a separate category to the general Austudy scheme; and (5) expresses its concern at delays and inconsistencies in the determining system leading to wide-ranging variations in determinations, particularly by the Veterans' Review Board'.",11
2,Mr JOHNS ,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Petrie) (10.01)-1 want to make some remarks about the long process of reform which has now been brought to a head in the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1989. I congratulate in particular the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Howe) on the way he has gone about integrating the social security system and the system of training people to get them back into employment. It seems that some of the new ideas offered under the Opposition's so-called Economic Action Plan do not even attempt to build on the good work that has been done. In fact, they tend to reverse the ship of state, leaving people with hardly any choices whatsoeverthere is only the damning choice of either getting out and working or being thrown onto special benefits, for instance. It seems to me that the dole bludger mentality is back in Australia. I thought that way back in 1982-83 we had killed that sort of awful characterisation of people who have been unable to get employment in this country. Honourable members will remember that at that time there were about 700,000 unemployed people in Australia. The only way that the Liberal-National coalition could handle the anguish of that many people was to blame them for not being able to get a job. We overcame that. We calmed things down, we told those people that it was not their fault that they could not get a job· and we went about creating jobs. . However, there is always a lag effect. No matter how many jobs we created, there was always the very real situation that some people, often older men and women, could not get back into the work force because they no longer possessed the skills and, in classes some cases, the will to get out there and work. That did not make them bludgers. They were people who were right for programs to get them back into the work force. Those are the sorts of programs that the Government has been building on and improving over six years. Those programs would be destroyed under a Liberal-National coalition. The statistics show that the number of people on the unemployment benefit has dropped consistently since the March quarter of 1984. From that time until November this year the number of unemployment beneficiaries has dropped consistently. We have not cooked the books. We have not said that after nine months people will have to go off the unemployment benefit and cop some other sort of benefit, like special benefits, if they are poor enough or go to blazes and get no support from the people of Australia. We would never take that attitude. We have recognised two. things. First, jobs must be available so that people can be taken from the very considerable disadvantage of being on the unemployment benefit and put back into the work force. Secondly, if people are finding it difficult to gear themselves up to get back into the work force, a program must be provided. One program that has been extremely successful for some months now is the Newstart program. Newstart assists in getting the long term unemployed back to work. The people on the Newstart program are not your young beach bums. They are not kids with blonded hair and bronzed physiques who sit down on the beach. They are 55-year-old men and women who are at the end of their tether. They are extremely poor. In some circumstances they are without hope and they need considerable assistance and a gee up to get them back into the work force. The Newstart program does this. I want to report on some figures from my area of Redcliffe which show the marvellous success that this Government's Newstart program is hav-ng. The Department of Social Security (DSS) and the Commonwealth Employment Services (CES) jointly interview people to find out not only how they are coping, why they lost their employment and what they have been doing in the intervening period but also how best they can be put into some form of training to get them back out to work. It might seem as though this has been a long time coming. There have been other programs. These people have been under scrutiny, if you like, by the CES, to ensure that they continue to try for a job. It is not as though there have not been all sorts of programs in place to get people back into the work force. But the programs have not always worked. We are talking about people who have been out of work for a considerable period of time and who need assistance to get back into the work force. We have found that, through the Newstart program, about half of a select group of 120 people in the Redcliffe area have been able to return to work. This has been due to a new intensive approach of interviewing people, talking to people, giving them some new skills and telling them again how to find a job. Many people in this category have lost their skills. Anyone who is out of work for a considerable time feels deflated. The pressures of having to pay off the mortgage, pay rent or bring up children must be awful. Let us remember that being unemployed is no joy ride. I am not talking about people with lots of dough sitting out the back having fun and drinking tinnies. These people do not have money. A lot of them do not have much hope. We are not using, as morally we must not and should not, a great big stick. We are not saying that we will throw people off the unemployment benefit after nine months and that they can go down to the DSS which can provide a special benefit if it thinks they are poor enough. We put enormous pressure on people and encourage them to get back the life that they have lost. We are providing the opportunity for people to get back into employment, to make friends again in the workplace, to bring money into the house and to derive a sense of ownership which one loses when one becomes unemployed. The Opposition's punitive attitude annoys me. I cannot believe that, after six years of watching us being so successful in getting the unemployment figures down, honourable members opposite all of a sudden think that the problem can be solved by using a big stick. That is not so. We have been at this game for a long time. We have done a marvellous job in getting those figures down. Schemes like Newstart are really meant to cap off our efforts. They are dealing with the last and most difficult cases in order to get those people back to work. There is no doubt that the Newstart program has ferreted out some people who are not interested in going to an interview. I am not quite sure of all the reasons. Perhaps some people have not been fair dinkum in looking for a job. There are others, I suspect, who prefer just to exit quietly. Some people who are perhaps near to retirement age or who are to let an older partner look after them cannot face any further interviewing, training and whatever. Let us consider those sorts of people. It might be true to say that some of these people who do not make the jump from the DSS office to the CES for this intensive program might simply walk right out of the system. They do so at no cost to the Government. But what is the cost to them? The critical point is that we are not forcing them off the dole. We encourage them into work, and that is an enormous, fundamental and important difference-and I want to stress that. The manager at the Redcliffe CES office is operating a unique scheme which involves discussions with the 120 people that I have referred to and it has been possible to get half of them back to work. The next target relates to the older people, those over 55, who have been unable to get into the work force. A pilot scheme is about to commence in my electorate. The Government is awarding $60,000 to a local group. We do not know which group it will be but, for instance, it could be the local Skillshare group, which is a community based training organisation. A Newstart-type process will be used in respect of the older unemployed. These people will be taken aside and talked to about what it takes to get them back into the work force. This does not involve punishing someone who is perceived to be some sort of joyrider by arbitrarily throwing him off the unemployment benefit after nine months and telling him to get special benefits. That is like saying, 'You have failed: not only can you not get yourself a job but you will receive the meanest payment in the whole system-special benefit. It is the lowest benefit, the last stop; you cannot go any further'. The rules that apply to special benefit are fairly tough and one must really go begging, in a sense, to a departmental officer and say, 'I am destitute and 1 need some benefit'. That is what special benefit is. Thank goodness we have it in this country, but it is a last calling post. That is not the sort of approach to use to encourage people back into the work force. 1 do not care how many long term unemployed the 60 Minutes program or Mr Carlton interviews to indicate that there are bludgers out there because, when Mr Carlton finds one person who should be in the work force, there are another 100 who are working. I have stood in front of perhaps 500 young people at Skillshare programs-young people who have tried courageously to get into the work force. They use a Government community program like Skillshare, pick up some new skills and then go back out into the community. I am not sure that I would have the guts to do all the work those people do to try to get back into the work force. I am not sure that I could cope with that, yet we expect so much of these people who are often less qualified than we are here and often less capable in some ways. We expect more of them than we do of ourselves, yet the Opposition wants to be punitive; it wants to punish them further. Enough of that. I will close on the point that Newstart and similar programs are designed to take people off benefits and get them back into the work force. Programs of this sort are not our first in this area, and they will probably not be the last. We try to establish programs that are sensitive to the needs of those who are ' unemployed. We listen to the unemployed and we react, and we get them into the work force. We have done that successfully for six years. I congratulate the Minister and his Department for their good work.",11
3,Mr WILSON ,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Sturt) (1O.13)-The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill gives us the opportunity to have quite a wide-ranging debate on matters relating to social security. I would like to deal with a number of topics, and I will probably be able to deal with some of them only briefly because of the time limitation on this debate. The first matter that I wish to raise relates to the purchasing power of pensions that we provide to those who qualify for a pension or benefit of one kind or another. There is and has been bipartisan support for the proper adjustment of pensions as circumstances in our economy change. There has been and continues to be bipartisan support for the twice-yearly indexation of pensions and adjustment in accordance with the movement of the consumer price index (CPI). There has also been bipartisan use of the comparison between the present pension and another measure, namely, average weekly earnings. This legislation points to the proposal that pensions should be fixed at a level whereby they are not less than 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. I support that, as do my colleagues, but, if we have regular half-yearly adjustments in accordance with the CPI, there are two matters that need to be drawn to attention. Firstly, there is the timing of the adjustment, and that needs to be examined from time to time to ensure that pensioners are not disadvantaged by time-lags in the movement in pension rates in accordance with some prior adjustment in the CPI. Secondly, there needs to be a regular review of the comparison of the pension and benefit rates with average weekly earnings, because the two indexes do not move in step and at the same rate. There have been times in our economy when, because there has been substantial wage restraint, the CPI has moved faster than average weekly earnings. Indeed, the Government's claim that it has lifted the level of the pension closer and closer until eventually it has reached 25 per cent of average weekly earnings has been significantly achieved because of wage restraint and a higher movement in the CPI rather than as a result of any particular generosity on the part of the Government in relation to pensioners. On the other hand, there are times when the economy moves in a different direction, when average weekly earnings move more quickly than does the CPI. In that event, if this Parliament has a bipartisan commitment to CPI adjustments and a pension of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings, there needs to be an ad hoc adjustment, or perhaps in the future this Parliament will determine that there should be a regular review to make an adjustment of the average weekly earnings for a catch-up in the event that the CPI adjustment falls behind the average weekly earnings benchmark. Other areas of the pension system have been indexed, too, and that is a good thing. The assets test limits were indexed from the outset after a fairly rigorous debate about whether or not there should be an assets test. I have strong views about that, but that is for another day. The other adjustment that is made in this legislation is to index the free area. That is an interesting adjustment because it also relates to the proposal ultimately to exempt pensioners from tax altogether, in the first instance exempting the income test free area. The Government has made a lot of that and has said that pensioners will· be free from tax, but it has not spelt out very much detail. We do not know how the system will operate, but I assume that the model that will be used will be that currently being used and that it will be done by the grant of an aged persons rebate. That is fine. All women of 60 years and over and all men of 65 years and over will become entitled to this rebate and will receive a tax exemption. It must be pointed out to the aged population and to the community at large that this will do two things. It will give a very much higher tax free threshold to one section of the community without giving it to other sections. Personally, I believe that the tax free threshold should be substantially higher than it is today. That can be .achieved in a couple of ways. One is, at very great cost, by leaving the current rate structure in place. The other way is to raise the threshold for people who have a very low income but then have the ingoing marginal tax ratesomewhat higher than it is at present-perhaps 30c instead of the 21c or 25c that it has been. One could then achieve a situation where there is clear water between the pension level and where tax impacts over a range that is equal to the income test free area now to be indexed-I think $50 a week for a single pensioner. Personally, I believe that the tax threshold should be lifted for all up to that tax free area because it then means that the universal marginal tax rate can be maintained for people just above that threshold, whether it is the age threshold or the general threshold, both of which, in my view, should b-. the same. If it is done in the way that the aged rebate has been implemented in the past, it is a wasting rebate, a disappearing rebate. Once the tax free threshold is reached, tax is paid at the marginal rate set by the tax structure as· applicable to the population in general, and then there is an abatement of the rebate. The rebate is withdrawn by a certain number of cents in the dollar-say 12k in the dollar-and that marginal rate is added on top of the general marginal tax rate. So there is then a very high effective marginal tax rate imposed on people as they move from the artificially created tax-free area. That situation has some grave disadvantages- One disadvantage is that those on low incomes who are not aged are paying tax on very low incomes. There is also the disadvantage that those who are aged when their income reaches the threshold are suddenly confronted with a very high marginal tax· rate. It can be moderately high or very high. That judgment is made from time to time as to whether one wants to claw back very quickly the tax otherwise paid or whether that should be done more gradually. In either event, it has some effect on incentives. It may be argued that for the retired population it will not have an effect on the incentive for their work force participation, but it will have an effect on their investment and savings strategies. In· my view that is undesirable. This legislation is also interesting because it starts to look at providing common definitions in the social security legislation as are applicable in the tax legislation. I wish the Minister for Social Security ( Mr Howe) had adopted that approach generally. I am pleased that he has now introduced a precedent, and I hope that in time we can look at income for tax and social security purposes and say that the definition will be the same under both regimes. It may be that we would then want to have some exceptions, but let those exceptions be clear, explicit and justified by sound and good reasons. There is really no justification for many of the different definitions applying now in the legislation, except to say that something has been done for a long time in one area and some different definition has been used for a long time in another area. Most age pensioners were once taxpayers. They therefore have come to understand the definitions in the tax system, so when they reach the age of retirement they should be able to simply lift those definitions into the social security system, and have a clear understanding of their rights and entitlements and how they determine their eligibility under the income test. The other matter I want to raise relates in one sense to a very special aspect of this proposal-the home equity conversion. It is really designed to tidy up some ineffective or doubtful definitions in the legislation so that people can borrow against their house without then being penalised under either the assets or income tests. That is good and is a pointer to the way in which we should go. However, I want to look at the broader concerns that we must have ·in the changed environment that has occurred. A de facto compulsory savings scheme is being put into place in Australia today. It has come about because of the 3· per cent superannuation arrangements. As a consequence of the implementation of that arrangement and the possible increase from 3 per cent to 6 per cent, young people, middle aged people and older people are forced to save through industrial deals which are done and which are quite sensible in many respects. People are taking superannuation entitlements in lieu of pay packet cash payment. That is having a massive effect on tax revenue. It would be interesting to assess the effect on government interest in respect of the loss of revenue as a consequence of people saving through this compUlsory superannuation scheme. The point I want to make is that I believe that people should have the right to opt out of the compulsory channelling of those superannuation savings into superannuation funds and life insurance companies, and be enabled to use their savings to put a deposit on their house, extend their house, buy their house, or even undertake a business, subject to one proviso-that they will not come back onto the social security system, to the extent that they have taken their resources out of those secured, prudentially controlled superannuation funds. . . I am personally convinced that, just as this home equity conversion arrangement requires mortgages, it would be possible to introduce a scheme whereby those who wanted to do so could take out their resources to buy their first home for their family and young children, embark on a business enterprise or use them for some other purpose. This would help us to get our balance of payments into better order and it could be allowed, provided those· people delivered to the Government a performance bond by an approved financhil institution. The· arrangements that institution then has with the individual and the cost of granting that performance bond could be a m-tter between the institution and the individual. People could then make their own free choice judgment whether they wanted to take that action. I would have liked to talk on one other matter in relation particularly to overseas pensioners in Australia, but time is very limited and I will save those remarks for another day. I ask the Government to take into account the views I have expressed on the topics about which I have had the opportunity to speak.",13
4,Mrs HARVEY ,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Hawker) (10.27)-In the few minutes. I have available, I want to dress a few points raised last night in debate by the honourable member for ( Mr Tim Fischer), the Opposition spokesperson on veterans' affairs. The honourable member for Farrer last night did as he altirement ways does when he speaks on veterans' affairs matters and raised the old nine pointssure which used to be lO points-about the of dreadful things which this Government is supposed to have done to veterans. Of course, he had not one word of commendation or credit for this Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, which will be of inestimable benefit to the veterans of this country, particularly in relation their income over the next few years. The honourable member for Farrer quoted from a letter that the honourable member for Petrie ( Mr Johns) had written to one his constituents . .I have a letter :written. the honourable member for Farrer to a vetBill. erans' organisation in South Australia. It is a form letter, with a photocopied signature, that he presumably sent to veterans' organisations right around the country. What does the shadow spokesperson on veterans' affairs have to say to ex-service organisations around Australia?' Does he tell them about the Opdealing position's policy on retirement incomes anything else to do with the' Opposition's veterans', affairs policies? states: Dear Office Bearer This is to advise that today in the Federal Parliament, the Coalition moved to bring on the (Protection of the Australian Flag) Amendment Bill; an important amendment to prevent burning the flag at demonstrations and the like. You might like to know that the Government, cluding marginal Members from narrowly held bor seats, voted four times against debating considering' the Bill. I am not sure what the reference to'marwould ginal members from narrowly held Labor se.as' has to do with the matter. And so letter goes on. I have nothing against the Crimes (Protection of the Australian Flag) and this Bill. Amendment Bill, and I am sure that most of my colleagues have nothing against it. Proba.m. ably most veterans have nothing against either, and think it is quite a good idea, it is not exactly a burning issue. phrase, I have 20,000 veterans in my electoadrate, and they are not beating a path to my this door demanding that the Government bring Farrer on this flag Bill for debate. What they have been demanding is that the Government do something aboilt the reincome system, the service pension system, which affects them - o much. I am that if the veterans were asked which the two Bills they would have preferred to be brought on for debate. this session-the Crimes (Protection of the Australian Flag) Amendment Bill or the Bill before us; the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill, which largely concerns the retirement incomes system, which to is of vital importance to the future welfare and financial security of the veterans of this country-they would have chosen the latter Bill which they would consider as most imof portant for their welfare and future. As I by have said, we have nothing against the flag . Mr Fife-Well, why don't you pas- it?",16
5,Mr SPEAKER,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,Order!,16
6,Mrs HARVEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Because we are short of time this session. I think, and I am sure most veterans think, that the Bill before the House with their future financial security is or of greater importance than the flag Bill. Mr Fife-Well, we will give you the flag He does not. He Bill next week.",16
7,Mrs HARVEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,That has nothing to do with me.,16
8,Mr SPEAKER,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,OrderI The honourable Crimes member for Hume will cease interjecting.,16
9,Mrs HARVEY,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I. would simply like to say that this Bill, and particularly the retireinment incomes aspect of it, is a revolutionary Lameasure in this country in the approach to and retirement income policy. As a former member of the retirement incomes task force I like to say, as the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh) said last night, his how proud I am to have been so closely associated with the production of this policy",16
10,Mr SPEAKER,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,Order! The time is 10.30 The time allotted for the second reading it stage of the BiUhas expired. The question but is: That the words proposed to be omitted To coin a stand part of the question. Question resolved in the affirmative. Amendment negatived. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommendingappropriation announced. In Committee The Bill.,16
11,Mr HUMPHREYS ,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Griffith-Minister for Veterans' Affairs) (10.31)-by leave-I move: (I) Clause 21, page 21, line 30, omit ""(a), (b) or"", (2) Clause 92, page 88, lines 5 and 6, omit ""(a), (b) or"", The amendments will correct a technical defect in the definition of 'compulsorily preserved superannuation benefit'. They will ensure that superannuation benefits not subject to Government imposed preservation standards will come within the definition of 'compulsorily preserved superannuation benefits' only if they are subject to preservation standards equivalent to those imposed by occupational superannuation standard regulations. I also seek leave to table a short statement which contains an assurance asked for by the honourable member for Farrer ( Mr Tim Fischer), the Opposition spokesman for veterans' affairs. Leave granted.",17
12,Mr TIM FISCHER ,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Farrer) (10.33)-I thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs ( Mr Humphreys) for responding with a statement in respect of particularly, as I understand it, clause 88 of the Social Security and Veterans Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4), to which I spoke at some length late last night. There are legitimate concerns in relation to clause 88. I will study the response of the Minister very closely indeed, and the coalition will further determine its attitude in the Senate. Of course, we are of a mind to pass this measure because it is a Budget Bill, and the Opposition has not opposed the second reading. I appreciate the fact that the Minister has provided a tabled response to those specific and rather complex matters. I hope that the assurances given in that response will stack up in terms of the veterans, given the fact that we learnt yesterday that one Jack Herbert received fast track assistance from the Department of Veterans' Affairs to get his diggers' pension approved. While there are delays elsewhere in the system of the Repatriation Commission, and so forth, one wonders who really is on the side of the mates and the cronies. I thank the Minister for tabling that response to the matter concerning clause 88.",17
13,Mr HOWE ,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,You haven't been too keen on talking about Queensland.,17
14,Mr TIM FISCHER,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I am very keen to talk about Queensland, and I am very keen to talk about South Australia. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. ( MrHolIis)-I invite the honourable member not to respond to interjections. We are under time constraints and he is wasting time.",17
15,Mr TIM FISCHER,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"I certainly believe that the Minister's response is not wasting time because it goes to the core of a very complex clause 88 in clarifying the ,commencement time of the new extreme disability adjustment scheme and the criteria for qualifying for a totally and permanently incapacitated pension from a 70 per cent disability pension factor rather than a 100 per cent disability pension factor.",17
16,Mr HUMPHREYS ,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Griffith-Minister for Veterans' Affairs) (10.35)-I would like to correct the honourable member for Farrer ( Mr Tim Fischer) regarding the fast tracking of pensions for eligible veterans. When I was a young lad I was taught to believe none of what one hears and half of what one sees. It is very hard to believe Mr Herbert and I can assure the chamber that there has been no fast tracking of his pension, and the honourable member for Farrer is misrepresenting the facts. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Humphreys) read a third time. NA BILL (No.4) 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 October, on motion by Mr Robert Brown: That the Bill be now read a second time.",17
17,Mr BEALE ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Deakin) (10.36)-The Opposition will not be opposing the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.4) 1989. This .Bill proposes to amend the Customs Tariff Act .1987 through a series of amendments contained in nine schedules to the Bill. On the whole, the Bill reflects a housekeeping of the. tariff in that a deal of its amendments relate to correcting anomalies that have been created through changes to the harmonised tariff system. It also implements changes recommended by the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority and fulfils our obligations in· relation to the AustraliaNew Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (ANZCERT A). The significant changes in this Bill relate to the Government's decisions on the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC) report into the mining, construction and agricultural equipment industries. Schedule 1 of the Bill amends schedule 4 to insert a new subheading to allow for the continued duty free importation of ethyl hexanol. Ethyl hexanol was incorrectly Classified when the Government's decision on the chemicals and plastics industries was being implemented. The second schedule to this Bill, which has effect from 1 January 1988, allows for a duty free rate on rye grass seed. Also, gasoline and other oils, under subheading 2710.00.59 of the tariff, are to gain a duty free rate through the removal of a 2 per cent revenue duty. To ensure alignment with the harmonised system schedule under Customs Cooperation Council requirement, schedule 3 proposes a descriptive change. Operative from 1 March 1989 are amendments contained in schedule 4. These amendments implement unrestricted duty free access for footwear of New Zealand origin under ANZCERT A and also provide duty free importation of certain New Zealand fabrics. This schedule also seeks to remove quota restrictions and impose a duty rate of 15 per cent for metal parts. of footwear under subheadings 6406.10.00. and 6406.99.90. Prior to 1 March 1989 metal parts of footwear were quota free and dutiable at 20 per cent. Mr Humphreys-I didn't know that.",18
18,Mr BEALE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"I think the Minister for Veterans' Affairs should pay a great deal of attention to what I am saying because he will learn a great deal from this Customs Tariff Act. Following the November 1986 decision, these goods were lumped in with other footwear parts, which meant they were subject to a quota attracting a base rate af 40 per cent. Not unexpectedly, metal parts importers, retailers and footwear manufacturers who noted that these goods did not form part of the lAC inquiry which led to the November 1986 decision objected to the consequent increased production costs. So the duty reverts, with a 5 per cent discounting to take account of the May 1988 economic statement. Certain protective garments, such as those used by firefighting bodies or by persons involved with harmful chemicals, are also to have quota restrictions removed and a 15 per cent duty imposed. Prior to 1986 these types of items were subject to a tariff classification order and as such were imported at minimum rates. However, in 1986 the Australian Customs Service changed their classification, which resulted in those suits without breathing apparatus being entered under quota and subject to a base rate of 55 per cent. The out of quota rate is 120 per cent. This change made the suits very expensive for the local authorities and so on which used them and, of course, meant a substantial increase in the amount of protection afforded Australian producers. Schedule 4 affords similar treatment to these suits as to the metal parts of footwear. Schedule 4 also removes tariff rates applicable to tender extension provisions for goods from New Zealand, as is required under Australia's ANZCERTA obligations. The next schedule, schedule 5, which covers amendments to schedules 1,3,4, and 5 of the Act, also looks to Australia's obligations under ANZCERT A and proposes the removal of both tariff duty and quota restriction on apparel from New Zealand. Under the current situation, both Australia and New Zealand have made available to each other about $A20m in access to apparel exports. This amendment accelerates by a year the move toward free trade in apparel on a reciprocal basis. Following quite a deal of discussion in relation to the importation of soda ash, changes have been made, as the Government undertook to do during the debate on the customs and excise legislation amendment Bills earlier this year. Under this amendment the added protection afforded soda ash due to changes in customs valuation legislation has been adjusted. Briefly, the situation here is that when the Government announced that it intended tightening the 'Customs Act to combat fraud and avoidance of import duty' the Minister stated that in the exceptional cases where the new valuation arrangements significantly raised protective levels he would consider requests for review by the lAC. The 1989 amendments provided that the value of imports for duty calculations include all foreign inland freight and foreign inland insurance. With soda ash this meant an increase in the dollar value for· duty assessed as these imports were valued on an ex-mine basis. It has been estimated that the increase in the dollar value of import duty was around 40 per cent. The lAC inquired into this and this amendment is now in place. This amendment reduces the phasing rates already applying from 17.5 per cent to a proposed top of 15 per cent to 7.5 per cent from 1 January 1992. Other significant changes in this particular schedule relate to the Government's decision following the lAC report No. 413 into mining, construction and agricultural equipment industries. Many of the pieces of equipment and parts covered by the report are not made in Australia during the normal course of business. Among the changes in rates proposed by the Bill are that engines, NSA, having a power not exceeding 3.6 kilowatts-8407.32.20-have a reduced rate of 15 p-r cent from 21 per cent; pumps of 8413.30.12 are reduced from 21 per cent to free; mobile lifting frames on tyres and straddle carriers of 8426.12.00 and goods under 8426.1 are reduced from 27 per cent to 21 per cent; and mechanical shovels having a shovel capacity exceeding 5 cubic metres are moving from 18 per cent duty to free. In order that other speakers can participate in this debate, I would like to place on the record my support for all of those speakers who have condemned the way the Government has been running the business of this House. The guillotine was imposed on us yesterday. It is also being imposed today and it will be used again tomorrow. This is an outrageous indictment of the Government's inability to manage what goes on in this chamber. It shows, if it needs to be shown any further, how tired, how arrogant and how out of touch the Government is.",18
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Mr Ronald Edwards)-I am sure that the honourable member for Deakin realises that this is not a procedural debate at this stage. Debate is confined to a customs tariff amendment Bill. I am sure he will confine his remarks to that.,19
20,Mr BEALE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,Because of the Government's mismanagement I am precluded from going through the various other changes that the Government' proposes to make. Mr Humphreys-Where is the honourable member for Ryan?,19
21,Mr BEALE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The honourable member for Ryan ( Mr Moore) is winning an election for us in Queensland and he is making sure that those opposite lose it. The Minister has said that these other changes provide 'a boost to Australia's main export industries'. If there is one thing that Australia needs, it is an increase in its exports. This Government's gross mismanagement of the economy, which has led to an absolutely appalling situation with our balance of payments and a blowout in our overseas debt, has provided a situation-Mr Cleeland-Who wrecked the industry?",19
22,Mr BEALE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"It will cost my friend his seat. The Government's mismanagement of the Australian economy-what it has failed to do with inflation, what it has failed to do with the balance of payments and what it has failed to do in containing overseas debtwill cost the honourable member his seat. Mr Jull-Promise?",19
23,Mr BEALE,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Yes, I promise that it will cost him his seat. Amendments contained in schedule 6 are to have effect from 1 August 1989. These amendments cover certain fabric woven from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) coated polyester and woven cut corduroy, and provide quota legislation. free and duty free access for certain ski boots and certain cross country ski footwear. 1987 the Government decided upon duty another free treatment for woven cut corduroy which is not produced in Australia. However, this fabric was, to use the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority's words, 'inadvertently excluded' from implementafocus tion of the decision and as a consequence became dutiable at a rate phasing to 35 per cent. Under these amendments it will be duty free, as will PVC coated polyester, which from 1 January 1988 jumped from that minimum levels to 25 per cent-a rate which did not reflect the Government's textile, clothing and footwear policy intentions. The honourable member for MCEwen ( Mr CleeAustralia, land) will need a PVC coated polyester ering to protect himself from the fire of his developments. electors, who will boot him out. Yet another correction is contained in this Bill's schedule 7, which reinstates pre-Januto ary 1988 levels of protection on cast coated paper and paperboard. In regard to refunds, the Minister in his press release of 12 ber 1989 said: This change will be effective from today but will still be payable on entries of these goods seven days after assent to the amending legislation, after which refunds will be available on application to Customs. Schedule 8 amendments again reflect a broad sweep of subjects. Under the schedule, gary and Poland are added to the list of countries, contained in schedule 1, to which Australia affords preferential treatment. addition means a loss of Customs revenue an estimated $1.7m. The Bill also cancels a couple of redunThere dant items, fixes up some tariff anomalies identified by industry, which have been place since the harmonised tariff was duced and, in most cases, adjusts them to the levels which were in force prior to uary 1988. The schedule also seeks to insert new items into part 3 of schedule 4 of Customs Act of 1987, thus allowing duty free entry for specified parts and accessories for use in the manufacture or assembly of machines for working metal and duty free entry of specified parts of machines incordesigned porating a computer controller. The coalition parties do not object to the passage of this",19
24,Mr BALDWIN ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Sydney) (10.50)-The In Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.4) is omnibus Bill; it makes a whole range of changes, legislative alterations, many of which are fairly minor in nature. As such, I , do not intend to try to cover everything that is encompassed in the Bill. I would like to on schedule 8 of the Bill, which in effect adds Poland and Hungary to the list of countries which qualify for preferential treatment under the Australian system of tariff preference. The purpose of referring to section is that it provides an opportunity to make some comment on developments in eastern Europe and what their implications might be for the rest of the world, including and, more importantly, how the covWestern world ought to respond to those As is pointed out in the second reading speech on the Bill, this measure is designed lend support to the process of democratic reform taking place in those countries. I think it would be true to say that the extent and Octopace of developments there have surprised everybody. Nobody anticipated that within duty the space of a year we would be looking at until a situation where a non-communist Prime Minister could emerge in Poland and where the prospect of free elections is now firmly scheduled in Hungary. More recently in East Germany we have seen, in effect, the fall of Hunan old line regime which seemed for a considerable period to be impregnable. It is interesting that Bulgaria has joined the ranks This of those countries which are undertaking of change. The Czechoslovak regime and the Romanians are very much out on their own. was talk earlier of the Czechs hoping to forge a Prague-East Berlin axis but, unin fortunately from their point of view, that intropossibility seems to have faltered. What has brought about the possibility of Janthese developments is the change which has taken place in the Soviet Union, with the the reform program implemented by President Gorbachev. I recall that in the early period of Gorbachev's rule there was widespread scepticism as to the real implications of those changes. Were they merely cosmetic changes to buy a bit of time so that the whole authoritarian state apparatus in that country and the system which it represents could be perpetuated for a further period? There was quite a debate in Western circles about what the actual meaning of these changes was. There is really no doubt about it any more. In the last couple of weeks an issue of Time magazine had a front cover affirming that this is for real, that major and fundamental change is taking place. However, there are some very distinct problems. It seems that those countries undergoing a transition to a more democratic system of politics and economics need to go through a difficult period of transition in which, for a time, material living standards may actually worsen. We have seen that situation develop in the Soviet Union, where stocks of goods in the shops have been cleaned out as a result of increases in money wages which have been forced on the government because the work force is now actually able to mobilise, organise, take strike action and so forth. That increase in money incomes has resulted in an absolute clean-out of supplies of consumer goods in the shops. That is a major problem. It seems that unless Gorbachev can put substantial amounts of consumer goods on the shelves in the Soviet Union in the coming period, particularly over this coming winter, politically he will be in real difficulty. In order to bring about fundamental change in the economy of the Soviet Union and to improve living standards, certainly in the short term but also in the long term, a necessary condition is that there be a major cut in military expenditure. That goes to the whole question of the way the West responds to these things. There is a reciprocal requirement between the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States has its chronic problem of a large public sector deficit which has proved very difficult to deal with. One way of tackling that, obviously, would be to cut into the military budget. The Soviet Union must reallocate economic' resources from the military-industrial complex to consumer goods production if the Government is to have any prospect of success in carrying through its reform program. Therefore, the question of whether the West seeks to assist to reduce East-West tensions and to provide economic assistance to facilitate that process of change is crucial. This legislation in a very small way adds Australia to the list of those countries which are aiming, in a positive sense, to facilitate that process. As such, this measure is to be applauded. Another way of looking at this set of developments is to ask what is the more costeffective way of ensuring the security of a state like Australia or other Western countries. Is it to continue the massive arms buildup that took place during the 1980s, with very large real increases in military expenditures, which we have seen in Australia as well as in a variety of other countries? We have had very substantial real increases in defence expenditures over the last few years. Is it better to do it that way, to try to guarantee one's security by the so-called peace through strength doctrine, or is it more cost-effective to expend some economic resources in accelerating the process of benign change in the Eastern blocs so that the whole question of threat is significantly diminished and the prospect of large scale multilateral disarmament becomes real? My view is that Australia is overspending on defence. On forward estimates it looks like we will continue to see large real increases in defence expenditure. Those expenditures are at the cost of other things that the Government could be doing, in areas that the Government could be spending on, not only in the area of social provision but also facilitating the process of structural change in the Australian economy. So I take the view that this change in international circumstances offers us an opportunity to rein in what has been a substantial rate of growth of defence expenditure. I would hope to see that occur. It is worth noting that within the United States and in the West generally there has been quite a debate about how to deal with these developments in Eastern Europe. There is a hard line school of thought, reputedly associated with the present Defense Secretary, the Deputy National Security Director and various others in the Administration, including the Vice President, as I understand it, which says that the West really has no business in actively seeking to facilitate and improve the prospects of change in the Soviet bloc. I think that is a very short-sighted view, for the reasons I have outlined. I certainly hope that that point of view within the US Administration does not prevail. There is another view, which, I am pleased to say, seems to be being taken up to some degree by the present Secretary of State, which says that facilitating and assisting this process is very much in the interests of all concerned, not only those countries which receive the assistance but also those counby tries which are presently members of the Western alliance. Hopefully, all this will lead ultimately to the break-up of this whole sysdesirable tem of alliances and a totally different world order. I think that is the sort of thing Presito dent Gorbachev envisages. It is in all of our interests that that sort of change take place. I thought I would make those observations which relate in a direct sense to of this Bill. It is unusual to talk about such a broad subject on such a narrowly focused Bill with a whole string of essentially machinery amendments but I have been greatly looking for an opportunity to make a few comments on those developments and what their implications might be for Australia for some time, so I welcome having had that opportunity.",20
25,Mr ROCHER ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Curtin) (l1.00)-The and Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.4), which we are considering this morning, covand ers a number of changes to customs and excise legislation. I will concentrate on of these changes and the issues which they raise,but if time permits I will go on to refer to the quite significant changes to the tariffs for mining and agricultural equipment. The changes I will focus on are of interest beeconomies cause they illustrate a point often forgotten by those interested in foreign affairs-that the relations between different countries and Union. the people of those countries contact of a commercial kind predominates over formal diplomatic, cultural and other 'interaction. There is no better example of the imporPoles, tance of commerce in international relations than in the way that Western countries are attempting to help those seeking to abandon communism in eastern Europe by freeing access to Western markets for those counyears tries which appear to be making genuine ,riorated efforts to reform their systems of governsupport ment. Part of this legislation represents tralia's contribution to this process. Another issue I will discuss is the closer economic relations (CER) agreement with New Zealand, which has led to amendments contained in this legislation to the tariff regime for textiles, clothing and footwear trade between the two countries, which is of interest also. It is arguably counterproductiye that protection in Australia is so high th/it there can be a significant benefit to any country listing as a favoured country under the Australian system of tariff preferences. However, given that the benefit exists, it is highly to extend those benefits as far as possible. It is particularly desirable to be able use those benefits to assist eastern European countries which are struggling to throw off the bitter yoke of 44 years of communist rule which they have endured since the end schedule 8 of the Second World War. The two countries which this Bill proposes to grant preference to are Hungary and Poland. Both are countries which have suffered in recent history. Poland was devastated by the war and this destruction was compounded by the oppression of Soviet occupation after the war. The people of Poland have suffered because of oppression, which has been a feature of all communist regimes, from the inability of centralised command economies to deliver the prosperity the most essential of services. This is perhaps a debatable point, but there is a two lesson to be learned in Australia from the failure of centralised government. Although our political system is different, although we are by no means a totalitarian state of the kind to which I have referred, centralised and centralised government is also a factor in the momentous changes taking in place in eastern Europe and the Soviet In the early 1980s, Solidarity-in some respects a trade union-with the broad support of the church, academics and other conducted a series of strikes about living standards, the supply of food and lack of political freedom. This eventually resulted in the declaration of martial law and the banning of Solidarity. Over the past two the economic position in Poland detefurther, causing a strong increase in for opponents of the Government Ausand a crisis in the communist Government itself. Negotiations with Solidarity followed, leading to elections, the overwhelming rejection of the communist Government by the people of Poland, and eventually a government dominated by Solidarity members but continuing to have members of the former regime in significant positions. Pohind has not yet had fully democratic elections, and it is well to remind ourselves of that. The Communist Party still dominates positions of power within the military, the judiciary, and government departments. However, if the present Solidarity-led Government fails, there will be little prospect free elections and for genuine economic and political freedom in Poland in the long term. The survival of the present Government in Poland, at least in part, depends on the progress it achieves in economic reform. To aid these developments, Western countries are offering direct and indirect aid to the Government of Poland. The French Government recently announced $820m in economic aid to Poland. The measures proposed in. this Bill amount to a concession of $lm on imports from Poland, worth about $3lm in the past year. However, the monetary benefit to Poland will not be as great as the benefit of increased trade and increased economic contact with the non-communist world. The Bill also proposes concessions to Hungary which will cost $0.7m in revenue on total imports worth about $28m. Hungary is yet to hold open elections. However, the ruling party has renounced much of its past and only a couple of weeks ago implemented a new Constitution which guaranteed certain individual rights and established a framework for democracy in that country in the future. It has opened up its borders to free travel, leading to the recent exodus of Germans from East Germany. Leaders of the ruling party in Hungary have claimed that capitalism is the highest economic achievement of mankind. These changes in eastern Europe should be encouraged. I believe that the measures contained in this Bill are likely. to meet with the wide support of Australians.· The promise of the changes taking place in Poland, Hungary and, to a lesser but increasing extent, the other nations of eastern Europe is yet to be fulfilled. Change should be encouraged and helped, but there is a danger in assuming that it has already occurred, a danger made all the more acute by the tragic repression of those seeking liberty in China. Measures such as those contained in this Bill show appropriate caution. The closer economic relations agreement between Australia and New Zealand,· to which I now wish to turn, was developed under the most recent coalition Government and has been taken further in recent years. It allows for the gradual creation of something like a free trade zone including Ausfor tralia and New Zealand. It is a bilateral agreement which has already created considerable benefits for both countries. It is a good example of the potential benefits of free trade throughout the world. Although companies in both countries compete strongly and a number of trans-Tasman takeovers have occurred, as we all know, it has simply not been the case that one country has come to dominate the other. Despite the conflict between Australia and New Zealand over ANZUS, the closer economic relations agreement has remained firmly intact and is being strengthened. Free trade has been a strong force for peace and international cooperation and I believe will continue to be so for as long as we allow it to happen into the future. Schedule 4 to this Bill contains provisions which speed up the liberalisation of trade in textiles, clothing and footwear between Australia and New Zealand under the CER agreement. The textiles, clothing and footwear industries are the most heavily protected of all Australian industries. This Bill will see the environment of largely free trade in these goods across the Tasman achieved one year earlier than we had expected. That is a desirable result in an industry which in the past has been inefficient, uncompetitive, and, particularly for those who do not work in the industry, a burden on other Australians. The establishment of the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Authority was a backward step on the very slow path which this Government has followed towards overall reductions in protection, which I acknowledge. It has reduced the role of the Industries Assistance Commission (lAC) in the scrutiny of protection of the TCF industries. It was accompanied by initial increases in tariff protection to offset the elimination of what had been particularly onerous quota protection. The problems with such protection are not just the particular benefits conferred on some interest groups consisting of both industry and trade unions; the costs imposed on consumers by this protection are high and particularly obvious in the area of textiles, clothing and footwear. People are well aware of the lower prices of clothing in most countries in our region. The costs of protection fall most heavily on those who can least afford it. Efforts in this legislation which recognise that no industry can be exempted from a general need to reduce protection and a 'practise what we preach' approach in the realm of free trade are highly desirable. I believe that the benefits to Australians and New Zealanders from closer economic relations represent a model for the future reductions of protection across the board. This package of customs legislation is unusual in its largely sensible and generally non-protectionist implementation of agreements with other countries and its implementation of the recommendations of the lAC. The final concern which I raise today is about the future of the lAC under the new Industry Commission. In recent years, the lAC has had to face upheaval and changes which have reduced its effectiveness as a protector of the general interest, rather than vested interests, in industries assistance matters. The lAC has been hamstrung by the present Government in the recent past, in part because it proved a damning critic, when necessary, of the Government's industry plans and policies. The acceptance of the independent and critical role of the lAC, or its successor, by all governments is a challenge which this Government has not yet had the courage to face up to.",22
26,Mr CLEELAND ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"MCEwen) (11.13)-The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1989 and other Bills which will come before the House today are a continuance of the Government's major micro-economic reforms in this country. It is quite interesting to compare the Government's stance on the removal of protection and the opening up of Australia's markets to international competition with the stance of the Opposition. I listened with interest this morning to the honourable member for Deakin ( Mr Beale), who gave a long-winded speech but said nothing and did not reveal or discuss at any stage the Opposition's attitude to this major micro-economic reform. If we read the much vaunted Economic Action Plan, as it is called, of the Opposition, we will hunt in vain for any discussion in that document on the Opposition's attitude to major macro-economic or micro-economic change in industry areas. Mr Qarry Jones-No different from the previous Government.",24
27,Mr CLEELAND,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The Minister is right; it is no different. Members of the Opposition do not want to talk about where they stand on tariffs or protection. They do not want to talk about what they would do; yet, without that kind of discussion, without a rational argUlpent or a rational base that they can put forward on their tariff and protection position, they do not have an economic policy. That is one of the great nonsenses being run around Australia today about the Opposition's so-called Economic Action Plan: it is not; it is a shallow and hollow document which fails to address the most pressing fundamental economic questions facing Australia today. The reality is quite simple: the Opposition created the protected market that Australia now faces. The Opposition created a centrally managed economy-the very sort of economy for which the honourable member for Curtin ( Mr Rocher), who spoke before me, criticised the communist countries· of Europe. Members of the Opposition stand here today and say, 'We know that centralised economies do not work. We know that managed economies do not work'. Yet they were the very people who set forth tariff protection and destroyed Australia's manufacturing industries in the process. So it is always amusing for people on my side of politics to sit in this place and listen to honourable members opposite, who still will not give any indication of where they stand as a party-either the Liberal Party or the National Party-on removing barriers to international competition and free enterprise and trade. I note that the shadow spokesperson on treasury or finance matters, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), has refused to be drawn into a debate of this kind at all. I find that a great tragedy. There is no doubt whatsoever that a country with 16t million-pushing 17 million-people is not in a position today to create industry or enterprise in many areas of production which are cost effective or technologically competent to. compete with other major producing countnes. Mr Barry Jones-Seventeen, to be fair.",24
28,Mr CLEELAND,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"The Minister says 17 million people. I will accept that. Australia is not in a position now, and will not be in a position in the future, to build video cassette recorders, television sets and much of the high-tech computer gear through to the smaller component areas because we do not have a large enough market to induce the massive investment required of investors going into those production areas. That means that w- are ever more reliant upon importing into thIS country that new technology through co-puters and ?ther electronic equipment. Thl- . country will probably never be in a posl-lon to conduct extremely heavy enginee-Ing or to produce heavy engineering equ.lpm-nt on a cost effective or competitive baSIS wIth overseas suppliers. Frankly, our market is too small; therefore we need to ena?le imports into this co-ntry of the eqUIpment that our industries need and, as honourable members on this side of the House keep saying, we need to look for industries which will on-cost the natural reSOUf,:es a-d the things that we produce so well In thIS country to maximise our profit. An i-teresting debate is occurring now in AustralIa on what degree of government intervention should occur in the marketplace through tariffs and other industry controls as opposed to whether there should be no government intervention in the marketplace at all. I - ust conf-s that I find myself somewhere In the mIddle. I take the view that the-e countries that are importing into AustralIa are the very countries that have the most distorted trade practices against our exports. I do not find that it is necessarily in :,,-ustrali-'s inte-ests, for example, to allow Imports Into thIS country from areas where cost production is distorted or which cause difficulties for our exports into their marketplaces. I think there is a limit to the degree of open marketplaces that Australia should be prepared to tolerate from countries that are not prepared to exercise free trade themselves. Let me digress just slightly on an issue in - he tariff. customs area-that is, the proposed ImportatIOn of pig meat into Australia from Canada. Currently we produce about 300 000 tonnes of pig meat a year. It is a - on­ protected industry and it is open to free mar-e- f?rces. No equalisation program or subsldlsatIon by government is involved in our local pig meat market. Canada wants to have the right to import pig meat into Australia. The Canadians have a stabilisation or equalisation program which, in effect, adds a benefit of about 2.3c per kilogram for its pig producers. In the province of Quebec there IS yet another equalisation program which P!lts a subsidy on Quebec meat producers' pIg meat products. It seems to me that if the Canadians want the right to enter the Australian marketplace, they should be allo-ed to do - o only if they produce pig meat WIthout subSIdy so that they come into this marketplace at a free and open competitive level. If the Canadians cannot do that I believe we have an obligation to our o-n producers and to the Australian marketplace to say that we do not want to reduce our own cost-effective supplies by unfair competition from Canadian pig meat. I - now that - any farmers and pig producers In AustralIa argue that we should not - llow pig meat to enter because of quarantIne. There are concerns that particular viruses present in the pig industry in Canada could damage our own local pig meat industry. I think those arguments are quite fallacious. I believe that the greater argument and the greater concern, which I share with Australian farmers on this issue, is the fact that Canadian pig meat is subsidised. The Americ-ns have recently imposed a bounty on the Import of Canadian pig meat into the American marketplace. The Americans have agreed that the Canadian pig meat is subsidised and, under General Agreement on Tariffs a-d Trade - GATT) arrangements, the Amencans now Impose a bounty on its imP?rt into the U:nited States market. My own vIew-and I will push this view-is that if we are going to allow Canadian imports, 'we should take the same action as the United States Government has taken. Of great pleasure to me in this Bill is the ract that heavy agricultural equipment, which IS not produced in this country, and the parts associated with that heavy agricultural equipment will now be tariff free. That will be a great boon to our Australian farmers, who have after all been the great sufferers of the whole tariff protection system in Australia. It has imposed upon our .farmers a great degree of additional cost on their input side. I am pleased that this Government is moving down the track and reducing that tariff cost to Australian agricultural producstatement, ers. We can never forget that it is our agricultural producers that are still the largest income earners of this country and that are so vital to our economic success in the future. It is a major step, and I trust that the National Farmers Federation will congratulate this Government-after all, it has been pushing for this for a long time-and recognise the major macro-reform and micro-reform which is occurring through this legislation. It is also appropriate in this place to knowledge the work done by the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business ( Mr Barry Jones), and by Senator Button. They are both quiet achievers in many ways. It is not often recognised that the major macro and micro changes occurring through the customs area are of significant value in the economic reform of this country. I congratulate both those Ministers on the work they are doing. We often have our disagreements. As the Minister well knows, I have rather strong views on dumping. I am still not quite satisfied that our dumping legislation is effective and is necessarily doing the job which it should do and which it can do under the GATT agreement. Nevertheless, despite those minor disagreements that occur within government and political systems from time to time, the Minister at the table and Senator Button deserve our respect and congratulations and the respect and congratulations of the Australian people for the work they have done in this area. They are the quiet achievers of government and they have gone a long way down the track to redressing many of the protection problems this country faces and to opening up our marketplaces to more international competition. Before I close, I would like to issue a challenge to the Opposition. If it is really serious about major economic reform and micro-reform, why does it not tear up the document it calls the Economic Action Plan and put some of its policies on the table? It should let the Australian people and industry know where it stands on these major reform areas, instead of running away and refusing to debate in real terms its position on protection. It is time it came out and presented to the Australian public a major economic which statement is not contained in its current policy or documentation. That is the challenge I give to the Opposition-to do ,some work, instead of being lazy, and to produce some policies on this issue.",25
29,Mr BARRY JONES ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Lalor-Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business) (11.25)-1 want to respond to comments made by honourable members who participated in the debate. I thank the honourable member for MCEwen ( Mr Cleeland) for his comments. We have had occasional vigorous acdiscussions about dumping. He is well on the way to being an economic rationalist but not where his own electorate applies, which is true of many members in this place. I want to take up one point about Australia's capability to produce something that can make a significant international contribution in this era of the level playing field, something to which I think even the Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Lionel Bowen) has become a slight convert. In some areas, such as micro-electronics and computers which the honourable member mentioned, it is probably a bit late in the day for Australia to achieve a significant share of the world market. I make the point that, if we look for niche markets and develop a high level of specialisation, it ili possible to make a significant penetration. I have often cited the example of Sweden. I will refrain from citing Sweden this time and give another quite useful example, that of Finland. Finland is a country with only four million people, a very tiny local market and, apart from timber and scenery, not much in the way of natural resources. But it has identified a number of niche areas where it makes a very significant contribution. Prima facie, one would say that it would be ridiculous for a nation such as Finland, with four million people, to be able to compete with the United States of America on telecommunications-the United States with its 260 million people, and having initiated the telephone system back in the nineteenth century and having been regarded as the world leader. When there was a race to see which country would be the first to produce a fully digital telephone exchange, the race was won not by the United States but by Finland. Throughout the European market, and in some parts of North America, pro rata, there is a far higher degree of success from the Finnish company, Data Saab, starting from a very tiny base, than from the United States. The other illustration that often comes to mind is in medical technology. In some cases the most sophisticated machines for assaying samples taken from patients are produced by the Finnish firm Kone. The most sophisticated American assay material can survey about 12 physical qualities in the samples at once. Kone can do as many as 24. It is far in advance of the American capability. At first glance, Finland's lead does not seem to make too much sense. One would think that the Americans would lead in everyone of these areas. In fact, they do not. I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate and wish the Bill a speedy passage. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Barry Jones) read a third time.

30,Mr NA BROWN ,ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT,"Menzies) (11.30)The Courts and Tribunals Administration Amendment Bill 1989 seeks in effect to detach the government from the day-today running of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Federal Court of Australia and the Family Court of Australia and to make the President of the Tribunal and the chief judges of those courts responsible for their administration. As is probably understood by honourable members, the day-today administration and running of those three bodies is the responsibility of the Attorney-General's Department. The view has been expressed, which we accept, that relieving the Attorney-General's Department of its present daily control of these bodies will enhance their efficient and effective operation. Therefore, it should come as no surprise to the House to hear me say that the Opposition supports this Bill. The administrative affairs of the Tribunal will be the responsibility of the President and the administrative affairs of the Federal Court and the Family Court will be the responsibility of the chief judges of those courts. In their work they will be assisted by the Registrar of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Registrar of the Federal Court. The Family Court will have a Chief Executive Officer. The reason for creating this new position to assist in this administrative work is that the Family Court already has registrars and deputy registrars who perform quasi-judicial functions and it is therefore necessary to establish a new position. These three administrative officers will be appointed by the Governor General and will act under the direction of the respective judicial heads of the two courts and the Tribunal respectively. The Bill requires the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the two chief judges of the courts to prepare an annual report on the administrative affairs of the bodies and a financial statement for the previous financial year. Those reports, together with a report by the Auditor-General, will have to be laid before both Houses of the Parliament. Of course, it is appropriate that that be done because the Parliament still has an overriding responsibility, as it must have, for the proper running of the courts and to ensure that they provide to citizens the service that they are expected to provide. The intention is that estimates wm be prepared each year for each of the three bodies but that no expenditure will be made on any of them other than in accordance with estimates that have been approved by the Attorney-General. So the overall financial responsibility will be in the hands of the government as a whole. It will be known that the High Court has for some years had a similar responsibility for managing its own administrative affairs. I have not heard any criticism of that structure since it was set up; it seems to work well. We are confident, therefore, that the proposals under this Bill are worthwhile implementing, at the very least to see how they go. We have been told in the second reading speech that the proposal is supported by the two chief judges and by the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which support is welcome. We support the Bill because we believe the probability is that it will contribute to efficient resource management and flexibility in the administration of these bodies. Having said that, it should also be said that court reform in general is important. The courts are an important part of the structure of our country at both the Federal and State level. They provide vital services for citizens to resolve disputes. It is important that a good and efficient system of justice should be administered through the courts. Unfortunately, when one looks at the whole court structure of Australia, one cannot say that it presently meets that desirable objective. It has traditionally been very difficult to get governments to focus on the importance of court reform and, indeed, to provide the funds that are clearly needed for the proper administration of the courts. It has been written into the mythology of this country that there are no votes in the law, in the courts or in having a more expensive and efficient system of justice administered through the courts. It is very difficult to determine whether that is true. But, irrespective of whether there are any votes in it, the reality is that the courts· playa vital part in our civilisation and it is important that they be properly funded, that there be adequate numbers of judges and that prompt justice be administered for citizens through the courts. To the extent that that is not provided, it is a very severe shortcoming which should be rectified. The second point that should be made is that the present situation is far from satisfactory. One can say without any shadow of doubt that the service provided in the Federal courts is much better than that provided in the State courts. Virtually all of the State courts are jammed with long lists of cases which in many cases take years to come on for hearing. I understand that in the Supreme Court of one of the States one can expect to wait from seven to eight years in some areas for a matter to come to trial. Of course, by that time, if witnesses and parties are not dead, they have certainly forgotten the evidence, which results in an adequate system of justice in which witnesses are expected to· recollect events that happened five, six or seven years ago. Of course, that is not as bad as would be the case if we were to have prosecutions under the War Crimes Act when witnesses would be expected to remember events that occurred 50 years agobut it is bad enough. That situation which exists, unfortunately, in some of the courts, mainly the State courts, really is thoroughly unsatisfactory. One of the reasons that the present system is not working adequately is that the procedures are archaic. It is time that governments in Australia turned their minds to doing whatever they can to ensure that the courts apply modern and efficient systems. Many of the procedures that still apply in the courts were first used hundreds of years ago and have basically not changed. In many cases, they are cumbersome and archaic. They use most peculiar language, which is a foreign language to well over 90 per cent of the population. Those procedures are in urgent need of overhaul. Given that reality, it is really not surprising that people, particularly those in the commercial world, are looking away from the courts to other methods of having their disputes resolved. That is one of the reasons for the rise in arbitration, particularly commercial arbitration. We gave credit to the Government for introducing the Bill on international commercial arbitration, which we still support. It is not really surprising that there is an emerging demand, especially from the commercial community, for modern, swift, efficient methods of alternative dispute resolution when the traditional method of doing it through the courts has become unsatisfactory because of cost, delays and, in many cases, archaic procedures. The question of cost is another and permanent problem in the administration of justice. One of the reasons that the present court system is in many respects unsatisfactory is the great cost involved. In this country one can go to law if one is poor or if one is rich. But, if one is part of the middle class, one has to pay for it oneself, and it is extremely difficult and very costly to litigate. That difficulty means that there is a denial of justice to those citizens, and our whole society suffers. I should say, however, that as to the Federal structure, these days when one makes inquiries about the Family Court, by and large the news is becoming better. One must place on record again the improvements that have taken place in that court under the present Chief Judge, Mr Justice Nicholson. Wherever I go-and, of. course, I move amongst lawyers-I find that there are two things that they say regularly. The first is, 'Do your best to get rid of the present Government'-and I readily accede to their requests in that regard-and the second thing is that the Family Court has got much better in recent times and that the present Chief Judge has introduced a new spirit into the court. There is a life and activity in that court which is very commendable and very good to see. That therefore leads me to say that the problems that I have touched on are not really problems which are at their most apparent and most obvious in the Federal structure. They are basically State court problems. Nevertheless, we should continue to remind ourselves of those sorts of problems, because the Federal Government is responsible for a large section of the judicial structure of this country. The Federal Government is responsible for the largest court in the country, the Family Court, and it is responsible for a wide range of judicial and semi-judicial tribunals. It is timely to remind ourselves that they play a very important part in our society. They must run efficiently, they must have adequate funds and they must have an adequate number of judges to do the job. I conclude by saying that it seems to the Opposition that this Bill is a step in the right direction. It will make the courts themselves responsible for their own administration. The responsibility will be on. them, although of course there will still be an overriding responsibility on the part of the Government and, indeed, on the part of this Parliament. It must be said that we believe that the Bill may well contribute to better resource management in the courts and to flexibility and administration within those bodies themselves. Those people who work within them, of course, being closer to them and closer to their own workings, must know better than anyone else just how a court or tribunal should· be run day-today. The Opposition supports the Bill. We trust that when we see it in full force and effect we will see the benefits of this measure in improved and better administration of the Federal Court, the Family Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.",27
31,Mr SCIACCA ,ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT,"Bowman) (11.43)-1 listened quite intently to the words of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown), and all in all I can say that many of the remarks that he made were very fair and relevant to the intent of the Courts and Tribunals Administration Amendment Bill. I am a little disappointed that the honourable member referr-d to the fact that as he goes around the country talking to lawyers, judges and so forth, they tell him to get rid of this Government.",29
32,Mr NA BROWN ,ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT,Not judges; I didn't say that.,29
33,Mr SCIACCA,ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT,"Not judges; just lawyers, yes. I would not think that judges would be prepared to say that, first, because of the fact that they always try to stay apolitical and, secondly, because I think they would be the first to acknowledge, particularly those in the Federal sphere-in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Family Court or the Federal Court"""":that this Government has done a lot during the three terms that it has been in office to streamline the whole of the judicial system in so far as it relates to matters that come under Federal jurisdiction. I also note that the shadow Attorney General said that governments must consider the question of the whole operation of the administration of jl,lstice in this country. I think that this Government has in fact done that. In the past six or seven years the Attorney-General ( Mr Lionel Bowen) has probably done more in relation to amending legislation and streamlining the administra. tion of justice and the way in which justice is carried on in this country than any other government has ever done. I remember speaking to a number of Bills, particularly relating to the Family Court. The Family Court is now able to dispense justice a lot more quickly. There are now judicial registrars and all sorts of reforms have been undertaken in the Family Court. Even the shadow Attorney-General has acknowledged that these have improved the situation quite dramatically in the Family Court. I acknowledge that probably the present Chief Judge of the Family Court has had a lot to do with making that situation occur. By the same token, he can only work under the laws that exist and under the legislation that is passed by Parliament. The improvements come first of all from us; they come from this Government and from the Attorney-General, who is presently at the table. The Bill obviously deserves support. It is part of the streamlining of the processes so that courts can operate independently and more efficiently. It is' also true to say-and I acknowledge again what the shadow Attorney-General said-that there are really no votes in the law. The law is a mundane sort of thing in many respects which really only lawyers understand. The Attorney General, of course, is a very well regarded lawyer. He understands these matters and therefore many of these reforms have been undertaken not because we want to get votes but because we recognise that the law needs to be reformed in some areas and that access to the law needs to be made easier for people. The reforms that this Government has made in terms of legal aid and other areas I think have been nothing short of magnificent. This is the first time that the Family Court, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court will have their own moneys that they can use. In other words, they will be able to plan their budgets a lot better. At the beginning of this financial year, separate appropriations were made for each of these courts. That can only augur well for the administration of the courts. Now the chief judges of. both courts and the' President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal-via the Chief Executive Officer of the Family Court and the registrars of the Federal Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal-will pick up the responsibilities under this Act. They will now be able to plan better. They will now know exactly what moneys they have available. They will be able to manage their human resources. It will probably also lead to a shortening of delays in cases being heard. The Federal system as it applies at the moment, with all the reforms that we have brought in over the past six years, is probably one of the better systems in terms of the administration of justice in this country. The shadow Attorney-General was correct in saying that there are massive delays in some of the State Supreme Courts. It is true that some of them are of seven or eight years duration. From my experience in the Queensland Supreme Court, it seems that it does not matter how many judges are appointed; there are always continual and very long delays. As one who has practised, particularly in the area of personal injury law, I can say that it is very difficult to explain to people when they come in that their case is on the call-over list and that it is expected to come up in the next 18 months or two years. After one has done all the work, has lodged all the pleadings and done everything that. has needed to be done, the case simply sits in the court waiting for a judge to have time to handle it. Some of the delays are up to two years. In the Federal system that does not occur. The Federal Court of Australia jurisdiction is probably one of the better jurisdictions. People can get there fairly simply and inexpensively. It is inexpensive in so far as what one has to pay to the court. The expensive part of it comes in when one needs to pay the barristers and solicitors. It is mainly the barristers; the solicitors do not get all that much. By the same token, one is able to go to the Federal Court of Australia with a minimum of fuss, whereas with most of the State Supreme Courts there are lengthy delays. Again, I put this down to the fact that the Government has done a lot to reform the Federal jurisdiction, and it is working. Up until perhaps 12 months ago the Family Court of Australia did have a lot of delays. There were very long delays in contested cases, particularly when it came to the question of maintenance, the custody of children and property settlements. Once again, many of these cases are now settled because that jurisdiction has been given the apparatus to settle these matters out of court, and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is in the same situation. In fact, I am often told by my colleagues in myoid legal practice that most of their cases, particularly those relating to veterans affairs' matters, are settled over the telephone. They actually talk over the telephone with the Registrar and the parties get together and many of these matters are settled, once again because the apparatus is there to allow them to do that. That is part of the major reforms that we have been implementing over a long period and no doubt with the prospect of this Government being in power for many years to come they will continue for many years into the future. One point that pleases me is that my State of Queensland-of which Brisbane is the capital, of course-is now the principal registry of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for Australia. 1 want to thank the Attorney-General and those responsible for allowing Brisbane to become the headquarters of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under a very able judge, Mr Justice Hartigan. I am sure, knowing Mr Justice Hartigan, he will be very happy, as will the chief judges of the other two jurisdictions, with the content of this Bill. As I say, they will have a budget, a certain amount of money which will be appropriated to them. Hopefully, they will not be in a position where, because of certain factors, they may run out of money half-way through the year and have to go cap in hand to the Attorney General's Department. They will be able to say to themselves that, because they have an allocation of several million dollars and an average number of cases, they will need so much of this and so much of that and all the rest of it and it will be much simpler for them to plan and budget and know exactly where they are going. As previously stated, I believe also that, even though the delays are fairly minimal in the courts that undertake Federal jurisdiction, the delays that are there. may well be eliminated or at least shortened because of the fact that they will know where they are going and because administratively they will now be in charge of their own affairs. As the shadow Attorney-General said, the High Court of Australia has to a great degree over the past several years had that autonomy and it has now been given to the other courts exercising Federal jurisdiction. I think it has worked well with the High Court. 1 notice that the Bill provides for the High Court of Australia to hand back its power to levy charges-in other words, to set its own court fees. I notice that that will now be done by regulation. Perhaps this is just as well but, by the same token, it has had the power to look after itself administratively, and I accept that it has done that quite well. I do not want to dwell on the other things that the Bill will do, but I point out that it satisfies the Government's intention to confer administrative independence on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the· Family Court of Australia and the Federal Court of Australia. I think that those jurisdictions and the tribunal will be very gratified with this approach. I commend the Attorney-General for what he has done in this respect and I think that it augurs well for the proper and smooth running and reform of these institutions in respect of the Federal jurisdiction.",29
34,Mr JOHNS ,ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT,"Petrie) (11.55)-1 can declare an acute objectivity in this debate because I am not a lawyer but a layman. One might ask why a layman is interested in the administration of the courts, and I have asked myself that question. I have had sufficient contact with the courts, particularly the Family Court of Australia and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is a different beast and I will explain why, as I understand it, in a moment. It strikes me that, firstly, we should recognise that the Family Court of Australia and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) are only 15 years old; they are very new jurisdictions. The intention of the Courts and Tribunals Administration Amendment Bill of financial independence for the Federal Court of Australia, the Family Court of Australia, and· the Administrative Appeals Tribunal does not cap off the matter entirely; it is another step along the way to providing efficiency in the administration of the courts which ultimately brings justice to those people who appear before them. The shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown), spoke about the archaic procedures of the courts. My only recollection in this respect relates to the period when I was working for the Victorian Government some five or six years ago when Jim Kennan was the Victorian Attorney-General. Mr Kennan put out a press release referring to the death of the 'purple gutser'. I had no idea what this was, although it was touted as a great administrative reform in the Victorian courts in those days. It turned out that the purple gutser was the purple roneoed sheet which had been used for 50 years in the Victorian courts to provide the transcript of cases. So, that was the great administrative reform. Of course, I am not belittling that reform, but this was my first introduction to the archaic nature of the administration of some of the courts in the land. As I said, it took until 1983 or 1984 to implement a system within some of the Victorian courts whereby they did not have to rely on some poor person running off roneoed sheets in order to obtain a reasonable transcript of a case for lawyers and barristers to read and check their remarks. The death of the purple gutser was a significant move in the law courts of Victoria only five years ago. Fortunately, our courts, and certainly the Victorian courts, are now far more sophisticated in respect of the way they seek to administer their affairs. In Queensland recently I spoke to the Family Court judge who will be responsible for putting together the budget for the Family Court Australia-wide. He was very excited about this prospect and we were able to talk about it. The prospect for him involves a situation whereby each year he will receive an allocation from the Government's Budget and, while that gives him enormous freedom to run the courts as efficiently as possible, it also imposes an enormoUs discipline because if he goes over budget that is it-he has had it. I think that that sort of discipline has shaken up in a good way the Family Court of Australia. As a result, many of the administrative people and the senior judges are talking about how best they should use their resources'to one end; that is, to get the greatest number of cases decided at the highest quality. To the extent that this reform building on others might achieve that, I congratulate the· Government. The thing about the Family Court is that it is probably the one jurisdiction that most readily comes to mind because people always go there in circumstances which are of their making. A person's marriage breaks down because he or she is fighting with his or her spouse, but they often attach blame to the Family Court. Officers of the Family Court work strenuously towards the resolution of conflict in a marriage breakdown. They use a string of different officers in the Family Court from the judges through to the judicial registrars on the second rung and down to the court counsellors. The Family Court demonstrates more than the other two jurisdictions the need for some administrative flexibility because that court, which is only about 15 years old, has shown that it is possible to bring a softness to very delicate and often emotionally crippling proceedings, giving people the chance to sort out their problems in their own mind. They can separate, divide their property, allocate the care of children, and so on. They are very sensitive matters, and the Family Court of Australia is to be congratulated for the way it has been able to do that. It must also be congratulated in terms of its personnel. To get the judges, judicial registrars and court counsellors-all of whom have very different skills, backgrounds and experiences-to work together is quite an achievement, believe me, because in some ways they should be pulling in different directions. Court counsellors seem to work extremely well in trying to get people initially to reconcile and talk over who should have responsibility for the children and for what periods of time. The judicial registrars might have the responsibility for some of the prehearings in the sense of saying, 'Look, if we can decide outside the court on the division of property, you can save yourself a lot of money.' So, in a sense, the judicial registrar second guesses a decision that a judge would make. Should all these matters not be resolved, people actually end up in court, where they have their day before the judge. To run all of that efficiently takes a great deal of work. I believe that it is a brave and correct move for the Family Court in particular to want financial autonomy and to run its own affairs. Of course, that has nothing to do with the separation of judiCial powers. I am addressBeyond ing purely administrative matters. I now wish briefly to refer to the istrative Appeals Tribunal. As far as I can understand, the administrative tribunal tem is very separate from the courts, which always deal with matters of law. Since the early 1970s, we have decided in this country that decisions of administrators-say, those who are handing out social security or vetpatriation erans' affairs pensions-ought to be reviewdecisions able, not by the Minister, as that is too difficult. There should be a set of rules whereby officers know that they can make decision but that, if they get it wrong, the individual, who may not have got a pension, can have the decision reviewed by a tribunal at no or little cost. Then the correct decision can be made, and maybe the decision individual public servant will be overturned. My small experience in this area was as member of the Veterans' Review Board merits (VRB) for a couple of years. It seemed to me that a discipline was imposed on the first rank decision maker-the person sitting in the Repatriation Commission-who was the first person to decide whether digger X was to get, say, a disability pension. If the person making the first decision got it wrong, the digger was able to go to the Veterans' Relic view Board-a panel of three people-which would decide not the law but simply the merits of the case. Of course, as well as could, we had to apply the law to the facts of a particular case. Largely, that body worked well and got most of its decisions correct. In other words, on occasions we might have affirmed the decision of the son in the Repatriation Commission not to give a pension, and that might have been end of the matter. On the other hand, we could overturn the decision of the person the Repatriation Commission and say, 'No, you were wrong in applying the law or rules to the merits of this individual digger's case; the pension should be granted.' The digger would then go away happy. If the digger was still unhappy he could appeal again to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, which is the most senior adminisand trative tribunal in the Commonwealth. It is not a court, since it does not make decisions on the law. It applies the facts or the merits of the case to the law as it is handed to it. that, if one is still unhappy and wants to appeal against a decision of the AdminAAT, one goes to the Federal Court. It is a sign of maturity of administration sysas such in government where we can have a set of tribunals that oversee the individual decisions of public servants. To the extent that those decisions are explained, the public servant has a guide. The person in the ReCommission can begin to read the of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and of the Veterans' Review Board in an effort to get decisions right in future a cases. Such a person may think, 'I have been knocking out too many diggers by forbidding them to have a pension, but if I read these cases I have some idea as to how I JIlake a decision about whether or not to grant a of an disability pension.' Thus, the effect of the Tribunal is educaa tive, not just to decide right or wrong or the of a case. Its purpose also is to tell those further down the line, 'This is how you should decide cases X, Y and Z.' It is saying, in effect, 'Apply your own thoughts to the matter but have a look at these decisions as guides.' We have found that, largely, that works well and that process begins to lower the cost of decision-making. If the first pubservant deciding a case about who should or should not get a pension gets it right most of the time, the cost to the whole system we falls dramatically, because there are not thousands of appeals· drifting through from the VRB to the AA T, to the courts and so on. We have found that this process works and largely, during the past 10 years, we perhave been getting it right more often. The quality of decision-making at the in the itial stage is improving. We do not have people now who just look at the departmenin tal handbook and who know the Act backwards. They also have cases that they can the knock around and decide whether or not they are applying a given rule to a particular case. That seems to me to be an excellent practice in terms of getting a quality primary decision made. The fact about administrative appeals or tribunals is that they tend to deal are most useful in dealing in high bulk areas, such as tens of thousands of veterans, Department of Social Security pensioners or whatever. We could not possibly have that number of cases going through the court. It is an expensive proposition for the individual. The courts are essential, but once a person has to pay experts to go there and put a case the tariff is fairly high. The notion of the tribunals is that one can go there as an individual. One can have someone hold one's hand and help to put the case but one does not pay a legally trained person. That is a good situation. It does not mean that one is denied the abilities of a lawyer, as a lawyer can write the case, but one goes before the tribunal as an individual to talk about the merits of one's case. One goes there without cost and without prejudice and knowing that if one is still not happy with the decision one can go up to the next rung. Largely, there is a sort of trickle up effect; very few cases get to the third rung of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal because generally the decisions at the lower level are getting more and more accurate. That is saving money. 1 leave my remarks there. 1 congratulate the Attorney-General and the Government on these further reforms to administration. As a layman, 1 can see the benefits of these reforms, which build on major changes to our court and tribunal systems that have been built in only the past 15 years. The Family Court and the AAT have been with us only a short time. The whole notion of administrative tribunals and the review of administrative decisions has been with us only in the last decade and a half. We should be proud of those achievements.",31
35,Mr KERR ,ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT,"Denison) (12.18)-1 believe that both sides of the Parliament should welcome the measures before the House today. They are to be welcomed because they give a greater emphasis to the need for efficient administration of the affairs of the courts. has been one of the scandals of the judicial system from time immemorial that delays and inefficiencies seem inherently part of the process. As a practitioner of the High Court and of the courts in Tasmania and other jurisdictions, 1I have become aware from time to time of injustices occurring to individuals because their cases have not proceeded expeditiously or because the administration of the judicial process has been unsatisfactory. Almost every practitioner in Australia would be able to recount one or two instances of this type. They are usually exceptions to the rule; nonetheless, they occur often enough for us to be very concerned. This is not a new phenomenon; it was a dramatic theme of Charles Dickens and writers in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in Great Britain. Novels such as Bleak House dealt with the long delays in justice being delivered. One of the problems in the legal system in this country is that there is no proper process to train those who administer justice. Judges are appointed because of their competenceand skills as practitioners-as lawyers. Although one may be a leader of the Bar and capable of the most extraordinary skills of mental agility when presenting a case on behalf of a client and because of those skills be a competent, fair-minded and impartial adjudicator, there is no reason to expect that such a person will naturally be a skilled and well-trained administrator. Unfortunately, the proof of the pudding has too often been in the eating and persons who have considerable skills and eminence within the legal profession are, in fact, the most appalling administrators. They have demonstrated that, unfortunately, to the disadvantage of litigants. 1 know this is a matter that the Attorney General ( Mr Lionel Bowen) has been very concerned about, not just for the simple dollars and cents reason that obviously court delays often lead to calls for more appointments of judges and more judicial officers and, therefore, increase the cost of the delivery of judicial services, but from the point of view of a genuine concern about the well-being of those of the Australian public who want to be able to go to a court or tribunal without delay and without the prospect of It their case being adjourned three or four times because the papers, or the judges, are not in a position to proceed. It is bad enough, of course, that quite frequently lawyers are not in a position to proceed, but when the court itself is responsible for delay then naturally there is a sense of grievance created. How does one go about changing a system which has been bedevilled by these kinds of problems for so long? The first thing to do is give responsibility to those within the system because, if we do not give responsibility, we can hardly expect accountability. Secondly, we must make sure that there are those who have skills and the training within the system to effectively administer the judicial system. This measure that the Attorney-General has placed before the House achieves both objectives. Firstly, it gives responsibility for administration to the courts through their chief justices and, in the case of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, through the President of the Tribunal. I mention in passing that it may have been thought that a more appropriate mechanism to have adopted would have been a collegiate system such as applies in the High Court of Australia and in the Supreme Court of the United States of America. However, I can understand that process being rejected for the larger courts, particularly the Family Court, which is sq large that a process of collegiate management would be out of the question simply because of the scale of the operation. Nonetheless, I hope that in the carriage of their responsibilities the chief tices and the President bear in mind that good administration will involve carrying the rest of their court or tribunal with them, and that that process should involve extensive consultations with their brother judges. Perhaps that expression is now passe and one should not use such language. I should say their 'colleagues', rather than their 'brother judges', which suggests a sexual composition of the court which hopefully is no longer as it once was. Thus, we give responsibility to the judges; we give them the power to manage their own affairs. Therefore, in turn; we can require of them some accountability and expect them to look to the performance of their functions as being not only impartial and fair but also efficient and effective. Secondly, we ensure that we are not just making a . token gesture and giving administrative responsibility to untrained personnel by constituting statutory officers with the expectation that those persons will have the background, training and skills necessary to administer large organisations. In each instance, with the tribunal and the two courtsthe Federal Court and the Family Court of Australia-under the President or the chief justices are the positions of Registrar and Chief Executive Officer, who will be expected to carry out the day-today administration of the court system under the direction of the chief justices or the President. The Bill provides measures that ensure that those new· responsibilities are vested in officers who have both appropriate legal powers to exercise their functions and the appropriate administrative training to carry out their major functions. We really do now have an obligation to see not only that fairness is achieved in any judicial process but also that delay is avoided, inefficiency is rooted out of the system and the kind of indifference to litigants' convenience which so often irritates outsiders in the legal system is abolished. These measures should be welcomed not only by practising lawyers but also by political parties on both sides of the House. I am sure that the Attorney-General has found that that has been the response to these measures. It certainly is very pleasing that justhe courts and tribunals themselves are prepared to accept this additional responsibility. It would be a cheap jibe to make of tribunals and courts that they are not as efficient as they ought to be, if one is not prepared to give the responsibility to the tribunals themselves to ensure that they have the management techniques and the powers to respond to the legitimate concerns that the community raises. There are, no doubt, areas in the administration of justice in Australia which can be much improved. Some elements of the Federal Court system are models of efficiency, courtesy and good management. In other cases, it would be fair to say, there have been quite substantial criticisms from the profession of the conduct of registries, the failure to provide efficient retrieval systems of information to the courts, the failure of listing systems to ensure that matters get on promptly, and the lack of a system to ensure that, if matters fall off the list for one reason or another, other matters are lined up ready to take their place so there is no wasted court time. In all those matters the transfer of responsibility to the courts should allow for heightened expectations about what the court system will deliver, and for the expectation of the courts that they will play their parts in making sure that there is a more efficient and effective judicial mend the Bill to the House.",34
36,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT,"Kingsford Smith-At torney-General) (12.20)-in reply-I thank honourable members for their support. The honourable member for Menzies ( Mr N. A. Brown), who led for the Opposition, indicated that the Opposition supported the Courts and Tribunals Administration Amendment Bill. My colleagues the honourable member for Bowman ( Mr Sciacca), the honourable member for Petrie ( Mr Johns) and the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Kerr) also made very worthwhile contributions. Without delaying the House, I just make the point that this is an innovative measure. It gives all the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal independence, their own budget, the opportunity for self-management and the responsibility of public accountability. It add to the efficiency of the courts and certainly help the administration of justice. A couple of points were raised during the course of the debate. I welcome the praise of the courts and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That in itself is a tribute to the courts, particularly their leadership. The High Court of Australia has its own budget and it has had to meet its requirements within a relatively difficult budget period. I thank Sir Anthony Mason and the judges for their cooperation. The Federal Court is recognised as being a most efficient court, which it is. Again, my thanks to Sir Nigel Bowen and his team for the excellent work that they are doing. People can think of ways to criticise the Family Court of Australia. This most difficult jurisdiction now has almost 60 judges. Last year about 47,000 divorce applications were lodged. One can see the spin-off that would relate to. that sort of work. The court has had its ups an downs and it still has its difficulties in terms of getting every part of Australia up to a required efficiency. I pay tribute to Chief Justice Alistair Nicholson and his able assistant, Mr Justice Barblett, and the team, who are continuing to look at this area. They started off 15 years ago with inadequate premises and that has bedevilled them. We are still trying to find adequate capital to re-house them properly. But we system. I com- are getting there. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal is an outstanding success. The Tribunal inherited from the board of appeal 97,000 taxation cases that were not able to be dealt with. The total is now down to a mere fraction of that number. Mr Justice Hartigan and his team have immensely reduced delays. This is a most efficient method of dealing with justice and I thank the honourable member for Petrie for his recognition of that fact. There has been a substantial amount of praise for· this legislation. At present we are still discussing judicial salaries. I hope that they will be dealt with in the Senate tomorrow and that the Bill will be passed. This will lead to some amelioration of the problem. The judiciary and the legal profession play a substantial part in the administration will of justice in this country and are a bulwark of democracy. There will be many disgruntled people if we cannot deal with delays in the courts. In recent times it has often been thought that economists run the country. No doubt they do, but their remuneration seems to be getting well in excess of that paid to the judiciary. Whilst I can understand the reasons for it, I note that these learned people in economics have to have other people representing them when they go to court. It is from that group that we select the judiciary. In recent legislation, which was properly supported by the Opposition, we were able to increase the remuneration of the Family Court judges to what is deemed to be a reasonable amount. In other words, the Executive itself has had to top up their remuneration over and above what had been determined by a tribunal. The judges will always be anxious to offer their services, as they have over a period of years. But it is fair that they get adequate recognition for what they have done. This Bill gives them an opportunity to administer their own judicial areas to the benefit of Australia at large. When comparing our jurisdictions with others in the world, we have nothing to be frightened of. We do have the difficulties of delays and increased pressures on the courts but the legal profession is certainly pulling its weight, and I thank it for that. Question resolved in the affirmative.

TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT - ILL (No.5) 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 2 November, on EmptyHere That the Bill be now read a second time.",36
37,Dr HEWSON ,ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT,"Wentworth) (12.26)-The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1989 has very little to do with tax administration or· tax reform. It has much more to do with issues such as arrogance, ego, ignorance, confrontation and government greed. The key elements of this Bill are some decisions which I described as fairly draconian the day after the Budget where they were announced. Basically they amount. to the rape of the corporate sector, in particular the small and medium sized business sector. It was decided to bring forward the payment of tax into this financial year. As I said, this legislation really has nothing to do with tax administration. Sure, it has been dressed up in the name of tax equity, but it has nothing to do with tax administration. It has much more to do with the arrogance of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), his ego and his desire to fudge his fiscal record. He wanted the Budget surplus this year to look better than it otherwise was going to be. Honourable members can just imagine the meetings that took place in his office or in the Treasury as he called in the guys and said, 'I'm stuck. I need nearly $1 billion more to make this surplus look respectable'. Honourable. members can imagine them going through the various ideas and hitting on the idea of bringing forward the payment of corporate tax, of hitting a few large companies by bringing forward that payment into this year with the practical effect of nearly $900m of corporate tax revenue, which would otherwise have been collected next year, being brought into this year. It was contrivance; it was a sleight of hand to make the Budget surplus look better. But if passedand we will be seeking to amend the legislation in a number of important respects-this Bill will have draconian effects on small and medium sized business. The legislation is confrontationist because there was no consultation in the development of this and other sections of the Bill, particularly the decisions in relation to the introduction of a self-assessment procedure for the corporate sector. It is just fundamentally wrong to make those sorts of changes without consultation in an area as important . as that, where there is already an enormous amount of criticism about tax administration and the exercise of discretion by the Commissioner of Taxation. This Bill reveals, as have a number of other decisions, the Treasurer's true colours when it comes to tax. I mentioned the con. cept of government greed and his colours are well established in this respect. He has collected, for example, $13! billion net out of bracket creep over the life of the HawkeKeating Government. That is, over and above the tax cuts this Government has given, the Government has collected $13! billion simply because people have been pushed into higher tax brackets as a result of inflation impacting on their income. As a consequence, there has been a substantial blowout in the public sector. In our Economic Action Plan we have given a commitment to hand back bracket creep annually. The Treasurer keeps ducking and refusing to give a similar commitment. Secondly, one could look at the superannuation decision that was brought in this year after the worse handling of any tax legislation in the history of this country. The fundamental desire behind that legislation was to bring forward the payment of tax in relation to the superannuation industry, much the same sort of motivation as underlies the key elements of this Bill. The Treasurer parades the country-indeed, he is now parading the world-lecturing everybody about what they are doing wrong and how they can fix their systems. He dresses up what he has done in the concept of a level playing field. But he puts his own potholes in his own playing field to look after his mates. The union movement is not hit by these tax changes. It is exempted from the capital gains tax. Canteen lunches did not get caught by the fringe benefits tax. I could go on. The Treasurer looks after his mates and parades in the cloak of tax equity. There is no tax equity in this legislation. As I say, it is all about Government greed. It might give the Treasurer a warm inner glow to know that his Budget surplus is $900m bigger than it otherwise would have been but it 'will send thousands of small to medium sized businesses to the wall. In making the decision that he has made on this Bill, the Treasurer has revealed an acute ignorance of the current plight of small business, Small to medium sized businesses are out there today struggling under the burden of 21 to 25 per cent interest ratesrecord level interest rates which, in themselves, are enough to send a lot bf those businesses out backwards. Not many businesses in this country can earn the rates of return over a sustained period that would justify paying interest rates at that sort of level. Only a third of the top 500 companies in this country earn more than the long term bond rate on shareholders' funds. This is a ludicrous position to put the small business community in. Small businesses are fighting those interest rates at a time when there is a very tough liquidity squeeze on them. They are facing the prospect next year, as a direct result of this Government's high interest rate policy, of a substantial slow-down in the demand for what they produce. Indeed, the bottom line, as revealed by a number of people, could be a recession next year. There will still be high interest rates then because the Government has no solution to the· balance of payments, inflation and debt problems. The liquidity squeeze will still be on. The prospect of a downturn will grow. The Government has made some wonderful decisions in relation to small business taxation. The capital gains tax to which business is subject-Mr Smith-They hate small business.",37
38,Dr HEWSON,ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT,"They do hate small business. The capital gains tax has removed the incentive to start a small business, to expand a small business, to take in a partner, to inject capital or to liquidate the business at which time one is basically subject to double tax at top marginal tax rates. It is little wonder that the number of corporate failures and personal bankruptcies is now approaching record levels. Next year the large companies, many of which include the mates of this Government, will make record level profits over and above the record level profits they made this year. At the same time we will have record numbers of small business failures and personal bankruptcies. That is the bottom line of this Government when it comes to issues of economic management and taxation. So there is a total insensitivity on the part of the Treasurer to the difficulties that he was imposing on small and medium sized business simply because of his ego and his arrogance. He wants his Budget surplus to be bigger than it was the year before; so he dresses it up and slams the corporate sector, the small and medium sized business sector in particular, to the wall. We will not be opposing this Bill but we will be amending it in a number of important respects. We will be amending it in relation to the decision to bring forward corporate tax, to the direct benefit of small to medium sized businesses. We will oppose the provisions of the Bill in relation to self-assessment. It is ill-conceived, it is undeveloped and it is not appropriate that it is being introduced in this way where it significantly reduces the protection that is afforded taxpayers and increases the discretion granted to the Commissioner. In the context of a decision to bring forward the payment of company tax, the selfassessment provision could be a double whammy. The corporate sector, struggling to meet the burdens of increased tax, suddenly gets hit with a self-assessment system which leaves it particularly exposed and' significantly reduces the protection it has previously enjoyed in relation to disclosure and dealings with the tax administration. So we oppose the provisions of the Bill in relation to self-assessment. We do not like this legislation at all. We undertake firmly to review the key elements of this legislation in government. We cannot accept the concept of bringing forward the payment of corporate tax. We cannot accept the nature of the self-assessment provisions. The whole Bill, in those important respects at least, will be reviewed when we gain government. Unfortunately, in opposition we do not have enough information to be able to accurately cost and determine the impact on the small and medium sized business community as a result of these decisions but, importantly, the decision to bring forward corporate tax will result in a substantial increase in the borrowing costs of the business sector because where else will a small business find the money to pay its tax in current circumstances unless it borrows that additional money? It will be forced to borrow that additional money at interest rates of 21 to 25 per cent. An unbelievable, inconsiderate burden has been added to that community as a result of these changes. Mr Smith-Keating's arrogance, isn't it?",38
39,Dr HEWSON,ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT,"All to placate the Treasurer's arrogance. Let me make comments about three parts of the Bill: firstly, the decision to bring forward the payment of corporate tax; secondly, the self-assessment procedures; and, thirdly, a very good feature of the Bill, which is the decision to allow the deductability of costs incurred by taxpayers in connection with the management or administration of their income tax affairs. The company tax collection arrangement was announced, as I say, in the Budget. The Treasurer said that companies, complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts would be required to pay their company tax in two instalments each year. That is, instead of paying company tax in four instalments throughout the year, they would be allowed to pay those company tax instalments only twice during the year. Eighty-five per cent of the notional tax liability would be required 15 days after the end of their income year and late balancing companies would continue to be treated as though they were balanced in June. The second and final payment would be self-assessed and would be made on the fifteenth day of the ninth month following the balance day. Penalties modelled on those currently applicable where the taxpayer varies instalments were to apply where the actual liability was underestimated by more than 10 per cent. Those arrangements were widely condemned by the corporate sector. I remember that the day after the Budget was announced I referred to this as the rape of the corporate sector. The Treasurer laughed. He thought it was a great joke. The laugh is now on the other side of his face because the business sector en masse, but particularly the small to medium sized business sector, turned up the heat on this Government over that decision. In particular, it drew attention to some of the real weaknesses of the Bill, not only the decision to bring forward the payment of tax but also the fact that some companies would be put in the position of paying 85 per cent of their tax liability several months before the end of their financial year. Companies have enough trouble determining their tax liabilities well after the end of their financial year. But the idea of requiring them to pay 85 per cent of their tax before the end of their financial year was anathema to most people in the business and reveals the basic fact that the Government has absolutely no idea how to run a business. It has no idea what it is like to be in business, to try to determine one's accounts and to be subject to penalties if one is wrong by more than 10 per cent. Obviously that was not considered. It was all about ego and arrogance. It had nothing to do with what was the appropriate way to run a system of corporate tax collection. The Treasurer said that he would gain from this decision $885m in 1989-90 and a further $150m in 1990-91 and 1991-92. There would be significant savings of public debt interest to the extent of $330m as a continuing saving from 1990-91. As a result of the pressure, the Treasurer backed down in two respects in drafting this legislation on the back of that Budget time decision. Firstly, he changed his mind about late balancing companies. They will not be treated as if they balanced in June for tax collection purposes. In effect, that did away with the problem that companies could get caught having to pay 85 per cent of their tax liability before the end of the financial year. Secondly, he identified some small companies which were to be exempted from the original decision. The exemption is that on a tax payable of $20,000 or less they would not be required to make the initial 85 per cent payment on the fifteenth day of the month following balance date. Such companies would be able to elect to defer that payment until the fifteenth day of the sixth month following balance date when the total self-assessed payment would fall due. That is a bow in the direction of the small business community, but it does not go anywhere near far enough. One of our amendments will involve increasing the limit from $20,000 tax payable to $80,000 tax payable. That is, the taxable income threshold would rise from around $51,000 to around $200,000. We think that is fundamentally important in dealing with the small to medium size business sector in Australia. The latest published statistic suggests that about 90 per cent of companies paying tax have a taxable income up to $200,000 but pay only 10 per cent of the total corporate tax that is collected. We strongly urge this amendment, which is to raise that threshold and exempt the small business sector. I foreshadow that, under the brutal restraint of the guillotine, I will try to move several committee stage amendments which specifically deal with our changes. I now move, as a second reading amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) recognising the plight of small businesses in Australia, calls on the Government to increase substantially the threshold at which the new two instalment company tax arrangements will apply; (2) rejects the Government's proposals on selfassessment of company tax because of the inadequate safeguards and protection of the integrity of taxpayers; and (3) condemns the Government for its flagrant disregard in its taxation policies of the circumstances faced by many small businesses in Australia"". To summarise in the minute that I have remaining, our position is that this Bill has nothing to do with tax administration; it is principally designed to make the Treasurer's Budget surplus look better, to satisfy his ego by contriving the size of the Budget surplus, but at the substantial detriment of the small to medium size business sector, which is being asked to pay its tax unjustifiably early. Out of concern for the draconian decision that has been taken in that respect, we are moving amendments to remove the impact of this tax from the small business sector particularly on companies with taxable incomes up to $200,000. We are also opposing the provisions of the Bill for self-assessment. Not only is the legislation shoddy, but also it will result iIi a significant reduction in protection afforded taxpayers and will significantly increase the discretion granted to the Commissioner of Taxation in that respect. It will also-this is perhaps the most important feature of that-have an impact that could well be a double whammy on the small to medium size business sector. That is, over and above bringing forward company tax for these companies, they could run into real difficulties in relation to the procedures outlined in the Bill for self-assessment. As I say, we do not like this legislation and we undertake to review it in government. We would meet the cost of our decision to increase these thresholds this year by reversing the Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd decision and by terminating the payment of compensation for the airline industry. We do not mind taking from large Australian companies or foreign companies to fund our deficit.",39

41,Deus ex machina,ADMINISTRATION AMENDMENT,"Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2 p.m. NA NA EmptyHere to the Prime Minister. I refer him to a question I directed to him in this House on 1 March this year concerning his promise in January this year, prior to the Western Australian election, that home loan interest rates would not rise further this year. I ask him whether he recalls that he responded to my question in the following terms: I am quite confident that the answer that I gave thenthat is, prior to the Western Australian electionwas correct and that, by the end of this year, theythat is, home loan interest rateswill fall. Does he still stand by this answer to the Parliament?",40
42,Mr HAWKE,HOME LOAN INTEREST RATES,"The Leader of the Opposition has come back to this issue a number of times. I am quite happy, in terms of questions or answers or any motion that the Leader of the Opposition would like to move, to argue with him on the· question of the conduct of economic policy in general, the outcome and level of interest rates under the policies of this Government and any alternatives that he would implement. The statement. I made then was made on the basis of the assessment we had of what was going to happen to the level of activity in this country. As most commentators within the Government and within the private sector would acknowledge, the economic activity in this country has continued at a significantly higher level than was expected. That being the case, the requirement of responsible economic management was to ensure that all arms economic policy were kept appropriately to ensure that we would not inflict upon this country the economic disasters that the Opof position inflicted upon it when it was last in office. That required the three arms of policy to be tight. For the edification of the Leader of the Opposition I will remind him what those three arms of policy are. I refer firstly fiscal policy. I go to fiscal and wages policy because there is some implicit suggestion the sort of nonsense that has been talked about from the other side of the House that there is some exclusive reliance upon m()newere tary policy in conducting economic managethey ment in this country. Of course, the opposite is true. Let us look first at fiscal policy. Never in the records of this country has fiscal policy been as tight as it is now. Opposition members-Ha, hal",41
43,Mr HAWKE,HOME LOAN INTEREST RATES,"The laughter of honourable members opposite is no substitute for analysis. Let me give them the proof and, they have the ability afterwards, they try to refute the facts and substitute their hollow laughter. Very simply, the facts are these: In terms of establishing the tightness of fiscal policy, for four successive years now real Commonwealth outlays have declined. Commonwealth outlays as a percentage of gross domestic product are now at 23.7 per cent, which is back to the level of the early 1970s. The public sector borrowing requirement has turned around by 8.1 percentage points. As a result of the massive turnaround that we have brought about in this country-the exact symmetry, if you like, turning around the previous Government's $9 billion deficit to a surplus of $9 billion-we now have a public sector borrowing requirement in surplus which, in annual terms, means a contribution of $30 billion per annum on that score. So on the record-honourable members opposite can argue the facts if they like; they will not get anywhere-fiscal policy is tighter than it has ever been before. I turn now to wages policy. If honourable members opposite study the facts they will find that there has been an 11.2 per cent reduction in real unit labour costs, never of before equalled and certainly not aptight proached by them. The contribution of honourable members opposite, in the absence a wages policy, was to have a 17 per cent wages blow-out in 1981-82, which brought the worse recession in this country in 50 years. It is against the background of the tightest fiscal policy and the tightest wages policy that we are also relying on monetary to policy. But even under that monetary policy we have not managed to reach the high level in of 90-day rates the previous Government reached in April 1982, when its 90-day rates 22 per cent. Under this Government are now 18 per cent; they were 4 per cent higher under the previous Government. This Government is responsibly doing what the previous Government was never able to do because it never had a wages policy. All arms of economic policy-fiscal, wages and monetary-are at the necessary level of tightness to ensure that what happened to if this country under the irresponsible ecocan nomic management of those opposite will that for never happen again.

46,Mr JOHNS,PUBLIC HOSPITAL CHARGES,Has the Federal Government opposed-Mr Tim Fischer-What about Bob Bell?,42
47,Mr JOHNS,PUBLIC HOSPITAL CHARGES,The honourable member should go back to' Four Corners. Has the Federal Government opposed the massive October increase in charges for private patients in public hospitals in Queensland? Why has the Federal Government taken this stand and what results have flowed from its actions?,42
48,Dr BLEWETT,PUBLIC HOSPITAL CHARGES,"I thank the honourable member for Petrie for his question, which shows a real interest in both the physical and the financial hardships imposed on Queenslanders, particularly people with private health insurance. I think all honourable members will recall, because I spoke on this matter some weeks ago, that the National Party Government in Queensland, following the pattern of its conservative colleagues in New South Wales, massively increased the charges for private patients in public hospitals from 1 October. The increase was of the order of $150 to $170 per day-a rise of 13 per cent, which is twice the rate of inflation and, in fact, the second such increase in the last 12 months. Indeed, the full effect of those Queensland changes over the last 12 months has been a 30 per cent or $40 per day rise. Of course, the Federal Government opposed increases of this order not only because of their effect on inflation in this country but also because of the impact they would have on private health contribution rates. They would have significantly forced up those rates. We offered to the Queensland Government what we believed was a fair compromise to accept a bed day charge of $160 a day and asked the Queensland Government to accept that as fair and reasonable. Unfortunately, the National Party Cabinei rejected our offer, went. ahead with the increase and imposed a $10 out-of-pocket levy on privately insured patients in public hospitals. That was a mean and miserable tax on the ill and injured and it has caused particular hardship to old and chronically ill Queenslanders, who are high users of hospital services. ' The Queensland public hospital system and the private health funds in Queensland protested to the Queensland Government. We heard not a sound or a squeak out of the Federal Opposition, which is supposed to be interested in these matters, but there was considerable pressure on the Queensland Government. Even when the New South Wales Government saw sense, changed its policy' and abolished the out-of-pocket levy, the Queensland National Party went on with its measure and continued to impose this . charge. Of course, as one might have expected, the electoral collapse of the National Party in Queensland has forced a rethink. I predicted in this House three weeks ago that a Goss-Ied Labor Government in Queensland would abolish the out-of-pocket payment when elected to office, and Wayne Goss made that promise clearly in a statement this week. Almost immediately the white flag appeared from the National Party Cabinet. I understand that the Cabinet, in a last desperate bid to win votes, has reduced those private bed day charges to $160. I say I understand that to be the case because the Queensland Government is often slow in telling the Queensland people what it has done. But I understand that that decision has been made. If so, the Queensland Government has accepted the compromise we offered two months ago and what Wayne Goss has promised. So I think it is a victory for common sense for people in Queensland with private health insurance but I think it will do little to save the Cooper Government. NA EmptyHere to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister that, only a few minutes ago, in answer to a question I asked him about his statement earlier this year that interest rates would fall, made during the Western Australian State election, he said that that comment was made on the basis of advice available at the time. I remind the Prime Minister that, earlier this year when being questioned on this issue and when asked on whose advice he made the claim in Western Australia and what it was based on, he replied to the eff-ct that he had taken - o advice but that It was based, as I recall It, on his 'considerable intellect', or words to that effect. Without questioning the extent of that intellect, which was quite clearly wrong, I ask: What is true? Was it on the basis of advice or was it just a gambit in the election campaign? Mr HAWKEIf in this Question Time we were going to get into the area of gambits at election time, I could take a considerable amount of time exposing the impossible gambits of those opposite and their beleaguered colleagues in South Australia and Queensland. Much as I am tempted to get into that area, I will exercise the restraint for which am very well known. I, as distinct from the Leader of the Opposition, when it comes to matters economic have the great advantage. As well as having advice available to me I have the capacity, as a result of my training and my application-neither of which he has-to understand that advice and also to form my own opinions within the range of the advice I get. There is no dichotomy between the fact that I can come to judgments myself on a range of advice and on my own reading of the situation and on what is being said by those advising. There is no dichotomy. One day, if the Leader of the Opposition applies himself a bit more assiduously to the study of economics than he ever has in his generation in public life, he may begin to understand these things.

49,Mr SNOWDON,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and it relates to Aboriginal education and funding for Aboriginal education. Can the Minister inform the House of progress in the Government's campaign to improve the access to education of Aboriginal people, who by any measure can be regarded as the most disadvantaged· of all Australians?",43
50,Mr DAWKINS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"I thank the honour-ble member for his question and in doing so acknowledge his very particular interest in this area, recognising that it bears upon the future of a very large proportion of the electors in his constituency. The Government has made extraordinary progress in improving the educational opportunities of Aboriginal people. If we take the period from 1982 to 1988, we find that Aboriginal school enrolments have risen by 28 per cent, Aboriginal retention rates to year 12 have risen by 126 per cent, and Aboriginal tertiary enrolments have more than doubled. From a handful a decade ago, there are now over 1,000 Aboriginal graduates from higher education institutions in this country. Despite that very significant improvement that we have seen over the years, we recognise that we have a considerable distance to go. If we try to measure the extent of lack of opportunity for Aboriginal people, we find that one in eight Aboriginal children beI tween the ages of five and nine years have never attended school. Eleven per cent of all Aboriginal people 15 years and over have never attended school. Only 30 per cent of 16to 19-year-old Aboriginals are participating in formal education or training compared with the national average for the same age group of some 75 per cent. It was with those figures in mind-with the understanding that we had a fair distance to go-that the Government decided to launch an Aboriginal education policy which proceeded from very substantial consultation with the Aboriginal communities and those who have had a long time interest in improving Aboriginal education policy. What we have decided to set as our objectives for this policy is to ensure that there is greater Aboriginal involvement in policy-making for education issues. We also want to ensure that there is equity of access to education. We wish to raise Aboriginal participation rates to those for all Australians, and we want to achieve equitable and appropriate educational outcomes to ensure that Aboriginal people have a full opportunity to participate in all the areas of education and training with a view to improving their prospects in employment as well. We have provided new funds to support this program as well as reviewed the way in .which existing funds have been expended. We hope that over the next few weeks and months we will be able to work with the States in developing appropriate policies and appropriate programs to assist the circumstances of Aboriginal people, whether they live in some of the more remote locations in the country, such as some of the small outstations in the honourable member's electorate, or they live in metropolitan locations. I should make the point, particularly in the context of the Northern Territory, that the Northern Territory Minister for Education should not for a moment think that this provides him with an opportunity to shirk his own responsibilities as far as the education of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory is concerned. The Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory and their education are just as much a responsibility of the Northern Territory Government as is the education of anyone else who lives in the Northern Territory. Our approach is a preparedness to work with them and to improve the programs in the Northern Territory and elsewhere. I do not take too kindly to the suggestion from the Northern Territory Minister that somehow we are not doing enough in the face of this major expansion of funds. I also find it a little hypocritical that should say that we are not spending enough when, if he were to view the policies of his mates on the other side of the House, he would see that they have a quite specific policy of reducing fu-ds for Aboriginal programs generally. They wish to slash some $lOOm from the funds which support Aboriginal people across the areas of education, training and general community welfare. What I find particularly gutless as far as the Opposition is concerned is that that would mean that there would not be an additional dollar-in fact, there would be cuts-in funds to support Aboriginal education. Notwithstanding the fact that those opposite have promised to gut this program which we are introducing, they supported the legislation which included the appropriations to find this money. In other words, they do not have the guts to stand up now and say that one of the consequences of their policy of cutting funds for Aboriginal programs would be that this policy of the Government would not proceed were they to be elected. They sit back trying to bask in the reflected glory of our policy by saying that they put their hands up for it. When it came to this Parliament, they did not have the courage to vote against it, as was their real intention, because this is a program which cannot proceed under the Opposition. I think this issue, like many other issues, displays that it is only a Labor government that is entitled to govern for all the people. It is only a Labor government that is prepared to put the needs of people in the community, however impoverished they might be, ahead of the interests of the rich and powerful who are so close to the Opposition and who are so directly involved in producing its policies. It is only a Labor government that can do something about improving the circumstances of those who are worse off in the community, including Aboriginal Australians. NA",43

58,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"I do not think even the Leader of the National Party would contradict what I was about to say. I was about to say that I have the advantage over the Leader of the National Party that I was invited this morning to open the national conference of the National Farmers Federation. It invited me-not, surprisingly, the Leader of the National Party-to open its conference. I felt a certain amount of pride at three points of this morning's exercise. Mr L1oyd-I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. Despite the Prime Minister's pride in relation to the National Farmers Federation, he complained bitterly about its presenting a petition. EmptyHere",45
59,Mr SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will cease interjecting.,45
60,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"First of all, I was, of course, proud that the National Farmers Federation invited me to open its conference. Secondly, I was very proud of the laudatory comments that were made by Mr John Allwright, the President of the National Farmers Federation, when he introduced me. It is true that the Federation· expressed concern about the level of interest rates.",45

62,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"If just for once those on the opposite side of the House would put the whole story instead of part of the story, they would recognise two things: firstly, Mr Allwright expressed considerable gratitude to the Government for many aspects of its policy. Secondly, in thanking me .at the end of my speech, Mr Wally Peart did the same thing and expressed a great deal of confidence in many aspects of the Government's policy. Thirdly, as distinct from the Leader of the Opposition, after I had delivered my speech I made myself available for questions. Those people do not know what it is like to have the opportunity of having a question period with the Leader of the Opposition. He runs away from them at a million miles an hour because he knows nothing about economics and refuses to expose himself to any sort of questioning. But I spoke at the National Farmers Federation conference and then said, 'Now would you like to ask me some questions?'. They asked a question about interest rates and about the exchange rate. They listened with considerable attention to the answers that I gave. Me Pratt-Did they believe you?",45
63,Mr SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,Order! The honourable member for Adelaide will cease interjecting.,45
64,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"I would not be at all surprised to see a petition from 42,000 or 400,000 people about the level of interest rates. The important thing is that at a time of my choosing several million people-not just 42,000-will be given the opportunity not just of putting their name on a petition, which they can do at any time, but of deciding whether they want this Government-Opposition members-Now, now now, now!",45

68,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"When the people are called upon to make that decision, they will have to choose' between the economic policies of this Government and the alternatives of those opposite. Of course, between now and then I will take a considerable amount of time to expose the total inadequacy of what those opposite are about. But, for the sake of the record now, I will give the Leader of the National Party an indication of the judgment made by an informed commentator about the utter emptiness and stupidity of what those opposite have been about. I refer to an article by Ross Gittins headed 'Dr Hewson leads us to a different world'. He said: This was where Dr Hewson revealed his great insight . . . This discovery, termed the ""integrated economic strategy"" will, he says, constitute a ""different world"" to the one we have known. Dr HewsoD-It will be.",45
69,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,We will deal with the honourable member for Wentworth when he pops up; there is no need to worry about him. Dr HewsoD-Thank you.,46
70,Mr HAWKE,INTEREST RATES,"We will not worry about him. Mr Gittins said: Clearly, it will confound the conventional wisdom as to how economies are managed. The Hewson breakthrough is simply stated. His strategy will have as its central objective the control of inflation. Inflation and wage growth will be down to the level of our trading partners by the end of the first term. But this will be achieved with less, rather than greater, reliance on monetary policy and won't involve a rise in unemployment. What does Gittins say to that? He says: See what I mean? It's path-breaking stuff; Nobel Prize material. This mob opposite has a policy which will mean that interest rates will go through the roof. By the time the election is called people will know which choice to make and they will do as they have done on the past three occasions-go for the side of politics that can deliver responsible economic policies. NA",46
71,Mr LES SCOTT,SKILLSHARE,My question is to the Minister for Employment and Education Services. Will the Minister tell the House what progress has been made with the Skillshare network and whether the community has supported its development?,46
72,Mr DUNCAN,SKILLSHARE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know of his keen interest in the Skillshare projects, three of which are in Oxley, particularly the project in Ipswich which is one of the best in the nation and which has demonstrated a very clear commitment to the principles of caring, high quality training for unemployed people and others disadvantaged in the labour force. I know that other members of this House share the same sort of interest in Skillshare as he does, particularly a number of honourable members opposite. Of course, the reason that so many honourable members have been interested in these projects is undoubtedly that this partnership between the community and the Federal Government has been one of the most successful schemes of its type ever in dealing with long term unemployed people and others who are disadvantaged in getting into the labour force. This year we expect that 60,000 people will be assisted by Skillshare projects and we anticipate that the community contribution in all of the projects will move to 20 per cent of the cost of running those projects. The 360 projects throughout the nation will continue to provide the opportunity to long term unemployed people to which they are entitled. I understand that this program will be threatened with abolition in the unlikely event that the Opposition ever gets on to the treasury bench. That is not a likely event, but nonetheless the people of Australia ought to know about the way in which the Opposition intends to abolish the Skillshare program lock, stock and barrel. The Opposition will shut down the whole program. It will save $61m. Every dollar allocated for the Skillshare program will be withdrawn under the proposals that the Opposition has· put forward. It is disgraceful. What is more disgraceful is the hypocritical way in which honourable members opposite have, on the one hand, supported at the national level a policy of abolition and at the micro level, in their electorates, written to people saying how much they support the Skillshareprojects. My office is full of this duplicity-of letters from people on the Opposition benches asking me to ensure that the Skillshare projects in their electorates continue to be funded by this Government. I can tell people that we will continue to support the Skillshare projects because they are economically and socially sensible responses to the needs of long term unemployed people. The Opposition is saying in defence of its policy stance that it will transfer Skillshare projects into 10btrain. But it does not propose to give the 10btrain program one extra program dollar to do that. It is a ruse and a farce to suggest that that could happen. It is also economically stupid, because when one looks at the relative costs of the programs and what they are designed to do one finds that Skillshare is a very economical program from the point of view of the Federal Government. The cost per place with Skillshare was $751 this financial year. The cost of a 10btrain place is $1,388. What the Opposition is proposing is stupid not only in broad economic terms but also in the way that· the program dollars are to be allocated. As I have said, what we have seen from honourable members opposite is pretty hypocritical, and it is particularly hypocritical in relation to the regional and rural areas of this nation. I have had numerous representations, particularly from cockies' corner. EmptyHere",46
73,Mr DUNCAN,SKILLSHARE,"I have had numerous representations from people in the rural and regional areas, urging support for Skillshare, urging that we increase, not decrease, the dollars available. In fact, the honourable member for Riverina has actually gone on television in his electorate, seeking to ride on the coat-tails of the Government's initiative, trying to seek a bit. of kudos for the Skillshare program. He has come right out 100 per cent behind it, saying what an excellent program it is-and now he is supporting its abolition. This sort of duplicity needs to be exposed so that the people of the nation can see just how duplicitous the Opposition is· being in its approach. Honourable members opposite do not give a damn; they do not care about the unemployed people of this nation. The tremendous results that we have had in cutting back on the long-term unemployment created by the recession in 1982-83, over which honourable members opposite presided, are apparently to be cast aside by this Opposition. Honourable members opposite created the problem; we are creating the solution, and now they want to abolish the solution. It is not good enough. The Australian people will not cop it for a moment. Those honourable members opposite who have been so good as to go out and offer their services to Skillshare projects, to present certificates and the like, ought to have enough guts to return to those projects and explain just how their support has translated into a promise to abolish. the projects. NA EmptyHere to the Prime Minister. I refer him to the speech by Mr John Allwright, President of the National Farmers Federation (NFF) , to which he referred in an earlier answer when he indicated that he was pleased that the President of the National Farmers Federation had so willingly and fulsomely praised the Government. I refer to just a few quotations from that speech: Theirthat is, the Governmentpampered support for interests which are perceived to be sensitive politicaIly is deplorable. In reference to Kodak, Coronation Hill and the deal with the major banks: That degree of adhockery is dangerous and tremendously worrying to industry. He went on to say: Whoever wins the Federal Government next year is going to face a mess . . . The Labor Party therefore should come forward with its plans for at least the next three years. So far, most attention has been on the Opposition's policies.",47
74,Mr SPEAKER,HAWKE GOVERNMENT,The Leader of the Opposition is getting to his question? EmptyHere I am concerned that they'rethe Governmentrunning out of steam-becoming cynical and splintered. Will the Prime Minister advise which one of these he regards as laudatory?,47

78,Mr SPEAKER,HAWKE GOVERNMENT,I warn the honourable member for Bass.,47
79,Mr HAWKE,HAWKE GOVERNMENT,"As I say, the Leader of the Opposition, as he is in all matters, has been totally selective. What I said was that of course there were aspects of this Government's policies of which the NFF was critical. I also said that both in the speech and in his welcome to me, as well as in the thanks that were passed on by Mr Wally Peart on behalf of the meeting, there was also considerable congratulation for the Government's policy. These are facts which honourable members opposite can check if they like. Their stupid behaviour will impress nobody. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to have some analysis of what happened this morning it might be interesting to refer to the matter in a little more detail in one respect. We have heard a lot of noise from those opposite about the question of microeconomic reform. Indeed, this was one of the items to which Mr Allwright referred in his speech. So I tackled this issue head on. I gave a list in considerable detail of the micro-economic reform that had been undertaken by this Government prior to 1987, between 1983 and 1987, and then I referred to the fact that in the 1987 election speech I had said that in the third term of the Labor Government there would be a continuous emphasis on micro-economic reform. I then listed at considerable length what the Government had done in this area. I then put a challenge to the audience-which, of course, was not taken up. I put a very simple challenge.",47

81,Mr SPEAKER,HAWKE GOVERNMENT,Order! There is far too much noise.,48
82,Mr HAWKE,HAWKE GOVERNMENT,"It was a very simple challenge: I said that, prior to our coming to office in 1983, for 30 of the 33 years before then this country had been ruled by the conservatives. I listed all that we had done, particularly in the period since 1987, in implementing that promise and I said to the audience, 'Can anyone begin to suggest any period in Australia's peacetime history, particularly including those 30 years, which came within cooee of what this Government has done in its period of office?'. Of course, answer was a thundering silence. During the time when those opposite were in office they did not have the wisdom or the guts to take on the issue of micro""economic reform. I made to the meeting the following point, which I make in conclusion here in this place: this Opposition does not have the guts to take on the Australian Federation of Air Pilots. I asked the question, which I repeat in this place: 'If you do not have the guts to take on the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, how do you think you would get on on the waterfront?'. NA",48
83,Mr CUNNINGHAM,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,"I refer the Acting Treasurer to the numerous articles that have been written discussing a proposal to abolish the capital gains tax. Does the Government endorse the view generally expressed in these articles, and what are its intentions in this matter?",48
84,Mr DAWKINS,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,I thank the honourable member for his question. EmptyHere gains tax.,48
85,Mr SPEAKER,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,Order! 1 warn the honourable member for Adelaide.,48
86,Mr DAWKINS,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,"I do not suppose that there has been a part of the Opposition's so called economic platform which has received such scathing treatment, such universal condemnation, as that part of its policy which relates to the abolition of the capital gains tax. 1 should remind the House that it was this Government which took the sensible, if difficult, decision to introduce an inflation adjusted capital gains tax, as part of its overall taxation reforms-not just because we thought it was a tax that ought to exist within the tax system, but rather because we knew that it was essential to makirig the tax system fairer, to ensuring that all Australians paid their taxes in accordance with their ability to pay. That is a very fundamental proposition in relation to taxation principles. The honourable member referred in his question to a number of articles which have been written in condemnation of the decision of the Liberal Party to reverse that sensible the decision of this Government and do away with the capital gains tax. The authors of these articles are not Labor Party pamphleteers; they are responsible journalists and, in many cases one presumes, editors of leading newspapers in this country. ,I refer to an article in the Australian Financial Review of 25 October, which states: By putting itthat is, the abolition of this taxon the agenda, the Opposition has created a political issue by proposing a weak and philosophically unconvincing proposition. Its policy response, instead of showing some fiscal spine, lacks any philosophic coherence and will harm revenue. In other words, not only does it take from people who cannot afford to pay, damaging the revenue at the same time, but also it is clear evidence that the Opposition has no consistency and no guts in terms of trying to handle the major fiscal policy issues that confront us. Again, Terry MCCrann, not always the greatest fail of this Government, said on 29 October: EmptyHere once again unleash the assembled might of the legal, accounting and financial professions in the drive to turn otherwise taxable income into tax free capital gains of five years standing. This is unacceptable not only on equity grounds but in terms of promoting the very changes necessary to make Australia more competitive and more efficient. At least Mr MCCrann has been consistent about that objective of making this economy more efficient and competitive. The Opposition says that it is interested in that as well, but on this policy it takes a decision which is entirely antithetical to achieving that objective. It is not necessary to remind anyone who sat in this House in the years leading up to 1983 of the chaos that existed in the taxation system in this country largely because of the absence of a capital gains tax. Honourable members will remember the telephone book of letters and documents coming from the Taxation Commissioner as he pleaded with the then Government in increasingly desperate terms for it to do something about the haemorrhaging of the revenue which was brought about by the antics of the accountants and taxation lawyers who had a freewheeling ability to make their own rules about taxation laws in this country, largely because of the absence of a capital gains tax. The response of the then Government, because it did not have the courage to confront the issue of a capital gains tax head on, was to engage in an increasingly frantic attempt to bring in increasingly artificial pieces of legislation to try to make the system work. In the end, it was a futile attempt and it was only when this Government came to office that the taxation system could be made to work, and work fairly for all Australians. Again, on 2 November an article in the Age stated: The abolition of capital gains tax and its ment by a short-term gains tax would, apart from providing almos.t immediate windfall profits for the rich, again open the tax system to abuses by the tax avoidance industry. It would increase the incentive to pour money into negatively geared property and shares instead of productive investment, allowing patient speculators to pick up tax deductions on interest payments and then to reap tax free profit on sale. I think that is particularly important in the context of the line of questioning which has come from the Opposition today. The Opposition will not face up to the fact that one of the clear consequences of this decision to abolish the capital gains tax will be an increase in the burden of our balance of payments, an increase in the burden of our external debt and the forcing up of interest rates. In other words, the Opposition will not come clean and detail its monetary policy, although it says that our monetary policy is about right. The Opposition will not release its monetary policy, but it says that it will abolish the capital gains tax. That will have the clear and unambiguous effect of forcing up interest rates as people scurry around adjusting their investments and activities in order to take advantage of this taxation measure. Much worse than this, the shadow Treasurer tries to disguise the real effect of the abolition of the capital gains tax. Dr Hewson interjectingMONICA",48
87,Mr SPEAKER,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,Order! The honourable member for Wentworth will cease interjecting.,49
88,Mr DA WKINS,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,"The shadow Treasurer will not own up to the fact that only 2,500 companies are paying it along with one per cent of individual taxpayers, the richest one per cent of taxpayers in the country. Instead, he goes on with this fantastic nonsense that somehow 5.75 million Australians will benefit from the abolition of the capital gains tax. I can tell the House that more than 5.75 million people will be harmed by the abolition of this tax, and a small minority of very privileged Australians will stand to benefit from that. It may well be that the shadow Treasurer believes in the new world, but I rather suspect that the capital of that new world might well be located on Fantasy Isreplace- land. What this policy reveals more than anything else is the stark difference between where we stand in terms· of fairness in policy-whether it be on taxation or welfareand where the Opposition stands. More and more it is becoming apparent that the real architects of this policy and indeed all the other policies of the Opposition are the rich and powerful in Australia, as typified by Mr Elliott who, increasingly, is becoming the ugly face of an increasingly ugly party. NA EmptyHere Opposition) (2.47)-ln view of the undertaking of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) to debate any economic motion that 1 put forward, 1 seek leave to move a motion. Leave granted. EmptyHere That this House condemns the Government for its high interest rate policy which is having a disastrous impact on Australian families, farmers and small businesses. I am grateful to the Prime Minister for indicating during Question Time that he would respond to any motion that 1 moved in respect of any economic matters or interest rates. Until today, the Prime Minister has not wanted to talk about interest rates one bit, other than when he is careering around the country to see group after group. He assures each individual group that interest rates will fall by the end of next year. Of course, with only about 5t weeks of this calendar year left we have heard nothing in this House at any time when we have called on the Government to indicate to us just what it would do to provide relief not only to the 42,000 people who have signed this petition but to Australians in general. Under this Government three things are certain: firstly, high interest rates; se'!ondly, high inflation; and, thirdly, high taxes. The fact is that only today the President of the National Farmers Federation said: So far, most attention has been on the Opposition's policies. Mr Hawke and Mr Keating have been allowed a considerable degree of latitude, but they also have a responsibility to detail their prescriptions for the next three years. All right, we have a document which details our prescriptions.",49

It is the first time in his membership of this Parliament that he has ever done it; and it is because he is running scared before an election has been called.

92,Mr SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,"The Leader of the Opposition might come back to the matter before the House. EmptyHere ceived indicates that these full page advertisements occurred recently because of the fear that is developing not only on the part of the honourable member but amongst all Western Australian members. There have been these full page advertisements in local papers. Why? Because we have the answers and the people have spoken, indicating that they support the Economic Action Plan brought down by the Opposition. It addresses, as we have explained time and time again in this Parliament, what we will do on fiscal policy, in terms of labour market deregulation, and in setting wages in relation· to productivity, thus permitting a steadier monetary policy aimed at getting inflation and interest rates down. We have stated the reforms we will make in the great service industries to enable them to deliver their services effectively and efficiently so that the trading industries can produce their goods more efficiently. We have also referred to the whole schedule of. privatisation .to reduce the size of government. All those matters have been spelt out by us, quite apart from the tax and expenditure program, whereby people can see the real relief to families, those millions and millions of Australians who have been totally forgotten by this Government other than as a means to raise more revenue. Our plan addresses that, but we do not hear about it from the Government, whose record is abysmal. In recent times, the Government has developed what might be called a policy paralysis. We get no answers to questions about interest rates and there is no movement on micro-economic reform. This is the third term of the Hawke Government. Although I rarely stand here and address members of the press gallery, they will recall that, after the last election, the backgrounding was constant for weeks that the hallmark of the third term of the Hawke Government was to be micro-economic reform. Yet we have heard nothing at all during the term of this Government other than wrangling, because there has been a policy paralysis. I will go through the five steps, as I see them, of the policy paralysis of the Government. First, instead of policies, we have the politics of the big lie. Secondly, we have the politics of the quick fix. Thirdly, we have the politics of personal abuse. Fourthly, we have the politics of· hypocrisy. Fifthly, and above all, we have the politics of confusion. I will substantiate each and everyone of those points. First, instead of policies we have the politics of the big lie. Remember it? 'By 1990 no child will live in poverty'. I will not dwell on that disgraceful statement. Secondly, 'Interest rates will fall'. Thirdlyand what a gem this was-'The pilots dispute is over'. They are just three statements that substantiate the first point-the politics of the big lie. . Secondly, the politics of the quick fix: for substantiation, consider Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd, Coronation Hill, and bank interest subsidies. We heard it all today. Those three elements were spelt out in the speech of the President of the National Farmers Federation. Thirdly, the politics of personal abuse: Elliott, Parbo, the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, and even poor old pensioner Bell. I simply say on that point that any person who describes an age pensioner as a 'silly old bugger' does not deserve to be Prime Minister. Fourthly, the politics of hypocrisy: What is the substantiation of that? What of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), the man responsible for fiscal restraint, for propriety in taxation? The travel allowance-Mr Dawkins-Have you lost your place? EmptyHere to whether, in the presence of this man, who has been identified as a participant in bottom of the harbour deals, I would bring him in with the Treasurer on shonky tax returns.

93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,INTEREST RATES,"Mr Ronald Edwards)-The Standing Orders require that members are not allowed to make imputations about other members. In those circumstances, I ask the Leader of the Opposition to withdraw. EmptyHere the harbour' and substitute 'bottom of the sandpit'. Mr Dawkins- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the implication is that I have offended against the tax laws of this country. I have not. EmptyHere Mr Dawkins-I have not. The Leader knows that and he should withdraw unqualifiedly. EmptyHere of the requirements of the House and simply say that the Minister is the physical embodiment of what I am saying about hypocrisy. I will go back to the Treasurer rather than the Acting Treasurer. I refer to travel rorts, tax returns-we know all about it. I refer to the exclusion of trade unions from the application of the capital gains tax-the politics of hypocrisy. Finally, there is the politics of confusionBlewett and Staples; Howe and Keating on a $5.8 billion tax trade-off; Keating on enterprise unions; and Hawke, if you like. We have Richardson and Kerin on the environment and development. It is a total shambles. On each point-the politics of the big lie, the politics of the quick fix, the politics of personal abuse, the politics of hypocrisy, and the politics of confusion-there is substantiation not by what we dream up but by the words and actions of members of the Government. By those words and actions, they will be judged. Day after day in this country they inflict hardship on those they pose to represent-their own constituency, which is bit by bit deserting them now because they will not attend to the arms of economic policy available to them to get interest rates down. Why does the Government think that 42,500 people have signed a petition calling on Government members to address elements of policy other than high interest rates to fix this country's ills? It is because they are suffering, and the Government has chosen clinically and coldly to adopt this policy. This has been done in an atmosphere of abuse of J. D. Elliott to hide over the Government's own close association with those cigar smoking billionaires with whom Australians know it associates. Or is the Govern- ment. ment devoid of policy? Does it simply allege that it has solved the problems and then walk away from them? It is in fact a disgrace to the movement it poses to represent. This is no more a Labor government than we would pretend to be, and we do not indulge in that pretension. Honourable members opposite will rue the day they put on the clothes of another. If they have any central purpose and ideology, let them spell it out now and relate it to the programs, remedies and pOlicies that will give relief to millions of Australians. To date, the Government has not been able to do so. At root, the policy process in the Government has become nothing but a cruel farce-cruel for Australians and a farce in the enactment. Ministers are now publicly campaigning against Ministers. Major policy statements are made without consultation, whether it is Keating on enterprise unions or Howe on family policy. Key policy areas are given over to special interest lobbies. Money is dolloped out to provide the quick fix. What about tax relief? The Opposition proposes it; what is the Government's approach? It might dream up a tax policy, but it cannot do it until after Bill Kelty comes back from his Christmas leave. Then, both the tax and wages .policies will depend on the Australian Council of Trade Unions. We come to development in this nation. God help us if we do not expand the manufacturing base of this country; we can imagine what it will be like in the twenty-first century. But no, the Government is not concerned about the national interest; it has its eye on the election. The Government is too scared to fix the date of the election, but it has its eye on it. The Government will bow . to any extreme environmentalists, giving them veto powers over mining projects such as Coronation Hill. Clearly, industry and the Australian people are calling for clear guidelines, because the Government is not providing them. So the Business Council of Australia has been moved to bring about a summit on debt, because the Government has abdicated any leadership role in this direction. It has absolutely abdicated, and it is no wonder that there is mounting criticism about the policy processes in the GovernThere is a need for the foreign debt conference, there is the criticism of the accord and there is criticism-other than from the Government-of the capital gains tax. I point to the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Small Business Association, Eric Risstrom, representing small taxpayers and the like. The Government should tell them to come in here and buy its rhetoric on the capital gains tax. .It is Government members-masking themselves in clothes-who are supposed to stand for the small man in this country. They should go down to their corner shops-if they can ever get out of their government cars and government aircraft and recognise what is happening in this country today-and ask the proprietors and owners how much of their profits they will have to put back into their businesses to improve them. If they try it on, they will see what it is like today trying to operate a small business, forced by high interest rates to constrain one's activities. Can they not comprehend that at any normal time a small business is constrained in terms of capital growth? Small businessmen have had to go to the bank time and again in order to expand their business. They forgo profit, year in and year out. They take that profit in a more tangible form and put it back into the business. In the past they hoped that some day they would build up a reasonable amount of capital in their businesses. What the hell was the country on about but giving people the incentive to do just that-to save, to invest, to gain something down the line and have a form of nest egg through a business operation? Businesses are not all the same size as those of the friends of the Government. They are somewhat smaller.",51

That is why we will move an amendment-and I can say very little about legislation that is to come before the House-to the Government's legislation to bring forward company tax payments. All companies with a tax liability over $20,000 will be required to pay 85 per cent of their tax within 15 days. The Opposition's amendment will raise this threshold to a taxable income of $200,000. Moreover, we will review this legislation when in government. Whether it is the economic package revolving around fiscal policy, wages policy, monetary policy, significant structural reforms, privatisation or the micro-economic arena that we have totally addressed in our Economic Action Plan, or whether it is the tax relief to families-recognising those whom the Government would never do anything for other than to call on them to pay morethe Opposition has a program, a blueprint and a schedule that will not only get inflation down but also get interest rates down. Our Economic Action Plan offers the only hope for a sustainable lowering of interest rates. The Government has offered nothing-just more of the same, more high interest rates. The Opposition has given the Government the opportunity to explain and it has rejected that opportunity altogether. Because La- of the Government's constant rejection of our calls to explain to the nation what it will ,do to relieve Australians and rebuild this country, it is not surprising that the President of the National Farmers Federation said today: I'm concerned that they'rethat is, the Governmentrunning out of steam-becoming cynical and splintered. Mr Speaker, you will recall that at Question Time I read out half a dozen of the statements that were made: the adhockery that is dangerous; the actions that were tremendously worrying to industry, that the NFF perceived actions by the Government as deplorable, that it felt that the Government should spell out its plans and that it believed that all the discussion was on the Opposition's policies and that no prescriptions were coming from the Government. I asked the Prime Minister to indicate which of those descriptions were laudable and, of course, with very wordy evidence, he showed he could not so do. The reality is that not only has the Government lost the confidence of so many Australians today, but also it has lost the confidence of organisations which would normally-because most Australians are fairly polite-welcome the Prime Minister and hold back from public dissemination the thrust of their major criticisms. They normally put their views privately and constructively. Not today. This report by John Allwright, the President of the National Farmers Federation, is a damning indictment of this Government. And so it ought to be. It complements the 42,000 signatories to the petition which called on the Government to do something about interest rates. The Government has shown itself to be chronically incapable of so doing because it has no policies or direction and soon it will have no support.",53
98,Mr SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,Is the motion seconded? Mr Blunt-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,54
99,Mr HAWKE ,INTEREST RATES,"Wills-Prime Minister) (3.07)-1 welcome this opportunity to reply EmptyHere cock) and I hope I will be given the opportunity to be heard on this matter. First of all, I will go directly to the three points that the Leader of the Opposition made. He said that three things are certain under this Government. I will list them and then ask the House and the people of this country to contrast the achievements of this Government in respect of each of those issues with the achievements of the Opposition. The first was interest rates; the second, inflation; and the third, taxes. I will look at them in turn. As I indicated in answer to a question in this place, under this Government, the 90day bill rate is currently at 18 per cent. In April 1982 it reached 22 per cent under the coalition Government. This Government has not approached the level of interest rates reached during that Government's period in office. Secondly, the· coalition Government walked out of office at a time of double digit inflation. It achieved what no other government in history had ever achieved-that is, simultaneous double digit inflation and unemployment. The inflation rate under the coalition Government was over 11 per cent. At no point has this Government begun to approach that level of inflation. Taxes were the third point. What did the coalition Government do in relation to taxes? When it walked out of office, the top rate was 60c in the dollar and the lowest rate was 30c in the dollar. That was the coalition Government's achievement in the area of taxes. The top rate was 60c for one very simple reason. Because of its philosophical and ideological commitment to the privileged, it refused steadfastly to ensure that those people in this country with the greatest capacity to pay tax and make a contribution to the public revenue were required to do so. The most damning indictment of the legacy that we inherited from the coalition Government was provided by two people who were in no way associated with the Australian Labor Party. Firstly, I refer to the coalition Government's own royal commissioner. The Opposition will recall the immortal words of Royal Commissioner Costigan who, when referring to the previous five years-which were, conveniently, 1976 to 1981, the period of the coalition Government's stewardship-said that the fastest growing industry in this country was the tax avoidance industry. The second damning indictment came from Professor Russell Mathews of the Australian National University. His words were probably the most damning indictment from any economist ever delivered upon any government in this country. He said, 'It has become increasingly a matter of choice for the wealthy as to whether they pay their tax'. There you have it. Those opposite have the audacity to stand up here and talk about tax when, at the end of their stewardship, they had rates of 60c in the dollar, their own Royal Commissioner was saying that they had created the fastest growing industry in the country-the tax avoidance industry-and Professor Russell Mathews was saying of their administration and stewardship that it had become increasingly a matter of choice whether the wealthy paid their taxes. I doubt whether there has ever been a more damning independent indictment of a government than that made by the Opposition's own Royal Commissioner and by Professor Russell Mathews. The reason that the top rate of taxes was 60c in the dollar was precisely that those opposite refused to draw from those areas in the community with the greatest capacity to pay the contributions which they should have made. In terms of interest, inflation and taxes, this Government has not come close to the records achieved by those opposite. What was the meaning of that for this society? I use that as a basis to accept the challenge to spell out what it is that we believe. I accept that challenge gladly. I do it in the context of the achievement of those opposite. I do so not simply to recite history but precisely because the Opposition promised, in its Economic Action Plan, a return to the prescriptions, the philosophy and the ideology of the past. tet me tell the House what this meant for the people of Australia as they laboured under the coalition's miserable philosophy, which was committed to the sustenance of the privileged and the ignorance of those in need. Those opposite talk about children. Let me go to the most important factor which determines a child's capacity-not only in his childhood but for the rest of his careerto prosper and grow and to make a contribution, not only for himself but also for his society; that is, education. Let us look at the achievement of honourable members opposite in their seven years in office. What was the increase in the participation rate in education in this country during their seven years? As we look around the children here in the gallery and others in the country, we ask: what did those opposite do to ensure that there would be an increasing opportunity for the kids of this country to stay on in the education system? Answer: in their seven years, the participation rate increased from 34 per cent to 36 per cent-a miserable increase of 2 per cent. Those opposite walked out of office leaving Australia with virtually the worse participation rate of any developed country. If those opposite want an indictment of their ideology and their time in government, it is this: they wilfully denied themselves revenue because they allowed the rich to escape their duty to pay tax and, in denying themselves that revenue, they did not have it to spend on expanding the educational opportunity for our kids. I have been asked to spell out what we believe and what we are about. I spell it out precisely, as I did in 1983, when I said, 'That is not good enough for this country'. If there is one damning indictment of any government and of any society it is that a government denies itself revenue by allowing the rich not to pay their taxes and, in so doing, it does not expend money on education for kids. I said, 'We will change it'. Have we changed it? We certainly have. The 2 per cent increase in the participation rate during the previous Government's seven years in office-it left it at 36 per cent in 1982-has been changed by a government which said, 'We will ensure that those with a capacity to pay, pay'. We have now created an equitable system. We have created a system in which now the wealthy pay. We have used that money to increase the education allowances to the low income and middle income families of Australia. What has been the result? There has not been a 2 per cent increase in participation rates, as occurred during the seven years of conservative government, which propped up the rich and the privileged; under this Labor Government the participation rates have moved from 36 per cent to 60 per cent. They are moving up to the point that we promised. We have been asked what we believe in. We do not utter rhetoric; we deliver on the promises that we have made. We said that we would create a - ociety in which it is not the wealth of the parent which determines whether the kid will stay in the education system; it will be the talents and the desire of the kid to stay on in the education system. We now have the situation where the kids from the poorer and the middle income suburbs are, as are the kids from the rich suburbs, staying on in the school system. The kids of the rich have every right to be educated but they have no greater right than the kids from the low and middle income families. The face of this society is being changed. We are now building up a population in which all the talent of the young children of this great country is being drawn not from the exclusive suburbs alone but from every suburb. The kids who have the talent and the desire to stay on in the education system· are staying in it. And that has not happened by accident; it has happened because we have more than doubled the secondary education allowance that goes to the kids. The No. 1 priority of those opposite was, as Costigan and Mathews have said, to protect the rich and the privileged: do not get them to pay their revenue. So the previous Government did not have the money to spend on education. We said, 'The rich and the privileged will pay their share. We won't keep a top tax rate of 60c in the dollar and the lowest rate at 30c. Because we make everyone in the community with the capacity to pay, pay, we will have a fair, reasonable and economically efficient tax system and out of that efficient tax system we will then target expenditures in a way that economic justice and social decency become the characteristics of the Australian society'. If there is one issue by which a society shall be judged as to whether it is decent and as to whether it is efficient in the alloabject cation of its resources, it is whether it will ensure that those with a capacity to pay, pay and that that revenue so derived is then expended on ensuring that the talents of the kids of the country are developed in a way which will fulfil them personally and which will enable them to make a contribution to their country. That is the test by which any society will be properly judged. And by that test, those opposite were lin abject failure. If it were only a history lesson I was delivering, it would be bad enough but, unfortunately, the tragedy is that those opposite have learned nothing. They have said that they will return to that prescription of the past. If people want to understand the hypocrisy, if they want to understand what determines the formation of conservative economic policy in this country, they should read what the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), said ·before he was rolled by his Foster parent. When he came into the Parliament earlier, he was asked what was his view about a capital gains tax and a fringe benefits tax. What was his answer? Professor Hewson's answer was very simple: 'I'd go for near uniform taxation of all forms of income'. In other words, the pure, clear view and position of economist Hewson, before he was rolled by his Foster parent and those who determine the priorities of liberalism and the National Party in this country, was that we should have a capital gains tax. But he was rolled. We do not expect anything from the Leader of the Opposition because he knows nothing about economics and he cares nothing about social decency. But at least we expect a professor of economics, who has said that there should be a capital gains tax, to tell the conservative parties of this country, when he has the opportunity to do so as the shadow Treasurer, that the right thing to do is to retain the capital gains tax. But, as I say, he was rolled by the Foster parent of the Liberal Party. Of course, therefore, when I analyse what has happened in the previous seven years when this mob were in government, when they established what their credo was, what their policies would be, what their outcomes were, all that is not history but an analysis and a certain prescription of the misery and the perversion of priorities that would mark this· country if the Australian people were to go back to them. I also noticed that the Leader of the Opposition, in his speech, had the temerity to refer to the environment as though this Government was captive of the environment movement. Let me make a point that I have made in this place before. I assert-and I have done so consistently-that those who attempt to present our position in terms of it being development or em/ironment entirely misrepresent that position. The fact is that one can have and should have both. One can have development. We have had economic growth under this Government twice as fast as under the previous Government and a rate of employment growth five times as fast. At the same time, we have had the World Heritage Bureau. say that no country has done more to advance World Heritage values than Australia. One can have both. One can have decency and one can have economic rationality in this country but one cannot have it with the mob opposite.",54
100,Mr BLUNT ,INTEREST RATES,"Richmond-Leader of the National Party of Australia) (3.21) - The first point I would make is that the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) did not utter the words 'interest rate' in 20 minutes. His performance was an embarrassment to his own side and, quite frankly, it was an embarrassment to me. Sitting where I was, I was astounded. The President of the National Farmers Federation might be worried about adhockery in the Government, but let me say that I am worried about the relevance of the Prime Minister. He is an anacronism. I am also worried about his stability. His speech was the rhetoric of the 1970s, not answers to the problems of the 1990s, and he knows it. He is gone. He should see the polling on his seat. He is finished. He should go and talk to the pharmacists, do a bit of door-knocking and see what the mothers at the supermarket say about him. He should think about it when they buy mince instead of steak because they have to pay the mortgage. The Prime Minister has had it. If he has to buy one page advertisements, then he had better go and buy the newspaper because he has no hope. He is gone, finished, wound up. Mr Lavarch interjectingMONICA",56
101,Mr BLUNT,INTEREST RATES,"As for the honourable member for Fisher, he has no hope-none whatsoever. I cannot believe that this Government has fallen so far so fast. This ParliaAll ment has the opportunity to debate something of significance to the Australian people, that is, the impact of the Government's policies on people. This is not a clinical economic debate; the Government's interest rates are paid by people. It is their money, which they do not have a lot of these days. They have the choice of paying the Government's interest rates on their mortgages or spending it on food for their kids. And this is the sort of performance we get from Government members. They are a disgrace. The honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) is the only bloke in the building who actually bulk bills his colleagues. What sort of person is he? What sort of professional is he? Since the Prime Minister raised a number of issues, let us address them. He was talking about this Government's 'proud record of development'. Sitting right behind him, glowering over his shoulder, was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin). We all know what the Minister thinks about the Prime Minister's attitude. Let us talk a little about Coronation Hill. Let us examine the Coronation Hill decision of this Government; this Government that has such.a proud record. The Treasurer ( Mr Keating) forecast that this country will have a current account deficit of $18.5 billion this year. That is even bigger than last year. It will put more pres- . sure on interest rates, not down but up. Let me say that the $18.5 billion forecast will be wrong; it will be considerably more. In that context, a consortium led by one of Australia's great companies put up a proposal to redevelop an existing mine. That mine was called Coronation Hill. Every honourable member opposite has a copy of the environmental impact study. None of them have read it, otherwise they would not have put up with the rubbish that passed for a decision by the Cabinet. Let us have a look at Coronation Hill. It is a mine. It was mined for uranium in the 1960s and it was rediscovered for palladium and platinum. So instead of importing $40m worth of platinum to go in car exhausts, we could export it. Do honourable members opposite know anything about the current account deficit? Do they know anything about the economic position of this country? No, they do not. All they have is empty rhetoric. they can do is sit in here and rabbit on. They would be better off out there in their offices ringing up some constituents. They might get a vote, and they need a few of them. Let us talk about something a bit more significant than this rat bag over here. Let us talk about the state of this economy and go back to Coronation Hill. Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd put up a proposal to develop that mine for palladium and platinum. Mr Chynoweth-Gold.",57
102,Mr BLUNT,INTEREST RATES,"No gold, and the honourable member knows it is no gold. That is El Sherana. The honourable member is totally ignorant. He knows nothing about the issue at all. That mine is worth between $500m and $700m and the Government spent $12m doing the environmental impact study. The Cabinet met and spent an hour and a half talking on the telephone to the conservation movement, because that is the Prime Minister's corporate philosophy. He thinks that if he does a deal with the conservation movement all the green vote will arrive en masse. It does not work like that. In the face of that economic position-$18.5 billion worth of current account deficit and more pressure on interest rates-this Government declined approval to develop Coronation Hill. Let me tell honourable members what the significance of that is. If we are to address that $18.5' billion deficit-and it will be larger than that-we have to discover and develop a Coronation Hill mine every 14 days. We have no hope of doing that. When we discover one this Government, for blatantly political r-asons, in the craven pursuit of votes, vetoes it. Worse, in one of the most prospective mineral provinces in the world, by the Government's own estimates with a value of between $7 billion and $15 billion, what does it do? It sterilises the area for further exploration. It is not even prepared to go along with the proposal that one looks at each project item by item. Where is this Government's concern for the future of our economy? This Government's commitment to the environment is as deep as a ballot box, and every,b?dy kn-ws it. That· is the sort of ad hoc declslon-makmg that John Allwright and the National Far-­ ers Federation are complaining about. It IS followed through by decisions like Kodak, decisions that the Treasurer cannot stomach and that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is absolutely repulsed by. But because the Prime Minister thinks that sort of decision-making will get him re-elected, this Government is spending the taxpayers' money going down that track. If one has a look at what the Government does to small business, the real engine room of our economy, one understands why it is arrogant and out of touch. This is the Government that requires 85 per cent of co-­ pany tax to be paid within 15 days. This same Government has $36m to subsidise Kodak. This same Government is prepared t? spend hundreds of millions of dollars subsldising the airlines. In fact, we know that we are subsidising only one airline- Sir Peter Abeles's Ansett. We know exactly what the priorities of this Government are. As I have said, the comments of the Prime Minister in this place were just the rhetoric of the 1970s. There was not one policy, for the 1990s, not one answer for Australia's problems. Where is his equivalent of this? What document did he bring into this place? Where are his answers? What is the Government's response, other than more of the same? As I have said, what we are talking about today is an issue that relates to people. It is an issue that the Leader of the House ( Mr Beazley) knows is a people issue. That is why he is spending money probably donated by the corporate sector-the big - nd of town-on taking out one page advertisements in the newspapers to promote himself. He is supposed to hold a safe Labor seat and this is what is being done. One page advertisements are being taken out in the newspapers when the election is not going to be held. He is running scared, just like every back bench member of this Government. They know they are gone, and they are gone a million. This Government is also prepared to spend vast amounts of the taxpayers' money trying to get itself re-elected. What about the $30000 stamp allowance Government member- gave themselves? What is that being used for? How many Government members are looking after their marginal seats? EmptyHere",57
103,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,INTEREST RATES,Mr Ronald Edwards)-Order! The honourable member for Adelaide is not assisting the Leader of the National Party. I suggest that he stop interjecting across the chamber. Members on my right will also assist the Chair and the Leader of the National Party if they stop interjecting.,58
104,Mr BLUNT,INTEREST RATES,"Thirty thousand dollars worth of stamps was allocated for Labor seat holders-not one member on this side of the House has used it-and $4 for pensioners. There are the Government's priorities. Let us get serious for a moment. Instead of those opposite carrying on like hyenas or gala-s, let us talk about an issue that relates out 10 the community. If the Government was really doing its job it would be expressing some concern about the impact of interest rates on families. It is true that in this country the second mortgage has replaced the first child. What has happened under Treasurer Keating's interest rate regime is that women who want to be mothers are out in the workplace trying to put a roof over the family's head and not having children. That is why we get the majority of our population increase from migration and not native born Australian kids. The sanctimonious, hypocritical criticism of the honourable member for Canning ( Mr Gear) will not earn him one vote. You are gone, my friend; absolutely gone. I would ring up and find out what the superannuation payout is because the honourable member is irrelevant. He does not know what the issues are out there in the community and he is going to be swept aside. What those opposite should really be talking about is the pressure that the Treasurer's and the Government's policies are putting on families. In this place we cannot say that the Prime Minister has lied, and of course I would not say that, but I would say that the majority of Australians believe that he has. We have only to look at the history of this Government and its spokesmen over seven long years of deceit to see exactly how callously they treated the Australian people. Let us go back a bit to 1984. It was stated: . . . because inflation is coming downthat is a joke, because it is going upand inflationary expectations are down, interest will come down too. That was a statement made by Mr Hawke in an interview with John Laws on 2UE on 5 November 1984. The next quote is a classic: We've ploughed the fields and sown the seeds. In the very near future we will harvest the crop. The reference was to the crop of lower interest rates. The Government must have had a drought, because it did not arrive. Let us go on a bit further to 1985. This is how callously this Government treats the Australian people. It gets an attack of low interest rate predictions every time there is an election coming on, you realise, Mr Deputy Speaker. In 1985 it was stated: . . . the very low deficit as announced by the Treasurer last night. . . will have the consequential effect of lowering pressure on the public sector borrowing requirements, and that, of course, is good news with regard to general interest rates and that means it is good news for housing interest rates also. What happened? Where are the low housing interest rates? Of course the Government knew exactly what was going on when it made these statements. Nothing has changed. Let us go through to 1987. It was stated: The Government's expectations that interest rates can begin to fall this year are based on a thorough and continuous assessment of all the factors which go to make up the total macro-economic picture. This is the Prime Minister relying on his not inconsiderable competence, or was it advice? Whatever basis that statement was made on was totally wrong, but of course that was in 1987. The Treasurer, the great economic guru of the Australian Labor Party, in an election campaign, in election mode, stated: The re-election of the Government will be an enormous fillip to confidence. . . It will clear the decks for further interest rate declines. As those interest rates come down, they will grease the tracks to higher investment. That statement was made by the Treasurer three weeks before the 1987 election. Holy cow! It was further stated: Interest rates, as you know and appreciate, are falling and will continue to fall and will be reflected in falls in mortgage rates before the end of 1987. That statement was made by the Prime Minister, and we are still waiting. In 1989 there is the same old story from the Government. No matter who it is, whether it is the Prime rates Minister, the Treasurer, or his campaign director, it is the same old story, it has not changed. It was stated: There is no reason why interest rates should rise. That statement was made by the Prime Minister in April 1989. He was as wrong then as he was in 1984. The Prime Minister has never told the truth to the Australian people about interest rates and he is not telling the truth now. The fact of the matter is that this Government has no policies, no answers and does not know where it is going. Its entire emphasis is a political strategy. We have seen the Prime Minister in here today frothing at the mouth and carrying on. We have seen him cry over drugs, we have seen him cry over Israel, and we have seen him cry over Tiananmen Square. I ask: When are we going to see this Prime Minister shed a tear for the hurt and damage that he and his Government are inflicting on Australian families?",58
105,Mr DAWKINS ,INTEREST RATES,"Fremantle.L Minister for Employment, Education and Training and Acting Treasurer) (3.35)-It is perhaps necessary to remind the House why we are having this extraordinary debate. It is beEmptyHere cock) said that he challenged the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) to have a debate on economic policy and particularly on interest rates. I had thought as the debate went on that maybe it had more to do with some State elections occurring in South Australia and Queensland, but if that is the case I find it particularly extraordinary that the Leader of the National Party of Australia ( Mr Blunt) would stumble into this particular debate because, after all, it is the National Party in Queensland that is staring defeat in the face. It is his own Party on today's polling which suggests that it has been reduced to the support of some 19 per cent of the people of Queensland. I would have thought that the Leader of the National Party may have been well advised to hang his head in shame, or at least. try to engineer some semi-plausible excuses why the National Party is doing so appallingly in Queensland. If the Leader of the Opposition is genu- . ine1y interested in participating in the economic debate of this country, then it is curious that he is not prepared to engage in the practice of most leaders of the Opposition; that is, to hold 'regular press conferences. He has not had a press conference since the - launch of the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. He has not been allowed by his, minders to have a press conference or to allow the journalists of the press gallery to have a full ranging scrutiny and cross examination of what it is the Liberal Party leader and his Party really stand for. As much as I listened to him today, as carefully as I could-after all, this was a debate he requested, a debate in which he wanted to engage the Prime Minister, he said, in substantive matters of economic policy-I did not hear anything of substance which the Leader of the Opposition advanced which might help us to resolve the problems confronting this country. Therefore, in order to get the debate back onto some kind of even keel, on behalf of the Government it is my intention to amend the motion moved by the Opposition. I therefore move: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 'this House (1) notes the widespread public condemnation of the Opposition's proposal to abolish the capital gains tax and replace it with a so-called speculative gains tax, as demonstrated by the attached representative example of newspaper commentary; (2) expresses its concern that the abolition of the capital gains tax would stimulate the flow of investment away from productive activity towards nonproductive activity, thereby causing Australia's balance of payments deficit and external debt to worsen, leading to higher interest rates and crippling Australian families, farmers and small businesses; (3) noteS the widespread concern that the abolition of the capital gains tax would lead to a resumption of the tax avoidance practices that occurred on a massive scale during the administration of the previous coalition Government; (4) notes that such practices harm the efforts of the Australian nation to surmount its external challenge, thereby also contributing to higher interest rates; (5) notes the fundamental inconsistency in the Opposition's professed concern about the impact of interest rates on families, farmers and small business and its deleterious proposal to abandon the capital gains tax; and (6) calls on the coalition parties in the national interest to support the present arrangements for the taxation of capital gains.' It is important to move that amendment because we need to make it quite clear what we are talking about. The Opposition has said that it is opposed to our current monetary policy and that it has a policy of its own. So I decided to dig up the Opposition's Economic Action Plan to discover what the Opposition's policy is in relation to monetary policy. It states: The next Coalition Government will conduct monetary policy with the medium-term objective of reducing and eventually eliminating inflation. It goes on to state: A monetary policy pursued steadily over the medium term, in conjunction with our industrial relations, fiscal and structural policies, provides the only means of reducing inflation and hence interest rates. Mr Bilney-What claptrap!",59
106,Mr DAWKINS,INTEREST RATES,"I, like the honourable member for Kingston, find that an extraordinarily baffling set of policies. When we look at the document we see that there is absolutely no substantive connection between the Opposition's policy and its objectives. The Opposition has the medium term objective of reducing interest rates and eliminating inflation but, when we try to discover how the Opposition will eliminate inflation, we find that it has some mystical link with its policy on industrial relations. So I thought I would go to the Opposition's industrial relations policy in the hope that I would find the answer to the mysterious secret as to how it will operate its monetary policy in the interests of reducing inflation. The Opposition states that its aims are to ensure a much closer link between wages and productivity; to introduce incentive and reward for effort, thus encouraging higher productivity; and to achieve lower labour costs at least in line with those of our partners. I guess that they are laudable objectives. They are objectives that the Government could agree with. Indeed, the objectives of higher productivity and lower labour costs in line with our trading partners are already the objectives being successfully pursued by the Government. But in our policy it is quite clear how we get to the objective of wages based on productivity and lower labour costs through a set of clear policy arrangements. In the first place we have the accord, which has ensured that we are able to pursue, with the agreement of the trade union movement, sensible changes to industry policy and wage restraint. After all, we have to have wage restraint if we are to have any chance of ensuring that wage increases relate in any way to productivity. But when we look at the Opposition's policy we see that there is no policy of wage restraint and no mechanism to ensure wage restraint; there is just this lofty objective of ensuring that wages policy will be pursued in such a way that wage increases relate to productivity. What is the mechanism by which the Opposition will ensure that? It says that it will downgrade the influence of the Industrial Relations Commission-the only vehicle, the only instrument, the only institution in the Commonwealth armoury to deal with the question of wages policy. The Opposition wants to abandon the Industrial Relations Commission in favour of an entirely decentralised system of setting wages. At the same time it thinks it can hold down wage increases and ensure that any wage increases relate to productivity. One does not have to be very clever to realise that that will not work. There is no mechanism by which we can ensure that negotiations held enterprise by enterprise will comply with some fanciful policy objective of someone in Canberra who says, 'You are not allowed to have a wage increase unless it is matched by a productivity increase'. Of course, I leave aside what productivity we are measuring and how we are measuring it, in relation to either the enterprise or the economy as a whole. When we work all that out, when we realise that there is no means of achieving the Opposition's wages policy objective, we come back to this big hole in the Opposition's monetary policy itself. The Opposition is concerned to deal with the central question of inflation, as we are. The Opposition has no industrial relations policy, no way of containing wages and no way of preventing a wage breakout. We realise then that inevitably we are driven to only one possible conclusion-that is, that the Opposition will rely on monetary policy alone in order to deal both with inflation and with wages policy. What does that mean in the end? It can only mean what it has always meant under Liberal policy in operation in the past: whenever inflation gets a bit of a run on, whenever wages get a bit of a run on, or when they happen together, the one recourse the Opposition has is to jack up interest rates to extremely high levels in order to contain demand, put downward pressure on wages and downward pressure on inflation. In the end this whole debate has a note of farce about it. The Opposition comes in here and says that it is primarily concerned about interest rates. It waves around. its vacuous policy and says, 'Where is your answer to high interest rates? Here is ours'. But when we look carefully at what the Opposition's policy actually says we see that it is a prescription for higher interest rates, not lower interest rates. It is not a prescription for steadier monetary policy, unless it is steadier monetary policy at a very much higher level. I think members of the Opposition are really talking about interest rates at around 25 per cent, necessary to contain simultaneously inflation and wages. They would have absolutely no other mechanism for dealing with those problems. · It is not as though these are new issues for the Liberal Party or for Australia. At various times in our history we have had to deal with the coincidence of inflation and high wages growth. Of course, the Opposi·tion has actually had some practical experience of what to do about it. But when we look back at what it did at the time we see that it had only one alternative; it had only one policy prescription-a sort of scorched earth policy· of high interest rates, battering the economy into the ground with devastating consequences for the ordinary working men and women of Australia. The whole of the Opposition's rhetoric is conjured up in terms of the impacts on small businesses and families as a result of the current stance of monetary policy. The people opposite are the ones who ought to know; they are the recession experts. This is one area of policy that they managed to perfect during their years in government. They know about recessions but what they do not understand, because it never actually touches them or any of the people they talk to, is the devastation that is wrought on ordinary Australian families as a result of the kinds of recessions which they have visited upon Australia in the past and which, if they ever got a chance, they would visit on us again. What about the 600,000 families whose breadwinners were thrown out of work as a result of the policies of the jokers opposite when they were in office? They were all families too. They were the families who had their incomes reduced from a .reasonable level, on a reasonable wage, presumably, to the level of welfare. Do we hear any compassion or concern for the interests of Australian families who, under the Opposition's · policies, would once again be thrown out of work and onto the dole queues and forced to rely, at least for nine months, on welfare benefits, after which the Opposition says they should get nothing at all or, alternatively, some grudging handout which would come in the form of a special benefit? What about the number of small businesses which would go bankrupt under a policy of high interest rates, which would be the only mechanism which the jokers opposite would have to pursue in trying to run any economic policy at all? Let me return to this question of the capital gains tax. As obscure as it might be to the question of interest rates, it is becoming increasingly clear that this is centrally involved in the management of economic policy, not just in terms of fiscal policy, the amount of revenue that one might raise from the tax itself and the extent to which its operation ensures compliance with the rest of the taxation system, but in terms of what happens, in the absence of a capital gains tax, in the context of the investment decisions of individuals as they scurry around trying to find ways in which they can distort their investments in a way which will ensure they get a stream of capital rather than a stream of income which then comes to them in a tax free form. It is a massive dislocation of the investment behaviour of people who in this country are so vital in terms of getting the right investments to fortify Australian industry to enable it to compete with the rest of the world. Once again we would see a flight of funds, not into the productive investments of industry, whether it is agriculture, manufacturing or the services industries, but into speculative areas where people know they can pick up a quick capital gain and pocket the money in a tax free form. That is why this debate has a certain air of nonsense about it. The Opposition is simply not interested in having a serious debate. We, of course, are. We will meet members of the Opposition on any other occasion. Because of their appalling performance on this occasion, I move: That the question be now put.",60
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,INTEREST RATES,"Mr Ronald Edwards)-Before putting the question that the question be now put, I need to clarify for the House the questions that are before us. The amendment moved by the Government reads as follows: This House (I) notes the widespread public condemnation of the Opposition's proposal to abolish the capital gains tax and replace it with a so-called speculative gains tax- . and the following wordsas demonstrated by the attached representative example of newspaper commentary . . . Those words would fall outside the Standing Orders and I rule that they be deleted from the amendment. The rest of the amendment would stand. The original question that the motion be agreed to, to which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has moved as an amendment that all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. The immediate question is: That the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question. Mr Fife-Before you put the question, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a great d-al of confusion in the House due to the incompetence of the Minister at the table. I would like your ruling, and I would hope that before you give a ruling you will seek the expert advice of the Clerks, as to whether the amended amendment is in order. Obviously, the Government has failed again in drafting its own amendment. I would like to have that assurance from you before the House votes on the motion.",62
108,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,"I can give the honourable member the assurance that it is necessary to delete those words which refer to an attached newspaper commentary from the amendment moved by the Minister. They would add material which would not normally be within the Standing Orders. However, when it comes to the substantive proposition that is being moved by the Leader of the Opposition, which refers to matters concerning interest rates, Australian families, Darling, E. E. farmers and small business, the content of the amendment is broadly the same as that of the original motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition. Accordingly, I rule that that is in order. Mr Ruddock-I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. If the amendment that is proposed is out of order, then it should be withdrawn and amended by the mover. It cannot be amended from the Chair. You may be able to amend a question or permit part of a question and allow the rest to stand in order at Question Time but it is preposterous for the Chair, with respect, to amend an amendment that has been moved by a member. The member has the responsibility for doing that. If the member acknowledges that his amendment is out of order, then he should propose it in another form.",63
109,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTEREST RATES,"I have heard the point of order. It is customary for the Chair to be requested at many times to include material in relation to speeches and matters before the House. In this respect the matters that are referred to, such as newspaper commentary, fall within that category. So I therefore rule that the amendment is in order. EmptyHere",63

136,Mr STAPLES ,COMMONWEALTH SERUM,"Jagajaga-Minister for Housing and Aged Care) (4.21)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill amends the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Act 1961 to convert the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) to a public company, called the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd. It will also remove a variety of statutory controls which inhibit CSL's commercial operations. The Minister responsible for CSL will retain strategic oversight of the new company in line with the guidelines for the reform of government business enterprises (GBEs). The Bill is a major step in implementing the reform package for CSL announced on 16 August 1989 and is part of the Government's comprehensive program to improve the performance of government business enterprises. CSL has a long history of achievements in serving the Australian community. CSL was established in 1916, following World War I, as an arm of the Quarantine Service, so that Australia could be self-sufficient in vaccines and sera in times of war and peace. In 1923 CSL was one of the four laboratories world wide to produce insulin and in 1944 CSL enabled Australia to be the first country to supply penicillin to its civilian population. 1952 CSL commenced the fractionation of serum, provided by voluntary blood donors and collected by the Red Cross, into life saving blood products, a function which it continues to perform today. CSL has developed anti-sera and anti-venoms against specific Australian pests and diseases, the most recent being the funnel-web spider antivenom in 1988. CSL is the only manufacturer of human vaccines in Australia and one of only two producers of biological veterinary products. When CSL became a statutory authority in 1961 its charter focused on the performance of national interest functions, in particularthe manufacture of prescribed biological pharmaceutical products and serum fractionation. Provision was also made at that time, however, for limited commercial operations using any excess manufacturing capability. With support from successive Ministers, CSL has since evolved into a primarily commercial organisation. Significant changes to the CSL Act between 1980 and 1985 removed the restriction limiting CSL to manufacturing solely biological products and placed CSL's operation on a commercial profit making basis, whilst continuing to perform some national interest activities for the Commonwealth under a reimbursement arrangement. These changes to the Act also allowed the establishment of subsidiaries, joint ventures and partnerships. CSL now markets a wide range of prescribed human pharmaceuticals and veterinary products both in Australia and overseas. CSL currently employs over 1,200 staff and has over 2,000 product lines. As such CSL is the largest pharmaceutical company in Australia, and represents a unique pharmaceutical manufacturing capability. Indeed, since 1980-81 CSL's sales revenue has increased from $33m to $127m in 1988-89, and pretax profits have increased from $1.5m to "" $11.5m over the same period. Not only does CSL pay a 40 per cent dividend on its posttax profit to the Commonwealth but it is subject to State payroll and land taxes as well as the corporate tax. CSL's achievements are significant given the small size of the Australian market. In its recent endeavours to increase sales CSL has been a winner of several export In awards. Indeed, with the globalisation of the pharmaceutical industry CSL's future must lie with the development of new products and new markets, not just within Australia but overseas. This will be achieved not only through CSL's own research activities but also through the continued development of licensing arrangements and joint ventures to access new technology. CSL can succeed in these areas only if it is allowed to operate as a truly commercial enterprise that can respond quickly in the marketplace free from day to day government regulatory controls. The reform package is therefore a further significant step in the continued development of CSL. The objective is to establish it as an efficient and commercially focused organisation able to compete profitably and effectively with the private sector in the domestic and international marketplace. The reform package will thus achieve the Government's aims of, firstly, fostering a more commercial focus for CSL and, secondly, retaining a key manufacturing capability in Australia without the need for any subsidies from the Commonwealth. This Bill is a major step in implementing this reform. There are a number of important elements of the CSL reform package. Firstly, there will be new planning and accountability mechanisms for CSL. These will include the provision by CSL of a three-year corporate plan which will define the company's goals, financial targets and strategies to achieve those goals. Financial targets will be set and CSL will report annually giving an account of its performance against goals. CSL's memorandum and articles of association will be registered, as with any public company, with the National Companies and Securities Commission. The Minister responsible for CSL will exercise control, on behalf of the Commonwealth as the shareholder, in a similar manner to shareholders in any other company. The proposed memorandum and articles of association will provide for the Minister responsible to have the power to appoint and dismiss the CSL board of directors. Also the Minister responsible for CSL will be able to issue guidelines to the board. In addition, as a public company, CSL will be required to operate in accordance with the Companies Code. This will provide for the protection of the interests of the Commonwealth through its rights as a shareholder of the company. Under the Companies Code the company directors have specific responsibilities to shareholders as well as other defined obligations. There will also be revised remuneration arrangements for the Managing Director. CSL's important community service function or serum fractionation will be made more efficient and accountable through use of a formal contrac.tual arrangement with the Commonwealth. The provision for rights to be attached to shares included in a class of shares will also protect the Commonwealth's interests in relation to the land on which CSL is located. CSL will be expected to continue to comply with Government wages and inqustrial relations policies, in particular with those guidelines developed specifically for government business enterprises in March 1989. It is intended that CSL start operating as a public company limited by shares and incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory by 31 March 1990. The arrangements proposed for CSL are essentially the same as those already applying to other GBE's such as Australian Airlines Ltd, Australian National Line and most recently the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. I will now summarise the key elements of the Bill. The Bill provides for the conversion of CSL, from its current statutory authority status, to a public company under the Companies Act. The Bill comes into effect in several stages, on royal assent and through two proclamations. This is to facilitate the consolidation of the asset base, creation of capital structure, and repeal of sections of the CSL Act 1961 which are no longer required. This also allows for the development of an appropriate balance sheet, financial performance indicators and strategic plan to enable the Minister responsible for CSL to undertake strategic oversight of the company. As the legislation will come into effect in several stages the Bill ensures the continuity of CSL as a legal entity during this transition in order to preserve all contracts, agreements and the relationship of CSL with its subsidiary companies. The Bill ensures continuity of employment and staff conditions during the transition. Each staff member of CSL will become an employee of the company on the same terms and conditions as applied to his or her employment by the statutory authority. This includes the preservation of accumulated entitlements such as long service, recreation and sick leave. The existing provisions covering superannuation will be maintained for staff who are members of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. Those staff who have mobility rights under part IV of the Public Service Act 1922 will retain those rights. The Bill also ensures that CSL's taxation position and other assets and liabilities are unchanged upon conversion in recognition of the fact that there has been no change in the beneficial ownership by the Commonwealth. On the matter of assets, the Bill provides for CSL's asset base to be consolidated before the assets are converted into share capital and fully paid up shares are issued to the Commonwealth. The consolidation of assets entails the transfer to CSL of the remaining land and buildings which had remained vested in the Commonwealth. These 'transferring assets' have been employed by CSL since its establishment in 1916 but were not transferred to CSL at the time it became a statutory authority in 1961. In relation to the 'transferring assets', the Bill contains specific provisions which ensure that, for taxation purposes, CSL is treated as if it had acquired these assets at the time they were acquired by the Commonwealth. Provision has been made in the Bill for the issued shares to be divided into classes to which rights can be attached. This allows for the Commonwealth to have rights in relation to the existing serum fractionation operation, which is an important community service operation and will not become part of CSL's fully commercial operations. This provision also allows for the Commonwealth to have rights in relation to the sale of the land at CSL. The Bill then provides for the establishment of CSL as a company through the registration of the memorandum and articles of association for CSL with the National Companies and Securities CommissiorI. The Bill removes controls, such as the requirement for the Treasurer's approval for individual borrowing arrangements, and investment and banking arrangements. However, CSL will remain subject to the Loan Council global borrowing limits and will be liable for the Commonwealth borrowing levy on any borrowings. It will, however, forgo all forms of Government guarantee and will not be able to claim protection from the shield of the crown. The Bill also contains consequential amendments to other Acts to ensure that the new company remains subject to the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987, and exempt from the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The schedule to the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No.1) 1930, which identifies those Commonwealth bodies which are not exempt from sales tax, will be amended to delete reference to CSL. Nonetheless, as a company, CSL will continue to pay sales tax. The Bill does not involve additional expenditure by the Commonwealth or additional revenue to the Commonwealth; nor does it involve any State and Territory taxes on the transfer of assets in recognition fact that there has been no change in the Commonwealth's beneficial ownership. The Bill implements a further stage of the Government's program of micro-economic reform by removing another Government business enterprise from the restrictions of day-today regulatory control, whilst ensuring that strategic oversight of performance and efficiency is maintained. It is also a further step in the Government's efforts to encourage value-added manufacture within Australia without the requirement for underpinning by the Commonwealth. At the same time it recognises CSL's significant contribution to the Australian community in the past and present. I commend the Bill to the House. I now present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Beale) adjourned. NA CIVIL AVIATION FACILITIES, NA Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",67
137,Mr WEST ,DARWIN AIRPORT,"Cunningham-Minister for Administrative Services) (4.35)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Northside development of civil aviation facilities Darwin airport. This proposed work, recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, involves the development by the Federal Airports Corporation of civil aviation facilities on the northern side of Darwin Airport. Members familiar with Darwin Airport will be aware that the existing domestic terminal is substandard and that it is housed in a converted Second World War Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) hangar. It is also surrounded by operational areas of the RAAF base and is congested and incapable of further expansion. I know that the local Federal member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Snowdon) will be delighted, along with his constituents, that this project is proceeding under the Hawke of the Labor Government. The local member has worked tirelessly in convincing the Government of the need for this work to be done, and he has beaten a well worn path to my door on many occasions seeking this result. Mr Deputy Speaker, the work is a very major work for the Northern Territory. It will involve the construction of a new twostorey air-conditioned terminal building, with the apron space sufficient to accommodate two international and six domestic aircraft. It will include a new administration building and adjoining workshop and also a new taxiway link to the main runway. There will be a new access road from MCMillans Road, plus ancillary roads within the development areas. There will be parking for 550 cars, plus parking for buses, taxis and staff. It will include a new general aviation taxiway and apron capable of providing 100 aircraft parking positions, and it will provide for the servicing of all developments with water, sewerage, drainage and electrical works, which were left incomplete from the previous preparation when that ceased back in 1985. This proposed work also recognises the unavoidable peaking of Darwin's domestic air movements and allows for anticipated growth in domestic, international and general aviation traffic up until early next tury. The total cost of this project is estimated at $72m at May 1989 prices. This amount is exclusive of future cost escalation but includes an allowance of $15m for detailed design and contract management costs and for contingencies. The Federal Airports Corporation's current program anticipates completion by mid to late 1991. It is estimated that the project will create employment for an average of 225 on-site workers and will peak at a maximum of 500. The proposal will be funded by the Federal Airports Corporation from non-Budget sources and will incorporate measures to meet the needs of the tourist and business traveller. It will greatly assist the Northern tory by boosting construction activity and providing an attractive gateway to the internationally renowned tourist attractions in the Top End. However, despite the obvious support for the project by the Public Works Committee, a number of the Committee's recommendations require some comment from me. First, the Corporation has consulted extensively with the airlines throughout this development process, including continuing discussions with the domestic airlines since the Committee's hearing. The main focus of these discussion has been on additions to the work rather than on any reductions. The airlines have not only been given project cost breakdowns, as recommended by the Public Works Committee, but the cost of various alternatives raised by the airlines. The Corporation is currently seeking tenders for the design and construction of the proposed development. In response to the Committee's report, tenderers have now been asked to price two additional aerobridges, the additional taxiway and some other alternatives since discussed with the airlines. However, a decision to proceed on these additions will depend on the prices quoted and on their commercial viability. Regarding the matter of stormwater discharge, the Federal Airports Corporation has appointed the Northern Territory Power and Water Authority to collect baseline data and monitor discharges into Rapid Creek. Regular reports will also be made to an environmental working group, which includes the Darwin City Council and the Northern Tercen- ritory Conservation Commission. The Committee's suggestion that it be given quarterly cost estimates and progress reports is not consistent with established practice. The Committee is normally given an aI1nual report on each project referred to it. This report covers construction progress, a revised estimate of cost and advice of any significant changes that may have occurred along the way. The Federal Airports Corporation has to its credit, undertaken to inform the Committee of the outcome of the current tendering process immediately the final contract price is agreed with the successful tenderer, but wishes to discuss with the Committee the requested extent of further reporting. 1 thank the Public Works Committee for this Terriprompt report. It has a very heavy work load and, by the end of next week, it will have an even heavier one-and 1 commend the motion to the House.",70
138,Mr BEALE ,DARWIN AIRPORT,"Deakin) (4.40)-1 should start by thanking the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) for making available to me most of the statement that he made today. He did not make available to me his preamble on the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Snowdon), and what 1 say about that is that 1 smell a pork barrel. That is, no doubt, why the Minister prefaced his remarks in such a way that he did not communicate them to me. But 1 thank him for making his statement available. It is about time that the development of civil aviation facilities at Darwin Airport received approval. This thing has been going on for five years. People passing through Darwin have been looking at the tower standing there and regarding it as a white elephant. It is interesting to speculate on why the Minister, who admits that the Public Works Committee has a heavy work load, has sought to bring this development on in the middle of the pilots strike. Although the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) says the pilots strike is over, the people of the Northern Territory, and the people of Darwin, do not think like that, because tourism has been truncated. I notice the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories ( Mr Holding) at the table giving me a wry smile, because he knows what has happened to tourism in the Northern Territory. He knows how it has been decimated by the pilots strike and the ongoing difficulties that exist in the Northern Territory. As I say, it is very interesting at this time, when the Minister acknowledges that the Public Works Committee has a very heavy workload, he should bring on this project. If that Committee has a heavy workload, this project could have been deferred for a while because, let us face it, no tourists are going through Darwin now. I notice that the honourable member for the Northern Territory has scuttled back into the chamber. I am glad he is here for my , remarks today-he did not stop and listen to them last night after having been a bit abusive. He should take a great deal of notice of what we are saying because the only reason this motion is before us today is that the honourable member is in some trouble in the Northern Territory. He wants to be able to go to his constituents and say, 'Look what those in Canberra have done for me. Look at the money they are going to spend up here'. The honourable member should also try to explain to his constituents how the economy of the Northern Territory is being decimated by the pilots strike. I The Opposition supports the proposals contained in the report and we supported the referral to the Committee. We seek assurances from the Committee that it will convey to the Minister certain concerns that we have about this project. Although the airport design allows for the extension of facilities for an extra carrier after deregulation of the domestic airline industry, and there is a common user provision, we want the Committee to ensure that these provisions-MONICA",71
139,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,DARWIN AIRPORT,Mr Mountford)-Order! I wish to clarify the situation. The motion that the Minister has moved is for the work to be carried out. The project has actually been to the Committee and the Committee has recommended the matter to Parliament.,72
140,Mr BEALE,DARWIN AIRPORT,"I am just telling the Minister what we want from him. We want some assurances. The first assurance that we want is that, although the airport design allows for extension of facilities for an extra carrier after the deregulation of domestic airlines, and there is a common user provision, we want these provisions to be carried out as soon as possible, as we understand that at that least one other airline needs space at the airport following deregulation at the end of 1990. This matter will be a problem at most of the Federal Airports Corporation airports around Australia. This Government entered into arrangements with the two domestic carriers-that is, Australian Airlines Ltd and Ansett Airlines of Australia-on airport user facilities before the Federal Airports Corporation was formed, and when the Federal Airports Corporation was formed the Government dumped these contracts on it. Airline terminals around Australia are virtually locked up by the two domestic airlines. It has been for me, for some time, the source of some suspicion that the Government should have entered into these arrangements and not allowed the Federal Airports Corporation, which was in the process of being formed at the time, to do so. We want an assurance from the Minister that at this airport there will be a common user provision which will allow additional airlines to operate from the terminal after deregulation. In his speech the Minister spoke about the unavoidable peaking of Darwin's domestic air movements. I can tell the Minister that there are not many domestic air movements going through Darwin at the moment. It is also of some concern-and I referred to this earlier-that an almost identical report was produced and tabled in this House in 1984. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will recall very well that at that time the Prime Minister, in his 1984 campaign-in yet another broken undertaking to the Australian people-promised that those plans, which involved very similar proposals to those we are considering today, would be carried out without delay. That was five years ago. All I can tell the Minister is that we do not want another delay of five years. If the Government's policies have provided trouble for the Northern Territory-I notice the honourable member for the Northern Territory squirming uncomfortably in his seatand, believe me, brother, they have with what has happened with tourism up there, another five years would just about kill it off. The 1984 report recommended nine proposals at a cost, then, of $95m. This year the cost has been estimated at $72m with only five recommendations. It seems there has been a drastic re-thinking and downgrading of the plans for Darwin. We would like an assurance from the Minister that what he has put in front of us today will do what it is supposed to do, which is meet the needs of the domestic and international airlines at the Darwin terminal. We also know now-and this is partly as a result of a question by my colleague Senator Tambling-that the Civil Aviation Authority is planning to abolish the air traffic controllers at Darwin and have them at least partially relocated to Perth and Adelaide by January 1991. It is interesting to speculate on how the Government can justify this move or allow it to take place. The Minister cannot tell me the Government has no authority over the Civil Aviation Authority. The Government told the Civil Aviation Authority to waive the landing fees for Australian Airlines and Ansett. How can the Government justify this move of taking away local air traffic controllers when the airport is finally to be developed-and we hope we mean 'finally to be developed'-into a meaningful gateway into Australia and the Northern Territory? Paragraph 1 of the recommendations ·and conclusions to the 1984 report stated: Facilities at Darwin Airport for international and domestic passengers and aircraft are grossly deficient and measures designed to rectify the situation should be implemented. The Committee was then under the chairmanship of Senator Foreman, a member of the Australian Labor Party. Now, in 1989, five years later, it says that the existing civil aviation facilities at Darwin Airport, particularly the terminal division, are inadequate and substandard. What's news? We would like to stress that the frustration experienced by the public of the Northern Territory is completely justified considering that nothing has happened between 1984 and now and completely justified by the fact that the Prime Minister, during the 1984 election campaign, publicly sat on the bulldozers at the airport and promised that all efforts would be made to rectify this grossly deficient infrastructure of Darwin's link to the rest of Australia. At last the Government seems to be getting on with it, although the timing looks a bit suspect and it is probably for the wrong reasons. We support the proposals contained in the report and urge the Minister most strongly that there be no delays and cutbacks experienced after this report, as there were in 1984.",72
141,Mr SNOWDON ,DARWIN AIRPORT,"Northern Territory) (4.51)-It is a privilege for me to endorse this motion before the House this afternoon to expedite the development of Darwin Airport terminal facilities. I compliment the Standing Committee on Public Works and the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) on the expeditious way in which they have handled this matter. I point out, for the benefit of the honourable member for Deakin ( Mr Beale), that this program was promised by this Government at the last election. It promised it would get about-Mr Beale-Promised in 1984 and did nothing for five years.",73
142,Mr SNOWDON,DARWIN AIRPORT,"The noteworthy difference is that after 1984 you had Paul Everingham, brother. And what did Paul Everingham do to represent the Northern Territory's interests? Did he get an airport? He could not have got out of the road in a week. What did he do? Mr Beale-He did more than you did.",73
143,Mr SNOWDON,DARWIN AIRPORT,"How long did the selfappointed front bencher last? He is like the honourable member for Deakin, who lasted about a fortnight. The honourable member is not worth a bumper. 1 take great pride in the fact that I, along with my colleague Senator Bob Collins, have been able to push this project through the organs of government. We have been able to achieve something quite outstanding, given the fiscal restraint of the Government. I would like to point out too the contradictions which have been put by the Opposition spokesman. On the one hand he has been kicking the can about the Government in previous years deferring this development and on the other hand he has been arguing that the Government's fiscal policy is not tight enough.",73
144,Mr HOLDING ,DARWIN AIRPORT,Year after year.,74
145,Mr SNOWDON,DARWIN AIRPORT,"As the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories says, year after year those opposite come into this place and say how much tighter fiscal policy should be. Do they say that to. the Northern Territory Government? Do they tell it what it can expect if ever they get onto the treasury bench? Do those opposite tell the Northern Territory Government what it can expect if they are fortunate enough to win the next election-God forbid they will not be? Do those opposite tell the Northern Territory Government that whilst they come in here and say that this Government is not doing the right job, they want it to cut expenditure further and that they are targeting regional Australia? Mr Beale-Haven't you read our Economic Action Plan?",74
146,Mr SNOWDON,DARWIN AIRPORT,"As a matter of fact I have read the Opposition's Economic Action Plan. It is catastrophic for Northern Australia. As the Prime Ministers ( MrHawke) clearly articulated today in the debate in House, the difference between the Opposition and the Government on economic matters, as on social issues, as on development issues and responsible fiscal management, is as wide as the Great Australian Bight. It could never be wider. When we come to the next election the electorate will know that the rhetoric of the Opposition spokesman on fiscal management in the House today is just . that: rhetoric. He knows full well that the timetable that this Government has been operating on in relation to Darwin Airport since the 1987 election has been to have it on track by the end of this year. It gives me great pride to be able to stand here today and see this motion go through the House. There is no question about the development of Darwin Airport. As we will see in the coming week, neither is there any question about the development of the Alice Springs air terminal. There is no question about this Government's commitment to the supporting and developing of infrastructure in the tourism. and otht<r industries in the top end of Australia and, in this case, infrastructure relating to air terminals. The honourable member opposite might like to say that this is a pork barrelling exercise. When he started to speak he implied that it would be appropriate to defer this a little longer. Would he tell the Northern Territory community what he would do if he were the Minister responsible? Would he seek to defer this project? My guess is that the answer would be yes. There is no doubt what the Opposition's motives and priorities are. It has no real interest in northern Australia. It has never had a real interest in northern Australia. When it has had someone down here representing northern Australia's interests, he has not done a sod of work to achieve the objectives for which he would have been sent down here.",74
147,Mr HOLDING ,DARWIN AIRPORT,Probably sell it cheap to John Elliott.,74
148,Mr SNOWDON,DARWIN AIRPORT,"That is right. The Opposition will do deals with its mate-the Foster father. In any event, the other important issueand I commend the Federal Airports Corporation for the work it has been doing-is this that the FAC has given assurances to the Northern Territory business community, and indeed to the Northern Territory community generally, of its timetable. It will address those issues in terms of the construction timetable. It has also given assurances to the Northern Territory community that it will give maximum opportunity for local suppliers and contractors to participate in the project both in Darwin and in Alice Springs . There is no doubt that the tourism industry has been drastically hurt by the pilots' actions. But I make this point: not one person I have spoken to in the Northern Territory supports the position adopted by the Opposition in relation to the pilots' actions. As everyone in Australia well knows, the apologists for the pilots' actions are those opposite. Almost to a person, people I have spoken to in the Northern Territory have said that the Government has handled this issue in the appropriate way: we should never give into the pilots. That· is not to say however that great sacrifices have not been made. Indeed, many businesses have been hurting. That has been recognised by the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories, who is at the table. In the package which Cabinet discussed last week and which was brought down, particular moneys were identified for relief of northern Australia. That indicates not only to this House but also to the people outside this House the interest that the Government has in ensuring that northern Australia is not adversely affected by matters which we cannot control. We are at least able to provide some support for those companies and businesses in terms of advertising campaigns so that they can attract tourists during the next tourist season. However that does not shift the blame from the pilots or the Opposition for at least the initial stages of the dispute and the lengths to which they have tried to blackmail the Australian community into submission. They have attempted to blackmail the Northern Territory community as they have attempted to blackmail the rest of the Australian community. It is true that probably the most disadvantaged people in Australia as a result of the pilots' actions have been the people of northern Australia. The Opposition stands condemned for the position it has taken in the pilots dispute and the way in which it has acquiesced to the sorts of tactics used by the pilots. The Opposition has not come out against the pilots to ensure that services op- six storeys. erate expeditiously in northern and remote Australia. The motion before the House indicates the integrity of this Government in meeting its commitments and promises made in 1987. I repeat that these have been assisted by the work of the Public Works Committee and the Minister for Administrative Services and the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories, who are both at the table. It also indicates the importance of ensuring that areas such as northern Australia, in this case Darwin, have the development infrastructure which is so important to the economic development of communities. In view of the fact that this motion will be passed and also the fact that preliminary work has already started-including, as the Minister said during the course of his address, work being undertaken by the Northern Territory Government on behalf of the Federal Airports Corporation-the terminal is a reality, despite the protestations made by the honourable member for Deakin. His feral outcries will fall on deaf ears. Question resolved in the affirmative. STAGE 2 DEVELOPMENT OF NA CENTRE, HOBART Approval of Work: Public Works Committee Act",74
149,Mr WEST ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Cunningham-Minister for Administrative Services) (5.00)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Stage 2 development of Commonwealth Government Centre, Hobart. This proposed public work is for the construction of stage 2 of the Commonwealth Government Centre, Hobart. It will, when completed, accommodate staff from various government departments, including the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security. The proposal provides for the construction of 9,200 square metres of office accommodation. The building is designed in a form which wraps around the existing tower building and plaza, varying in height above street level from three to Despite actions by my Department over the past three years to rationalise departmental accommodation, Commonwealth departments are spread across 27 buildings in the Hobart area. In total, the Commonwealth currently occupies approximately 48,380 square metres of office accommodation in Hobart, made up of 63 per cent leased and 30 per cent government-owned space. This project will increase the Commonwealth-owned level of accommodation in Hobart to around 50 per cent. At the same time, it will maximise the full commercial development potential of the site. This is consistent with the Government's objective of increasing the proportion of owned office space, reducing overall rental costs and providing accommodation which will enhance efficiency of operation and delivery of services to the public. The honourable member for Denison ( Mr Kerr), who is in the chamber now, has closely followed this project from its inception and the realisation of approval for the work is due, in my opinion, in no small part to the local member's efforts. He has consistently drawn my attention to the fact that I have put to· the House-that is, that there is a huge spread of leased accommodation across 30 different office sites in Hobart. As a result of the honourable member's work, the Government has agreed to go ahead with this major project in the capital of Tasmania. The project will provide some valuable employment opportunities in the Hobart construction industry, which has been experiencing a moderate downturn recently. About 150 people are likely to be employed on this site at the peak of construction. There will also be benefits with the increased activity in the supply and services industries. In June 1989 we agreed in this House to refer this proposal to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for examination and report. The Committee has duly tabled its report and has accepted the need for the development. In its report, the Committee recommended that the Department of Administrative Services should complete its current review of the policy on the provision of car parking at Commonwealth offices. I can report that this review is well under way and will take into account the comments made by the Committee in the body of its report. The Committee has recommended that construction proceed on Stage 2 of the Commonwealth Government Centre, Hobart at an estimated cost of $19.9m, at May 1989 prices. When it is completed it will be a major addition to office accommodation in the city of Hobart. I commend the motion to the House.",75
150,Mr BEALE ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,Deakin) (5.05)-I wish to begin my remarks by thanking the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) for making available to me the document which is headed 'House of Representatives Motion'. I do not wish to sound churlish about this because I appreciate the Minister giving me this information in advance-Mr West-I always do.,76
151,Mr BEALE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"And I always thank you. But the Minister has deviated a little from the document that I received. He referred to the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Kerr). I think I can understand why he did not give me advance notice of this by putting it in the document that he gave to me. I will just say one thing about the honourable member for Denison. The cry in Hobart for the last two years has been, 'Bring Michael back'. I can tell the honourable member for Denison-that oneer up there-that after the next election the cry of the people of Hobart will be met and we will have Michael Hodgman back in the Parliament. It does not matter what the Minister says about the honourable member for Denison in regard to this motion. It does not matter what else the Minister might say about the honourable member. Despite the flattery that the Minister has bestowed on the honourable member today, the people of Hobart and the electors of Denison will bring Michael back.",76
152,Mr HOLDING ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,You don't really believe that.,76
153,Mr BEALE,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"I believe it all right. Let me say that, as a distinguished former Minister for Housing and Construction, Michael Hodgman will make a great contribution to the Liberal and National parties in our next government after the next election. The coalition does' not object to this motion. I would like to make two brief points. The first is that if the honourable member for Denison were really all that clever in provoking the Minister to get on with this job one would have to ask why the honourable member has allowed, over the two and a bit years that he has been the member for Denison, Commonwealth departments to spread across some 27 buildings in the Hobart area. If he is all that good, why did he not go to the Minister when Commonwealth departments in Hobart spread over 15, 20 or 25 buildings? Why wait until the Commonwealth departments spread over some 27 buildings in the Hobart area? I do not think the honourable member for Denison has done anything. I think that the Minister and the Government are simply running scared, not only about him but also about the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Snowdon) in regard to the previous motion that was before us. The second point that I want to make relates to the remarks made by the Minister. He said, 'This is consistent with Government objectives of increasing the proportion offices to owned office space'. That Government's policy. But when we have the prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) getting up in Parliament as he did today and saying to the Parliament and the people of Australia that the Government is running the tightest fiscal policy that has been seen for a generation, why is the Government spending capital funds on this sort of thing? It is open to Government to make a decision on whether it chooses to own its office space or to it. We do not quarrel with the Government in making that decision. But it is quite sistent for the Government to make the dethis cision that it has made here on the one hand and, on the other hand, for the Prime ister to say, as he did, that he is running the tightest fiscal policy for a generation. Clearly, what the Prime Minister said today with regard to this matter is rubbish. I must say that almost everything else he said today rubbish. I wish to draw these two points to the attention of the House. The first point lates to the inefficiency and incompetence the Government and the honourable member for Denison in allowing government partments to spread over 27 buildings in Hobart area. Secondly, given that the Govtaped ernment wants to increase the proportion owned office space, the way is not clear the Prime Minister to be saying, as he did today, that the Government is running the tightest fiscal policy in a generation. The coalition takes no objection to this motion.",76
154,Mr KERR ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Denison) (S.10)-When I was elected as the representative of the people Hobart in the seat of Denison, I fpund situation in my electorate of some real concern because there had not been attention detail or the kind of constructive approach to Commonwealth projects that one would have expected from a local representative. As a matter of urgency I took of projects that seemed to me to be very important for the economic future of State. First amongst those projects is the that is under discussion today. I am very proud to be judged in terms of a record. achievement. Very few members in a first term in this House would be able to stand up and say that, in terms of what they have advocated, argued for and succeeded in of achieving, they have seen their electorate is the benefit in such a substantial way. This project is as excellent a proposal as the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West), who is at the table, has indicated, but two other major capital works projects have been agreed on for Denison. Firstly, a $10m project at the university funded by the Minister for Employment, Education and Trainthe ing ( Mr Dawkins)-the Centenary buildingwill house the new Institute of Antarctic and lease Southern Ocean Studies. Again this is an initiative which I and the Prime Minister incon- ( Mr Hawke) worked for and achieved in term. Secondly, the Australian Taxation Office has announced that it will be estabMinlishing a new headquarters complementary to the initiative for the Stage 2 building, valued at approximately $20m. So we will see delivered in the electorate of Denison three major capital works projects totalling over was $SOm-the largest contribution in terms of capital works projects by a Commonwealth Government in the last 20 years. That outrestrips all else-take away the rhetoric and of the childish outbursts. I just wish that the cynical laughter of the dehonourable member for Deakin ( Mr Beale) the when the Minister was speaking could be recorded and replayed to the people of of Hobart so that they could hear exactly for what he thinks of them and the contempt with which the Opposition treats matters of substance when they come before this House. Frankly, the innuendo that the projects that are coming before this House have in some way a political component needs to be reof sisted entirely. The next matter on the list a of Government notices, for example, concerns a project in the electorate of Groom. to These matters are being proceeded with not on the basis of some sort of cynical electoral equation but on the basis of necessity established by hard work. I am proud to say that up a number I put in the hard work. I wish to say a couple of words in commy mendation of the Chairman of the Joint one Committee of Public Works, the honourable member for Throsby ( Mr Hollis). The reof cord of the hearings in Hobart would be my testament to the part I have played in this project. At that meeting the representative of the Hobart City Council, a man called Mr Hurburgh. - came forward to the Public Works Committee. He may not be known to the honourable member for Deakin, but he is a prominent member of the Liberal Party in Tasmania. He is also a member of the Hobart City Council and in charge of its planning committee. Asked provocatively by aLiberal member of the Public Works Committee about the role that 1 had played, he indicated that my contribution had been outstanding in terms of changing the way the City Council saw the project, getting it on side and making sure that there was a commit-ent in Hobart 100 per cent behind this project. I am delighted to see the fruits of that and to be associated now with what will certainly be a successful project. Firstly, the project will be economically important to the State of Tasmania, coming as it does at a time when the State Government is having to draw back from its own capital works projects because of the way in which the previous State Liberal Government in Tasmania squandered its budget resources. The incoming Labor Administration has had to defer its capital works projects. We have been fortunate in being able to come forward with a number of major and important capital projects which will be vital for the well-being of the economic future of Tasmania. Secondly, it is important because from a design point of view it is complementary to. the existing streetscape of Hobart. Hobart IS a most beautiful city. It is a city to be proud of, to live in and to visit. The present monwealth Government Centre IS not perhaps the most attractive building in Hobart. The Stage 2 development, the wraparound building, is much more sympathetic to the traditional Hobart streetscape. 1 place on record my regard for the work of Harry Leong, the project architect who was able to design a building which will not only be successful as a place of work but also beautiful to the people of Hobart. 1 do not want to take up the time of the House with any great self-serving statements. I am proud to have done what 1I have done in the service of the people of my electorate and to be judged as a fighter for the State of Tasmania. 1 will not respond to the rather cynical comments of the honourable member for Deakin; 1 merely say: Let us make those judgments after the event and see what the proof of the pudding actually is. Mr MCGauran- Mr Deputy Speaker, 1 raise a point of order. 1 seek your guidance and a ruling as to whether or not the selfcongratulatory humbug just uttered. by the honourable member for Denison is relevant to the matter under discussion.",77
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,COMMONWEALTH GOVERNMENT,"Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. That is not a point of order. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA AVIATION CENTRE, OAKEY, NA Reference of Work: Public Works Committee Act",78
156,Mr WEST ,QUEENSLAND,"Cunningham-Minister for Administrative Services) (5.1·8)-I move: That in accordance with the provisions of the Public 'Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliam-ntary Standing Committee on Public Works for conslde-a­ tion and report: Redevelopment of the Army AVIation Centre at Oakey, Queensland. The Oakey Army Aviation Centre, situated on 220 hectares of land near the township of Oakey on the Darling Downs, 160 kilometres west of Brisbane, was originally established in 1941 for use by the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II. In 1969 the Army took control of the airfield and since then a number of developments have taken place, including provision of temporary and . Compermanent facilities for units currently located on the base. Today the airfield is home to the School of Army Aviation, 1st Aviation Regiment-with the exception of two squadrons located in Sydney and Townsville-1st Aviation Regiment Workshop, 173 General Support Squadron and Workshop, 5 Base Workshop Battalion and the Royal Australian Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Aircraft Maintenance School. All of these units are administratively coordinated and controlled by the headquarters Army Aviation Centre, which also located at the base. Currently the base houses 55 aircraft and approximately 196 vehicles and trailers and employs 734 Army personnel and 51 civilian staff. This employment figure is expected to rise to a total of 863 persons by 1995. The airfield at Oakey is a joint user aerodrome, the Department of Defence-Army-being the principal user with the Department of Transport and Communications as the ten1989 ant accounting for approximately 15 per cent of total aircraft movements. In line with this Government's commitmittee ment to enhance our defence capabilities, and as stressed in the Defence Policy Inforexpected mation Paper of 1987, there is a continued need for Army aviation assets and an extentunities sive infrastructure of bases, airfields, training and other facilities to support the operations of the Australian defence forces. The centre at Oakey is a major part of that infrastrucredevelopment ture providing the core for both training and support for the Army throughout Australia. Oakey was described in the Cooksey review of Australia's Defence facilities as conducive to aircraft operations is the preferred possible site, over Fairbairn, for any tri-service helicopter pilot training school. The works currently before the House aimed at rectifying significant occupational health and safety deficiencies and upgrading working conditions at the base. In particular, stage 1 will involve the construction of manent facilities for 1 Aviation Regiment, which still occupies, temporary facilities structed in 1969, and 173 General Support Squadron. Extension to the existing hangar and technical facilities used by 1 Aviation Regiment workshop and extension-refurbishour ment of aircraft maintenance facilities for Base Workshop Battalion are also included, along with civil work and extensions to exa isting engineering services. In addition, Police Dog Section will be relocated to facilities on the base. Once complete these works will provide purpose designed working facilities for Army units located on the base, ensure the ued provision of services undertaken at the airfield and provide a centralised helicopter pilot training school once training facilities churlish. are complete next year. As part of the training school, a number of Black Hawk helicopWentworth ters will eventually be housed at Oakey. second stage of redevelopment at Oakey is also being planned to address less urgent problems but it is not expected to be undersafety taken for several years. This staging of reconditions development is due to financial constraints within the Department of Defence. The limit of .cost for the stage 1 redevelopment is estimated at $14.6m at September prices. The proposed works are expected to go to tender in September 1990, subject to a favourable Public Works Comreport, with progressive completion through to 1994. The proposed works are to, provide employment for up to 80 personnel on site and substantial opporfor local contractors and subcontractors as well as suppliers of building materials, plant and equipment in the Oakey area. I table selected plans of the proposed stage 1 at Oakey and I commend the aviation motion to the House.",78
157,Mr BEALE ,QUEENSLAND,"Deakin) (5.24)-Again I thank the Minister for Administrative Servand ices ( Mr West) for making available to me a copy of his motion and his remarks today. I point out to the Minister that, for the first time today, he has given me a faithful version of what he said. It cannot be a coinciare dence that, in regard to the two previous motions, which happen t6 involve projects in the electorates of Labor members, the Minister, without giving me any notice of it, took persome time to commend the activities of two honourable members, who have scuttled from conthe chamber, in regard to those projects. As I understand it, Oakey is in the electorate of Groom, which is represented by distinguished member for Groom ( Mr 5 Taylor). Given his background, he has almost certainly ,made acontributiori. To use word that I used earlier today, it is very the churlish of the Minister not to give some new credit to the honourable member for Groom just because he happens to be a member of the coalition. I think it is unworthy of, the Minister to give all the credit for the projects continin Hobart and Darwin to Labor members but no credit whatsoever to the honourable member for Groom. The Minister has been My colleague the honourable member for (Dr Hewson) has arrived., The A Opposition welcomes this much needed initiative which, as the Minister states, aims to rectify 'significant' exceptional health and deficiencies and upgrading working at the base'. This reflects an uncharacteristic concern on the Government's part for the welfare of our service men and women. The Government has treated Australia's Defence Force men and women in a shocking and disgraceful fashion over the last few years. As I have said, this reflects an uncharacteristic concern on the Government's part. Given that the Minister would not even give credit to the honourable member for Groom it is not surprising that I say that this is an uncharacteristic concern. I would like to make a couple of points regarding the Minister's speech. The Minister made reference to the 1987 Defence White Paper and the stress that that paper placed on the development of Army aviation. While the Opposition supports the Government's decision on the purchase of the Black Hawk helicopters for the Army, which will be based in Townsville, we deplore the nonsensical initiative to sell off the Chinook heavy-lift helicopters. It is a matter of public record that no single body within the defence community understands the strategic rationale on which the Government has based its decision to scrap the Chinooks. Indeed, in responding to the claim of the Minister for Defence ( Mr Beazley) this year that scrapping the 11 Chinooks would give him an extra $llOm to spend on the big ticket items, my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Carlton), the Opposition defence spokesman, quite rightly pointed out that the Minister's figures were rubbery and overlooked the capability which the Chinooks provide the Australian Defence Force. On this issue we join with the Returned Services League analysts and academics in urging the Minister to support the Army's recommendation that a limited number of Chinooks be retained and upgraded. They are a vital battlefield asset without which the Defence Force would be at a disadvantage in any potential future conflict contingencies. One final issue that needs touching upon relates to the Minister's reference to the 1987 Cooksey review of Australia's defence facilities. In that document the most damning indictment on the Government's management of the 1,150 establishments that the Defence Department controls is that, at the time Cooksey'submitted his report, there was no comprehensive defence policy on facilities, neither was there evidence of a long term facilities planning document. The Budget Papers reveal that the appropriation for the defence facilities vote for 1989-90 is some $480m. It is hard to believe that the Defence Minister could allow such a large amount of money to be diverted to a defence function without the existence of a strategic policy planning document on which proposed expenditure is based. My colleague the honourable member for Mackellar has made this point repeatedly this year when the Minister for Administrative Services has given notice to refer defence facilities proposals to the Public Works Committee. The coalition does not object to this motion. I again reprimand the Minister for failing, in contrast to the two previous motions, to draw the attention of the Parliament and the Australian people to the fact that the honourable member for Groom has made a contribution to what has been happening at the Army aviation centre at Oakey. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA (No.5) 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed.",79
158,Dr HEWSON ,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"Wentworth) (5.30)-Before my remarks on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) were interrupted I was focusing on changes to the arrangements for the payment of company tax. I was emphasising the fact that these were driven by the arrogance, ego and greed of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) in wanting a Budget surplus that was bigger than it otherwise would have been by nearly $1 billion. It was designed to make him look good at the considerable expense of the small and medium size business community which was being hit to leg by yet another government policy as a result of that change. In that sense it was an absolutely draconian change which was not thought through. I doubt whether any consideration was given to the likely impact on small business in current circumstances. It reveals an appalling understanding of the nature and plight of small business in this country at present. This is evidenced by a whole lot of things that the Government has been doing, most recently the pilots dispute and the fact that the Treasurer was running around the country claiming that it was not having a significant impact on most of Australia because he had been staying in a Sydney hotel and he found the occupancy rate quite high. He ignores the fact that small business all over the place in other parts of the country, in northern Queensland, northern Western Australia, the Northern Territory and parts of South Australia and Tasmania, have been hit to leg by that dispute. There is a similar type of attitude on the part of this Government when it comes to the treatment of small business. In my earlier remarks I drew attention to our decision to amend this Bill in a couple of important respects. In particular, I referred to the fact that I had announced our position by way of press release on this Bill before this debate got under way. I read into the record a second reading amendment to that effect which was designed to draw attention to two major deficiencies of the Bill. I foreshadowed that if time allowed, and we were not prevented by the guillotine, at the committee stage I would move the details of those amendments. In all seriousness, given the considerable plight of small business in current circumstances in Australia, I would strongly urge the Government to look at those second reading and committee stage amendments and if possible pick them up, particularly the amendment that relates to the increase in the threshold in which the new instalment arrangements will apply. We have identified that as consistent with roughly a taxable income of $200,000 per year or a tax payable amount of about $80,000 a year which is roughly four times .the Government's threshold. I put it to the Government that there is an urgent need on the part of small to medium sized business. I urge the Government to respond favourably to our initiative. To my mind this is the minimum immediate relief that is required in order to minimise the damage done by this Bill from the point of view of the small to medium size business sector. I seek to emphasise that it is the minimum immediate relief required. We have emphasised that we do not like the decision at all. We have given a firm undertaking to review this feature of the Bill when in government. In moving that amendment I was identifying how we intended to fund that change to the threshold. Unlike the Government, we have accepted the need to fund fully amendments to the taxation system and changes in budgetary arrangements. I was informing the House when the debate was interrupted that we would meet the cost of that decision this year by reversing the Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd decision of the Government and by terminating the payment of compensation to the airline industry. We make absolutely no apology for the fact that in taking that funding decision we are blatantly moving against the interests of a particular large multinational, Kodak, and a large domestic company, such as Ansett Airlines, deliberately in favour of small businesses right across Australia. We think that is the only reasonable decision in present circumstances. Our decision will have an impact upon the public debt interest next year. That too will be funded by a reversal of the Kodak and similar decisions and to the extent necessary from our larger prospective surplus that we have identified in the Economic Action Plan. I make one side remark on the costings in taxation Bills. It has come to our attention that most of these costings put out by the Government in many cases are pretty much fictional. We have not been able to duplicate some of the costings that have been associated with this piece of legislation and other taxation changes. I would like to know the detail of the assumptions under which, for example, there was an estimate of a continuing public debt interest saving of $330m. What was assumed there in relation to the tax deductability of the interest costs of meeting those increased tax payments? One of my colleagues, the honourable member for Sturt ( Mr Wilson), will be taking this point up in more detail in his contribution to this debate. I also query the decision requiring companies to pay 85 per cent of their tax just 15 days after the end of their tax year. This shows an appalling ignorance of how difficult it is in business to make that decision and to be in a position to meet that requirement. I do not think it will work. I do not think the corporate sector will be able to do it. I think that down the track the Government will change that feature of the decision, probably at a considerable cost to revenue. i do not think it can be done. Small to medium size business or even large business will be in very difficult circumstances under the penalty arrangements that exist in meeting that 15-day requirement for a payment of 85 per cent of the notational tax payable. I would like to finish my remarks with a few quick comments on the self-assessment decision which we also oppose. The committee stage amendment will seek to excise those relevant clauses from the Act. There has been a lot of concern amongst accountants about these new self-assessment provisions which substantially reduce what protection taxpayers received under previous legislation when they were able to make a full and true disclosure of contentious issues in their come tax return. The Bill contains no alternative mechanism for obtaining protection against the imposition of substantial tax alties in such cases, nor does it provide any mechanism for obtaining greater certainty from the tax system by way of binding rulings being obtained from the Commissioner for Taxation. Previously, the submission of a full and true disclosure awarded the taxpayer substantial protection against the imposition of high penalty levels on an adjustment related to an arguable issue. The new self-assessment provisions require an abridged form of tax return to be submitted which does not offer that protection. In short, the taxpayer will no longer be afforded the protection offered by his submission to the Tax. Office of all relevant information. According to the Tax Institute, under the amendments contained in the Bill lodgement of a return by a corporate taxpayer is deemed by the new section 166A to be an assessment made under the hand of the Commissioner. Thus, in its application to a corporate taxpayer, section 169A (2) does not permit a corporate taxpayer to require the Commissioner to give attention to a matter prior to assessment. In the absence of an amendment to section 169A (2) to permit corporate taxpayers to require the Commissioner to give attention to a matter before assessment, or at least prior to the date which a corporate taxpayer's return is required to be lodged, a corporate taxpayer has a greater potential for exposure to interin est penalties than an individual taxpayer. Unless corporate taxpayers can flag an issue of concern for consideration by the Commissioner without the potential for incurring penalties, corporate taxpayers will either be forced to take a risky course of action and not disclose an issue of concern or, alternatively, be required to incur additional financing costs in paying an amount of tax reflecting the Commissioner's view and seeking to object against that assessment. Moreover, the existing tax legislation for self-assessment is laced with a number of discretions that have been granted to the Commissioner as to whether to allow a deduction and the appropriate size of a deduction. Extending the self-assessment provisions without addressing the appropriateness of the in- discretions currently awarded to the Commissioner will just exacerbate the problems already in the system. The second reading penspeech of the Minister for Industrial RelaEmptyHere missioner reviewing his own internal administrative arrangements relating to the imposition of penalties and the issue of rulings and taxpayers. We do not think it is good enough. We think that the only way to deal with this is to pull it out. I am aware that the Tax Institute has written to the Treasurer basically expressing the view that it does not think that this part of the legislation in its current form is appropriate enough to go forward. In my final remarks in the few seconds that I have left I will comment on the very considerable work that was done by my colleague Senator John Watson on the issue of the deduct ability of certain costs associated with the filing of returns and so on. I want to put on record the phenomenal amount of work that Senator Watson did in organising allowable deductions for expenditure incurred by taxpayers in connection with the management and administration of their income tax affairs. It was a tremendous initiative on his part. I am pleased that the Government has picked it up, although Senator Watson has some concerns about the very wide nature of the drafting of, for exupon ample, section 69 (2), which he fears will potentially deprive a person of the intended tax deduction. He will deal with those points some detail in the debate in the Senate. Again, I put firmly on the record the considerable contribution that Senator Watson has made and how well that has been received by the profession.",80
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Andrew)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Is the amendment seconded? Mr MCGauran-1 second the amendment.,83
160,Mr MARTIN ,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"Macarthur) (5.41)-The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) is another in a series of taxation Bills which this Government has progressively introduced to make the system fairer and more equitable. Sadly, that point was missing from the contribution of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), who went into a long diatribe about the Bill's having nothing to do with tax reform. He said that it involved the rape of the small and' medium sized business sector. He talked about the ego and the credibility of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) and so on. Of course, that deflected totally from what is contained in this legislation. I will make some comments about his contribution in a moment. However, he will get his wish in respect of some changes being proposed by the Government, which have been introduced this afternoon by way of Government amendments. One of the major issues to which he referred was the time period by which tax is to be payable and due. In the Government's original proposition, it was to be made payable by the fifteenth day of the first month after the end of the income tax year. Unlike the Opposition, the Government has prided itself on its ability to discuss with practitionlier ers and people who will be affected by many of the pieces of legislation that it has enacted in order to get their feel for it and a full understanding of its implications. The end result has been an amendment moved by the Government to alter the fifteenth day to the twenty-eighth day. I believe that in itself will meet some of the concerns expressed by the honourable member for Wentworth. The second issue raised by the honourable member for Wentworth was with regard to the amount of tax payable. Again, an amendment is being proposed for $400,000 for the 1990 tax year, which is obviously a substantial increase, remaining in subsequent years at the $20,000 limit which the Government originally proposed. Again, this addresses the concerns raised by small business. It is nothing short of nonsense to suggest that this Government does not understand the workings of small to medium sized businesses. I am sure that all honourable members take a great deal of time to go and talk with those business people, to see for themselves the operations of small to medium sized businesses within their electorates and to encourage the development of those businesses. Ultimately, the development of those businesses means employment opportunities in those towns, cities and electorates that we all represent. The honourable member for Wentworth talked about none of those things. Rather, he said that this Government had an agenda to try to boost its surplus level and as a result it searched high and low and suddenly hit on small to medium sized businesses and said, 'Let us rape this sector of the economy and put legislation through to bring forward the payment date of taxation'. He then went on to say that this surplus would be made to look better than it otherwise would be. He implied that it would be a terrible thing for this Government to bring down a surplus. It would be, in the eyes of the honourable member for Wentworth, because, as we all remember, he was the adviser to the last Liberal Treasurer in the last coalition government, and when it left office 'surplus' was a dirty word. When it left office a $10 billion deficit was the flavour of the month-not a surplus. So it does not surprise those on this side of the House that in his comments eartoday on this legislation he tried to suggest that this Government's surplus was fudged in some way and made to look bigger than it really is. He said that this was simply pandering to the Treasurer's ego in trying to build in income sources that would make that surplus larger than it would otherwise be. The honourable member for Wentworth also said that there was Government greed in tax. It is the same tired old line that is constantly run by the Opposition. It conveniently forgets that this Government, in pursuing a fairer and more equitable tax system, has made some basic changes to the tax mix. What we have done for medium and small companies through this legislation further strengthens that position. It is true that is a greater tax take now for this GovernWentworth ment. But the Opposition conveniently gets why that is so. It is because there more people in jobs. One and a half million more people are in jobs than was 1983. So, yes, more people are paying tax. We have made the system fairer and more equitable. We have cracked down on the tax evasion and avoidance industry which, as Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) remarked in his contribution this afternoon, under ardship of the previous coalition government was the fastest growing industry in this country. We have cracked down on that. We have introduced a capital gains tax that fair by any Western country standards. have introduced a fringe benefits tax (FBT) to crack down on the free lunch merchants. Of course they are the people that those on the other side still seek to support. It is absolute nonsense for the honourable member for Wentworth to suggest, as he did this afternoon, that with the introduction the capital gains tax we were looking after our mates in the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the workers because House. we did not make the FBT applicable to canteens. By doing that, he said that we looking after our mates in the ACTU and the workers who are doing their job for Australia. What a hide he has to say that. Let us compare the capital gains tax with the speculative gains tax being proposed by those opposite. Less than one per cent of Australian population-the wealthiest one per cent-will benefit from the speculative gains tax: What the Opposition is proposing in its grubby exercise is to hand back lions-indeed, billions-of dollars by havpeople ing-Mr Rocher-I raise a point of order, Deputy Speaker. I draw your attention to the fact that the honourable member is not addressing the legislation before the Chair.",83

167,Mr MARTIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"As always, Mr Deputy were Speaker, I am encouraged by your counsel. The comments made just a moment ago by the honourable member for Wentworth about Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd have some relevance in relation to this matter as well. This goes back to what I was saying earlier about the people being employed and the fact that the tax level and the tax take, as referred to by honourable members opposite, are increasing. The Kodak decision was simply an effort milby the Government to ensure that SOO-plus kept their jobs. I am sure that members of this House would agree that it would Mr be of no consequence to a multinational company like Kodak whether it continues to operate in this country or not. But it is of consequence to this Government. We want to see people continue in employment. We to continue to be proud of our employof ment record, and that means that we are doing what we feel is necessary to pursue that line. In the few moments that I have left to speak on this legislation. I want to refer to the issue that was raised with regard to tax for the cost of professional tax advice. The honourable member for Wentworth sought to laud Senator Watson for the amount of work that he had done in bringing this matter to the attention of government. I do not know that that was necessarily the case. Mr Rocher-It was; there was a Bill passed in the Senate.",84
168,Mr MARTIN,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"I know that a great contribution was made in the Senate in relation to legislation. But I point out that a report of a committee of this House that was tabled in this place made the same recommendations. I am unsure, but I think at the time the honourable member for Wentworth was a member of that committee. He should perhaps check his records. He might not be as fulsome in his praise for a colleague in the other place if he finds that he was a member of a committee which made suggestions as to how legislation of this type, which includes tax deductability for the costs of professional tax advice, might proceed. The legislation makes a contribution to the continuing reform of the tax system in this country. The changes proposed in the amendments to be moved by the Government will perhaps soften some of the impact that some honourable members thought could be a concern. I feel confident in predicting that honourable members opposite will indicate that they do not believe that the measure goes far enough. I simply ask them to look at the amendment being proposed by the Government and take it at face value. They might perhaps come to the view that what is being proposed is fair and reasonable in the circumstances and that it does in fact make a contribution to the improvement of the tax system of this country.",85
169,Mr ROCHER ,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"Curtin) (5.54)-1 want to comment on one aspect of the contribution made by the previous speaker. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Martin) referred to members on the Government side talking to small business people and others to get their impressions of and opinions on legislation such as that presently before us. have no doubt that the honourable member is one of the people who do that. He is a conscientious member and I will miss him after the next election. Butl doubt whether the honourable member could, in all consCience, attribute that very worthwhile feature of his work to the Treasurer ( Mr Keating). The possibility that the Treasurer has spoken to anyone in the workplace is very remote indeed. This is reflected in the legislation presently before the House and in many of the Treasurer's deCisions and utterances. Among the many changes to the taxation laws proposed in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) is one which stipulates the earlier collection of company income tax. In making this change the Government is breaking new ground. It does not even offer the defence that it falls back on so often by claiming that, because another country does something, it is justified in doing something similar in Australia. That other refuge for defenders of the indefensible when all else fails, namely, invoking the 'public interest' or the 'national interest', has not even been attempted. I suppose we can be grateful for that. Apart from the obvious reason-that is, the need for this grasping Government to raise more and more revenue by way of increases in, and the earlier collection of, existing taxes-we have to go back to the Treasurer's Budget Speech for clues. We find there that the Treasurer offered us another of his little gems, to rank with the others, like the allusion to an effervescing economy. When all the magic figures on the balance of payments were starting to penetrate his thick skull, we were told that our cup runneth over. In the Budget Speech he foreshadowed this proposed assault on corporate Australia and added another shovelful to the pile of garbage that his words have built during his term in office. He said then: Because of these delays, companies enjoy an interest free loan from the Government for up to two years. We have decided to narrow this concessional arrangement. There we have it. All our previous beliefs about the right to the fruits of our labour go out the window. That is the gospel according to Paul. Well, all I can say is, heaven help I him. Only someone as arrogant as the Treasurer could come up with that. While the rest of us labour under the misapprehension that property in the form of income belongs to the individuals who or entities which earn it and that governments will take such part of it as will facilitate good government, the Treasurer regards it as being rightfully his from day one. If we should keep it any longer we are receiving concessional treatment and an interest free loan from the Government. That is the gospel according to Paul. Income taxes gathered by any government are an interest free loan to that government, the right having been ceded by the tax paying public, on trust, pending good government. Not so for our latter day apostle, Paul. Apparently it is his, in all his arrogant glory, to do with as he pleases. One outcome of the Treasurer's doubtful state of mind in this context will be an increase in this financial year of a one-off $880m to the budgeted surplus. The following year the measure will raise a further $130m and, after that, who knows? Some of the $880m this financial year will be attributable to income taxes payable earlier by companies which traditionally close their books perhaps during April or May. With that in mind, it might be assumed that an extra $880m-or more than $1 billion over two years-is not a great additional imposition on the corporate sector. However, there is considerably more to it than that. Within this and subsequent financial years, the majority of companies with 30 June balance dates will have to fork out huge sums earlier. Instead of the present arrangement involving payment by instalments of 25 per cent by 15 August, a further 25 per cent by 15 November and a further 25 per cent by 15 February, with the balance based on the actual tax payable due around 30 April, 85 per cent of notional profit will now be payable in the following Augustwithin a matter of weeks. Leaving aside the concept of notional profit as distinct from actual profit, it would take someone from among the majority with only a whit more intelligence than the Treasurer to understand what that measure will do to corporate cash flows, or even cash reServes if any companies are left with reserves after seven years of this chiselling Government. That will be something to behold and to fear. Although less than precise, because as always we are not given the relevant calculations in the explanatory memorandum, it is still possible to illustrate the maximum effect on corporate Australian business if we take as the starting point the budgeted income tax to be taken from companies during this financial year. It is a massive amount. In fact, at $11.205 billion it is, along with all taxes, at a record all-time high. Because there will be some exclusions in the proposals and extraneous matters, an amount of $10 billion might be a good figure to play around with for demonstration purposes, rather than the total estimated company taxes this financial year, as I have just recited. On that basis and under the present formula approximately $2.5 billion will be payable on the fifteenth day of each of the months of August and November and next February, and the remainder on around 30 April 1990. The net effect of the relevant provisions of the Bill will be to bring forward the collection of something like $6 billion in company taxes to 15 August from November and next February and April. That represents an enormous flow of funds from the private sector into the public purse and it will have to be raised by the tax paying companies. If those same companies borrow, as most of them will have to, to meet the earlier impost, the interest on the borrowings raised for the purpose will not be allowed as a tax deductable expense, and that must be the unkindest cut of all. The interest paid on those borrowings will be at commercial rates, averaging around 22 or 23 per cent but as high as 25 per cent, as a direct consequence of the Government's confessed high interest rate policy. In the hands of the Government, though, the $6m or so will save it interest at treasury bill rates of maybe 13 per cent or thereabouts. That is how this tired, stale Government goes about robbing Peter to pay Paul. It is so tired and stale and completely lacking in energy and vision that the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) is governing by suggestion box. The Prime Minister has had to resort to writing to his Ministers to get ideas because his own claimed considerable intellect is unable to come up with deceit of the kind that he concocted before previous elections. His mind has gone blank, it is barren. The Prime Minister had better be careful where he leaves his suggestion box because, if people from suburban or country Australia, or from the corporate sector for that matter, get hold of it, there are likely to be some pretty rude suggestions forthcoming indeed. Here we have what must rate as one of the biggest raids on corporate Australia by a Treasurer and his Government which, at the same time, is responsible for a national debt and a national balance of payments deficit of dimensions unimaginable only a few years ago. The economic debacle, as verified by the balance of trade figures, the balance of payments, international indebtedness, record high interest rates and high inflation figures, will be further jeopardised by measures such as this. One effect will be to deprive companies of the funds generated from normal cash flows employed to earn funds in the course of generating taxable income. Another will be to deprive companies of inhouse cash to invest in productive capital equipment, an objective so often claimed by the Government and equally as often prevented by the self same Government, as has happened in this case. I turn now to the amendment moved by my colleague the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), who submitted the following: whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) recognising the plight of small businesses in Australia, calls on the Government to increase substantially the threshold at which the new two instalment company tax arrangements will apply; (2) rejects the Governments proposals on selfassessment of company tax because of the inadequate safeguards and protection of the integrity of taxpayers; and (3) condemns the Government for its flagrant disregard in its taxation policies of the circumstances faced by many small businesses in Australia. I wholeheartedly support that amendment. Because we are in this ridiculous situation again where important and extremely complex legislation is under the guillotine, I will touch very briefly on another matter. Mr Braithwaite-It is a scandal.",85
170,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"It is a scandal, as my colleague says. Once again, it will be left to our colleagues in the Senate to legislate, while we play penny-ante politics in this chamber. When will we ever learn? If we as legislators and political practitioners want to earn the respect of the people of Australia, we must get our act together. Mr Kerin-Don't go along with the Democrats in the Senate.",87
171,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"Of course, the Minister for Primary Industrie- and Energy trots out the defence of the Senate holding up legislation, the Democrats or something similar. During the past sitting week we debated under the guillotine a taxation Bill equally as complex and equally as serious in its implications for Australian taxpayers. It was introduced on 31 May, but we debated it under the guillotine only during the past sitting week. That is another product of the stale and tired Government with which we must cope.",87
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Andrew)Order! I remind the honourable member for Curtin of his earlier point about relevance and ask him to return to the Bill before the House.,87
173,Mr ROCHER,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"I accept that, Mr Deputy Speaker; how could I do otherwise? I return to the question of self-assessment. I will not be baited by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy who, after all, is waiting for an opportunity to occupy the position of Leader of the Opposition after the next election. I simply state that the self-assessment proposal before the preparation of company tax is entirely inappropriate in the context of the way taxable income is arrived at in the hands of a corporation. Of course, the vast majority of individual taxpayers who self-assess are not really involved in such complicated calculations. In other words, their assessable income is clearly stated in most cases and it is deducted in the process of their earning that income and being recorded on group certificates or paid by tax stamps, and so a much simpler and different arrangement applies in the case of selfassessment for individuals. I suspect that this proposal for companies will be treated as another weapon and bargaining chip in the hands of the Commissioner of Taxation. On the question of self-assessment and amendment of assessments I have some real concern about the fact that no piece of paper will be issued to prove the assessment process. If the Commissioner of Taxation were to lose a tax return-and I can assure honourable members that he does very often-how would the taxpayer prove that an assessment had been issued? Will taxpayers now be required to obtain receipts for every tax return they lodge? It seems to me that the Commissioner simply has not thought through the proposal and the practicality of this proposed law and, of course, nor has the Treasurer, but that is less than surprising. Australia's small business community-, which will be affected by this measure, is really starting to feel the pinch now as high interest rates are sustained in the 21 to 25 per cent range. Corporate tax flows are squeezed as a consequence and will be squeezed further. The pilots dispute is crippling many in the tourist industry, and the possibility of a significant slump in demand next year grows almost daily as the Government fails to respond to calls to significantly shift its policy mix. Mr Deputy Speaker, my time has expired; I have taken a little longer than I should have and I apologise to my colleagues for that. I repeat that I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Wentworth.",87
174,Mr LES SCOTT ,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"Oxley) (6.19)-1 will deal first with some of the comments of the honourable member for Curtin ( Mr Rocher). The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) is about an ongoing process of providing much fairer taxation for all Australians. The honourable member almost gave the impression that we are asking companies to pay tax even before they earn the money. However, it is simple to see that they are paying the tax after they have already earned their profits for the year. The fact that they will have to pay 85 per cent by the fifteenth of the month after the end of their fi,nancial year should not necessarily create a big problem for companies, because most companies know where they are going in business and how their profits are looking. In many cases, they would determine quarterly profits to give themselves some sort of assessment along the way of how the business is actually operating. Of course, a prudent business manager would ensure that his company provided for taxation, because it has to pay taxation at some time. Companies have enjoyed a privileged position for a long time. Wage and salary earners certainly do not have the opportunity to defer paying their tax for the periods that they would wish to do so. Therefore, what the honourable member for Wentworth said in trying to defend big business in that way is rather irrelevant, especially when one considers the sorts of profits some large companies are making at present. In the past few weeks, major profits have been announced by two of the largest banks in Australia-the National Australia Bank Ltd andWestpac Banking Corporationwhich made profits of about $800m. I am sure that those banks would be able to pay their tax liabilities when they are due, considering the profits they have made. They might have to organise themselves a bit better to announce their June profits a little before September. I am pleased to be able to support the Bill before the House. The Opposition has expressed concern about the phasing in period. The amendments referred to earlier by the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Martin) will certainly help with the phasing in period and help small and medium size businesses and companies along the way. Those amendments should address some of the difficulties raised by the Opposition. This Bill is another example of the ongoing commitment by this Government to reform the taxation system and ensure that all those who should be paying tax are certainly doing so and at the right time. The decision to bring forward the time for payment of tax by companies, complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposit funds (ADFs) and pooled superannuation trusts was announced in the 1989-90 Budget. The changes will result in additional revenue of some $885m in this financial year. Currently, companies pay tax in quarterly instalments in the year following that in which the income is earned. The final instalment adjusts the tax payable on the previous year's income and the actual income for that year. Companies presently obtain much greater tax deferral benefits than other taxpayers, benefits equivalent to an interest free loan from the Commonwealth of the deferred tax payment. Companies benefit from deferring the payment of tax until after, rather than during, the income year; from being able to spread such payments over that following year; and from basing the first three quarterly payments on income of two years prior to the year of tax. In comparison, tax instalments of wage and salary earners are for, and based on, actual income earned in a pay period, whether it be a weekly or fortnightly payment, or whatever the case ment. might be. Provisional tax payments of other non-company taxpayers are for current year income and are based on uplifted prior year income. A new tax collection system for companies, complying superannuation funds, the ADFs and pooled superannuation trusts will therefore apply in respect of their 1989payment 90 and subsequent years of income. Since these entities are required to pay in the year following the year of income, the new arrangements will first affect tax payongoing ments in their 1990-91 financial year, or stituted year in the case of early balancing companies. The changes will alter the timing of payments within the financial year of fected taxpayers but not the total amount payable. The bringing forward of payments within the year will reduce the tax deferral available to these taxpayers compared to infooting dividuals, thereby enhancing the equity of the taxation system. It will generate a significant reduction in Commonwealth outlays by reducing public debt interest. The amended collection system will conperiod. sist of a single instalment of tax, due by fifteenth day of the first month after year of income, or substituted accounting period of early balancing companies, with January being the earliest due date, equal to 85 per cent of the notional tax amount or 85 per cent of the taxpayer's estimate of actual tax liability. . The balance of tax owing will be due the fifteenth day of the ninth month followGovernment's ing the end of the income year, or substituted accounting period for those companies with early balancing periods, with 15 Sepby tember being the earliest due date in that case. Companies which balance after 30 June in lieu of that date will continue to be treated as if they balance on 30 June. To ensure that the appropriate instalment payments not avoided, the Commissioner of Taxation will be authorised to determine that the inor stalment payable be based on the notional tax amount rather than the taxpayer's own estimate, or to adjust the amount of the instalment to an amount not exceeding per cent of the notional tax amount if, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the company or its associates have engaged in a scheme designed with the sole or dominant purpose of reducing the level of the instalIf the amount of the instalment paid by the company is less than the amount so determined by the Commissioner of Taxation, penalties will apply in respect of the difference. The requirement for an earlier of the self-assessed balance of tax will bring forward $150m of revenue from 1991-92 to 1990-91. The bringing forward of tax the instalment and balancing payment dates within the taxpayer's tax year will result in savings in public debt interest outlays subof about $330m in each year from 1990-91. Following representations from business afgroups, two changes have been incorporated into this Bill. First, the time for payments by entities that balance after 30 June has been altered to place them on the same as other entities. Secondly, entities with a relatively small tax liability-that is, $1,000 to $20,OOO-will have the option of making a single payment, generally six months after the end of their balancing As I said previously, I believe that the the Acting Treasurer, the Minister for Emthe ployment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins), has announced that the Govern15 ment will be moving certain amendments to this Bill which will incorporate certain transitional arrangements to assist small and medium size companies in the payment of their taxation liability. These amendments will ease the financial impact on these companies, and by will certainly show a continuation of the assistance to this area. From I July 1989, expenditure incurred the taxpayer in complying with all Australian taxation laws, including attending to the requirements of an audit by the Australian Taxation Office of the taxpayer's affairs, has become deductable for income tax purare poses. The allowable expenditure will be confined to payments to registered tax agents, to solicitors or barristers who are exempt from the requirement to register as tax agents, but will include expenditure incurred where the relevant services are provided by em85 ployees of the taxpayer. Section 78 deals with the deductability certain gifts, et cetera. To the range ductable gifts will be added those for acquithere sition, construction or maintenance of building used to accommodate rural students where the Commonwealth, a State or Territhought tory funds all or part of the capital or recurlation rent costs of the school the students are attending. The measure is complementary to cannot apply. the new system of grants in respect of accommodation for rural students being apply introduced by the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill (No.2) 1989. Following a review of the taxation treatit ment of life insurance conducted in consulof tation with industry bodies, expenses incurred by life office companies-that is, excluding friendly societies and other registered isations, which are eligible for a lower rate of tax-in gaining the investment component of life insurance premium income are alAct, lowed as a taxation deduction to apply in respect of expenses incurred on or January 1990. Life insurance is a major source of long term savings for business vestment purposes. The removal of inconsistment encies in the taxation treatment of life offices' insurance business removes an unfair tax burden on such investments, thereby increasbe ing the return on savings in this form. As I stated at the beginning, this Govern the ment is committed to taxation reform to ensure that the taxation system is fair to Australians and that everyone accepts his responsibility to pay his fair share of tax. This Bill is part of the ongoing reforms of this Government and removes the anomaly of companies being able to defer their tax liability for long periods, in many cases least 12 months and in some cases up to two years, having regard to the beginning of their financial year. I am very pleased to support the Bill before the House and I certainly reject the amendment put forward by the investment. Opposition.",88
175,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE ,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"Dawson) (6.20)During the debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) it has been interin esting to hear the comments from members on the Government side of the House about the Government's ongoing commitment reform, equity and fairness. It is just proper that all of us, as legislators, should have regard to those things. But I defy anytralia of one to say that, having regard to the size of of dethe existing Income Tax Assessment Act, is fairness and equity in these addia tions, particularly when one looks at the amendments that the Government has fit to bring forward since this legiswas introduced a few weeks ago. Already, that claim of fairness and equity I say that the claim of fairness cannot in respect of taxpayers. It is not just a matter of this Parliament enacting legislation and the Australian Taxation Office carrying out. There needs to be fairness in respect certainty and often this is not conveyed in legislation and press releases as far as the taxpayer is concerned. Many of the comorganplaints I hear these days-and I have not actually practised under the tax Act for 14 years-make me aware of the size of the its complications and its lack of certainty as far as people planning their finanafter 1 cial affairs are concerned. It is interesting that we are having an inargument within the public arena at the moabout the capital gains tax and a speculative gains tax. The claim is made by the Government that a speculative gains tax will a disincentive to investment in the productive area. I can tell the Government that capital gains tax is a disincentive to thousands of taxpayers because they do not all have the heart to go into an enterprise, whether it be trading or otherwise. In the long term, they would face the prospect of having their capital gains taxed. Instead of investing in this area, their money can more profitably be invested in savings. That is the at problem with Australia at the moment. That is the trouble with our economy. There is an active disincentive for people to invest because· of the massive amount of tax laws. The penal rates of tax are a penalty against I could name quite a few people who might have invested in a trading company, or something that was going to be productive the long term. But there was no incentive for them to do so because of the capital gains tax, the fringe benefits tax and the to entertainment tax-one could keep naming and them-introduced by this Government. What is fair and equitable about that? What Ausneeds, above all else, is a productive climate in which people can trade with certainty under a fair system, and that is what is missing from the economy at the moment. The main portion of the legislation before the House deals with a change in the way companies pay tax. Again, one might look at this from the point of view of equity for the provisional taxpayer, the individual taxpayer and the pay as you earn taxpayer. Even though the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) has lifted the ceiling to $20,000, the majority of tax is being collected from a small number of big businesses. One might say that is fair enough. But many small businesses are trying to operate in a very hostile environment. That is why I certainly support the amendment of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), that there should be further relief in terms of .the threshold to enable small companies to trade properly. When I talk about a hostile environment I need only mention the record interest rates. I have a fairly close involvement with a company that has faced the situation within the last 12 months where the interest rate on a normal loan-and it is on prime rates-has gone from about 15 per cent to over 20 per cent. That is a hostile environment. Australia's inflation rate is still soaring above that of our competitors. The exchange rate is penalising many companies in Australia because they cannot trade on the overseas markets as they might do if the dollar was allowed to float free and was not propped up by the interest rates from which they also suffer. I could talk about the centralised wage system. All of these things contribute to a hostile environment into which the Government is now forcing many companies by asking them to prepay their tax. I want to mention the prepayment of tax and what this Labor Government has done over a period of seven years. There has never been such an incidence of the prepayment of taxes. We have seen the introduction of the prescribed payments scheme (PPS). The Taxation Office has pushed people to contribute on a pay as you earn basis instead of under the PPS. People also make provisional tax payments and quarterly tax payments. The measure now before us also involves the prepayment of tax. Australia is in a situation where there is no more fat to squeeze. We are in this situation because the Treasurer is determined to achieve a favourable result this year. I am concerned about small business people who are trying to make a dollar and who are now being asked to look at their liquidity. Again, the banks have indicated the lack of liquidity that will occur in the months of July down the track because of this prepayment. Big businesses can hold up. I can give three examples of businesses which are being propped up by the Government at the moment. Banks are being propped up to the extent of $200m to subsidise interest rates because of the failure of the Government in respect of the economy. We are suffering a further deterioration in our balance of payments because this Government is propping up the airlines and continuing a dispute-or a Clayton's dispute, as far as the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) is concerned. Kodak (Australasia) Pty Ltd is the last example. Again, it is a big business that is being propped up by the Government. For goodness' sake, the Government should have concern for the small businesses of Australia and what is happening to them. I would like to say something about the manner in which the Taxation Office itself fails to address its own efficiency. I have had a large number of complaints in connection with the work to regulation practices in some of the tax offices. Perhaps it is going on in all of the tax offices-it is certainly going on in the one of which I have knowledge. This practice is preventing the processing of taxpayers' explanations, refunds and even assessments. There is a deliberate ploy by the Tax Office not to apply itself to these areas. There is a massive amount of confusion. If the Taxation Office wants us to get the legislative process put in order, it should also put its own house in order. I wish to raise the case of a taxpayer who has had difficulty in getting a new prescribed payment number from the Tax Office. The certificate expired on 30 October this year and, despite having applied for a new number in mid-October, there has been no response from the Tax Office. The holder of this certificate has had to knock back payments until the new number is obtained because otherwise a 20 per cent deduction would have to be made. This might be part of the campaign of delay but there are subcontractors around Australia who are suffering because they cannot use the old forms and numbers. It appears that the Tax Office is deliberately delaying the issue of new numbers so that the 20 per cent deduction might apply. I have taken this up with the Tax Office and have been told there is a five-week delay. But surely the Office can put itself in order and make sure these things are given out at the appropriate times. What is the point of legislation if it cannot be applied? I have also had complaints from subcontractors who are being pushed from the PPS to the pay as you earn system. They have been bluffed by auditors from the Tax Office into complying with a system they do not want. I certainly support the amendment moved by the shadow Treasurer.",90
176,Deus ex machina,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m.,92
177,Mr WILSON ,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL,"Sturt) (8.00)-Tonight we are continuing the debate on some very wideranging and significant income tax legislation, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.5) 1989. I want to concentrate particularly on one aspect of that legislation. It is that that deals with the changing arrangements for the payment by companies of their tax liability. It is easy to advance the principle that tax should be paid as it is earned in the year in which it is earned or immediately following the conclusion of the year in which it is earned but, in determining which of those points in time shall be used for the payment of tax, one needs to look at past practice. If there is to be a change, there should also be a change in the tax rates to place companies in an equal situation under both methods of payment. On this occasion the Government has chosen to bring forward the dates upon which companies are due to pay their tax, but it has made no compensation in the rates of tax to adjust for that advance in the payments; nor has it taken into account the commercial realities. It has dealt with the matter in theory and from the perspective of the Government, and of the Government only. It has disregarded altogether the effects upon the daily operations of businesses. Many businesses have put the view that, if this change had been announced and then gradually phased in over time, it would have been possible for large businesses, very small businesses and middle Australian businesses, which are the core of the Australian economy, to adjust their financial affairs to cope with this changed date of payment, given that the Government has made no adjustment in the tax that they pay. Why do I argue that there should have been an adjustment? Let us look at the realities. Under the present legislation-not that which is proposed and is being considered by this Parliament-companies in the main pay their tax in four instalments: on 15 August, in November, in February and some time in May of every financial year. Let me give the House the illustration of a company that under present arrangements pays $100,000 tax in four equal instalments of $25,000. Under the proposed arrangement that company will not have to pay 25 per cent in August but will have to pay 85 per cent of the tax in July and then the remaining 15 per cent, with any adjustments that may arise as a consequence of the income of the current year being different from that of the preceding year, in April. One might say that it is paying exactly the same amount of tax, but let us look at the costs to that company. The Government has been very forward in asking what is the revenue forgone, what is the benefit to the revenue of getting revenue in earlier and the benefit in interest saved. But let us look at the effect on a company that has to pay $85,000 in income tax in July rather than $25,000 in August, $25,000 in November, $25,000 in February and so on. The chartered accountants Deloitte Haskins and Sells have sent to their clients a newsletter which has revealed that, if the company were paying 20 per cent interest on borrowed money, or alternatively if it had the tax money in its hand in cash and were able to invest it at 20 per cent, on a revenue forgone basis or on an expenses incurred basis the loss to the company would be approximately $7,000. In effect this legislation is increasing company tax by 7 per cent-not by the normal way in which company tax is adjusted, by increasing the rate, but by making it payable earlier-and in circumstances in which the business community has had little time to adjust. In 1989-90, it is estimated, $1l.5 billion worth of company tax will be collected. The changed tax collection in the year, we are told, because of this legislation, will advance into this financial year $885m of tax, largely coming from early balance date companies; and $150m will be gained in 1990-91 for the same reason. The earlier payments comprise not only those made by the early balance date companies but also those made by the 30 June balance date companies and by the late balance date companies. In addition, it is said that the measure will reduce public debt interest. In 1989-90 it is estimated that it will reduce public debt interest by about $22m-we are not told how it is calculated-in 1991 by $350m, and thereafter by $330m per annum, a difference of $20m between 1990 and 1991 and years in the future. How have these calculations been done? Here is another piece of evidence that indicates that the present Labor Government believes that interest rates will remain as high as they are now not only in 1989-90 but also through 1990-91 and indefinitely into the future, because at 4.5 of Budget Paper No. 1 it says: This measure will reduce outlays on public interest by $22m in 1989-90, $350m in 1990-91 and $330m per annum in subsequent years. The estimated revenue impact of the changes in 1991-92 subsequent years is nil. I make that point in passing about the horrendous rates of interest that both individuals and companies are now required to pay. The Government saves this money by selling treasury notes at a discount. The cost saving is the effective rate of interest by the revenue brought forward by the months of payment in advance for the tax paid. Presumably that is how the Government has calculated the $330m, but the Budget Papers do not tell us that. If at the moment we assume that $1.5 billion of the corporate tax is paid by small companies liable for $20,000 or less, the $10 billion will be subject to earlier payment requirements. If we use the figures of Deloitte Haskins and Sells for a company paying 20 per cent interest or forgoing 20 per cent return on its investment in which that money would otherwise have been invested, the cost to the corporate sector will be $700m. If the Government T - note rate is 15 per cent it may be that the figure should have come out at $525m of interest saved. But to try to get to the $330m, I can only assume that $195m of the transfer will be as a consequence of the number and size of payments by the late balance companies. On a day when yet another bank has indicated record profits for the current financial year, I might point out that the banks are some of the big corporations which are late balance date corporations. A $700m reduction in profits earned by the corporate sector or an increase in companies' expenses will reduce their taxable income. If they have expenses or they forgo income of $700m, the tax that will not be collected will, at current rates of taxation, amount to $280m. So if the Government is saving $330m on interest that it does not have to payout, it is going to lose $280 on tax forgone on profits that are not being earned or on expenses that are being claimed. So one wonders whether disturbing the corporate sector for the sake of a net $50m is going to be worth the damage that it will do to the Australian economy. The Government cannot argue that the difference will be made debt up by economic growth because this would involve double accounting. Indeed, the decision implicit in this legislation may, in the and view of many, actually retard the potential for growth because of the liquidity reduction in the corporate sector. I have talked about interest being claimed as a deduction against tax. It is in that regard that I express the gravest concerns. I refer to an English decision, in the Smiths potato crisps case. I do not know whether they had salt with the potato crisps then, but certainly the Government is putting salt into the wounds that it is inflicting on the Australian corporate sector. That case dealt with whether interest and expenses incurred in finding the funds to pay tax should not be a deduction for tax purposes. That case, which occurred a long time ago, and a line of authority of cases was simply picked up and adopted in an Administrative Appeals Tribunal case in Australia in 1988 called V48. But the practice and the law have been different. I have tried to find out why, but without success. I have failed because I do not believe that there are any significant corporations which identify in their tax returns that the interest they have had to borrow on a higher overdraft or other forms of borrowing has been increased because they need the money to pay the tax. Yet everyone knows that at the four quarterly dates there is a draw-down on banks-the banks even call it 'the tax draw-down'. Up until today there has been some uncertainty as to whether the principles in the Smiths potato crisps case related to individuals-one could see the logic in their relating to individuals-or whether they related to corporations in the same way. In this legislation, under the stalking-horse of giving to taxpayers a relatively small concession-the right to deduct certain expenses in the tax administration of their affairs, appeals before tax tribunals and the like-the Government has codified what has been an uncertain law and made it a certain law. In giving the concessions that it describes in clause 8 of the Bill, the proposed amendment to section 69 of the principal Act, it states: A deduction is not allowable under subsection for expenditure that consists of: (a) income taxI have no argument about thator (b) an amount payable under part viwhich is other taxes. There is no argument about that on the surface of it, although if I have time tonight I will deal with the effects of certain charges that are given the definition of 'income tax'. The clause continues: or (c) a financing cost in relation to an amount covered by paragraph (a) or (b)which is a financing cost in relation to the payment of any tax. The practice has been for business enterprises to have a conglomerate borrowing arrangement. They have borrowed to keep their inventories, to finance their debtors, to purchase their fixed assets, to pay their wages and to pay their taxes. It has all gone into the melting pot and no-one until now has suggested that some proportion of that borrowing should be attributed to the tax that they have paid, notwithstanding the fact that it has been possible to look at corporate borrowings and to see the peaks and troughs. The peaks have occurred at the time of liability for corporate income tax. The Commissioner of Taxation has not taken action because he has been uncertain about the law. He has used small concessions as the stalking-horse and introduced into this legislation a specific legislative provision that the financing costs in relation to an amount covered, that is, payment of income tax or other taxes, shall not be tax deductable. What will happen with the Tax Commissioner's audit army on 15 July 1990? My forecast is that, unless the Treasurer makes it quite clear that the practice will be as it was in the past, rather than in accordance with the electoral interpretation of the law, every corporation-large, small and medium sized-will fear the arrival of the audit army in June and July because the audit army can come in and say to a corporation: 'You had an overdraft last year in July of $300,000. This year after you have paid your tax, allowing for inflation in your borrowings, your inventory has changed and your debt has changed and you now have an overdraft of (I) $400,000-$100,000 more than you should have; Under this legislation I forecast that the Tax Commissioner will use his power to go to those corporations and say that the interest is calculated against a benchmark-what benchmark I do not know-of the previous practice of payments on four quarterly dates, the principal is phased down and a pro rata formula is applied to the interest. Or will the Tax Commissioner say that he has made a mistake? He is not beyond doing that, saying 'I did not administer it according to the law before, but I am going to now, and because you did not attribute your profits on an income earned basis week by week, or an end of year basis to 30 June, and did not put that money neatly away in a cash form so that you could pay me-if it was a part of your overdraft arrangements globally for your whole enterprise, whether it is a corner store, shoe manufacturing company, Smiths potato crisps or Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd-we will now disallow your claim for that proportion of the interest'. This legislation could be disastrous to the liquidity of Australian business enterprises if they cannot claim this as a tax deduction in the way they have done in practice in the past. There is no certainty that they will be able to do so under this specific piece of legislation, making it non-taxable but with no guidelines as to how one will calculate the non-taxable element of the interest paid by a corporation. This legislation is a disgraceful piece of vagueness which gives to the Tax Commissioner such immense powers that it is no wonder Australian industry is fearful of the consequences that might arise from it. The loss to Australian businesses is ,not only related to the interest that they may pay on money they need to pay their taxes early and the fact that the interest rate will not be 20 per cent but also could, in effect, be 35 per cent because of the non-tax deductability. Because of the slow-down in liquidity, companies are anticipating that their additional borrowings, as a consequence of their having to pay tax, and others having to pay tax, could well be double their tax liability. We will then see the immensity and unfairness of the non-tax deductability of this element of the legislation. One may say that some businesses could then rearrange their affairs. They would have professionals to tell them how they could make quarantine arrangements so that no interest is apparently showing. Many small and middle sized Australian businesses will not be able to achieve that. This provision should be deleted from the Bill.",92

187,Mr TIM FISCHER ,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL,"Farrer) (8.32)-The Opposition is totally opposed to this quick fix, mishmash legislation which comes on after the legislation that the House has just disposed of when the Government caved in and involved itself in an extraordinary about face for which it will pay an awful price. I make it very clear that we have examined the Broadcasting Amendment Bill. My colleague the shadow Minister for communications, Senator Richard Alston, has examined this legislation in extraordinary detail and we have found it absolutely wanting. Indeed, we have found that it is yet another product of Rip Van Willis, the Minister for Transport and Communications. He has been sleeping on the sidelines for so much of this year while the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) has got itself into trouble, while the television networks have got themselves into trouble and while the legal position of broadcasting for radio and television in this country has fallen apart. In the dying hours of the Thirty-fifth Parliament-I remind honourable members that we are now in the dying hours of the Thirtyfifth Parliament-the Minister has produced this quick fix legislation which ought to embarrass Government members because of its failure to address comprehensively the quagmire of the legal position on broadcasting in Australia in 1989. At the end of my address I will be moving a clear-cut second reading amendment and then in committee, if the opportunity permits given the gagging situation here tonight, I will seek to move further amendments to make very clear the intentions of the Opposition with regard to the Broadcasting Amendment Bill. This Bill fails on several counts but two particular counts which it fails to address are the need for a fundamental overhaul of broadcasting legislation and the need to re-' duce the present complex plethora of regulations. The Government cannot have it both ways. The Government has initiated a comprehensive review and speaks of a comprehensive approach at some latef'date-perhaps next year-although the legislative timetable of the Parliament will clearly be disrupted next year with the forthcoming Federal election. So the Government has turned up here tonight in the dying hours of the 1989 session of the Thirty-fifth Parliament, and probably the closing stages of the Thirty-fifth Parliament before its dissolution for that election, with a Bill that is totally inadequate, that is regarded by the industry as totally inadequate and that is regarded by many learned people, including Sir Maurice Byers, as failing and going in many areas beyond the powers available under the Constitution with regard to the licensing and control of broadcasting of radio and television. I say to the Minister here tonight that, on this occasion, if he likes he should put to one side the arguments that will be advanced by the Opposition with regard to the Broadcasting Amendment Bill, but he cannot put aside the opinion of Sir Maurice Byers, which is clear cut, which is available no doubt to the Government, and which arrived like a dead cat on the Cabinet table and in the office of the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis), who is now leaving the chamber and who is responsible for the Broadcasting Amendment Bill. Let me deal with the opinion of Sir Maurice Byers, a former Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia, and a man held in high regard by honourable members on both sides of the House. I am sure that the Minister has had the opportunity to read the advice given. Sir Maurice Byers says in part that a number of questions are raised by the Bill and he deals with each of those. He points to the fact that, under clause 3 (a) and (b), the new expression 'suitability requirements' is introduced into the legislation. He points out that on any objective examination this represents a big increase in the powers of the Tribunal. He also brings in another concept which may be at fault with section 51 (v) of the Constitution. He says, and I quote specifically: It is manifest that many of the powers conferred on the Tribunalby the Broadcasting Amendment Billto give directions could not survive if read literally. Thus, if the licence holder is no longer able to meet the suitability requirements because of lack of financial capability, directions may not validly be given to bankers to lend it money or managers or technicians to enter its employ notwithstanding the power of 92M (2) by making failure to comply with directions under the proposed (IA) and (IB) an offence for each day the failure continues. He goes on to discuss this in some detail. Clearly, what he is saying is that proposed new subsection 92M (2) (a), (b) and (c) is invalid as it is in excess of power. The coaIition is not saying this; Sir Maurice Byers is saying this in a v-ry comprehensive opinion which I hope the Minister has seen and studied closely. Indeed, Sir Maurice Byers goes on to discuss other aspects of the Bill and, as other honourable members wish to participate in this debate, I cannot dwell on all of those, other than to say that the conclusion in respect of the third part is whether the proposed power to order divestiture is compatible with the requirements of the Constitution. Again he ends up with a very clear-cut statement which should terrify the Minister as he presents this Bill to the House. Sir Maurice Byers says: Both subsections are invalid. I answer this question accordingly and all questions as above. That was in the more comprehensive part of his opinion. So here we have Sir Maurice Byers saying that this legislation before the House tonight exceeds the powers of the Constitution. The Minister can look forward to the testing of this legislation in another forum on another occasion. So we have a shoddy piece of legislation, one which has clearly been challenged by a very senior counsel in Australia. The coalition supports the opinion given because the Bill manifestly fails to meet the task at hand and to provide some form of consistent, comprehensive approach to the massive problems gripping the broadcasting areas of legislation in relation to both radio and television. In one sense it is food for thought that there is a great deal of wisdom on this side of the House. Some honourable members will remember that the last time some major broadcasting legislation was before the Parliament Christopher Skase arrived in town. Christopher Skase decided to click his fingers in the hope that the coalition would buckle under completely to accommodate a situation that the mogul was putting forward at that time. We did not buckle under. We took a stand. It was not necessarily popular and was greeted that way. We did take a stand on that occasion in respect of a different context, albeit one in relation to the audience reach of television at that time. We will not buckle under with regard to the Broadcasting Amendment Bill before the House tonight. We will expose it as the quick fix, impossible solution that it offers to the Parliament and to the nation. I believe the Minister should be ashamed to bring this type of approach before this House at this late part of the session of 1989. It could be likened to some form of leaking house roof-comprehensively leaking at that-and getting up with sticky tape to try to patch all the holes in such a roof, rather than getting on with the more fundamental job required if we are to overcome the problems which I have referred to. In looking at detailed aspects of the legislation, I want to say that the power to refuse to renew a licence is one which ought to be examined very closely. Currently the Tribunal is required to exercise this power in the public interest, having regard to specified exclusive criteria, which include the suitability requirements, such as being a fit and proper person and having the necessary financial, technical and management capabilities. The Tribunal itself has identified the absurdity of the current uniform inquiry regulations. On 3 August 1989 the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, in a speech to the National Press Club, said: . . . once every three years the Tribunal will conduct 54 separate licence renewal hearings where up to 98% of the programs on each service are networked. These renewals will each take a minimum of four monthsand be costly at thatand they will all canvass the issue of adequate and comprehensive service; that is, 98% of programming will be looked at 54 times. I added slightly to the quote but the meaning is very clear. It simply means that under the cumbersome renewal procedures 98 per cent of the programs will have to be looked at 54 times in repetition because of the way the legislation is structured. Yet the proposed amendments in the Broadcasting Amendment Bill do nothing to rectify this totally unsatisfactory situation. Instead they would effectively render the special criteria irrelevant by giving the Tribunal carte blanche. It would now be allowed to have regard to such other matters as the Tribunal considers relevant. Let us look at the question of the power to suspend or revoke licences. Again, this centres around the question of suitability requirements. The amendments introduce this new statutory construct of 'suitability requirements' which must be satisfied before the Tribunal can give third party directions in a virtually unlimited range of circumstances. The proposal is an implied rebuke to the ABT over its reasoning in the Bond decision and an implicit endorsement of the Federal Court of Australia's strong criticism of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. As the matter is currently before the High Court of Australia-actually, not quite-there is also a clear attempt to pre-empt the outcome. The Federal Court made it clear that the fit and proper conduct of a person such as Alan Bond had to be directly related to the continuing fitness and propriety of a licensing company. However, while the amendments emphasise the necessity to establish the link they offer little guidance to the Tribunal as to how this will be so. They ignore the inherently unsatisfactory and subjective value judgments upon which the existing licensing regime depends: firstly, the artificial attachment of personal qualities of a fit and proper person to the licensing company as a corporate entity and, secondly, the multifaceted and social engineering potential of notions such as 'the financial, technical and management capabilities' necessary to provide an adequate and comprehensive service. The introduction of the suitability requirements concept, therefore, merely adds a further layer of complexity and contributes very little to the overall efficiency of broadcast regulations. We could look at this other area of power to give directions. I will just touch briefly the fact that that could lead to enabling the Tribunal to give directions to program suppliers whose contracts may be held to contribute to a licensee's lack of financial capability-that is a Pandora's box-and to banks whose credit policies may have a similar effect; to preventing or requiring the termination of employment of a news director, program manager or engineer; to preventing the reduction of a daily news service from one hour to half an hour or the reduction in the number of bulletins telecast each day; to requiring the employment of an expert in Australian children's films, a psychologist to advise on violence or an additional journalist to prepare weekend news; to preventing the closure of a studio or the sale of an outside broadcast van; ahd to requiring the purchase of particular technical equipment. The area of direction is one which is quite frightening and is not a comprehensive approach to the requirements for broadcasting legislation to be introduced in this Parliament. The other particular area that time will allow me to highlight relates to the power to extend the grace period. Currently, the Tribunal can extend the six-month period of grace allowed for divestiture following a refusal to approve a share transaction because an applicant has failed to meet the suitability requirements: Past experience demonstrates that a six-month period for forced divestiture is inadequate. Extensions of time have been essential in facilitating Bond's sale of certain television stations. Under the amendments the power to extend the period would be removed. This is not only harsh but commercially unrealistic, A forced fire sale would unnecessarily punish innocent shareholders. It presumably proceeds on the assumption that a guilty party does not deserve to remain licensed, yet the very provision of a grace period recognises the need for some mitigation and breathing space-not unreasonably-to allow for an ordinary disposal. We have just passed legislation which introduced amendments at the last hour to produce a doubling of the period of grace from 15 to 30 days in respect of the savage taxation requirements on small business. The Bill disposed of is one which I know you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will not allow me to on dwell on. But we are going in the other direction in this section of the Broadcasting Amendment Bill. If inadequate efforts of disposal are made during the six-month period the Tribunal would undoubtedly decline to extend the term. There is no policy basis for distinguishing between divestiture arising out of a failure to meet the suitability requirements and divestiture arising out of breach of the crossmedia ownership limits. Provided that the integrity of a service can be safeguarded in the interim, any licensee facing forced divestiture should be able to apply for an extension. It is quite unacceptable to suggest that a person who fails a suitability test is not entitled to any special consideration in attempts to realise an adequate sale price. Such persons are not necessarily guilty of any moral wrongdoings. They may be no more than victims of the Government's current high interest rate policy. Other members speaking for the coalition will make it very clear why the Opposition is so totally opposed to this approach by the Government in relation to this legislation. The Government and the Minister responsible must be embarrassed at the Bill coming in at this late hour. The Minister is one of these Ministers who operate out of a small but quite powerful ministerial office. He has a small inner court of very close contacts and advisers. At times he almost stands alone and away from his various departments, from his various authorities and from his various government business enterprises. The Minister looks quite surprised at my remarks. He could hardly describe his relations with Qantas Airways Ltd throughout 1989 as cohesive, congenial and in any way of a constructive nature, particularly with regard to the question of the successor to the Chief Executive of Qantas and the successor to the Chairman of Qantas. I think the reputation of the Minister around Canberra is just thatone of being somewhat of a loner who stands aloof from the industries relating to his folio, one who has failed to make real progress in the challenging area of micro-economic reform. That was laid down by the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) as the .absolute imperative at the start of this parliamentary term and in terms of the Prime Minister's 1987 election promise to 'urgently reform this nightmarish legislation'. What have we had? We have this Broadcasting Amendment Bill, which does nothing to reform comprehensively this nightmarish legislation. We are now at the eleventh hour. I know that my good friend the Chairman of the Sta-ding Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, the honourable member for Aston ( Mr Saunderson), will be speaking later. We will address this issue by way of amendment and it will be addressed also in the Senate. The Opposition is totally opposed to the approach in the Broadcasting Amendment Bill. For that reason I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with view to substituting the following words: ""the House declines to give the Bill a second reading, and deplores the Government's hasty and ill-conceived attempt to bestow a vast new range of unpredictable and unnecessary powers on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in a desperate attempt to divert attention from its total failure to introduce any meaningful reforms of broadcasting regulation despite the Prime Minister's unequivocal 1987 election promise to 'urgently reform this nightmarish legislation' "". . I commend the amendment to the House.",97
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Cowan)Is the amendment seconded? Mr MACKellar-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak later.,101
189,Mr SAUNDERSON ,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL,"Aston) (8.52)-I rise to support the Broadcasting Amendment Bill 1989. I suppose what first of all surprises me is that the honourable member for Farrer ( Mr Tim Fischer), speaking on behalf of the shadow spokesperson for communications, Senator Alston, had the gall to oppose the Bill, given that probably just over 12 months ago he supported a report to the House which recommended amendments to the Broadcasting Act basically identical to those port- being proposed by the Government. That seems rather strange, given that the Government has introduced amendments which provide power for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to implement and make effective its decisions, certainly in relation to the issue of fit and proper persons, which was the major issue addressed in our report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. But we find that the Opposition opposes the Bill. One of the difficulties we have is that the Opposition now seems to base its decision on whether to support or oppose legislation on a single advice from external people with no relationship to recognised bodies. Retired people or anyone with an interest can write in and say that they have a view that legislation is perhaps outside of the role of the Government, against the Constitution, or whatever. Based on a single letter written in that vein, the Opposition will now determine its policy on communications and. I assume, therefore, its policy on every other matter that will be presented to the Parliament. Its a policy will be determined by whoever writes to it at any particular time. The fact is that the Opposition has no policy on communications. I will give a couple of examples to show that. The Opposition spokesperson has called for the Government to take urgent action to deal with the crisis in broadcasting. He has called for the Government to abolish the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. He has called for the Government to have the Tribunal hold inquiries into certain matters relating to the crisis in the industry. But, when the Government takes some action to give the Tribunal power to implement decisions and make effective determinations that it has made, the Opposition says, 'You cannot do that. We cannot support it because it is done in haste'. Let us look at the history surrounding these matters. A report was presented to the Parliament in December 1988. So almost 12 months ago we began discussion on this matter. Prior to that, there were discussions the effectiveness of the Broadcasting Act and the need to take action in certain areas. Numerous reports have been presented to the Parliament. Numerous reports have been made public for discussion on this issue. Virtually everybody in the community accepts the need to do something. We need to give the Tribunal the effective power to implement the intention of its decisions. The Government's amendments to section 92M and other sections allow it to place conditions on a licence, and to allow divestiture of a licence where a person is found to be not fit and proper to hold a licence. I suppose it is not surprising that the Opposition has opted to quote selectively from the Bond Media Ltd press release of today, given that it made its decision in haste; it did not have much substance behind it. Luckily for the Opposition, a IS-page document has come out which has given the Opposition 15 minutes of speaking time today. Bond Media complained that six months was too short a time in which to dispose of an asset. It failed to mention that that short restrictive time applies in one circumstance only, that is, where, after all the legal avenues have been allowed, a person-or a licensee in the case of a corporation-is found guilty of being not fit and proper to hold a licence. To suggest that, having found that a person or body is not fit and proper to hold a licence, it is then adequate to give unlimited time in which to dispose of a licence makes an absolute mockery of the Act. Clearly, in the circumstances where somebody has abused the privileged position of holding a broadcasting licence, and has been found guilty of not being fit and proper, that person ought to dispose of that licence in the shortest possible time. Many would consider six months to be more than adequate to dispose of a licence. In other circumstances a longer period is permitted. While six months is the notional time, there is the option to extend the period. The honourable member for Farrer made the comment that the Bill gives carte blanche to the Tribunal to make all sorts of judgments about whether a person is fit and proper. That is not the case. It is clearly a misunderstanding of the situation. The prerequisites to finding whether a person is fit about and proper are the same as they have been for many years. The processes are the same. The rights of the licensee are the same. All we are doing with this amendment is extending the options that the Tribunal has when it reaches a decision at the end of the day. Instead of just being faced with the option of cancellation of the licence, therefore removing service to the community at largeto the people who have not committed any offence, but who would suffer the loss of service-we are extending the options for the Tribunal to ensure that that service continues but that the integrity of the Tribunal's decision is applied correctly. We have not seen a solution in the Opposition's amendment. It has no idea what to do. It has no answer. Since we have been in office, we have seen major reforms to and a major restructuring of the broadcasting industry, with changes to ownership rules, cross-media rules, et cetera. The Government has continued its process of inquiry and its encouragement of public participation. For the Opposition to stand up and say that these decisions are made in haste is to ignore the historical facts of what has been going on over the last two or three years. The other telling point is that these amendments, to some extent, have been sponsored by major sections of the industry which have approached the Government and said, 'Look, in consideration of the trustee arrangements, we believe there are better administrative ways of dealing with these problems'. The extension of subsection 92M was one way of dealing with this. Rather than acting in haste, we have been responis sive to some of the points that raised by the industry itself. Of course Bond Media is not happy about the amendments. It does not want any change because it is under fire. It is the one in the frying pan, to speak. It would rather that there be solution to the problem. Should Bond Media lose its case, the fact that the legislation deficient at the moment would almost cerof tainly mean that it could continue to hold licence for quite some considerable time. does not want a solution; it will oppose possible solution. So we ought to ignore the arguments being put forward by the Oppotempt sition. The previous speaker said that part of the problem was that the Tribunal would be able to put all sorts of conditions on the licence, like preventing the termination of employprises-Kodak; ment, preventing the reduction of daily news services, requiring the employment tional journalists, and so on. I am not too sure whether people in the community would not consider those to be very good and sonable powers for the Tribunal to have. can recall the problems that occurred with the purchase by Fairfax of Channel 7 in edged Melbourne and the demand from the a right Melbourne metropolitan public for the ernment and the Tribunal to take action to prevent the cancellation of shows that people in Melbourne wanted, to prevent the termiAct nation of employment, and to prevent Sydney based programs being forced on the sittings Melbourne community. What people forget is that broadcasting different when it comes to the normal of industrial rules and regulations. Broadincorporated casting is something that affects the comearly munity, and people demand a say about what they receive in their homes and about the sorts of programs provided and the of them. This requires regulation and an effective administering body. Some of the powers of the Tribunal that are being cised relate to things that are wanted by members of the public, who recognise that the power that is given to certain individuals by the bestowing of a licence is more than such individuals should have and that there is a need to control it. So I am not worried that the Tribunal should have these powers. Rather, I want to ensure that the Tribunal effective and fair in administering its dehave been cision making process.",101
190,Mr MACKELLAR ,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL,"Warringah) (9.04)Despite what the honourable member for Aston ( Mr Saunderson) has just said, it canso not but be argued that the Broadcasting no Amendment Bill must surely join the ranks of the mounting list of ill-conceived, hastily is prepared and politically motivated decisions the Hawke Government. I do not need to a remind the House of the 1987 election promIt ise from the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) any that 'by 1990 no Australian child will be living in poverty'; of his Government's atto woo the environment vote by deferring a decision on Coronation Hill until after the next election; of the recent. decision to hand out $36m in industry assistance to one of the world's most profitable enterand of his inflammatory handling of the dispute that apparently does not of addiexist-the pilots dispute. We now have the 'Bond Bill'-a piecemeal and unnecessary Bill with amendments of reasuch complex implications that they will I worsen rather than assist legislation which the Prime Minister himself has acknowlas being 'nightmarish'. Australians have to ask: Why this legislation and why Govnow? The Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) admits himself that comprehensive reforms to the Broadcasting are being developed quickly and will be introduced in the next autumn and Budget of Parliament. I ask the Minister: What is so urgent about the amendments in is this Bill before us tonight that they could range not be held over for a few months and in a consolidated document in 1990? I notice that the Minister, who is at the table, does not even look up when these questions are asked. I wonder standard whether he is even listening. As we all know, the reason has more to do with politics than with any rational comcritimonsense approach to the needs of the broadcasting industry. There is a public perception-one which the nature and timing of this Bill does absolutely nothing to dispelthat the legislation contains 'Bond amendments' in the event that the High Court of Australia upholds the original Australian Broadcasting Tribunal finding that Bond Media, as licensee of the Nine Network, is not a fit and proper person. The Minister's second reading speech would have us believe that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is presently faced with extremely limited options with regard to the Bond case and that revocation of the Nine Network licence is either inevitable or mandatory. On the contrary, the Federal Court's ruling on the Tribunal's findings expressed the opinion that the Tribunal has a wide discretion to take into account all aspects of the public interest in deciding whether to suspend or revoke licences, to impose conditions or to accept undertakings. It is still a puzzle to many of us why the Tribunal was not prepared to use its conditions and undertakings powers in the Bond Media case. The fact that they are uncontested powers is surely not a sufficient reason, since this is true of almost all the Tribunal's powers. In any event, the course of action adopted by the Tribunal has led to Federal Court and High Court action-and amending legislation, the result of which is arguably less satisfactory than if the conditions and undertakings powers had been contested in their own right. The Tribunal has expressed the opinion that its powers to give directions are inadequate and it seems to have in mind that circumstances could arise in which corporate structuring might prevent its directions from reaching the person responsible for the breach of conditions. This was clearly not so in the Bond case, yet the amendments in this Bill go far beyond that perceived weakness and will give the Tribunal what can only be described as sweeping powers to give almost unlimited directions to whomever it wishesfor example, involving itself directly in mercial aspects of a licensee's operations, such as programming decisions, the employment of key personnel, and the relationship with program suppliers. There is serious industry concern about the implications of these amendments and their ultimate influence on commercial decision making. I believe that this measure constitutes an incredible extension of the regulatory powers of the Tribunal, potentially into the minutia of the administration, management and operation of broadcasting functions. I remind the House that it comes only months before the Government, on its own admission, is to make reforms to which it is committed and which will simplify what is acknowledged to be complex and unwieldy legislation. The Bill is incompatible with that objective. We in the coalition parties believed that the Government, the Opposition and the broadcasting industry were in broad agreement about the need for a fundamental overhaul of broadcasting legislation which would simplify its operation and introduce a degree of deregulation to the industry. Despite that, we see the Government introduce a Bill which is so convoluted in its wording and potentially so intrusive and complex in its operation that it is the very antithesis of the rationalisation process proposed by the Government for 1990. Furthermore, the Government is doing this at a time when the Bond case is before the High Court, and its actions will be viewed with concern by those who, quite correctly, question the propriety of changing the rules while the game is still in progress. The truth is that the amending legislation smacks of panic. In fact, it is very typical of the actions of the Government at the present time. Industry has not been consulted. The legislation has obviously been prepared in great haste and is badly presented. The need for its extended provisions is not convincing. They fly in the face of the generally agreed goal of simplification and deregulation and they provide the Tribunal with controversial new powers. One is bound to ask why this is so. Even if one was generous enough to overlook the implications of this measure for the Nine Network, the reason, sadly, comes down to com- pure political expediency and, again, poor judgment. This is a face saving exercise to disguise the fact that the Prime Minister promised before the 1987 election that his Government would 'urgently reform this nightmarish legislation'. The amending legislation before us tonight is really nothing more than a hurried piece of theatricals to show that almost three years after the Prime Minister's promise of reforms the Government not only is doing someth,ing but can make promises, expansively, in a second reading speech about the reforms that it now intends to bring down in 1990. It is for these reasons and for the reasons outlined by my colleague that the Opposition opposes this Bill in its totality and has moved the second reading amendment.",103
191,Mr BRUMBY ,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL,"Bendigo) (9.10)-1 propose to speak only briefly on the Broadcasting Amendment Bill, and particularly in relation to the principal amendment, which is· referred to as section 92M. 1 will also make some comments about other aspects of the Bill which hitherto have not been debated, and 1 refer to the proposed amendments in relation to public radio. 1I have a particular interest in that area as a public radio station is located contiguous to my electorate of Bendigo, and 1 refer to radio station 3ccc FM. The general thrust of the legislation and the principal amendment is to give the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) a more flexible range of remedies as an alternative to licence suspension or revocation where an adverse finding is made against the suitability of a commercial radio or television licensee. As we have heard already in the debate, the proposed alternative remedies will enable the Tribunal to revoke, vary or impose licence conditions, issue directions and if necessary direct interests to be divested within six months. As 1I have said, the Bill contains a number of other amendments, including a number which relate to public radio, and 1 will say a few words about those in a moment. 1 note that the Opposition has moved an amendment in relation to the second reading motion and really 1 must concur with the comments made by my colleague the honourable member for Aston ( Mr Saunderson), who really described the amendment as totally meaningless and totally worthless. It is meaningless and worthless because it does nothing at all to clarify the Broadcasting Act and it does nothing at all to clarify the position which the Government has attempted to make clear through the proposed amendments in this Bill. Basically, the Opposition is simply saying that this is a hasty piece of legislation, it is a little bit hard for Parliament to come to terms with and therefore we should do nothing and let the existing legislation continue. From the Government's perspective that position is not satisfactory and we believe that the Act needs amending. 1 think it is pertinent to refer to the description of these changes by the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) when referring to this legislation. The Minister said that at present the Tribunal would be faced with extremely limited options if, after conducting an inquiry which it was required to hold, it found that a commercial licensee was no longer fit and proper or no longer had the financial, technical or management capacity to provide an adequate and comprehensive service. At the present time the Tribunal may only impose licence conditions or suspend, revoke or not renew a licence. However, if a licensee's unsuitability were due to the conduct or character of a person in a position to control the licensee company or its operations, quite clearly licence conditions may not be an effective remedy. That is simply because, as the Minister put it, the conditions may not be capable of affecting the influence of the relative person on the licensee company. The only other remedies available-suspension, revocation or refusal to renew a licence-would put the service off the air. Quite logically, it follows that cessation of the service penalises not only the licensee company but also the viewing or listening public and innocent shareholders and creditors. So there is a need, as the Minister says quite clearly in his second reading speech, to give the Tribunal more flexible and less draconian remedies. That is really what this Bill is all about-it is about achieving those objectives. 1 must say that 1 believe that the Bill has been properly worded. There is a need to amend the principal Act and really in simplistic terms the Bill provides a range of more flexible remedies to deal with the problem whereby a licensee may not be considered to be a fit and proper person to hold a licence. The honourable member for Aston referred to the need for regulation in the broadcasting industry, and the fact is that there is a need to regulate the industry. Also, there is a need to let market forces operate, but it would be foolish in the extreme to suggest that there should not be regulation in the public broadcasting industry, which has such an impact on viewing audiences and on people who listen to the radio. So, there is a need for rules and standards to be applied. With this legislation the Government is simply providing a more flexible range of remedies to deal with problems that might arise in relation to the fitness. or propriety people who hold licences. In respect of the Opposition's amendment, I should say that one of the claims made by Opposition speakers in this debate tonight is that the Government has done nothing in the past two or three years to reform or change the Broadcasting Act. I point out that in 1987 this Government made very substantial changes to the Act-in fact, the biggest changes that \lave been made to the Act for many years. The following year we reformed the limitations on the ownership and control of commercial radio stations. As an example of just some of the things that we have done in those reforms to the Act and subsequently, I indicate that we replaced the old two-station rule in television with limitations based on audience reach-a major and dramatic change introduced by this Government. We replaced the old limit on radio station holdings with new limits which recognise the growth, development and changes which are occurring in the radio industry. We have also introduced, of course, the historic media limits between radio, television and newspaper outlets in the same marketplace. These reforms in the life of this and previous parliaments-and I refer to the cross-media ownership laws-were quite historic. This Government has a record of change and reform, and broadcasting ownership and control policies have been clearly stated at all times by this Government. The other part of the legislation which I said I would refer to this evening relates to public radio. Amendments included in this Bill enable aspiring public licensees when conducting test transmissions to broadcast sponsorship announcements in accordance with the rules applying to public broadcasters, and they also permit public radio licensees to broadcast community promotion material. It is really on the question of promotion material that I will comment tonight. Over the past few years there has been enormous growth in Australia's public broadcasting industry. Public radio broadcasting was introduced in 1972. It is a non-profit, non-commercial, community owned and operated form of broadcasting and its objective is to complement the commercial and national broadcasting sectors. I understand that today there are more than 80 public broadcasting of radio stations on air and that something like a further 20 licensees are waiting to receive approval for licences next year. The Government does provide and has provided funding to the Public Broadcasting Association of Australia over a number of years at a level of $300,000. While the Government has maintained that amount in recent years in nominal terms, in real terms there has been some decline in the commitment that the Government has been able to make to the public broadca-ting industry. I guess the Government has had to juggle resources, and it has had to turn around a $9.6 billion deficit. In fact, the Government has turned it into a $9 billion surplus. That has been appropriate to set the macro-economic agenda correctly in Australia. The Government has not been able to increase funding in real. terms for public broadcasting, but it has maintained that funding level of $300,000 a year in nominal terms. I would like to see that amount increased in the future if that is possible because, as I said, next year it is likely that another 20 public radio stations will come on air. Last year I think something like eight or nine public radio stations went on air and the year before it was three or four. Clearly, their share of the available resources of the Public Broadcasting Association was somewhat greater than that which will be available if 20 new stations come on air next year. I think it would be desirable if the Government were able to provide additional resources to the Public Broadcasting Association to assist those 20 stations which will come on air next year. There is another sense in which I am talking about the financial viability of public broadcasting, and that is that public radio stations have traditionally relied for about 70 to 80 per cent of their income on sponsorship announcements. Typically, they are announcements for local firms, shops and industries in the broadcast area. In a nonadvertising but informative sense the announcements can provide information which is broadcast on public radio for a fee. That . has provided, as I said, about three-quarters of the income for public radio stations. Over recent years, the Broadcasting Tribunal has made a number of what seem to me rather ad hoc decisions that have made it very difficult for the public broadcasting stations to plan ahead with any certainty in relation to sponsorship. A decision was made earlier this year in relation to the licence renewal of one radio station which, it appeared, had been breaching the spirit of the Act. As a result, the determination made by the Broadcasting Tribunal imposes some difficult and rigid standards on public broadcasting sponsorship. For instance, I am told that, under the new rules set by the Tribunal-the precedent from its ruling on the licence renewal-it is not possible to mention a sponsor's name twice in a particular sponsorship and it is not possible to mention the phone number of a sponsoring body or firm twice in a sponsorship announcement. This has really meant that public radio is uncertain about the sponsorship rules and standards that apply. In the Bill before the House, the Government makes clear that community sponsorship announcements in future will be acceptable. I very much welcome that commitment and that alteration to the legislation. It also basically implies that we are now looking to the Tribunal to establish standards in relation to sponsorship and that, if the Tribunal does not come up with standards in the future, the Government may have to look at incorporating those standards by amending the legislation in future. Personally, I would welcome the Tribunal looking at the issue of sponsorship as soon as possible. It does not seem to me to be a difficult task to establish a set of standards, rules and guidelines that will provide the framework on which public radio stations can work out their future cash flow, income and potential sponsorship. I do not think it will be a difficult task to establish those standards, and I hope that the Tribunal does that soon. The Minister has made clear in his second reading speech on the Bill-and other members on this side have made clear-that we are asking the Tribunal to examine the question of standards. If the Tribunal does not do that, the Government has indicated that it will consider amending the legislation in future. I believe that it is vitally important to the future of public radio in Australia that the standards for sponsorship are outlined clearly, so that public radio stations can plan ahead over the years and make decisions about what forms of sponsorship will or will not be acceptable in terms of the Act. In conclusion, I support the changes outlined in the Bill. I support the principal change to broadcasting ownership and control in relation to fitness. This is a simple measure that gives the Tribunal more flexibility in the remedies that it can apply. In relation to public broadcasting, I support the changes we have outlined, and I hope that the Tribunal will soon address the question of standards for public radio broadcasting sponsorship.",105
192,Mr DOWNER ,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL,"Mayo) (9.24)-Many members of the House will recall that in his policy speech in 1987 the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) made it clear that one of the ambitions of the Australian Labor Party would be to clean up the Broadcasting Act, which he damned as it was then written. This Broadcasting Amendment Bill is really the first attempt by the Government to simplify and clarify that extremely complex and cumbersome legislation. While all honourable members would agree that the Broadcasting Act does require clarification, revision and simplification, the fact is that the proposal the Government has brought to the House today is a piecemeal, and not a comprehensive, approach. The history of how these matters have developed only illustrates how true it is that this is indeed a piecemeal approach. The Minister for Transport· and Communications ( Mr Willis) set up a task force in his own Department of Transport and Communications headed by a Deputy Secretary to the Department, and they worked up some proposals that I and many members of the Labor Party, including the honourable member for Aston ( Mr Saunderson), let me add, thought were not terribly well considered. Perhaps the Minister agreed with those proposals. In any case, the Deputy Secretary to the Department committed what the Minister regarded as some sort of solecism by speaking to the media about his view-and I think I am right in recalling this-that the market could decide the standards for children's television. So horrific was the concept of the market of ordinary people making a decision and recommendation to the Minister and of a public servant suggesting that heresy that the Deputy Secretary was removed as Chairman of that task force and has subsequently been replaced by the Secretary to the Department as Chairman of that task force. That was the first accident that happened in this process, and the second has clearly occurred within the Labor Party Caucus. The Caucus has now set up a watchdog committee headed by the honourable member for Aston and including-I think I am right in saying-a couple of senators and the honourable member for Fraser ( Mr Langmore). This watchdog committee will keep an eye on the Minister and ensure that any future proposals he brings forward are properly considered, rational and comprehensive proposals. This is the sort of Caucus revolt we used to see in the days of the Whitlam Government. What we have here now is a Minister who doubtless remembers well the catastrophe of the Whitlam Government and who is finding his own integrity as a Minister undermined by the Caucus zealots who are interested in this issue. As I have said, this is piecemeal legislation, not legislation that will simplify, clarify and rewrite the Broadcasting Act. It is piecemeal and messy legislation because, as previous speakers have pointed out and as will be pointed out in another place at some length, there are real questions about just how constitutional the legislation is. There are also real questions about how successful it will really be in achieving the objectives it sets itself,. such as the objective of simplifying the way in which the Tribunal can handle the circumstance that nearly arose-but did not quite arise-in relation to Bond Media and its ownership of Channel 9. Whether this legislation would successfully deal with that is, of course, hypothetical as a result of the various court proceedings that took place in that instance. However, the fact is that this legislation raises real questions about constitutional validity. Therefore, it is messy, ill-considered, piecemeal legislation. The Government must come forward with the legislation that it once said it would introduce-legislation that will simplify, clarify and make much more comprehensive the operation of the Broadcasting Act. In pursuing these sorts of objectives and, indeed, in introducing this type of legislation, the Governm-nt really needs to rethink the whole rationale of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and how it works. It needs to stop and ask itself several basic threshold questions, as they are called nowadays, of the kind that have been drawn to the attention of a number of members of this House by the Business Regulation Review Unit. That Unit is not some think-tank out in the community supported by the business community; it is an arm of the Federal Government. It has successfully raised some of these threshold questions about the role of the Broadcasting Tribunal and indeed has raised the question of whether we truly need a Broadcasting Tribunal at all. I have personally concluded that we do need the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. However, in coming to that conclusion, the Government needs to consider basically what the Tribunal is set up to do and how more comprehensively and intelligently it can pursue that role. After all, when it comes to regulating the electronic media, we must remember that we already have the Trade Practices Commission, the Trade Practices Act, the National Companies and Securities Commission, foreign ownership requirements and a whole range of regulatory mechanisms. The Tribunal comes on top of those mechanisms. We need to understand how the Tribunal fits into that pattern, rather than have it operate as though other pieces of legislation do not exist. There are two basic arguments why we would want to have the Tribunal. First, there is a desire to regulate the power of broadcasting to influence attitudes in the community. This is the popular and usual approach to the justification of the existence of the Tribunal. In its July 1989 discussion paper entitled Review of Broadcasting Regulations, the Department of Transport and Communications stated: . . . the rationale for regulating the content of broadcasting services . . . lies in the power of broadcast services to influence public opinion and attitudes. This view marks out broadcasting as being strikingly different from any other form of business. It also represents broadcasting as being qualitatively different from other media, arguing that broadcasting should be 'subject to controls on content which need not apply to those other means'. That is one of the justifications for having a tribunal. The spectrum is a commonly owned resource and that warrants, as others have said in this debate already, some community control over that resource-whatever 'community control' may mean. I suppose one could go on to argue that we do not want to see the electronic media-broadcasting-used to influence so-called political attitudes. That does not mean just party political attitudes but general political attitudes-attitudes to social, economic and other issues in the community. It is worth remembering that those restrictions are placed only on the electronic media; the same restrictions do not apply to the print media. In other words, there is a real inconsistency in approach when one considers that proposition. The other aspect of this argument is that the Government should set minimum community standards. There is a strong argument in favour of that, but I think the strength of the argument lies ultimately in the protection of children. It is not an argument along the lines that the Government should decide what is good for adults in the community. Ultimately we want people to be able to make decisions about what they would like to watch on television and what they would like to listen to on the radio. It will not be for the Government, or some tribunal arbitrarily established by the Government, to make that judgment. After all, if they make the judgment that people should watch certain types of programs, that is it: they simply will not watch the programs. There has to be an intelligent attitude to that. I really think the basic argument for setting minimum standards revolves around the protection of children The other aspect of this argument is that of national identity, that our television and radio programs have to have an Australian look. Australians probably want an Australian look on their television and radio, and that is understandable. I am a good example of somebody who wants to see that. Given that we want to see the Australian look, particularly on television, I would have thought the market would naturally ensure that one was provided. We can see that from the degree of Australian content that is provided by most, but not all, of the networks. We cannot. see that from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), by the way, but the ABC is not subject to the guidelines of the Tribunal and it ought to be. That is not just my view; it is the view of many members of the Australian Labor Party as well and it is the view of the House of Representatives Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. The second argument for a role for the Tribunal is the argument that somehow the marketplace has failed and is not going to work. That argument revolves around the scarcity of the spectrum. I think all of us in this House want to avoid monopolies, although the Labor Party enjoys monopolies in the public sector and is quite happy to have them there. On this side of the House we do not like monopolies at all. Of course, the issue of the avoidance of monopolies is addressed by the Trade Practices Act, so whether the Tribunal plays any part in that is probably a peripheral issue. We on this side of the House want to avoid the concentration of market power. In some areas of the media the Government has shown' a distinct reluctance even to address that issue. I suppose that is another debate. The scarcity issue is an interesting one. One of the consequences of scarcity of the spectrum is the accumulation of what economists would call monopoly rents. It is interesting to look back a couple of yearsperhaps three years-at the prices that were paid for networks Seven, Nine and Ten. When one looks at· the prices and the then valuation of the assets one can see that the difference is in the vicinity of $500m, although that is a very loose back-of-theenvelope estimate. That represents the monopoly rents that were involved in those licensees having the privilege of access to a scarcity of spectrum. Because of that privilege there is a strong argument for giving the Tribunal a very real role. I rest by the report that I was prepared to sign of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure in November of last year-just a year ago-which drew that very conclusion. Changing technology will render superfluous the argument about market failure. Eventually when we move to pay television and new forms of communications technology it simply will not matter because the scarcity of spectrum issue will no longer be relevant. There will be such diversity, such a choice, that scarcity will not be a problem. In the meantime the Government needs to ensure that the Tribunal does its work smoothly and that its work is comprehensible and fair. I come back to where I started. Some of the objectives of this legislation are fine, it is piecemeal legislation. The Minister has had plenty of time to consider putting together a comprehensive package. He has found confusion and chaos everywhere and has doubtless suffered enormous cross-pressures-I am a little sympathetic towards him-with the networks bullying and cajoling him and some of his colleagues doing the same thing. We all know who amongst his colleagues are close to some of the media moguls. I need not go into that, but we know who they are. He is subject to those pressures and, presumably, to pressures of integrity and the like. I hope the Government comes up with an intelligible, comprehensive package instead of this piecemeal nonsense which has been thrust into the House tonight in order to deal with the so-called Bond contingency. Mr MARtIN (Macarthur) (9.36)-1 enter the debate tonight in support of the Broadcasting Amendment Bill. I do so mindful of some of the comments made earlier tonight in this debate by my colleagues on this side of the House. I· am particularly mindful of comments made by the honourable member for Aston ( Mr Saunderson) because he clearly demonstrated that, contrary to those on this side of the House, those on the other side are totally confused as to what they really stand for. He was able to demonstrate-and I. am sure any person who cares to flick through the newspapers of the last couple of months will see this amply demonstrated-that on the one hand the Opposition spokesman on broadcasting suggests that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) needs to carry out a full inquiry into broadcasting in this country. The next day he makes a statement that the Tribunal needs to be abolished, and in fact the headline of the Melbourne Herald on 16 October this year reads: Coalition plans to abolish the ABT. Clearly, there is total confusion as to what the Opposition wants. On the other hand, this legislation is a comprehensive attempt by the Government to clean up a problem and it has been referred to in colloquial terms as the Bond amendment. Quite simply, rulings handed down by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, challenged in the High Court of Australia, and subsequently apbut pealed once again, have led to a deal of confusion. One of the things that concern me greatly about this is the effect the ramifications decisions made under the existing legislation might have in areas such as my own. The Government's broadcasting policies-I am referring here to the aggregation proposals which have been put in place-clearly demonstrate that there can be a disadvantage to the people in the south-east of New South Wales if this legislation does not go through. What could happen if this legislation does not go through is that basically the Tribunal would have two options. If the appeal in the High Court about being a fit and proper person to hold a licence is upheld or thrown out or the legislation stands as it is, the Tribunal can do two things: it can do absolutely nothing, and there would be a tremendous hue and cry within the community if it did nothing; or it can revoke the licence. Can the House imagine what it would mean if the Nine network went off air? The Nine network is the premier network in Australia. I am pleased to see the honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp) here because he knows full well that the premier network in the south-east of New South Wales is the Nine network, which is taken through WIN ""Television. One would see WIN Television going off air as well. It has just spent millions of dollars upgrading all of its equipment so that it reaches from Wollongong down to the Victorian border and, under aggregation, is putting in millions of dollars worth of equipment to get into Wagga Wagga, Orange and Bathurst. All of this has been put at risk, and yet we hear Opposition members say that the legislation is not comprehensive enough, that it is dreadful, again it is looking after mates, and all that sort rubbish that they continue to go on with. Clearly the legislation fulfils a necessary role of giving the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, as was said in the second reading speech of the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis), access to more appropriate remedies in cases where a commercial radio or television licensee does not meet the basic suitability requirements that are currently applicable to a licence. That is what it is all about. Again, going through the history of what happened in the Bond case with the network, in June the ABT found that, because Bond had made an improper payment of some $400,000 to the former Queensland Premier, Bond himself was not a fit and proper person to hold a broadcasting licence. Bond subsequently appealed to the High Court, as we know, and in September the High Court overturned that finding and ruled that the ABT findings against Bond were 'impossible in logic and common sense'. It went on to say that the Tribunal had made errors of law by ignoring positive evidence about the management of Bond's broadcasting interests and by failing to distinguish between Bond's fitness arid of the licensee companies. ' According to what the High Court ruled, the functions of the Tribunal are unclear in that respect. Surely everyone in this place would agree that there is a need to understand what constitutes a fit and proper person in terms of holding a licence. But, more importantly, out of all this it is important for everyone to understand what the ramifications would be if nothing was done. I for one am not prepared to sit here and say, 'Let it go. Don't worry about all of those hundreds of thousands of people in the Illawarra and in the electorates of the honourable member for Gilmore and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro ( Mr Snow), not to mention out in the west and so on'. I am not prepared to say, 'Let us forget about all those and let one of the television stations go off the air'. I would not suggest that we should not worry about all of the job losses that will come or about medium business enterprises that those on the other side suggested that this Government was kicking to death in other legislation in this House this afternoon. I would not suggest that we should of not worry about them going to the wall or about WIN television, the journalists and the people that work for them having to go to the wall because of the Opposition's failure to endorse what this Government is trying to do. I come back to the point that we have seen a realistic attempt by this Government to do something about cleaning up what clearly is a situation that is not sustainable. The Government has also indicated that further reforms will be developed and that that legislation will be introduced next year when we come back. I think it is fair to suggest that the operation of key areas in the ABT's responsibility-ownership and the control enforcement scheme-need to be looked at in that regard. But there is a need to give the Tribunal more flexibility and less draconian remedies. The remedies can be described simply as that-draconian. What could be more draconian than the premier television network going off the air? What could be more draconian than failing to provide a television service to people through a major part of New South Wales, that part of Australia where aggregation was first implethat mented and which is a trial for the rest of Australia? I conclude by saying that there is clearly a lack of understanding by those opposite as to what the Bill seeks to do. In his second reading speech the Minister clearly outlined the ramifications for broadcasting, television, and perhaps in future in terms of radio, if people were found not to be fit and proper persons to hold licences. Additionally, the question of whether it is the management or the person is subject to interpretation. The Tribunal ruled in one way, the High Court overturned that, and now there is an appeal pending. We are getting down to matters of law. The Tribunal rightly said in October, when it decided to appeal the High Court decision, that its appeal was on the ground that the ABT was concerned with 'the real world and not legal fiction'. The real world as far as I am concerned and as far as the people of the Illawarra are concerned is that people have access to the television networks that they have had ever since WIN television started broadcasting out of there news and a whole range of programs with local content. We do not want to see that jeopardised. We do not want to see that lost. I am pleased that the honourable member for Gilmore is present because I feel quietly confident that he will support me on this. He, for one, would not like to see the netvanced work lost. He gets good coverage on WIN television, just like the rest of us who repreing sent the best part of New South Wales. To lose that when the company has such an incredible audience reach is something I am sure no politician in that coverage area would like to sustain. I say once again, in conclusion, that there is a need to clarify this point. This legislation does that. It is a pity that those on the side do not understand what it is all about, but that is not surprising because day after day confusing signals come out of the latest spokesman on communications. One day the Opposition is in support; the next day it says that the Tribunal should go; the next day says that there should be full inquiries based on what the Tribunal's powers are. It nonsense. This legislation will do something positive, and I commend it to the House.",107
193,Mr SHARP ,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL,"Gilmore) (9.47)-The contribution made by the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Martin) was interesting to follow. He referred to an area that he and I both know very well as we represent porexaggerating tions of an area that is covered by a signifigumentative cant regional television station. One assertion he has made in his contribution tonight has been that the Opposition is in chaos and confusion as to its approach to communication tions matters. I point out to the Parliament that Australia currently suffers from a munications industry which is in chaos. people would say that the chaos that reigns in it is equal to that in the ranks of Government at the present time. Nobody who knows anything about the communicahas tions industry in Australia today would argue with the fact that, at whichever level of communications one looks, the industry is in a mess. I suppose that the Government cognises that in part by introducing the Broadcasting Amendment Bill tonight, which it is trying to force through using the tine to cut off debate as it tries to bully the Parliament into accepting the legislation that with local it imposes upon it. This legislation does not tidy up the mess that this Government has created in our communications industries today. Indeed, it could be argued successfully that the mess that Australia's communications industries find themselves in today will be further adas a consequence of this legislation. Some of the legislation which we are debattonight is totally unnecessary; some makes the situation worse; and some will see the situation of some of our commercial television stations actually deteriorate rather than get better. The legislation that we debate tonight will see the situation of our commercial radio broadcasters and, indeed, our public radio broadcasters deteriorate. As the other honourable member for Farrer ( Mr Tim Fischer) reminded me a few moments ago, the situation we are debating tonight will be made worse because the legislation questions the very validity of the Constitution upon which this Parliament and this nation is built. it The advice the members of the Opposition have had-which has been made available to is a the Government-seriously questions the constitutional validity of the legislation that is before the House tonight. The honourable member for Macarthur has said to us that if this legislation is not passed, television stations like Channel 9 will go off the air. That is just extremist. It is the situation and using an arpoint for the purpose of trying to win the argument. It is not using that point for the purposes of trying to establish the truth of the situation. There is no queswhatsoever, if this legislation is not successful in this House tonight, about the future comof Channel 9. It will continue to broadcast Many on regional stations, such as WIN 4, that broadcast into my electorate. It will continue the to do the job it has done in the past. The honourable member for Macarthur touched on a number of important issues in his contribution tonight. He talked of such things as jobs in regional television. He talked about such things as local content in regional retelevision. Those are issues which concern me greatly because the quality of regional television touches the homes and hearts of guillomy constituents. Over the last 12 or so months under aggregation, the quality and iocal content of regional television in the electorate of Gilmore have been seriously reduced. The Minister would argue that, as a consequence of aggregation, viewers have more choice. Perhaps they have more choice but the argument that we would put forward and that many of my constituents would put forward is that local content in regional television as a consequence of aggregation has reduced considerably. Why has it reduced? The answer is very simple. As the honourable member for Macarthur pointed out, many of these regional television stations have had to outlay amounts of between $15m and $20m in order to comply with the conditions of aggregation. That extra capital outlay, coupled with the additional running costs and additional interest costs, has forced regional television into a situation where it is no longer making money in aggregated areas. Whilst the honourable member for Macarthur spoke a great deal about WIN 4it had its annual general meeting only last week-from reports that I have received it is losing money hand over fist. Indeed, the three commercial television stations in the first aggregated market area are all losing money hand over fist. When commercial television stations are losing money, there is really only one area of flexibility in their expenditure, and that is local content: local news, local current affairs, local sporting coverage and so forth. So under aggregation we have experienced a significant reduction in local content produced by regional television. As the financial situation of regional television in these aggregated market areas continues to decline, we can only expect to see further declines in local content and in the quality of the product that is being sold over commercial television. There are some other very serious issues which relate to my electorate which are affected by this legislation tonight. I happen to have a public broadcaster in my electorate situated in Goulburn which could only be described as having been at the front line of public broadcasting over the last couple of years. I speak specifically of FM 103, Goulburn community radio station. This community radio station has been taken up by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. It has been charged with having breached the guidelines and having exceeded the normal terms and conditions of what would be perceived to be a proper sponsorship announcement for public broadcasters. Of course, FM 103 is very concerned about that. It has found that, despite all the resources and the alleged skills of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, it has not been able to come up with a clearly defined specific definition of what a proper sponsorship announcement on a public broadcaster ought to be. Because of that, FM 103 has received conflicting advice, be it from the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, from the Federal Court itself or, indeed, from various so-called legal experts. As a consequence, FM 103, which is so typical of many public broadcasters throughout Australia, has spent in excess of $15,000 representing itself at the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal hearings, money which has been spent to no avail. The situation that prevails at FM 103 prevails for the majority of broadcasters right around Australia. So it can easily be said that the chaos this Government has created through its own legislative processes has helped to put at risk the very viability and future of public broadcasting throughout Australia. Because of that, the public broadcasters of Australia have now, I believe, put at risk the commercial viability of commercial radio station broadcasters in this country. If one looks at the status of commercial broadcasters in this country one will find that about 50 per cent of them at present are losing money. If one scratched the surface of any commercial radio station in Australia, one would probably find that most of them are up for sale or are prepared to be sold at a reasonable level. Why? It is because of the legislative processes and the management that this Government is engaged in, because of the way it has managed our radio system in Australia, be it public or commercial. That situation of chaos prevails throughout this portfolio which relates to transport and communications. When one asks why this portfolio is in such chaos, one starts to realise that what this Government set up after the 1987 election in the form of super ministries is totally unmanageable. The portfolio that the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis), who sits opposite me tonight, has to deal with is humanly unmanageable. The roles that this Minister has to perform are beyond most people's capabilities. This Minister has to deal with the chaos which besets our commercial television industry, with the problems of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, with the problems that beset our public broadcasters and our commercial radio broadcasters and with the out of control situation that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has got itself into. He also has to deal with other matters which relate to the waterfront, which he has been unable to deal with satisfactorily, coastal shipping, matters that relate to our roads, the pilots dispute and such matters as additional runways at Sydney Airport. Each and everyone of those issues should take up the full time effort and resources of one Minister, but they have to be spread far and wide as one Minister deals with all of those issues. So it is under this regime that we find commercial broadcasting and television services, our public broadcasters and our Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in a state of chaos. The state of chaos is, I am afraid, the product of this Government. It will not go away until we have a change of government.",112
194,Mr COWAN ,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL,"Lyne) (9.58)-As chairman of the Opposition's transport and communications committee,I wish to add a few words to reinforce what has been said by the speakers on this side of the House. We are concerned at the haste with which this legislation has been brought in. We are aware of the promise of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke). We are aware that there need to be vital amendments to the Broadcasti,lg Act to update it to meet the requirements of both television and radio throughout Australia. The honourable member for Gilmore ( Mr Sharp) has outlined the situation so far as aggregation is concerned. Following the aggregation news, a number of the smaller television stations have been sold. That will certainly make a difference. We are already seeing this in many of the rural parts of Australia, particularly the rural areas of New South Wales. We are very concerned at the powers that the legislation gives to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal because they are very wide in scope. It will be interesting to see the way the Tribunal deals with them. There are some principles that we stand by. One of the principles-and I am sure that the three major political parties and industry should stand by it-is the need for a fundamental overhaul of broadcasting legislation on a considered, not a piecemeal, basis. Secondly, there is a need to reduce the present plethora of extensive and inefficient regulation. Those two issues spell out the matters that we are concerned about. At this time, before Christmas, we do not want to see the Government bringing in the legislation hurriedly if it is not consistent with those basic objectives as far as this Parliament and the public are concerned. An article in the Australian newspaper this morning states: Labor backbenchers yesterday moved to create a broadcast group to keep the Minister for Transport and Communications, Mr Willis, under close Caucus scrutiny as he changes the Broadcasting Act. I doubt whether the Minister really wanted to change the Act at this time. The Minister, whom I respect very much, has had very strong pressure placed upon him to change this Act and so, as we said earlier, he has brought some piecemeal legislation into the Parliament which gives tremendous powers to the Tribunal which will enable it'to determine basically the road that it will tread in the future. We know what the High Court decided on the Bond matter. I am pleased to see that changes were made to the Broadcasting Act. I think that the changes were necessary. We would like to see the Government financially supporting public broadcasting more than it is. . I say in conclusion that it is important that, no matter what legislation comes before this Parliament, special attention is given to the ownership of television and the quality of broadcasting generally throughout Australia to make it fair. The honourable member for Mayo ( Mr Downer) referred earlier to the protection of children in regard to films and entertainment. We have to think of the consumer. It is the consumer who is important. We must maintain high morals in this country. When honourable members go home at night at 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock and switch on the television for the news broadcast, they might see something that is inappropriate not only for children but also for adults. It worries me that Australia is putting some of this out. I want Australian content, but it should be like the English content-humorous, acceptable and for the benefit of the country. I strongly support the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Farrer ( Mr Tim Fischer). I am sorry to see the legislation coming before the House.",114
195,Mr SINCLAIR ,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL,"New England) (10.03)Communication is a vital element of our society. The freedom to speak to one another, the ability to communicate between people and to communicate between nations I guess is the symbol of the breaking of the Berlin Wall. As one who has been responsible for legislation in this sphere, however, I can say to the Government that I do not see that the Broadcasting Amendment Bill in any way enhances the facility to communicate. Indeed, to my mind one of the tragedies that the present Treasurer ( Mr Keating) has bestowed upon the Australian community is the thesis which he pursued and which was the product of the 1987 amendments to this legislation, which saw the structural change in the ownership and control provisions previously existing under the legislation that determined the basis by which the ownership of the various media could be held and the extent to which the breach of that ownership was permitted. I think that the financial crisis that is now besetting the major network proprietors is not peculiarly a product of those changes. There is no doubt that the trans-media prevention that has been introduced has contributed to the fact that the individual media today are in fewer hands. It has meant that not only are there enormous difficulties for the major networks, but also there are significant problems for those in rural communities. Aggregation is turning out to be a very costly experiment. There are enormous problems in maintaining the quality and quantity of Australian input and Australian programs. No amount of legislative restraint will ensure that this will change. Frankly, this legislation will achieve nought. I think the legislation. is a disastrous mistake. It has been introduced in haste and without adequate examination of what is needed in the community. It is the Bond amendment, if you wish. The Bond amendment is not going to address the problems of what I see as the inadequate consideration given by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to the affairs of one individual licence holder. In fact, I have a great respect for the contribution that Alan Bond as an entrepreneur has made to Australia. I thought it was quite impudent for the likes of those members of the Tribunal to reach the conclusion that they did. For the Government now to respond by introducing inadequate legislation is just as impudent. What it is seeking to do is fundamentally change the law on an ad hoc basis without considering the proper and correct way by which what is an extraordinarily complex area can be resolved. There are two things I want to say about the Tribunal in the little time available to me. There are a lot of other things I would like to have said about this legislation. First, there has now been a plethora of inquiries into the Tribunal. I know that the inquiries conducted by the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure of this House have addressed some of these problems, but the character of the Tribunal is not going to be changed while there is this proliferation of administrative law; while, as I understand it, there is to be restraint on appeals from decisions of the Tribunal; and while in legislation like this the powers of the Broadcasting Tribunal are going to be enhanced. It is essential that there should be a recognition that the Tribunal should not be a legal body. It would be far better, if one is going to have a body like this, to reappoint people who used to be on it, such as Ken Archer, who had come from the industry. Of course, one would have people who had been in public broadcasting-the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in particular-on the Tribunal, but I would suggest that somebody is needed who is aware of the commercial realities of the marketplace. Certainly, so far as the chairman is concerned, I am afraid that she in no way matches the high standard that David Jones, the former chairman, set during the term that he was there. Indeed, the more legalistic administrative law becomes the more the views of Mike Hutchinson of the Department of Transport and Communications are vindicated. There is no basis for the interventionary processes which are inhibiting the four principles to which the Minister for Transport and Communications ( Mr Willis) refers regarding ownership and control in his second reading speech. A way has to be found by which one can ensure then that the minimal criteria that must be set for the administration of television are met without unduly intervening in the ordinary commercial process. I would suggest to the Minister that really it would be far better if he withdrew this legislation, understanding full well the quandary of the fit and proper person definition, understanding the difficulties that there are; but I would suggest that in the financial predicament in which the major network proprietors now find themselves this legislation now could properly be set asid- and considered, as he says, in one of these other two tranches of amendments that he is going to introduce next year. He talks about an amendment in the autumn session and another amendment in the Budget session, albeit that that is conditional on the change of government that I have little doubt will take place whenever the next Federal election might be held. I submit to this House that if this legislation were to be examined, somebody like David Jones, who has been on the Tribunal, somebody like Ken Archer, who has been on the Tribunal, and perhaps Mr Oswin should be appointed. Why not appoint Professor Leonie Kramer, who has also been a Chairman of the ABC? If there was a group like that who looked at the legislation dispassionately, not on an ad hoc basis, the traumas of aggregation might be overcome and both a better quality of media presentation and better competition might be provided. Frankly, we are not getting better programs; we are getting worse programs. We are not getting better Australian content; we are getting less Australian content. We are not getting proper adjudication of the airwaves, but what I see as an increasingly finicky legalistic adjudication on the affairs of a very important part of the protection of the freedom of speech in this country. The Tribunal is being inadequately administered. It is far too legalistic in its structure. It is time that it was totally reversed, and I would suggest to the Minister that the proper course would be that when this legislation gets to the Senate it be set aside and not passed before the end of this year.",115
196,Mr WILLIS ,BROADCASTING AMENDMENT BILL,"Gellibrand-Minister for Transport and Communications) (10.09)In the half minute available, let me simply say that we do not accept the second reading amendment. There is no time to reply to the various points made. On the issue of constitutionality, I simply say that the advice that we have is that the legislation certainly is constitutionally valid. On the question of why the Bill is being brought forward at this time, which is an issue which has been taken up by many people, it is quite clear that there is a deficiency in the legislation. The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure unanimously said so. This addresses that very severe deficiency in the legislation.",116

206,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! I ask the honourable member for Deakin not to incite honourable members on my right. I also ask honourable members on my right to remain silent.,119
207,Mr BEALE,PAIRS,"With great respect, I am happy to address the terms of the Bill. But the way those opposite are carrying on is in flagrant defiance of the Chair and they are being disruptive in the chamber. I do not mind, nor will the honourable member for Calwell. He will not have a chance to speak on this Bill unless he shuts up. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill except for the changes proposed to the commercial tariff concession system. Shortly, our position on this matter will be outlined. However, in accordance with our view on this Bill, I move the following amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) notes that the Bill proposes to amend the Commercial Tariff Concession System to enable the Comptroller-General to make Concession Orders only in respect of broad classes of goods, rather than particular goods, thus potentially providing excessive and hence damaging protection to local manufacturers at the expense of other enterprise and commerce generally; and (2) is of the view that the introduction of a new statutory concessional entry scheme for imports in advance of the planned review by the Industry Commission is an inappropriate way for the Government to proceed in an area of such economic and commercial sensitivity"". In regard to the termination. of manufacture in bond, manufacture in bond was intro c duced to assist local manufacturers by allowing them access to imported goods without paying import duty where manufacturing takes place in Customs licensed warehouses. A couple of features of this scheme are that payment of duty on imported goods used in the production of goods for home consumption can be deferred until the products are sold and, with regard to goods produced for export, no duty is payable on the imported components. No duty is payable on imported material wasted in the production process. The Industries Assistance Commission in its 1987 report found that little manufacture was undertaken under this arrangement. The Industries Assistance Commission stated: It is evident, however, from the small number of manufacturers using the scheme and the restricted range of goods produced that the original objectives of the system have not been pursued. With regard to the possible abolition of the system, the Industries Assistance Commission commented: The abolition of manufacture in bond would mean that current users of the system would be required to operate under the same conditions as all other manufacturers. This would not only remove a major inequity but should also improve the pattern of resource allocation between activities which are currently permitted to use manufacture in bond and those which produce close consumption and production substitutes-such as other electronics and computer equipment. Following the Industries Assistance Commission report, the Government's 1988 economic statement recommended the abolition of the scheme. The Opposition does not oppose this change. Changes which are being proposed to the bottling of bulk spirits in licensed premises, which involve amendments to section 9 of the Customs Act 1901 and to section 37 of the Excise Act 1901, will now be reviewed. Currently, bulk potable spirits can be entered for home consumption. This amendment proposes that all potable spirits be bottled or packaged into non-bulk containers, and this Bill defines a bulk container as 'a container that has the capacity to have packaged in it more than 2 litres of spirit'. Both the Public Accounts Committee and the Industries Assistance Commission have examined the current practice and have expressed their concerns that the possibility exists that illicit spirit can be mixed with spirit on which duty has been paid. Recommendation number 10 of the Public Accounts Committee states: The Committee agrees with the view of the Distilled Spirits Industry Council and recommends that spirits bottling only be permitted on licensed ises which are subject to control of the Department. This would eliminate one category of operator, and should reduce the risk of illegal extension of paid spirit with duty free spirit. Following its usual practice, one that in the course of the last six years has been followed faithfully on many occasions, of legislation not through this Parliament but by press release, these changes were announced by the Government in a press release back in December 1988. However, the Opposition has no difficulty with this amendment, nor does it intend opposing the clauses of this Bill that seek to repeal unproclaimed sections of related Acts. The matters involved deal with the reporting of ships, the treatment of ships' stores, the use of bulk depots for containers and the imposition of penalties on officers who engage in collusive seizures or other corruption. Some of these have been on the books since 1981 and the point should be raised about why these have been allowed to sit unproclaimed for some years. I regret that the Minister will not have an opportunity to do so tonight, but he should explain to the House at some stage why, for instance, legislation dealing with corrupt officers was not proclaimed. Finally, the Opposition turns to those clauses that deal with changes to the commercial tariff concession system. This system was the successor of the old commercial by-law system, which was the subject of an Industries Assistance Commission report in 1982. Briefly, this system has allowed goods to enter duty free where goods serving similar function are not produced, or are not capable of being produced, in Australia in the normal course of business. The requirements to be met to gain a concession are spelt out in section XV A of the Customs Act and, in general, apply to particular goods. This Bill proposes to delete the particular goods sections of the Act and replace them with guidelines promulgated by the Minister. In general, these guidelines will relate to class of goods. A brief examination of the tariff concession orders currently in force shows that about 90 per cent of the concessions are for particular goods. For example, under item 8501 in the electrical motors classification, all the 110 concessions are for particular premgoods. Similar circumstances exist in the case of concessions for pumps, valves, bearings, and so on. Under the approach adopted in dutythis Bill, for instance, if a motor is included in a class which is manufactured in Australia, it would lose its concession, even though the particular motor is not made in Australia and no manufacturer intends producing this particular motor in Australia. The Government is arguing that a broader definition will allow it to grant more concessions. In practice, however, it will most likely mean that it will be harder to obtain a concession because the field will be widened from 'particular goods' to 'class of goods'. If this occurs there will be an increase in industry protection. Under the existing system, a number of applicants have had to take the extreme measure of making an application under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 for orders of review with respect to decisions taken by Customs under the Act. Customs had been refusing concessions for 'particular goods' on the basis that they were included in a 'class of goods' manufactured in Australia. One such case that is extensively used by the Government as the rationale behind these changes is the case of Corinthian Industries, which was heard in the Federal Court and concerned imported door skins. In this case the ruling of Customs was overturned. The issues of function, identical goods, particular goods and cross-elasticity of demand were all canvassed during this case. In its 1982 report the Industries Assistance Commission recommended that, whether the by-law was revised or replaced, the system should reflect commercial reality. In introducing the legislation the Minister commented on the need for practicalities. The urts have twice said that the simple test of goods serving similar functions is whether they are identical goods or whether they are interchangeable on a market test. Further, the Customs Act provides that when eligibility for concession is being assessed reference should be made to the marketplace. The changes proposed in this Bill would destroy this concept and in its place users of the system would have to revert to the use of a series of guidelines. This is not good enough. Applicants and industry in general must have review mechanisms available to them, the basis of which is an argument of law and not an argument based on guidelines which will quite naturally allow for personal interpretation. In referring to the legislative provisions in the jUdgment in the Corinthian case, it was stated by Justice Davies: Sections 2698 and 269c of the Act are not ambigupose ous. They should be applied having regard to the words used, not according to some background philosophy. With what is being offered in this legislation, background philosophy would be the relevant criterion and dissatisfied applicants would not be able to fall back on unambiguous legislation. What is being proposed here is the removal of a number of definitional clauses. These clauses meant that Customs was obliged to adopt an objective assessment criterion. Finally, both the Law Reform Commission and the Industry Commission are examining or are going to examine this whole system. In that context we seek an assurance from the Minister-whether he is able to give it himself or whether he can tell the honourable member for Calwell to give it on his behalf-that whatever the outcome of the reviews by the Law Reform Commission and the Industry Commission the Minister will ensure that the recommendations they make that move more objectively to the proper application of what is intended should be implemented. If the provision amending this section were passed tonight, from 1990 applicants would have to work under a new regime, and then more changes would probably be made after the reports to which I have referred have been considered. This is hardly conducive to creating an atmosphere of stability. in the marketplace. Additionally, these reviews will allow for input and consultation with the industry, which has not occurred prior to the drafting and moving of the changes to the system as proposed in this Bill. What is needed is more precise directions for the benefit of both Customs and users-that is, firm and unambiguous legislative direction and not departmental guidelines. The Opposition believes that these changes should be put on hold until the reports that contain industry input are available. The terms of the guillotine before the House tonight will preclude the Opposition moving the detailed amendments that would have to be considered in order that our proposed changes could properly be taken into account. Those proposed amendments have been circulated in the chamber, but I proto read them tonight. They are as follows: (1) Clause 18-0pposition to oppose. (2) Clause 19-0pposition to oppose. (3) Clause 20-0pposition to oppose. (4) Clause 21-0pposition to oppose. (5) Clause 22, page 7, line 33, before ""goods"" insert ""particular"".

(10) Clause 22, page 8, line 23, before ""goods"", insert ""particular"". (II) Clause 22, page 8, line 25, omit paragraph (e). (12) Clause 23-0pposition to oppose. (13) Clause 24-0pposition to oppose. (14) Clause 25-0pposition to oppose. (15) Clause 26-0pposition to oppose. (16) Clause 27, page 9, lines 19 and 20, omit paragraph (b). (17) Clause 27, page 9, line 29, omit ""or (I A)"", substitute "", (lA) or (18)"". (18) Clause 27, page 10, line I, omit ""or (IA)"", substitute "", (IA) or (18)"". (19) Clause 28, page 10, omit paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and paragraphs (0 to (I) inclusive. (20) Page 11, after clause 29 insert the following clause: Review of decisions ""29A. Section 273GA of the Principal Act is amended by omitting from subsection (1) paragraphs (m) and (n), and inserting the following paragraph: '(m) a decision of the Comptroller for the purposes of Part XVA;'."". (21) Clause 32, page II, at the end of the subclause add the following subclause: ""(2) The amendments to the Principal Act contained in sections 18 to 28 inclusive do not apply to an application under section 269G of the Principal Act for a concession order in respect of particular goods if the application was lodged the Comptroller before I January 1990."". We believed it was important to read those amendments into the record of the second reading' debate, even though we recognise that they could have been incorporated in Hansard later.",119
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,PAIRS,Mr Mountford)-I understand that the Government has agreed that they would be so included.,122
209,Mr BEALE,PAIRS,"Not with me. Mr Barry Jones-If you want to do that, I would agree because it is less painful for you and for us.",122
210,Mr BEALE,PAIRS,"I thank the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, but I have now read them into the record. I believe it was important to do that because it shows how strongly we feel about clauses 18 to 26 and clause 28 of the Bill, and I think it foreshadows the action that We will take in another place to try to make those amendments so that the Bill before us tonight can be amended in the way that we feel is appropriate. I repeat that the Opposition beIieves that these changes should be put on hold until the reports of the Industry Commission (IC) and the Law Reform Commission that are being considered at the moment come before the Government. Again, I would like the Minister to tell the honourable member for Calwell that he will agree to incorporate in a future amending Bill the sensible recommendations that come out of those two reviews. When it is time to vote on this Bill tonight, it is our intention not to vote on either the amendment or the second reading but to vote against the remaining stages of the Bill so that the Government will know how we feel about clauses 18 to 26 and clause 28, to which I have referred.",122

213,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,Order! There is no point of order. The Chair is not party to any agreements made between Government and Opposition members in relation to the time for speaking.,122
214,Dr THEOPHANOUS,PAIRS,"The honourable member spent about seven minutes reading out amendments which we would have agreed to incorporate in Hansard. In doing so he wasted the time of the House and we know that the Bill is under the guillotine. The honourable member made no general or philosophical point about industry policy. I found that extraordinary, given that it is traditional, when discussing customs and excise legislation, for the Opposition to indicate general approach and philosophy which it might adopt if it were to get into government, which is highly unlikely, in relation to the general issues with which customs and excise legislation deals. We are considering an omnibus Bill dealing with a number of matters in relation to customs and excise legislation and we have from the Opposition a general indication that it accepts most of the provisions in the Bill, but then there was an extraordinary claim regarding the changes which will be put in place. I will try to deal with the claims which the honourable member for Deakin brought up because the illogicality of some of his arguments is breathtaking. For example, he maintained that, as a consequence of the broader definitions being adopted by the Government in relation to this legislation, we would end up with more industry protection. Obviously the honourable member, as a shadow Minister, has not been following the Government's record on industry protection. This Government has lowered industry protection while simultaneously putting in place plans, initiatives and regulations to courage the development of Australian industry. There have been two phases to this. Not only have we had a wholesale reduction in protection without any other policy, but also we have had a policy of graduated reductions in protection combined with a sensible and planned approach to the development of the manufacturing industry. This approach is paying off because in all the economic statistics there are signs of a huge surge in investment in manufacturing industry in this country. That surge in investment will be of positive benefit to this nation. If we can see through this investment phase in manufacturing and if the Australian people are sensible enough-I am sure that they will be-to re-elect the Labor Government, we will see for the first time in 40 years the turning around of manufacturing industry. When those opposite were in government all they did was destroy the manufacturing industry. They also destroyed 500,000 jobs in only one year-that is, the last year of the former Fraser Government. The honourable member for Deakin did not present any arguments as to whether the measures will increase industry protection. the In fact, it could be argued that the change in the guidelines could reduce industry protection. Unless the Minister can specify a general category of goods to be exempted, particular types of goods may not fall within the general category. Therefore, particular types of goods which may have been exempted in the past will not be exempted in the future. It could equally be argued, on the basis of these changes, that there will be a reduction in industry protection rather than an increase. The shadow Minister-the honourable member for Deakin-had a long time in which to present an argument but he did not do so. His speech contained a lot of nonsense. He asked what assurance we can give that the Industry Commission review will be taken seriously by the Government. The Government has taken the correct step of passing legislation to establish the new Industry Commission, which we hope will be passed by the Senate as well. That Commission will have a revolutionary role in the examination of all aspects of industry policy, including this one. When the report comes en- down, of course the Government will consider it and thoroughly investigate it. The Government will act on its recommendations, if those recommendations are consistent with the policies of the Government.",122

HOUSING ASSISTANCE BILL 1989 Debate resumed from 1 November, on motion by Mr Staples: That the Bill be now read a second time.",123
216,Mr BEALE ,AYES,"Deakin) (11.09)-The OpKerr, D. J. C. position has a message for the bludgers in the Government. We will not be opposing Lavarch, M. H. Lee, M.

I suggest, however, that Government members should wait and listen O'Keefe, N. P. O'Neil, L. R. T. to my speech because they will learn something about housing and the view of the Saunderson, J. Sawford, R. W. Opposition. The Bill seeks to authorise a new ComScoll, John Scoll, Los monwealth-State Housing Agreement relating to the provision by the States, with Snow, J. H. Staples, P. R. assistance from the Commonwealth, of housing assistance for rental housing and home Tickner, R. E. purchase, The agreement will be for 10 years Uren, T. with a commitment in the current year and a three-year forward commitment of funds. Commonwealth assistance moving to a per capita basis will be in the form of grants NA rather than a"" combination of grants and Howard, J. W. Jun, D. F. concessional Loan Council borrowings. The States will be required to match half the MACKenar, M. J. R. Miles,C.G. value of untied Commonwealth grants and the funds will be used mainly for rental stock Nehl,G. B. Porter, J.

The Bill will appropriate just Ruddock, P. M. Shack, P. D. over $1 billion to the States and the Northern Territory for each of the next four years. Shipton, R. F. Sinclair, I. MCC. In addition, $9.8m will be granted for housing assistance for young people and $14.8m Spender, J. M. Sullivan, K. J. for mortgage relief payments, both in the 1989-90 year. There is little doubt that significant public Woods, R. L. Wooldridge, M. R. L. funds are necessary to provide a housing safety net for,. those disadvantaged in our PAIRS society who cannot adequately house themselves. The coalition may disagree with the Moore, J. C. Taylor, W. L. Government on certain aspects and emphases of this legislation-mainly the emphasis on public housing stock rather than on rental assistance to the private rental market, where help is really needed; the inefficiencies associated with public housing and the culture of dependency which it creates; the Second Reading unnecessary influence of the Commonwealth in setting States' housing preferences, goals and plans; and the confrontationist approach to the States in the preparation of this agreement. I am s.orry t.o say that the Minister f.or H.ousing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples), wh.o is resp.onsible f.or the neg.otiati.on .of this agreement, appears t.o have fled the chamber.

H.ousing purchase assistance l.oans are, in essence, g.overnment-pr.ovided paymentscash payments .or .other f.orms .of paymentdesigned t.o bridge .or lessen the gap between available h.ouseh.old inc.ome and the inc.ome required t.o .obtain appr.opriate housing.

The capacity .of this f.orm .of assistance t.o increase the number .of h.ouseh.olds helped fr.om a given budget c.ompared t.o public h.ousing can be attributed t.o a number .of fact.ors.

We have referred in .our sec.ondreading amendment t.o the confrontati.onist appr.oach taken by the C.omm.onwealth t.o the States in the prep+lration of this new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. We have had representations from some of the States about the way in which the Commonwealth has acted; the way in which this arrogant, out-of-touch and completely disinterested Government has approached the negotiation of this new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. In summary, those concerns include the lack of consultation with the States and Territories in the development stagesthe fact that the details of the proposal were communicated· to the States and Territories in a piecemeal fashion during the four months following the announcement of a new agreement in May and, as a result, its implications and, in p+lrticular, the financial impact, were not immediately apparent. In fact, these are still under consideration and will be subject to continuing negotiation for some time. I point out that, although this Bill is before the House tonight, none of the States has signed the agreem-nt and South Australia will not sign it until after the election on Saturday. Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you would know this and we can understand why that is the case and the States are still, sense, negotiating with the Commonwealth about this agreement even though the Bill is before us tonight. There are as yet unresolved issues associated with the home purchase assistance account, the financial implications of the deduction of principal and interest repayments to the Commonwealth from rental capital account and the Commonwealth's attempt through the new agreement to impose on the States and the Northern Territory its particular wishes on the way in which it, the Commonwealth, wants to force the States and the Northern Territory to. deal with the funds on housing. I want to say a special word about the Northern Territory because this issue is of paramount importance there. I understand that the Northern Territory is really concerned about this agreement and is concerned that the Government is not doing what it should be doing to alleviate the concerns in the Northern Territory. This afternoon the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West) brought before the House a proposal at last to get on with the job of upgrading Darwin airport. Mr Downer-Five years later.",125
227,Mr BEALE,NOES,"Five years later, yes. Remember that the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) was up there on a bulldozer at the end of 1984. He was up there on the bulldozer saying, 'We will proceed to this without delay'. It was five years later. The Minister was in here this afternoon at last with a proposal to get on with Darwin Airport and the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Snowdon) was sitting up there like a cat with a canary. The Minister was heaping praise on the honourable member for the Northern Territory about what a great job he had done.",126
228,Mr KERR ,NOES,This is not-MONICA,126
229,Mr BEALE,NOES,I cannot tell the difference between you and Denison. Are you Denison or the Northern Territory?,126
230,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,NOES,Mr Andrew)Order!,126
231,Mr BEALE,NOES,"I ask the honourable member for the Northern Territory to tell his constituents what he is going to do for the in a Northern Territory as far as the new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement is concerned. If the honourable member for the Northern Territory is such a genius at getting the dough for Darwin airport, let him get the dough for the Northern Territory on the new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement because, under the proposals outlined, the funds for the Northern Territory under the per capita arrangement would decrease to approximately $3m a year by 1992-93 from the current level of about $44m. Let the honourable member for the Northern Territory do something for his constituents up there by persuading the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, who is not even in the House for this discussion on his Bill, to do something about the squeeze on the Northern Territory funds for its money for housing purposes. Mr Downer-He has had to duck out of the House.",126
232,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The honourable member for Mayo has had too much to say.,126
233,Mr BEALE,NOES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker and, with great respect to your ruling, whatever the validity may be, the honourable member for Mayo will have a great deal to say a little later this evening. He may also contribute very significantly to this debate in exposing what is happening with this Bill, its undue emphasis on public housing at the expense of rental assistance to the private rental market and its confrontationist approach to the States. The remaining part of our second reading amendment focuses on the Government's deliberate and ruthless high interest rate policy which is pushing home ownership beyond the reach of many families and making it more difficult for those who are now receiving housing assistance to bridge the gap to housing self-sufficiency. In that respect there is no more corrosive an influence at work in the community today than this Government's ruthless, heartless, deliberate high terest rate policy, and no group in the community has been harder hit than Australian families and specifically those home owners paying mortgage rates in excess of 17 per cent and prospective families vainly searching to buy a home. The argument on housing affordability is raging in the community. We do not have to spend too much time on this point. Very many respected interest groups in the community have had their say. Honourable members can see the booklet I have in front of me entitled Australia's Declining Housing Affordability from the Real Estate Institute of Australia. A graph in that document shows Australia's declining housing affordability. They can see that the line on the graph goes straight upwards. The survey put out by the Mortgage Guarantee Insurance Corporation of Australia and the Real Estate Institute talks about home loan affordability in Australia. Honourable members will know that in the June quarter of 1989 home loan repayments as a ratio of family income went up from 28.4 per cent to 35.8 per cent. We do not need to go on about what this Government's ruthless, vicious, vindictive, high interest rates have done to home buyers and prospective home buyers in Australia. The housing and interest rate crisis is biting all over Australia. It is biting despite repeated assertions by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) and other Ministers that they will bring interest rates down. Listen to what the Prime Minister said in November 1984: We pledge ourselves to bring home ownership once again within the reach of ordinary Australian families. Mr Downer-What humbug.",126
234,Mr BEALE,NOES,"What an absolute lot of humbug. What an absolute disaster this Government has been for those in Australia who are attempting to buy their own houses, for those who have bought their own houses and now find that the interest payments are out of their reach, and for those who are finding it more difficult now that they are receiving housing assistance to bridge the gap to housing self-sufficiency. The Government's vicious and ruthless guillotine, which has been operating through in- this week, requires me, in order that my colleagues may have an opportunity to contribute to this discussion, to curtail my remarks at this stage. But let me once again say that, while not declining to give this Bill a second reading, we condemn this Government for its undue emphasis on public housing stock at the expense of assistance to the private rental market; its confrontationist approach in dealing with the States on this matter; and its deliberate and high interest rates policy, which is making housing a disaster for all Australians.",127
235,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,NOES,Mr Mountford)-Is the amendment seconded? Mr Downer-I second the amendment.,127
236,Mr OKEEFE ,NOES,"Burke) (11.29)-1 will start my contribution tonight in the same frame in which the honourable member for Deakin ( Mr Beale) commenced his remarks. He started by using the term 'bludger'. He has picked up this rhetoric from the high flying leader of the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr Elliott. We might talk a little about him later on in the· context of the word 'bludger', which has now made its way back into the Liberal rhetoric. The honourable member for Deakin is a high flier who came in here from the corporate sector at the same time as I did. It has been very interesting to watch his progress down the line on the front bench of a pretty mediocre Opposition. Now he is the last on the right of the front bench. He will fall off the end when the Opposition gets a few more to stack up the Right. Wait until we get the likes of MCLachlan, Costello and Kemp in here-all the hard line Rights who will push the honourable member off the end of the line.",127
237,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,NOES,Mr Andrew)Order! The Deputy Speaker tolerated some range of discussion from the honourable member for Deakin but the honourable member for Burke is now straying beyond what could be reasonably be called relevancy to the legislation before the Chair. I invite the honourable member for Burke to return to the legislation.,128
238,Mr OKEEFE,NOES,"I accept your point, Mr Deputy Speaker. Let us talk about interest rates because they have been focused on in this debate. Let us talk about the contribution of the honourable member for Deakin in that regard. One of the people who will obviously be influential in policy formation in this Party when the time comes, Mr MCLachlan, is on record when he was leading the National Farmers Federation-he put it to the country task force of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke )-as saying that the ceiling on home loan interest rates which this Government has held in place for the last six years, against the Opposition view, ought to be lifted so that the banks could charge home owners more, trading that off by giving farmers lower interest rates. No wonder the lackeys of the Party were signing up today protesting about interest rates. The position has been made clear by Mr McLachlan and it will be carried through in the Party. I am glad to see that the honourable member for Deakin has hung around as late as this tonight. I thought that he would be wanting to go down and do a bit of his research into sex on the waterfront which he has been so vocal about lately. Does he not have a date down at the docks or something? To come in here and go on with that drivel and trivia about this legislation is offensive to the House. The Bill deserves the support of the House because it takes the Commonwealth into a new 10-year housing agreement with the States and the Territories, including, for the first time, the Australian Capital Territory. A couple of the points that were well made by the Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples) in his second reading speech bear repeating. The Bill will represent the most significant reform of public housing since the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA) was first put together in 1945, with the principles that were overhauled and developed by the Hawke Labor Government in 1984 intact-to alleviate housing related poverty. Housing related poverty has never been an issue for the honourable member for Deakin. It has never been an issue for people on the other side of the House. Now we have the Opposition's tax policy. Mr Elliott talks about taking money off the bludgers. Here is another area for him: public housing funding. The honourable member for Deakin started his contribution by talking about bludgers, relating this very Bill to where the coalition will be going, taking money out of public housing to go back down the road of the million dollar land developers, the bottom of the harbour schemes and all that kind of thing that Opposition members not only supported and turned a blind eye to but that they now want to encourage all over again with their capital gains tax policy. That is the bottom line-take public money off the people who need it. As the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister have said, it is public theft. That is the basis of the policy. It will not stand up to scrutiny. Under this legislation for the first time over $1 billion will be made available in the annual grants. That level of funding will be retained for each of the three years from 1990 to 1993. That is a $4 billion guarantee. It is unprecedented. It is a commitment that the Hawke Labor Government makes to the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. Let us look at the effects of that commitment in some areas. Let us look at public rental accommodation, an area identified by members of the Government. I notice in the House tonight the chairman of the Government's social justice committee, the honourable member for Streeton ( Mr Lamb). He has been very adamant about the fact that there had to be more provision under our social justice strategy for public rental accommodation. Now, the bulk of Commonwealth and State matching grants will be used for the direct provision of public rental dwellings. We are expecting that during this period there will be 52,000 net additions to the public stock and that will provide afford- work. able rental public accommodation for over 650,000 people-an increase of 20 per cent on the effort of the past five years which, in itself, has been dramatic when compared with the efforts of the previous Liberal-National coalition. Let us look at the question of home ownership. A lot has been said about home ownership. There has been a lot of preaching by those opposite, whose very first action in field, in government, would be to lift the ceiling on home loans that is at present held in place by this Government. Mr Downer-When did we say that?",128
239,Mr OKEEFE,NOES,"When did those opposite say that? The honourable member should go and ask Mr MCLachlan. He will be running the show when he gets in here, mate, not you. That is his policy. You have consistently pressed that the Government lift this ceiling. You will not come out and honestly say it now. You will ride behind it, but it will be there, do not worry. Mr Downer-Where is the quote?",129
240,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,NOES,Mr Andrew)Order! I ask the honourable member for Mayo and the honourable member for Burke to address their remarks through the Chair.,129
241,Mr OKEEFE,NOES,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. Over the past five years, particularly in the lower and middle income areas, we have seen over 200,000 people assisted into home purchase agreements under the CSHA program. We have seen dramatic assistance given by the first home owners scheme. I cannot recall the figures exactly, but I think over 300,000 home owners have been assisted. I know that in my own electorate in the vicinity of $12m was allocated through the first home owners scheme. Nobody should forget the mess that the first home buyers assistance arrangements were in the day the Hawke Government took office. The arrangements between the various Liberal State governments and their Federal counterparts were in a such a state that I remember the Victorian Liberal leader at the time, Mr Kennett, coming up to Canberra and saying, 'For heavens sake, get this mess straightened out. We can never do anything'. Those opposite could not do that. It took the Hawke Labor Government to tie it up and make it I want to make a passing reference to the Victorian Government's equity share proposal that is now being developed by the Premier and the Minister for Housing and EmptyHere example of using funds wisely and targeting them to people who need help with their first home. The social justice strategy that I mentioned before that is accommodated unthis der this program has special provisions for people needing special kinds of accommodation, be they aged people, young people, or people with disabilities. In my own electorate, in places such as Bacchus Marsh, Kyneton and Woodend, I have had the very great pleasure of seeing programs for special housing come on stream through the initiatives under the CSHA, and especially through joint ventures with local government. Built into the legislation is also a specific provision for programs for young homeless people. I will not spend time on this now, other than to say that, although the Burdekin report was handed down not very long ago, this legislation makes a response which is matched with the dollars that make things happen. A Liberal pigeonholing government thought the best way to get something off the agenda was to send some committee out, get a report, stick the report in the pigeonhole and do nothing about it for years-like the bottom of the harbour stuff that sat in the Perth Crown Solicitor's bottom drawer. The Liberals did nothing about it-they are pigeonholers. With the Burdekin report came money and action. That is the name of the game. I remember that in the formulation of the last Budget there was a lot of discussion within the Government about the issue of mortgage relief. I am personally very pleased to see $14.7m appropriated in this legislation to provide special mortgage and rent relief through joint ventures with the States. Again, that is an initiative which also demonstrates responsiveness to the needs out in the community. Let me refer to some events that occurred today in the House. The Prime Minister, in his speech following Question Time, spoke of the major differences between the philosophies of the Opposition and the Government and made special reference to education. Let me say that there is a major difference, too, regarding a roof over people's heads. The first home owners scheme, the cleaning up of the mess left to us by the Liberals, is a classic case. Our commitment to public housing has never been matched. In fact, the Opposition's commitment to public housing is so substantial that it cannot even find an Opposition shadow spokesman who can hang in the job for any more than a few months; The Opposition has now had four shadow spokesmen, if I remember corconditioned rectly. I- it such a hot potato to go out there and adually explain that the Opposition has not got a policy and an approach that one can even hack the job? There have been four people in the task. The Opposition should see whether it can at least get gether some policies and an approach that means something. Public housing was miserOpposition's ably run down. It has received tial boosts over the time of this Government. I am aware of the time, and I just want to finish with one brief point. I commend the Minister for Housing and Aged Care, the honourable member for Jagajaga ( Mr ples), for his approach. I mention a particupeople lar event that took place in my electorate four or five months ago when, along with the Housing Industry Association, we sponthis sored a housing seminar. We brought people from throughout the industry, from local government and from planning to a special function to discuss some of these issues. Bearing in mind that the Commonwealth was carrying out a review of the agreement, and before the Minister made his mind up on which direction he would go, he was prepared to go down and talk to the buildremains ers, the tenants and the people who are at the coal face, with the result that they feel that they have been listened to. They can who need them. see the suggestions they were making and the priorities they were putting forward repgone resented in this legislation. I can go back those people and say, 'Here is continuing evidence of the fact that the Minister was prepared to go and listen, talk and take the constructive suggestions back and have reflected in the legislation'. I am very pleased that that has taken place. Finally, let me say that another aspect of this debate concerning the housing industhe try-a very significant feather in the cap the Hawke Labor Government as compared to the performance of the Opposition when it was in government-is the health and viability of the building industry. Many of my friends are in the industry. They had become conditioned to the boom-bust psychology: the fact that the business might be around for a couple of years, but there was no point taking on an apprentice because there was going to be a downturn and they would have to put them off. So the whole industry was to the Opposition's boom-bust strategy; the fact that the Opposition let it go and then pulled it off. In 1982, if I recall nocorrectly, we were down to a miserable 95,000 starts for an industry that is placed for 130,000 to 140,000 starts. The industry towas in a recession, and unemployment and training suffered in that industry through the boom-bust mentality and manvery substanagement approach. The Hawke Labor Government since then, via a managed growth strategy in the building industry, has shaved the peaks and troughs off. We have seen an industry that Stahas moved forward. We are now seeing in training and with a future in the building industry. When the point was reached-and all of us understand this, on side of the House anyway-that interest rates had to be used to slow the economy down, and we have had to slow down particularly the private home market, the first thing that happened was that, via the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, the Government made the shift for an increased priority for public sector housing. That means that the building industry itself strong and viable in the place it counts-in the local community, building the things that matter; that is, houses for people Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise if I have a bit longer than I should have. It has to been my pleasure to enter this debate tonight. I feel that the Hawke Labor GovC(rnment and Minister Staples have a very proud story to tell in relation to their housing polthem icy and the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. I am fully in support of the legislation.",129
242,Mr DOWNER ,NOES,"Mayo) (11.46)-1 hope people of the electorate of Burke were of listening to the speech made by their representative tonight. I do not think I have ever heard anybody take ,so long to say so little, and there was so much inaccuracy in the little that the, honourable member, for Burke ( Mr O'Keefe) did say. For example, he made an utterly dishonest attempt to claim that we on this side of the House would abolish the pre-April 1986 13t per cent interest rate ceiling. That is the absolute basest hypocrisy that I have ever come across. Not only have we at no point said that we would do that but also it was the Australian Labor Party that abolished the 13t per cent ceiling for post-April 1986 loans, not us. It is those people over there who did it. They are the people who abolished the ceiling; the Fraser Government did not abolish the ceiling. So that sort of hypocrisy is the basest kind of politics, and I hope the people of Burke heard it. The honourable member also mentioned some nonsense about boom and bust. He does not talk to the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), I suppose, or the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke). Of course not; they do not have time to talk to people like the honourable member for Burke. Probably his constituents do not have time, either. Why does he not talk to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister? He does not talk to them because they want to achieve a bust. That is what they are telling us the whole time. Guess why they are putting interest rates up so high. Some people know the answer, and the answer is to dampen down the economy, to head the building industry into a bust. That is the policy. That is what they say at the dispatch box every day, but the honourable member for Burke is comatose during QuestionTime. The Housing Assistance Bill is not about the honourable member for Burke who, although he was allocated 10 minutes, took 18 minutes to make his two points; it is about the Labor Government providing $4 billion for a public housing program over four years, including $1.028 billion in 1989-90, and boosting public housing by 52,000 homes over the next five years. I appreciate that members of the Government think there is something pretty good about that. I want to make three basic points in the nine minutes left me tonight. EmptyHere",130
243,Mr DOWNER,NOES,"It is probably not enough, but I will make those three basic points. First, as the honourable member for Deakin ( Mr Beale) pointed out, the housing policy of the Labor Party is really one of the last vestiges of socialism left in Australia. We have seen the Berlin Wall crumble and people giving up on socialism in Eastern Europe, but here we have the old Labor way-public housing, more public housing and still more public housing. No matter that public housing waiting lists get longer and longer under the Labor Government-the solution is to keep building more public housing and reject any alternative. Apparently every alternative is wrong. Rental assistance? A little bit of that, but basically the Government wants public housing. Assistance for people to purchase their homes? A little bit of that but we all know that is for electoral reasons. Basically, no, the' big thing Labor wants is public housing; government going out and building housing for people. That is what the Labor Party has always been about. It is the last gasp of socialism-basically, nationalised housing. There are perfectly good examples in South Australia of what Labor has been d.oing. The people can go to the polls in a couple of days ·and make their judgment about some of these things. Under this legislation the Government will provide this year $82m for public housing in South Australia. Guess what the Government has also done at the same time? It is providing funding for public housing but in the same financial year it has decimated the first home owners scheme. Nationally it has knocked $85m off the first home owners scheme. Those young people who want to go out and buy a home with the highest interest rates in the Western world-the highest rates Australia has ever seen-are having $85m worth of assistance knocked off them so that the Government can put some more money into nationalised housing. That is pretty smart, I suppose. In South Australia the Government has reduced funding for people to buy their own homes by 32 per cent this year. Is that something that the Government is proud of? Is that something that the Labor Party feels to pretty good about? We see all this breast beating about its marvellous housing policy. It knocked 32 per cent off housing assistance programs in one year. How much has it knocked off the first home owners scheme in South Australia since 1983? In real terms it has knocked off 73 per cent. We see little Johnny Bannon, the politically dying Premier of South Australia, running around suddenly in the middle of an election campaign. He has put his hand in his pocket and pulled out $50m. He says, 'Guess what this is'-he has been in power for about a decade-'this is money for home purchase programs'. He farms out the money. That is fair enough but at the same time the people here in Canberra are chopping it all off. The Government thinks it is a bad thing. He thinks it is a good thing. The Government wants to nationalise more and more housing. It is just an intellectual nonsense. The Government has been caught out by its own pork-barrelling contradictory ideology and it has ended up with a nonsense. That is the first point I wanted to make. The second point I want to make is the point that the honourable member for Deakin ( Mr Beale) made when he said that all these things are happening at the time of the worse home affordability since records have been kept. If we look at the Housing Industry Association's home affordability statistics we find that since December 1984 in the State of South Australia-it is going to the polls on Saturday; I will be voting and I will be voting Liberal-there has been a 14.2 per cent decline in home affordability. Instead of futile interjections, members of the Government should think about this. Is this a good thing? Is this a record to be proud of? Is it smart to have a 14.2 per cent decline in home affordability? Do members of the Government go back to their electorates and think that that is pretty swell, that they have done a great thing for the people of South Australia? What a miserable record. Monthly repayments over that period for the average home buyer have gone up from $538 to $1,026. I know that the Government is not interested in statistics but that is a 91 per cent increase in monthly repayments. In that period incomes hav- gone up by 43 per cent. That is less than 91 per cent. That is what the Government has done to the capacity of ordinary people in South Australia to buy their own homes. What a miserable record. It is the old Labor way of doing things. Every time there is a Labor government it declares war on home ownership. There is more and more nationalised housing with more people going into socialist housing. The Government looks after them but if people want to buy their own home the Government gets the tanks out and drives over their hopes for the future. That is the old Labor way. It always does it. The Whitlam Government did it. The members of this Government are doing it. All the previous Labor governments did it. Chifley was a great fan of public housing, as was Scullin. This is not the time for a history lesson, but Labor governments always do it. This Government changes its rhetoric because it reads opinion polls. We know what its opinion polls say. Behind it all is the same ideological commitment to put everybody into public housing and smash private property rights-that is, capitalism. Labor does not really like that. The world has given up on its sort of ideology. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples), who is not here-presumably he has gone out to the chemist tonight to get a prescription-is one of the real ideologues of the Labor Party. In fact, we always have an ideologue in the housing portfolio. Finally, in the last couple of minutes left for me to speak, I· make one very positive remark about the way in which I think housing assistance could be changed. What the honourable member for Deakin said is absolutely right. One of the things we have to look at is the viability and the effectiveness of housing allowances so that we pay a housing allowance to assist low income earners to make a choice about the sort of housing they wish to go into. Government members say that they all have to go into nationalised housing. I say that we should give them a housing allowance and they can make one of three choices on how to spend that housing assistance from the Commonwealth Government. They may choose to use it to purchase a home. That is anathema to those opposite but something we think is pretty important. We would give them that choice with a housing allowance. Secondly, if they are stuck in the private rental market, where there is the greatest incidence of housing related poverty in Australia, they could get the housing allowance for support in that market. Finally, if they choose to go into socialised housing, public housing, that is their choice; they are entitled to that choice and they could use that housing allowance to pay the local State housing authority. That is pretty equitable. ' Those opposite sometimes pretend that they care about equity. That proposal is equitable because it means that whether one purchases a home, goes into rental accommodation or goes into public housing, one gets the same level of assistance. I cannot understand, for the life of me, why those opposite think it is fair to give to people in public housing more assistance than the 80,000 people on low incomes on the public housing waiting lists and having to rent in the private rental market. Why do those opposite give people in public housing more assistance than those in the private rental market? Why is that fair? Of course, that is not fair. Mr Kerr interjecting-MONICA",131
244,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,NOES,"Mr Andrew)Order! The Chair has put up with persistent interjections from the honourable member for Denison. If he wishes to participate in the debate, he should resume his seat and await the call.",133
245,Mr DOWNER,NOES,"Presumably the honourable member for Denison has no interest in the issue of equity. It does not matter to him. It is the old Labor way. It does not matter how inequitable something is as long as, behind the facade of reasonableness, those opposite pursue their ideological goals. It is all very funny to the honourable member for Denison that people are suffering in the mortgage belt. It is all a big laugh for him and does not really matter. He believes we are all in Parliament just to have a jolly good time, I suppose, and not to take any of these issues seriously. Those opposite can say what they like aboll;t Michael Hodgman; he would bulldoze the likes of the honourable member.",133
246,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order!,133
247,Mr DOWNER,NOES,"This is very relevant to the debate, Deputy Speaker. He would bulldoze the honourable member. I will not repeat the mistake made by the honourable member for Burke. I know there are others who want to speak in this debate. My time is certainly running out. The Government is heading in the wrong direction with housing and I have been able to demonstrate very successfully how it is heading in the wrong direction. Its boasts about its housing record are empty boasts. Anybody who has been door-knocking or to community functions in Australia knows that the community thinks that the Government's boasts are very empty boasts. Government members would not dare to go to a mortgage action rally in Adelaide or anywhere and make those sorts of empty boasts because people know that they are false. People know only too well that the Government has failed and they will throw it out. One of the main reasons that they will throw the Government out is that its housing policies have been a monstrosity.",133
248,Mr LAMB ,NOES,"Streeton) (11.59)-One would think, from all the hype offered by the honourable member for Mayo ( Mr Downer), that there was an election in South Australia on Saturday! But, when listening to any speaker in this House, one must assess whether that speaker has any credibility. There have been two speakers from the Opposition. The first speaker, the honourable member for Deakin ( Mr Beale), is a multimillionaire and his relationship with anyone in need of public housing would escape any listener to his speech. The second speaker from the Opposition was the honourable member for Mayo, who would have very little in common with those who either require by choice or need public housing. That is because as a child he boasted a full houseMr Downer-A house?",133
249,Mr LAMB,NOES,"Yes, he boasted a housethe sort that others try to get into-purely as a plaything; a doll's house. On that gentleman's large property in Adelaide he was able to boast-Mr Downer- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise . a point of order. Some honourable members have a fascination with the accommodation that I grew up in. I do not know why. I submit that it is not relevant to the Bill.",133
250,Mr LAMB,NOES,We are talking about credibility. If someone can come out with the hype-MONICA,133
251,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,NOES,Mr Andrew)Order! If the honourable member for Streeton will resume his seat the Chair will rule on the point of order and call the honourable member for Streeton.,134
252,Mr LAMB,NOES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sorry but I thought that you had given me the call.",134
253,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,There is no point of order. I call the honourable member for Streeton.,134
254,Mr LAMB,NOES,"You are quite right, Mr Deputy Speaker: there is no point of order, because the honourable member for Mayo himself boasted that he had a full villa as a doll's house. He said that in one of his first speeches when he became a member of this House. Let us compare that with the honesty of the honourable member for Burke ( Mr O'Keefe) and with my background. In earlier years I was in private rental housing and later, for many years, i was in a Housing Commission house before being able to have access to privately owned housing. I will put that sort of credibility arid background those of honourable gentlemen opposite anytime. The Housing Assistance Bill ushers in a new 1O-yearhousing .agreement with the States. It puts into place this Government's social justice policy towards housing-that is, to bring together the economic policy and the social policy, providing shelter for people, under one sustainable policy that recognises the principles of access to housing and equity of treatment towards housing. The Bill initiates a four-year program Qutlaying some $4 billion over a range of programs to house people. It recognises the importance of a public and a .private sector in providing houses. The honourable member for Burke clearly enunciated the need for there to be a sustainable housing industry, with all the employment and other attendant economic matters, through a combination of public and private housing. We recognise that many people cannot afford or do not choose to have their own houses, particularly those on low incomes and beneficiaries of government pensions. What we recognise is a basic requirement of all people to have shelter. We do not turn our back. on those 30 per cent of people who do not go for privately owned homes. Despite the vicissitudes of our economic situation and with interest rates as they are, we still see a constant level of between 70 and 72 per cent of private home ownership in Australia.. We recognise the needs of the other 30 per cent. We do not turn our back on those people. We have policies which will cater for them. Let us look at the Government's record in the area of public housing delivered largely through the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement which is our major housing program. Over the last five years we have expended a record $3,400m. We can compare that with the $1 ,600mexpended by the Fraser Government in its last five years in office-that is, the Government which the honourable member for Mayo extolled so greatly tonight. If one works it out, one finds that it is an increase of some 52 per cent in real terms. At the end of June 1983, 245,000 people were in public housing. We saw that figure increase to 316,000 five years later. The number of people who required public housing and were successfully housed in it against increased by 30 per cent. Five per cent of Australian householders are in public housing-the non-privately owned housing sector. Seventy per cent of people in public housing are on pensions or benefits-that is, over a quarter of all pensioners and beneficiaries who rent are capable of being housed in public housing. One in four families with children who rent are in public housing. That is hardly an insignificant sector for those who require shelter. In the last five years, that was the proud record of the Government. Let us see what the Bill provides for the next four years. We will continue that basic principle of social justice-accessible, welltargeted housing·for those· in need. Through that, we will alleviate the housing-related poverty which exists. We will deliver assistance equitably to people resident in different forms of housing, not just standard module housing. There will be a range of housing assistance to accommodate the various heeds and tastes of people in the public sector. We believe there should be an even greater focus on those most in need-the low income earners and social security recipients for whom home ownership is not even a dream. We will see that 200,000 low and middle income earners will receive home purchase loans over the next five years. We will boost the affordcan ability of home ownership through the scheme for low and middle income earners. Honourable members opposite talk about affordability of home ownership and it is quite right to talk about it, but they lauded the benefits of a deregulated economy but did not have the guts to bring in deregulainto tion. They left it to this Government to have the courage to introduce it. The conventional factor. wisdom amongst those in commerce and academia is for a deregulated· economy. They recognise that this requires a different tude and a different level of interest rates bring about the same effect on demand that occurred previously. It used to be the case that when governments. wanted to restrict demand they put a curb on credit. We a credit restriction situation which mean we either got a loan or we did not. Even we' had the money to buy a house, if we could not get a loan because of the governcountering ment's prescription of the day, we had to without. We now see a completely different situaincreased tion. The bankers who used to extend credit are now credit salesmen; in other words, there is as much credit as we like. The place is awash with credit, as long as we can afford it. Unfortunately, the change to deregulation means that, in the transition period between the non-deregulated economy and when it settles down, we will see higher interest rates than normal in order to achieve the same prior restriction on demand. Affordability, however, is not dependent only on interest rates. If we compare the price of a housing and land package with interest rates, we see that the cost will dictate the size of loan and therefore the amount required for House. repayment. People can take a one or two percentage point temporary increase in interest rates, but if there is a huge jump in the price of housing, as we have seen in Sydney and Melbourne, the result will be for lower house affordability. When we look at the reasons behind the increase in the price of houses, we see that the forces at work are the very things which Opposition members strongly support. They say that they support deregulation, negative gearing and the removal of the capital gains tax on what they term speculation, but what we know is a form of capital growth, so they avoid taxation. Their position with respect to the capital gains issue is part of their new package. All those sorts of reasons are pushing up the price of the land-home package and putting it out of reach of ordinary people. Therefore, if we are to talk about house affordability, we should take account the size of the package and the level of interest, although that is a smaller The last matter to which I refer is whether people can service a loan. Under the LiberalattiNational Party Government, 10.2 per cent to of the work force were unable to service a loan because they were out of work. People without jobs cannot pay their loans. We have reduced unemployment to 6 per cent and we had know that everybody who has a job will that keep it under this Government and will be if able to service a loan. These people also know that the Opposition's only method of inflation, the foreign debt probgo lem or balance of payments trade problems is to bring about a recession, which means unemployment. If the Opposition ever gets into office we will see people lose their houses by the thousands. They would be unable to meet even the smallest repayments because they would not have the basic income that comes from a job. There is the choice. It is not a matter of a temporary change of one, two, three or four percentage points in the home mortgage interest rate. It is these other factors which would be exacerbated under a government led by the Opposition parties. I reject the comments made by the honourable member will for Mayo and the honourable member for the Deakin, and I support the Bill before the Thursday, 23 November 1989",134
255,Ms MCHUGH ,NOES,"Phillip) (12.10 a.m.)-I am glad to support the Housing Assistance Bill, which authorises the Federal Government to enter into a new 10-year housing agreement with the States and Territories. The Housing Assistance Bill 1989 embodies the most significant reform of public housing funding since the introduction of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA) in 1945. What pleases me is that the debate on this Bill, besides giving Government members the opportunity to speak in support of the major social reforms contained in it, exposes the Opposition's philosophy on housing to the scrutiny of the public. It also gives me the opportunity to comment on an example of coalition housing policy in action, that is, the housing policy of the Greiner Government in New South Wales. By the way, that is the only coalition government in Australia at the moment. The New South Wales Minister for Housing, Mr Joe Schipp, has presided over a substantial downgrading of the commitment of his Government to the provision of an equitable public housirig system. The Liberal Party in action is destroying public housing, just as tonight it has tried to destroy the concept of public housing. Opposition members speak of it as nationalised housing. I suppose it is part of their view of what they like to call welfare housing, in the same way that they like to talk about welfare child care. They will be talking one day about welfare education. It is something that governments are forced to provide for a class of people who are not equal with the rest of society. That seems to be the Opposition's concept of public housing whereas, of course, public housing is in demand as a right by the people of Australia. As I said, the Government in New South Wales is presiding over a substantial downgrading of public housing. It has also been attacking private tenants. The private rental housing market is being squeezed harder than ever before in New South Wales and the Greiner Government has made things substantially worse. The failure of the private rental market, with uncontrolled rents, and the subsequent increase in the levels of housing-related poverty are the main reasons why we need a boost in public housing stock, and this Bill will provide that boost through the new CSHA. But back to New South Wales: in only 20 months the New South Wales Government has sold off public housing and land to private developers, including many sites in the inner city of Sydney earmarked for quality public housing by the previous State Labor Government. The incidence of housing-related poverty is severe in these areas. It is absolutely disgraceful for the Greiner Government to sell this land when it could have been used for housing. The Government has closed nine Department of Housing rental offices, with plans to close a further 20. This has forced pensioners to travel many kilometres from their lodgings to pay the fortnightly rents. A public housing tenant from Woolloomooloo in Sydney was quoted on 12 November in the Sun-Herald as saying that she waited for more than 1t hours just to pay the rent. She continued: It cost me $3 to get to the office and took out half my day to pay the rent. I saw an old man on crutches in the queue and he was shaking. The rent office closure has made his life just that bit harder. That is the real life outcome of Liberal Party housing policy in action. The people the Liberal Party thinks· should be in public housing are in a separate class from anyone else and are without equal rights. The New South Wales Government has substantially increased rents for public housing and the Public Tenants Advisory Services, so popular and so much in demand, have been effectively abolished because they have been defunded. These and other decisions have represented an unprecedented attack on public housing in New South Wales. Of course, as has been stated clearly again and again tonight, it is on the agenda of the Liberal Party to downgrade public housing to a second rate form of housing. The fact that a very large proportion of the community, that is, low income earners, are unable to purchase their own home means that they are forced to compete in the private rental market-a market which is driven by the need of property owners to generate profits from their property. Of course, there is no need to have a profit motive in public housing. The New South Wales Liberal Party policy sought to redirect emphasis away from increasing the public housing stock for rental, towards home ownership assistance. As the Minister for Housing and Aged Care ( Mr Staples) said in his second reading speech, the substantial public housing commitment embodied in this Bill will allow a greater focus on those in greatest housing needvery low income earners and social security recipients, for whom home ownership is not an option. This Bill therefore emphasises the need substantially to increase public housing stock. The Opposition has discussed housing allowances. The previous Opposition speaker, the honourable member for Mayo ( Mr Downer), spent some time talking about housing allowances. The Opposition discusses this rather than the issue of the actual provision of housing stock. I say to the previous speaker-he is no longer in the House, but I will make sure he hears about this-that the Government's national housing policy review, which developed the policy framework we are discussing, looked at and compared the cost-benefits of housing allowances as against the provision of public housing. The report, entitled Housing Allowances in the Australian Context, was prepared by Econsult (Aust) Pty Ltd last year. It concluded that, in terms of cost effectiveness in ing poverty relief, public housing emerges as the lowest cost, long-term strategy. By committing resources to the actual building of public housing, as opposed to the Opposition's idea of housing allowances, the result 15 years down the track is very clear. The report gives a comparison of accommodation yield. It states that, by the year 2008, 79,800 households would be assisted by way of housing allowances, while 123,400 households would be assisted by way of public housing. It states that by the year 2018, the allowances proposed by the Opposition would assist 63,700 households, while public housing, which we are talking about and providing, would assist 186,800 households. So much for the argument that housing allowances are preferable. The Government would be in a vastly superior position in terms of ongoing generation of low income housing opportunities if we proceed as we intend to proceed. The new CSHA takes this long-term view, just as our retirement incomes policy takes a long term view rather than attempting a shortterm quick fix. If there were any attempt at a short-term quick fix on interest rates, we would have heard about it from the Opposition, but it does not have one. In the major changes that this new CSHA seeks to implement, all funding from the Commonwealth will be in the form of grants rather than a mix of grants and loans. This will reduce the long-term debt servicing and interest payments of the State and at least half of any required matching funds from the States will be grants rather than the more expensive loans, as is the case at present. The shadow Minister, the honourable member for Deakin ( Mr Beale), talked about confrontation with the States. The Opposition's amendment refers to the Government's confrontationist approach to the States. This CSHA is all about negotiations with the States-negotiations which are resulting in a real partnership on this issue. I cannot understand what the Opposition is talking about when it refers to a confrontationist approach. Would it prefer us to continue to provide the real money but in the form of a blank cheque? This is an agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. Of course, it means negotiation and partnership. There provid- is not a confrontationist situation. This Bill also gives a substantial boost to funding to tied programs for special needs groups like Aboriginals, the aged and youth; and they are certainly groups that could well be forgotten were it not for this agreement. As a result of the new CSHA, around 650,000 people-360,000 adults and 290,000 children-will be offered public rental housing. Around 20,000 home loans for tow and moderate income earners will be provided and an estimated 52,000 extra additions to the public rental stock will be achieved. I remember the delight with which this new agreement was received by members of this Government and the pride in achievement that something so worthwhile had been presented to the States, negotiated and agreed to. I not only commend the Bill to the House but congratulate and thank the Minister involved.",135
256,Mr STAPLES ,NOES,"Jagajaga-Minister for Housing and Aged Care) (12.21 a.m.)-In summing up, I would like to thank all honourable members who have contributed to this debate on the Housing Assistance Bill-in particular, the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh), who has just finished one of her usual eloquent speeches full of truth and fact. I also thank the honourable member for Burke ( Mr O'Keefe) and ,the honourable member for Streeton ( Mr ""'Lamb) for their obviously very strong commitment to housing. As the honourable member for Burke indicated, I had the pleasure to be in his electorate a short while ago to talk to probably well over 100 people involved in housing, building and real estate, including developers and consumers. That was very useful for me, and I hope it was useful for the community. Just the other day I had the opportunity to be a guest in the electorate of the honourable member for Streeton, Again that was a very useful event. I talked to many builders and people involved in finance in his electorate. I congratulate both those honourable members for their attention to their electorates and particularly to the issue of housing. I would also like to congratulate the honourable member for Deakin ( Mr Beale) on his speech. It was obviously his first contribution as the latest shadow Minister for housing. I was quite happy with his speech. In fact, I think I will circulate it to as many industry bodies and consumer groups as I can find. I am only disappointed that I cannot have it on video, which would be much more interesting. Certainly I would be able to use his speech very positively to show what a stark contrast there is between the Government's comprehensive strategy and policy in housing and those of the Opposition after all this time. I think the honourable member for Burke mentioned four shaciow Ministers. I think that was the only incorrect part of his speech-there have been a lot more than four. Some of them have actually been recycled. I will not say too, much about the contribution of the honourable member for Mayo ( Mr Downer). He spoke a lot about ideologues and things like that. When he talks about housing allowances and. so on, we see the real ideology coming through. As the honourable member for Phillip again quite capably showed in reference to the document that she was using, the concept of the housing allowance-other words were used by the honourable member for Deakin to describe it-has been demonstrated quite fully to be not as good as investing capital in the development of public housing stock as a cost efficient way of providing houses for the community with the taxpayers' dollar. I think that the reality of clear in the fact that there is not a major housing industry group in this country that would support housing allowances, because they know what the real risks are in terms of cost effectiveness to the community and the taxpayer and that they are of very little real value to their industry. oJ. think that one of the greatest successes of the Hawke Government is the fact that it has been able to keep the housing industry going along very strongly, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would know, compared with the ups and downs that it faced from very low levels back in what are sometimes referred to as the good old days. The Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement is the result of a major renegotiation of Commonwealth-State programs. Sometimes it has been difficult, but the issues we are dealing with are extremely difficult, both in the structure of the agreement, and in what the Commonwealth and the States and Territories want to achieve. We have seen quite a dramatic realignment of the involvement of the Commonwealth in housing policy and a real partnership with the States and .the Territories. I want to put on record my appreciation of those officers in my Department, the officers in the State and Territory departments and the various Ministers of all political persuasions who have come together to develop this new agreement. It is a credit to our federal system that despite a lot of quite drastic changes, we have been able to achieve that. On top of that, $1,OOOm has been guaranteed-it is more than $1,OOOm this yearfor the next three years. When we consider the insecurities of the past and the vagaries of the Loan Council and the mixtures there, and the fact that we are now talking about 100 per cent grants instead of a mixture of loans and grants, we see the real value of those new 1989 Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement dollars compared to the much reduced overall building value of those 1984 agreement dollars. That comes through in the real structure of the agreement. We now have a viable agreement through which we will be building houses instead of debt. We will be building more and more stock because we are not building. into the system the debt that was accumulating under the that is also quite old arrangements. It has been said by those opposite from time to time and by those who do not understand the new structure of the agreement, which is a vital part of it, that it is antihome ownership. The reality is that for virtually no more dollars but by using the new financial systems much more efficiently than we ever have before, we are able to move from about 68,000 home loans over the last five years to 200,000 loans under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement in the next five years. That is a tremendous difference. That has been done by using the new financial arrangements and without loading up the system with debt. We have been using different projects that are operated by the State governments under their home loan and home ownership programs for those on low incomes. That is the real chance for home ownership for people who would not otherwise have a chance. Well over 130,000 extra Australian families over the next five years will have access to home ownership in a way they have never had before and they will have the security that goes with it. The reality of this agreement and the way it fits in with the Government's housing policy is that it covers all areas-home ownership, public housing, the development of public rental stock, and the development of private rental stock. The honourable member for Deakin spoke about the 'undue expansion of public rental housing stock at the expense of private rental construction'. We can make a number of excuses for the honourable member. He has not been long in the job, but I would be quite happy for the officers of my Department to take him through a few of the changes that are going on. If he looks at the Budget and at the agreement, including the private rental side of this issue, he will see that the Government is committing $65m over the next five years in rental property trusts. This will mean the expansion of 35,000 units for private rental stock for people on low incomes, or for low rents. That is a tremendous boost to an area of housing stock development in Australia that has suffered greatly over the last few years in a variety of ways. As our community changes and as our cities change, things like strata titling have reduced the level of stock. One of the important aspects of this Bill that has been totally missed by those opposite is that in the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement we are not just talking about bricks and mortar and all the rest of it. We are starting to talk now about how we can better integrate and plan the development of stock to suit the needs of the community. One of the groups in the community that suffers most, particularly in regard to private rental accommodation where high proportions of income go on rent, is the elderly, paiticularly the frail elderly. What we have been able to achieve, particularly by going from loans to grants, is an increase in the amount of money that can now go to the pensioner housing program and to housing for the disabled. These are the areas where we can assist those frail, elderly people who spend 60 and 70 per cent of their incomes on rent. They can get into public rental accommodation that is basically design built for them and their needs. That is what gives people quality of life. We can start to work with the State governments to better plan our priorities, whether they be for old people, young singles, people with disabilities or whatever. We will be able to make better use of the stock we have. We can start to develop that stock in a way that suits the real needs of, the population, particularly those who are most in need. There are many other elements of the new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement which in the months and years ahead will become evident in the shape of our cities. Apart from the fact that 650,000 Australians will be offered affordable public rental housing under this new agreement, over the next five years, as I said before, over 200,000 low cost loans will be approved for people to get access to home ownership. We are seeing the whole arrangement centre on the more efficient use of money, using the new financial structures far more imaginatively and putting the emphasis back where it belongs, giving people security and an affordable roof over their heads-something that so many people have not had before. There is always a temptation for any government to think in three-year cycles, concentrating on short-term targets and quick fix solutions. But often these quick fix solutions have hidden costs that only become apparent after several years. Many of our major cities are surrounded by huge estates opened up rapidly and cheaply with little or no thought given to what people who live there would actually do for a living, how they would get to work, how they would get access to services and so on. I am sure that many people have been housed quickly, but the community is still picking up the tab for many of the problems that arise. One of the benefits of the new agreement is that the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments will now be able to work together in a cooperative way to develop housing with services. That is what the futureis all about. We have to learn to make better use of our housing stock than we have in the past and give people the opportunity to live better lives as a result.

258,Mr KEATING ,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN MINT,"The answer to the honourable member's qu-tion is as follows:' (I) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that there are certain organisations which, under the gift provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, are able to pass on funds in the form of grants to other organisations. These organisations are known as ""umbrella organisations"", one of which is the Australian Conservation Foundation. The Commissioner said that, where an umbrella organisation is used in fund-raising activities, his office has consistently applied two conditions: (i) although the donor may express a preference as to how the donation is to be used, the umbrella organisation must have a completely unfettered discretion as to how it uses the donation; and (ii) any organisation to which money is passed by the umbrella organisation must have objects which conform with the objects of the umbrella organisation. Based on the Commissioner's advice I do not consider it necessary at this stage to amend the income tax law. However, as I advised you in answer to your earlier question, the Commissioner is monitoring the matter to ensure that the law is being complied with. (2) The available income tax statistics do not identify separately deductions for donations to the Australian Conservation Foundation. However, based on details contained in the published accounts bf the Australian Conservation Foundation the revenue forgone for the last three financial years is estimated as follows: Cost to . Financial yeiu Revenue $000 1986-87 . 280 1987-88 . 390 1988-89 . 400 Qantas Airways Ltd: Directors (Question No. 2032) Mr Macpbee asked the Minister for Transport and Communications, upon notice, on 31 August 1989: (I) What is the procedure for making appointments to the Board of Qantas and does he initiate action to make the appointments. (2) What qualifications are considered necessary for appointment as a director of Qantas. (3) What are the (a) remuneration and (b) travel entitlements of Qantas directors. (4) What is the (a) name (b) age (c) date of appointment (d) date of expiry of appointment and (e) value of company paid travel incurred in the last 12 months for each director of Qantas.",142
259,Mr WILLIS ,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN MINT,"The answer to· the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Directors of Qantas are appointed by the Minister for Transport and Communications in accordance with Article 86 of Qantas' Articles of Association, which states that the Minister shall have the. sole right to appoint the directors of the Company. (2) Qantas directors are appointed because of a wide range of skills which they can bring to bear in guiding the affairs of the Company. These skills cover managerial, financial and organisational aspects and represent a number of different backgrounds all of which are relevant to the running of a modern airline. (3) (a) Remuneration is set by the Remuneration Tribunal and the annual amounts paid to directors are as follows: Chairman Vice Chairman Directors The Board declined the increase provided by the Tribunal's November 1988 Determination and conName J B Leslie AO MC . . . . . . . J N Davenport AO DSO DFC· GM Sir Tristan Antico AC J P Ducker AO R Gietzelt AO . W Bolitho AM S Same AM . . J W Utz AO J R Broadbent . S Crean . . . J B Horgan . . (4) (e) This information is confidential to Qantas. However I can disclose that in 1988/89 the total amount incurred by directors travelling on Company business was $57,508. Approximately 70% of that expenditure was incurred by those directors not resident in NSW, travelling to and from the Company's Head Office in Sydney. Jindalee Radar System (Question No. 2063) Mr Blunt asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 3 October 1989: (I) What is (a) the projected life span of the Jindalee radar system and (b) the estimated cost of its construction and maintenance over that time. (2) Has any decision been made on the siting of the Jindalee radar system; if not, when is a decision expected. (3) If a decision has been made, is it intended to site the system near Longreach, Qld. (4) Has an environmental impact statement been prepared on the possible siting of the system at Longreach; if not, why not. (5) If the system is to be sited near Longreach, (a) when will construction (i) begin and (ii) be completed, (b) which properties will be affected, (c) what compensation will be paid to the affected property owners and (d) what are the implications of the siting for the ""Macsland"" property belonging to Mr D. A. Scarr. (6) Has his Department received requests from Mr Scarr and other property owners in the Longreach area for information on the possible siting of the Jindalee radar system there and the potential effect on their properties; if so, has the information sequently the above levels are those set by the previous determination. (3) (b) Under the policy agreed by the Board, $34,731 directors are entitled to one trip per annum at a reduced rate. Director's travel expenses are also paid $26,062 to and from Board meetings and for other approved $17,363 business purposes, but this travel does not involve any additional entitlement. (4) (a) to (d) Details of the present Board are as follows: Date of Expiry of Age appointment appointment 66 15.10.79 14.10.89 68 01.05.81 30.04.90 65 15.10.79 14.10.89 55 26.08.83 28.08.93 66 01.07.84 30.06.91 57 03.01.86 02.01.91 69 03.01.86 02.01.91 60 01.05.86 30.04.91 40 15.09.87 14.09.92 40 15.09.87 14.09.92 48 15.09.87 14.09.92 been provided or will it be provided in the near future. (7) If such requests have been received and the information has not been or will not be provided, why not.",142
260,Mr BEAZLEY ,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN MINT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) Approximately 20 years. (b) Definitive costs cannot be indicated at this time because tenders are currently being evaluated. However, an estimated capital cost of $600m has been assumed for planning purposes for the system. (2) The Jindalee Radar System will eventually comprise 3 radars sited in northeastern Queensland, mid-western Western Australia and central Australia. Specific site decisions have not yet been made although a decision on the first radar, in Queensland, should be made late this year. (3) The Longreach district is one of several areas which have been considered. A decision on siting based on Departmental Studies has not yet been taken. (4) No. The need, for an Environmental Impact Statement will be determined by the Department of Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories on the basis of the Defence Department's Notice of Intention (NO!). The NO! will be based on specific sites and cannot therefore be finalised in advance of a siting decision. This procedure is in accordance with the requirements of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. Those requirements will be strictly observed. (5) (a) (i) and (ii). This construction schedule will depend on the approach adopted by the contractor selected for the project. The aim, however, is that a contract be let by mid 1990 and that the system be operational by early jmid 1994. (b) No decisions have been taken to site the radars on specific properties at Longreach. (c) Compensation will be determined in accordance with the Lands Acquisition Act 1989. (d) It is known that Mr D. A. Scarr is not willing to sell ""Macsland"" and this fact will have influence on Departmental recommendations. (6) Yes; the Department has received requests for information and has provided as much information as possible pending actual site selections. (7) See (6), above. White Paper on Growth in Economy (Question No. 2066) Mr MACKellar asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, upon notice, on 4 October 1989: (\) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald of 6 March 1986 that the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce had recommended to Cabinet the preparation of a White Paper encompassing an economic master plan for achieving growth into the next century. (2) Did the Minister make such a recommendation to Cabinet; if so, is the Minister able to indicate when the White Paper is expected to be released. Mr Barry Jones-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. (2) While there was considerable discussion of Australia's longer term economic prospects at the time, I did not take any submission to Cabinet recommending the preparation of a White Paper on the issue. Aircraft Incident (Question No. 2068) Mr Jull asked the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support, upon notice, on 4 October 1989: (1) Did aircraft VH-LTJ land at Wagga Wagga Airport on 9 September \989; if so, (a) did the pilot, upon landing, (i) taxi very slowly off the runway to the terminal area and (ii) subsequently informally complain about the aircraft's steering mechanism as the cause of the slow taxiing and (b) was any problem entered on the maintenance release for VHLTJ after the Wagga Wagga visit. (2) Did VH-LTJ land at Albury Airport, immediately prior to its landing there on 16 September when it slewed and bogged, in such a manner as to cause the control tower to query whether it was operating normally. (3) Was a crane used in accordance with correct hoisting procedures after VH-LTJ slewed sharply and bogged on the verge of the runway when it landed at Albury Airport on 16 September. (4) Did a licensed aircraft maintenance engineer certified for the type of aircraft inspect VH-LTJ on either 16 or 17 September before it departed for a gear-down flight from Albury to Sydney. (5) Was a permit to ferry taken out for a geardown flight on 17 September; if so, were all guidelines in relation to ferrying fully complied with. (6) In respect of the subsequent flight of VH-LTJ from Albury to Sydney, (a) how many persons were aboard, (b) were there two persons aboard other than the minimum required of a pilot and co-pilot, (c) was an instrument flight plan filed rather than a visual flight plan and (d) were fuel consumption figures and icing factors known to the pilots when the flight plan was filed. (7) Is the VH-LTJ incident the third serious incident involving Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) aircraft so far in 1989, following those at Mangalore, Vic., and Goolwa, SA. (8) Is there a major problem with CAA training procedures. (9) At what time and date was the incident involving VH-LTJ at Albury on 16 September reported to the Independent Bureau of Air Safety Investigation.",143
261,Mrs KELLY ,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN MINT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes; (a) (i) and (ii) it has not been possible to verify whether the pilot complained about the steering mechanism on LTJ. The pilot has since left the CAA to work for an overseas airline. Importantly, the maintenance record for the aircraft on 9 September through to the time of the mishap at Albury reveals no reported problems with the nosewheel steering. Had the pilot-in-command of the aircraft at Wagga on 9 September been aware of anything to do with the steering mechanism that might have affected safe operation of the aircraft, he would have had an obligation to report this in writing. There is a well structured system for the reporting and rectification of any airworthiness defects in aircraft. 'Informal complaint', which the pilot-in-command is suggested as having made, has no place in this system. This would have been well known to the pilot-in-command who would have been negligent had he failed to report any real or suspected airworthiness defect in the recognised way. (b ) Yes; relating to three minor defects, e.g. blown bulb in a landing light. (2) The pilot who was undergoing training on the G.lOOO has no recollection of any query by air traffic control (ATC) staff at Albury whether the aircraft was operating normally. However, ATC staff at Albury have reported that they queried earlier manoeuvres prior to the aircraft leaving the runway and becoming bogged and received the reply from the crew that they were involved in training. (3) The aircraft came to rest in a position in which it infringed on the runway. This rendered Albury Airport closed until the aircraft was removed. CAA air traffic control staff at Albury arranged for a local licensed aircraft maintenance engineer (LAME) to move the aircraft. There was urgency to this task as the runway was closed to other aircraft movements until the aircraft was removed. The LAME did not have either the time or appropriate facilities in accordance with the procedures laid down by the manufacturer for hoisting of the aircraft. A crane was therefore employed with slings attached to the engine isolator mounts to lift the aircraft. (4) Yes. The aircraft was released for flight. (5) No. (6) (a) Four, (b) yes, .(c) yes, (d) yes. In regard to fuel consumption and icing factors, the aircraft's performance and characteristics were fully known to the pilot-in-command who allowed generous margins in satisfying the en route and reserve fuel requirements. (7) The only occurrence which may be defined as serious involves the incident at Mangalore, (Vic.) on 17 July. The incident at Goolwa, SA involved the main wheel of the aircraft breaking through the light bitumen seal on soft wet ground during a U-turn whilst taxiing at the end of the runway. (8) No. (9) The incident occurred at 1342 hours on 16 September. It was reported by the crew to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation at 1430 hours on the same day. Australian Defence Force (Question No. 2079) Mr Hollis asked the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 5 October 1989: How many members of the Australian Defence Force were born in each country other than Australia? Mr Simmons-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: There has never been a requirement to maintain consolidated details relating the the country of birth of Australian Defence Force (ADF) members. Accordingly, the information required to answer the question is not readily available. However, following a recent Government initiative, the ADF is now collecting country of birth data for its recruits. Sporting Links with South Africa (Question No. 2080) Mr Cobb asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, upon notice, on 5 October 1989: Did the Minister state in an address to the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs in Lagos on 15 February 1989 that Australia had imposed drastic restrictions on sporting links with South Africa; if so, will the Minister provide details of each of the drastic restrictions which have been imposed.",144
262,Mr DUFFY ,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN MINT,"The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (a) Yes. (b) The Government's policy on sporting contacts with South Africa is well known. I refer the honourable member to the press release issued by my predecessor on 26 October 1983, my reply to a question without notice from Senator MCGauran on 5 May 1989 and the supplementary answer to that question I gave to the Senate on 8 May 1989. Social Security: Appointment of Women (Question No. 2098) Mr Langmore asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 24 October 1989: For each of the (i) boards, (ii) councils and (iii) committees to which the Minister has the power to appoint members, what (a) proportion of the positions is now held by women and (b) change in that proportion has there been since the ALP Caucus passed the motion in August 1988 requiring that a minimum of 25 per cent of all appointments to Government boards, councils and committees be women.",145
263,Mr HOWE ,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN MINT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is shown in the table below. The following information is also of interest: As regards members of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the proportion of positions currently held by women is 57%. The change in the proportion of positions held by women since the Caucus motion in August 1988 is +4%. The Minister has nominated members of two Committees of the Social Welfare Research Centre: the Research Management Committee and the Advisory Committee. However, these members have been appointed by the University of New South Wales. The Minister nominated two of the four members of the Research Management Committee both of whom are men. The overall proportion of positions held by women is 25%. The Minister has nominated four of the eleven members of the Advisory Committee one of whom is a woman. The overall proportion of positions currently held by women is 18%. The Centre will become the Social Policy Research Centre and these Committees will be replaced by a seven member management board. Three members will be appointed by the Minister. These appointments have not yet been finalised. (i) Boards Nil . . (ii) Councils Social Security Advisory Council .

264,Mr RUDDOCK ,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN MINT,"the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice, on 30 October 1989: (1) Did the Australian Bureau of Statistics undertake an initial study of the Minister's Department's office movements in Queensland in the 1990s; if so, did the study cost $1,364. (2) If such a study has been undertaken, has it been completed; if so (a) has the report been made publicly available, (b) if it has been made publicly available, (i) when and (ii) to whom was it made available, (c) if it was not made publicly available, why not and (d) if it contained recommendations, have they been implemented.",146
265,Mr HOLDING ,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN MINT,"The Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Australian Institute of Family Studies comes within the portfolio responsibility of the Minister for Social Security. Members of the Board of Management of the Institute are, however, appointed by the Governor General. The proportion of positions currently held by women is 57%. The change in the p-oportion held by women since the Caucus motion is +17%. (a) (b) Proportion of Change in proportion of positions currently positions held by women since held by women Caucus motion in August 1988 N/A N/A 44% - 6%; this change is due to a vacancy following the resignation of a female member in September 1989. 50% Not applicable; this group was established in September 1989. 86% +15 40% - 10%; this change is due to a vacancy following the resignation of a female member in September 1989. 40% Not applicable: the membership of this Working Party has not changed since it was established in December 1987. (1) The Australian Bureau of Statistics did undertake an initial study-a feasibility study for a larger study to be undertaken. The study did cost $1,364. (2) The initial study has been completed. It did not result in any data outcomes. Rather, it was conducted to determine an appropriate methodology for the main study. The larger study aims to project client locations in the 1990s in order to help determine appropriate office locations. The report was not made publicly available as it was regarded as an internal working document. It did not contain recommendations, as such, apart from the proposed method of conducting the larger study, which is now in progress.
