1,Mr OZANNE,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Minister of Home Affairs whether, as Geelong is acknowledged to be the leading centre in Australia for the manufacture of woollens, and has every facility for the prosecution' of the industry, the Government will' take into consideration the advisability of erecting its mill there? Mr KING O'MALLEY - When we start to build our mill, there is no doubt that the Athens of Australia will be considered.",14
2,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Will the Minister, before deciding on the site of the Government woollen factory, visit Lobethal, in South Australia? Mr KING O'MALLEY - No doubt Lobethal also deserves well of Australia. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - Will the Minister also visit the salubrious and well-known district of Marrickville, which is famous for the production of the best tweeds in Australia? Mr KING O'MALLEY - There can be no doubt that Marrickville makes good rugs.",14

POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. LETTER SORTERS PROMOTIONS-COMMUNI 1 CATION WITH KING ISLAND.",14
4,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"T n reply to the questions asked yesterday by the honourable member for South Sydney, respecting the promotionof letter sorters, the Commonwealth Public Service Commissioner has furnished the following information1. Under the original grading of sorters, one-third of the staff was not promoted each year, as stated. Promotions were only made as vacancies occurred. The grading provided for two-thirds of the staff being in the lower grade and one-third in the higher grade. Provision bas been made on the Estimates, 1910-11, to advance twenty (20) sorters in New South Wales to the higher grade, and thus maintain as nearly as passible the proportion between the grades. It is essential in the interests of efliciency that sorters should pass the prescribed test before receiving promotion to the higher position. 2. The prescribed test for the higher position is the sorting of 500 letters at the rate of forty-five per minute, with not more than 2 per cent, of errors.. The test is not unduly hard for the nature of the work to be performed, and is being negotiated by oflicers at a speed varying Irom 45 to 71 letters pei minute. Twenty-eight (28) sorters have passed the test, and thus qualified for promotion. 3. No. Provision is made annually on the Estimates for increments to officers of the General Division, these increments being statutory and automatic and payable, subject to efliciency and good conduct. Omcers of the Mail Branch, Sydney, participate in these amounts in common with all other General Division ofBcers.",14
5,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"the Postmaster General, upon noticeIn view of the fact that the ship Carnarvon Bay was wrecked on the south-east coiner of King Island on - Thursday last, and seeing that there are no facilities for communication with King Island-Will he take into immediate consideration the necessity for the construction of wireless telegraphy stations at King and Flinders Islands ?",14
6,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Upon the completion of the Sydney and Fremantle. stations, the' whole matter of establishing wireless telegraph stations round the coast of Australia and Tasmania will be dealt with, and the inclusion of King and Flinders Islands will then be given consideration. NA IRRIGATION. Mr SAMPSON '(Wimmera) [10.36] That, for the purpose of enabling the Parliaof the Commonwealth to effectively legislate in respect to water conservation and irrigation, the Constitution should be amended to place under Federal control the Murray River and its tributaries. This motion has been on the notice-paper for several months. I have brought the matter forward because I regard the proper control' of our waterways as essential to the prosperity of Australia, and believe that it can be effective only if exercised by the Commonwealth Parliament, the Parliaments of the States having failed in the last forty years to deal with the subject as a national one. The Federal Convention exhaustively discussed the subject, and arrived at the compromise which was inserted in the Constitution, but the advantages of irrigation were not so well known chen as they are now. Section 51 empowers this Parliament to pass laws respecting trade ancl commerce between the States, while section 98 provides thatThe power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the property of a State. The power to regulate trade and commerce has been held by the judicial authorities of the United States to be very elastic, and capable of considerable expansion, and, no doubt, the power given in our Constitution, which is not clearly defined, will be similarly interpreted by the High Court. Section 100 enacts thatThe Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the riglit of any State or the residents therein to reasonable use of the waters for conservation or irrigation. That is an obvious limitation of our power to legislate respecting navigation, subordinating it to the right of the States and of the people to use the water of the rivers for irrigation. No doubt the High Court will, ultimately, be called upon to decide whether our power to legislate respecting navigation is paramount to that of the State Parliaments to legislate respecting irrigation; it is not advisable to enter now upon the academic discussion of the abstruse and intricate questions of riparian law. The Roman law respecting the rights of land-owners to the water which flowed through their property was graduallyadopted by the various European nations; became largely the common law of England, and was in part accepted by Napoleon. It was framed largely to meet the exigencies of navigation and fisheries, the importance of those industries largely bringing into prominence the law of riparian rights. In modern times, however, the value of water for irrigation has become more and more recognised, with the result that riparian law has been materially modified, especially in the United States, where it has been proved that the application of water to the soil is productive of great benefits. Of course, the whole interpretation of the law hinges upon the ference in time? phrase "" the reasonable use of the waters."" But a reasonable use of water for irrigation has been proved to be of more importance the national life of a community than its use for navigation. We have it on the authority of the eminent Chairman of the Victorian Water Supply Commission that this tendency on the part of irrigation rights in the United States to gain a paramountcy over the rights of water supply for navigation has been of constant growth, so that there is at present very little doubt as to which would be ruled by the Courts to be the superior use in the national interests. Mr. Mead is a gentleman who at one time occupied the position of chief engineer of the Federal Department of Agriculture in the United States. He has also written a work, setting out the water law of the various States of the Union and the great difficulties and disadvantages that have arisen in those States through a divided control in the regulation, supply, and distribution of water, which has considerably retarded the progress of irrigation. In his evidence before the Victorian Water Supply Commission he states that it is his belief that the the need for water for irrigation is imperative, and that its value for this purpose is so great that navigation'should be made subordinate tp irrigation. He points out that the waters of rivers which, in the early stages of the United States, were declared by the Supreme Court to be navigable,, have since been utilized in the upstreams by the irrigators. Mr Mead also states that for transportation purposes the railways of the United States have superseded the ships on the rivers. That has been, I think, the tendency in most countries where railways have been constructed to any considerable extent. The products which are grown on irrigation areas are mostly perishable articles, and it is necessary that they should be placed upon the market at the earliest possible moment, so that the more rapid the means of transit the more suitable it is. It has also been found that the railways are more reliable. Our experience at Mildura gives proof of that. In that settlement there was a constant agitation for the construction of a railway, although steam-boats were running past it during the greater portion of the year. Since the railway was constructed nearly the whole of the produce has been conveyed to the market by that means.",14
7,Mr JOHN THOMSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,What is the dif,15
8,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I have not taken out the figures, but the railway takes the proto ducts several times as quickly as did the steamer. In his evidence before the same - Commission, Mr Tait, the Chairman of the Victorian Railways Commissioners, stated that in 1899 the tonnage carried by boat on the Mississippi-on e of the most important navigable rivers in the United States-wa s 29,000 tons, and that in 1906 it had fallen to 19,000 tons, showing a decrease of 31 per cent.",15
9,Mr ARCHIBALD,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Was that through competition by railway?,16
10,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Yes . Mr Mead justifies his contention that in modern communities the transcendent value of irrigation as a producer of wealth has got beyond the stage of controversy. He cites numerous decisions in the United States which have generally laid it down "" that the use of the streams in arid country for irrigation purposes is of paramount importance to their preservation for navigation purposes.""",16
11,Mr ARCHIBALD,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Is that a Supreme Court decision?,16
12,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"This information is taken from Mr Mead's evidence, in which he quotes Supreme XTourt decisions. He also states a decision that "" No restrictions are placed upon the Po river, in Europe, and its tributaries, for irrigation purposes."" In giving his own opinion, he states that with a paramountcy in irrigation the Murray must rank with the Po, the Euphrates, and the Sacramento, among the irrigation valleys of the world, but that this result will only come by making irrigation superior to navigation.",16
13,Mr ARCHIBALD,WATER CONSERVATION AND,What about (Danube? Navigation is primary on that river.,16
14,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,That is right. But even . on the Danube-probabl y the only river in the world on which anything like the volume of trade by boats has been sustained-ther e is a tendency for the railway competition to decrease the amount of traffic.,16
15,Mr FENTON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,What about the Nile?,16
16,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"In the case of the Nile, beyond Khartoum., the railway competition has not been felt very much. Of course, it furnishes a magnificent example of the success of irrigation.",16
17,Mr GLYNN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It is proposed to spend ^30,000,000 or ^40,000,000. Mr KING O'MALLEY - And America beats the earth now.",16
18,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I do not know that it does. I believe that India will run even the United States very closely in that regard. I believe that India furnishes, not the most up-to-date example, but the best example, of the great benefits which maybe derived from a proper system of irrigation. As briefly as I possibly could, in the time at my disposal, I think I have given a sketch-probabl y not sufficient to satisfy legal minds-of the law in respect to the control of waters generally, and the development in nations which have acquired by experience the knowledge of the relative value of the two systems, showing that irrigation has been proved of immeasurably greater advantage to the needs of a nation than has navigation.",16
19,Mr SPENCE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Why does the honourable member confine the motion to the Murray river? Are there not other streams in Australia ?,16
20,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Because , so far, the Murray is the only river which runs through the centre of Australia, and on which irrigation colonies have been formed. I think that for practical purposes the Murray river and its tributaries, extending as it does over such a wide watershed, furnishes a more simple method of bringing about nationalization.",16
21,Mr SPENCE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"If it is proposed to alter the Constitution, why not include other rivers ?",16
22,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"That is a matter which can be debated at another time. I think that it should be almost unnecessary, even with our limited experience of irrigation, to deal at any length with the advantages of irrigation as it has been apthe plied, not only in Australia, but in other parts of the world. But, perhaps, it might be advisable in dealing with this important question, that I should make a brief reference to the success of irrigation in some countries where it has been practised extensively. Irrigation, probably, had its genesis in Egypt. For thousands of years irrigation, in its crude and primitive form, was practised in that country, and yielded forth very abundantly. But it was only in 1882, that Mr - no w Sir WilliamWilcocks, the engineer, was sent there for the purpose of reporting on a comprehensive scheme of storing and distributing the waters of the great Nile river. At Assouan there was constructed from his design one of the greatest storage works in Western the world. During the last few years the Assouan dam has been the means of almost doubling the population of Egypt. Out of its total area of 12,000 square miles, with a population of 10.000,000, it has at present 5,000,000 acres of land under active irrigation, and besides feeding that huge population from the produce of the soil, chiefly brought about in a modern and scientific way, it has exported over £20,000,000 of primary productions as the result of irrigation. In the United States there are at present no less than 15,000,000 acres under cultivation. That is, I admit, a magnificent achievement for a comparatively young country, that is, compared with countries where irrigation has been practised for many hundreds of years. The productivity of that area is Sufficiently explained when it is stated the value of land has been increased from its .old prairie price of from 5s. to ios. to from ,£20 to .£100 per acre. Within the irrigated valleys of the United States we find cities containing no less than 100,000 persons as centres of commerce for great irrigation works. As regards India, the leader of the Opposition reported on its irrigation system twenty years ago, and one of the most eminent engineers whom we have has described it as an exhaustive and voluminous work and one of the ablest ever written on its irrigation system. When the leader of the Opposition wrote his work there were 30,000,000 acres under irrigation, but that area has since increased to 50.000,000 acres. The system of irrigation obtaining in India is of a composite character. Very large areas, indeed almost provinces, are irrigated with water obtained from wells. This, of course, will appeal to the honourable member for Maribyrnong, who believes, as I do, that a very much larger area in Australia will be found to have subterranean water. If it can be brought to the surface, as in India, and utilized to such tremendous advantage in watering arid areas, why should it not be applied in the same way here? I have not the exact figures as to the area which is watered through the agency of wells in India, but I know that it is a very large proportion of the total area of 50,000,000 acres. They have channels and water storages, and the total outlay of £30,000,000 on storage works and principal head-works is yielding more than 6 per cent, interest. That is a wonderful achievement. At present no less than 200,000,000, out of the total population of 300,000,000, are supported, directly or indirectly, through the agency of irrigation works. The same tale of transcendent progress might be told of southern Europe. In Australia most of the work is yet to be done. We already have examples which show that we have a soil which is specially adapted to irrigation, and that the highest results obtained by any nation are capable of achievement in the arid areas of this continent. Throughout the Gunbower, the Cohuna, the Kerang, the Goulburn, and the Swan Hill districts, we have examples of what can be achieved through an ordinary system of irrigation. We have in some of these districts on the Murray flats small areas devoted almost exclusively to the production of lucerne and butter, which bring forth more abundantly that than do whole provinces in the northern parts of Victoria, given over to wheat growing. We offer the world a unique and perfect example of the value of irrigation. Notwithstanding the great difficulties that had to be encountered in the early stages of its history-difficultie s inseparable from early pioneering work in Australia-that settlement has progressed by leaps and bounds. It was established on what was formerly a barren scrub, probably not worth is. per acre.",16
23,Mr HANS IRVINE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,A shilling a mile.,17
24,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Some of it could be taken up at 2s. 6d. per square mile, yet no application was made for it. By the intelligent and scientific application of water to the soil of that territory, especially adapted as it is to fruit-growing, we have achieved results that furnish an object lesson even to the irrigation districts of the United States. We have in Mildura an area of 11,000 acres under intensive cultivation - equa l to about a dozen ordinary wheat farms-and it is supporting in comparative prosperity 5,000 souls, or a population of 300 persons to the square mile, whilst it provides employment for fifty workers to every square mile of country cultivated. The value of its yield last year was £250,000. After much agitation a railway was built for the exclusive benefit of the settlement, and last year there was collected in respect of passenger freights upon it ,£5.000, whilst ordinary freights yielded ,-£30.000. Mildura is therefore supporting not only 5,000 souls, but is finding employment for a number of people in connection with the carriage of its dried fruits, which are equal to any that the world produces.",17
25,Mr JOHN THOMSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,And better in many respects.,17
26,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"In the matter of flavour they are superior to any that can be produced by any irrigation settlement oversea. I look upon the honourable member for Cowper, who has just interjected, as an authority on whom the most complete reliance may be placed. This territory which has proved so suitable for the production of dried fruits, and whose production per acre is equal in value to that of the most highly tilled plots of irrigation land in the world, has been found especially suitable for the production of butter, whilst the salubrity of its climatf is highly favourable to fattening stock for export. We have in the London market an unlimited demand for our dairy produce and stock, ancl by the proper application cf tha imrrense volume of water now largely running to waste, we should be able to establish some of the greatest dairying districts in Australia along our river valleys where the soil is excellent and the climate most salubrious. The productivity of the soil when water is applied to it is well known to every honourable member, but to justify my motion I think it wise to invite the House to glance for a moment at the problem involved in the control of the Murray and its tributaries. Numerous attempts have been made by State Parliaments to deal effectively with this most important question, and the records furnish us with the story of a series of bungles. Let me point, first of all, to the tremendous catchment area of the Murray and its tributaries. According to the report just issued by the Royal Commission, the basin of the Murray is 414,253 square miles in extent. It will come as a surprise to some honourable members to learn that the Murray has so great a catchment area and gathering ground.  up in Queensland.",17
27,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Queenslan d is also a ent very big contributing factor to the Murray mile waters. The Commission reported thatThe general boundaries which form the watershed of the streams flowing through this basin are on the east, the Coast Range of New South Wales and Queensland ; on the south and north the Dividing Range of Victoria and a line of low hills stretching north-westward from Toowoomba, in Queensland, respectively: on the west the Mount Lofty, Harrier, and other lower and less-defined hills. The areas of the various States that go lo make up the basin are Queensland-104,52 5 s-juare miles. New South Wales-234,36 2 square miles. Victoria-50,97 9 square miles. South Austialia-24,38 7 square miles. Broadly speaking, the basin of the Murray River can be divided into(1) Undulating and mountainous country. (2) Plain country. The undulating and mountainous country varies in elevation from Mount Kosciusko 7,256 feet, to where it merges into the plains, at a general elevation of between 500 feet and 700 feet above sea-level. The plains then fal l gradually from this level towards the main stream and towards the outlet of the river system at Lake Alexand r i a , the average slope being approximately 1 foot per mile, ""although it becomes less as the sea is approached. The undulating and plain areas are practically coincident with the contributing and non-contributing division of the Murray basin. It is only occasionally-and that principally in Victoria and in small isolated areas-that the plains contribute to the flow of the rivers. The following are the contributing and non-contributing areas of the Murray basin :Non-contrihutinir State. Contributing Areas. Areas. Queensland 07,090 tq. miles - 36,833 sc . miles. Now S-iuth Wales ... 7S.499 do. 15S,8f3 do. Victoria ... 15,310 do. 3a,Cti9 do. South Australia ... 24,387 do. 158,499 sq. miles. 203,754 sq. miles.  tralia contribute the least, and yet they are fighting the hardest over the Murray waters",18
28,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Althoug h the gathering ground in the other States is greater, the chief consideration relates to the volume of water that actually flows from the tributaries into the Murray. The principal rivers that go to make up this supply are the Murrumbidgee, the Goulburn, and the Darling, together with their respective tributaries. The report sets out thatThe Murray River rises in the highlands about Mount Kosciusko, and enters the plains between Albury and Corowa. The distance from Albury to the mouth is 1,366 miles. The slope or gradiof the river bed increases from 3 inches per lo about 1 foot per mile at Albury j thence, as the valley becomes more restricted, the gradient increases to 10 feet per mile till the small tributary streams at the source of the main stream, and its upper tributaries in the highlands, have a slope of up to 200 feet per mile. The area of the watershed above the Goulburn that is contributory is 9,673 square miles, of which only 2.373 square miles are in New South Wales. The Murrumbidgee River has the same characteristics as the Murray itself, and, if the Goulburn River be excluded, is little inferior in length nnd flow to the main stTeum. The watershed of the Murrumbidgee that is contributory is 13,000 miles in area, but the river receives practically no additions to its flow below the junction of the Tumut River, near Gundagai. The Goulburn River rises at Wood's Point, in Victoria, and has an effective contributing area of about 5,000 miles. This river has a much shorter course than the Murrumbidgee, but in flow and effective catchment, as the recent gaugings of the two streams show, is really superior to that stream. The Darling River has a total catchment area of 300,000 square miles. Of this, however, only 100,000 could be considered as effectively contributing to the flow. Rising as it does in Queensland, it is some 2,000 miles long before it junctions with the Murray. When fed by the heavier monsoonal rains in Queensland, for shorter periods it contributes as much water as the Murray does when in flood. On the other hand, it frequently almost ceases to flow. The importance of this question is my excuse for making these quotations, which show what an enormous catchment area the Murray and its tributaries have. If only the flood waters were conserved-and they could be conserved far more advantageously than they are at the present time-it would be possible to distribute them over our arid plains, to the greatest advantage, even although every acre were not devoted to intense cultivation. The quotations I have made show how important it is that some control of an effective character should be exercised by the National Parliament over these great sources of water supply. According to the estimates of engineers, the Murray and its tributaries command no less than 50,000,000 acres which could be irrigatedif the water supply were available. What has been done by the States to bring about some kind of effectual control of these great inland rivers ? We have a record of a long series of ineffective attempts in that direction by Parliaments and Commissions. A judicial statement of the case, free from any colouring, is given in the report of the Royal Commission which was appointed in 1902. Following the conference at Corowa in that year, the Chief Engineers of New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria were appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the whole question of the catchment area, the water available for irrigation, and the area that could be irrigated; and to recommend some form of effective control over the waters of the Murray. In the preface to its report, the Commission gives a brief history of the negotiations which had taken place between the various States interested in the question up till 1902. It is only necessary for me to quote what is said in this connection in order to show that the State Parliaments have utterly failed to grapple effectively with the [127] problem. The report of the Cornmission says The River Murray, judged by its length of channel and area of catchment, sbould be one of the great streams of the world; and, although its volume of water is small, relatively to its immense gathering ground, it is yet the greatest waterway in Australia, and its utilization is of the first importance to the inhabitants of the States through which it flows. It is, therefore, matter of surprise that the problem which it is the function of this Commission to investigate still remain unsettled. The history of the rivers question for the past eighteen years is, briefly, as follows :In 1884 a Royal Commission was appointed in New South Wales, under the presidency of the Honourable W. J. (now Sir W. J.) Lyne, M.P., "" to make a diligent and full inquiry into the best method of conserving the rainfall, and of searching for and developing the underground reservoirs supposed to exist in the interior of this Colony, and also into the practicability, by a general system of water conservation and. distribution, of averting the disastrous consequences of the periodical droughts to which the Colony is from time to time subject."" This Commission presented three reports, a prominent feature of which was the utilization of the waters of the River Murray. Two conferences were also held, in 1886, with a Royal Commission on water supply, appointed by the Government of Victoria. The result was the adoption of the following resolution :1. That a joint Trust shall be constituted, equally representative of the Colonies of New South Wales and Victoria, in which shall be vested the control of the whole of the Murray River and its tributaries, from its source to Howlong, to be known as the Upper Murray; and of the whole of the Murray River, from Howlong to the eastern boundary of the Colony of South Australia, to be known as the Lower Murray; and such Trust shall have power to regulate all diversions of water from the river and tributaries within its jurisdiction. That recommendation has been repeated since by Royal Commissions, and yet we are now no nearer a settlement of this question than we were forty years ago. The Commission made several other specific recommendations regarding the control and distribution of the waters of the Murray between the various States, with which, however, it is not necessary for me to deal. These recommendations were submitted to the Governments of South Australia and Victoria, but no Bill was prepared by either for the constitution of the suggested Trust. The birth of the Commonwealth has brought into existence a new authority vested with powers which, within certain limits, are supreme. The introduction of this new, and, to some extent, controlling factor, made it more than ever necessary that the States interested in the disposal of the waters of the Murray Basin should come to some conclusion as to their respective Tights and interests in the river and in works for the utilization of its waters. Several successive years of drought, too, had made the residents in the Riverina district of New South Wales keenly anxious for the realization of some of the projects for the irrigation of their lands, already so long under discussion. This anxiety found public expression in March of this year, when an organization, called the Murray River Main Canal League, invited the Federal Premier, the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria, - and South Australia, and other representative men, to a conference at Corowa. At the conference several resolutions were passed, the principal of which are the following :i . That the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States concerned be urged to co-operate in preparing and carrying out a comprehensive scheme for the utilization of the waters of Murray, which, while improving the navigability of that river, would also provide for the imperative needs of the residents on both banks in the conservation and distribution of its waters. Then follows a further very important recommendation, which readsThat, in the opinion of this Conference, the circumstances of Australia demand that all natural waters not already appropriated under regal sanction shall be declared public water, and made, subject to a suitable system of law, applicable to the whole of the Continent, and that the Commonwealth and State Governments be respectfully asked to consider such legislation as would provide for its regulation and disposal in such manner as shall secure its fullest possible use in the interests of the whole of the people. But what has been done to give effect to that very important recommendation ? Absolutely nothing. It is clearly pointed out by the Commission that unappropriated water should become public water, and that the Commonwealth Parliament should be approached by the State Parliaments with a view to securing the utilization of that water to the best possible advantage. I recognise that the navigation claims of South Australia have an equal right to be considered with the more important claims put forward by the other riparian States in respect to irrigation. But-even the Royal Commissions which have investigated this Murray waters question have failed to recognise the immensely superior claims of irrigation over navigation, especially in view of the probable extension of our railway systems into the interior of the continent. The next point which we have to consider is, "" What are the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with this question ? "" In the early portion of my remarks, I stated that the Commonwealth is hampered because of the superior powers in respect of irrigation which are vested in the States. These powers almost dwarf Mr Samfson. our own authority to deal with this question effectively, because, under section ioo of the Constitution, the Commonwealth cannot abridge the right of a State or the residents therein to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation. We know that the whole question of the exercise of power by the Federal authority depends upon the "" reasonable "" use of waters. Therefore, it merely needs to be stated that the claims of irrigation are far greater than those of navigation to show that we cannot deal effectively with this important question. So the River far, however, there has been no conflict between the Federal and State authorities. The States have made heroic attempts to establish large irrigation works. The Barren Jack scheme, in New South Wales, is one of the engineering triumphs of the world, and, when completed, will not be very much inferior in capacity to the first Assouan storage in Egypt. In Victoria, a considerable extension is being made in the construction of irrigation works, and we believe that those works will rapidly attract to this State the population that is so urgently required. I repeat that, so far, there has been no conflict between the Federal and State authorities over this Murray waters question. But had this Parliament taken in hand the locking of the river in order to secure the effective navigation of that stream- a matter upon which engineering authorities are very much divided- a conflict would have immediately arisen as to which power was paramount. I hope that I have made clear the evolution of the law in respect of the claims of navigation and irrigation, and also the lamentable failure of the State Parliaments to deal effectively with this important question. It seems to me that there should be no difference of opinion regarding the necessity for effective control being exercised over this great national asset by the Commonwealth Parliament, especially in view of the fact that the Murray and its tributaries, which are all inter-dependent, extend into four States. Of course, it may be urged that my proposal is a step in the direction of unification. My own view is that our Constitution ought not to be tampered with except in the interest of the people as a whole. I can see no prospect of stability in our national system of government unless we pay some regard to the permanency of our Constitution, but the framers of that Constitution-eminen t men as they were-and notwithstanding that evolved one of thefinestpieces of construcwater. tive statesmanship that has ever been duced by a deliberative assembly, could not be expected to foresee all the contingencies of' the future in respect of the need for the terior. expansion of our constitutional powers. Regardless altogether of the question of Socialism or of unification, I think that gation. sober common-sense and a due appreciation of the growing needs of the people suggest that it is our duty to ask for an extension of our legislative powers, so as to enable us to discharge our national functions the best interests of the people. At the same time, I think that any amendment of the Constitution should be made only after it has been conclusively shown that the question upon which we seek an extension of _ our legislative powers is too large for the States to successfully handle. Then is the time for the Federal Parliathe ment to step in. We have not the constitunot tional power to touch the question at premight sent. It will be necessary before we can have effective control of our great national water-ways to ask the people to extend powers, and that is the object of my be motion.' There is nothing extraordinary such a proposal. In Switzerland, which cannot be regarded as a Socialistic Federabe tion, but which is one of the highest dethat velopments of Democracy in the world, was found necessary, only a few years ago, to place under Federal control millions the water supply for power purposes in the large rivers. There was a great agitation over the question. The proposal was subtage. mitted to the people, who rejected it. There was a good deal of conflict between the Federal and State powers, but eventually the people sanctioned the transfer of the control of the question to the Federal authority, when it was clearly shown to them that Federal jurisdiction was necesthat sary in the public interests. I have always believed that the future of Australia was bound up with the extension of irrigation projects, and, therefore, at the earliest posbelong. sible moment, an opportunity should be given to the people to invest this Parliament with the necessary power to control our great water-ways. Australia is try with a rainfall which is probably not quite so low as some people believe, we are fortunately situated in having nearly the whole of our rivers taking their close to the coast line, and running for most part through arid areas which can be know what was done then. [127]- 2 they made most fertile by the application of In order to provide against our procomparatively low rainfall we must make the best possible use of the water flowing along the water-courses through the dry inMr KING O'MALLEY - We can increase the rainfall by an extensive system of irri",18
29,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"That is quite true, as has been proved in the United States of America. When the water is distributed over the country it has been shown concluin sively that it soaks into the soil and percolates back into the rivers. Intermittent streams in the United States of America have become perennial through the spreading of the water over the land. The question of irrigation should commend itself to every patriotic citizen. If we properly utilize our water-courses and make necessary storages, whole areas that cannow be placed under intense cultivation be flooded with water at certain seasens of the year, and I am confident that we shall find that , the yield in cereal growing our and many other forms of cultivation will vastly increased. It is absolutely necesin sary, if we are to fill Australia with a sturdy yeomanry, which has been proved to the backbone of every progressive nation, we should effectively control the water it supply, which is the great source and foundation of wealth. At present tens of of gallons of water are flowing to waste every year into the sea, when it could be placed upon the soil to the best advanI t is an unpardonable and almost criminal neglect on the part of this Parliament and the State Legislatures to allow those great volumes of valuable fluid to be wasted. They should be applied to the soil to create wealth, promote settlement, and so produce the very best class of citizens any nation could have. In this way we could help the other agencies of commerce, and assist in building up a civilization to which we should all be proud to",21
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Hume) [11.35]-This is a question in which I took a great interest in 1882, 1883, and 1884, and a counin which I am still interested.  but member do something then?",21
31,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I shall tell the rise honourable member what we did, and why the we could not do more. Very few people The report from which the honourable member for Wimmera quoted was produced by a Royal Commission appointed in New South Wales in 1882, and sitting in conjunction with a Royal Commission from Victoria from 1882 to 1884. That investigation concluded with the best report that has ever been made on this question in Australia. The reason why nothing could be done, especially in reference to the Murray, was that it was found that New South Wales had no power to touch the southern bank of the river. She could do little or nothing with regard to the Murray without the full concurrence of Victoria. Thus it was that the great scheme recommended was not carried out. The sum of £250,000 or £300,000 was spent in the contouring of the whole of the watersheds of New South Wales, and a map was prepared, and is now in the Home Affairs Department, showing the heights of the rivers and the land all over New South .Wales. The intention was to carry out a great scheme of irrigation, and the map showed how every river in the State could be diverted by gravitation. It was advised that there should be six weirs erected across the Murray, from Howlong upwards towards the head of the river, but New South Wales could not build them without the concurrence of Victoria, although, technically, the water belongs to New South Wales.",21
32,Mr MATHEWS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,New South Wales claimed both banks.,22
33,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"No ; New South Wales claimed the water in the bed of the river. We were prepared to do and would have done the work at that time, but we did not and could not claim the Victorian bank. That was how the. whole scheme was stopped. Those weirs would have conserved, not only the flood waters, but the snow waters from the Kosciusko and other ranges. The map to which I have referred shows that between the Murray and the Mumvmbidgee, from Howlong on the one side and about 20 miles below Wagga on the other, there is a depression of about TOO feet all through the Riverina, so that the water from those two points could be taken by way of gravitation, and the whole of that large district irrigated from each river without pumping. It was the desire of a syndicate, if they could have got the offer of nearly all the country that was alienated in the Riverina, to go to England with a project to irrigate the whole of the dry portion. That would apply not only to the centre of Riverina, but also to the areas down below, even as far as Swan Hill. The Edwards River and other streams could be brought within the scheme of irrigation, and, if the project could have been carried out, there would not have been a finer piece of country in the world for wheat-growing or any other form of production. I must, commend the New South Wales Government for taking the action they have done in regard to the Barren Jack water scheme. They are running a canal between the Laehlan and the Murrumbidgee, to irrigate the country between those two rivers. The land is good enough, but is very dry, and that work will do a great deal of good by bringing into profitable occupation a large area of country. So far as I can gather, however, the contour of the country between the Murray and the Murrumbidgee is different from that between the Laehlan and the Murrumbidgee. In the latter case a ridge runs along the middle, and the canal is being run along the ridge to distribute the water on each side. If such schemes could be carried out in many places, we should never hear anything more about droughts. The land would be turned to the best advantage, and, incidentally, would be made more capable of bearing taxation of any kind. My impression is that the new land taxation will have the effect of compelling land-owners to turn their attention more towards improving their properties by means of irrigation and in other ways. That is the only way by which they can secure returns which will enable them to pay large sums in taxation. No question is more thoroughly Australian than that which relates to utilizing the water of this country after conserving it on the watersheds. We have the main watershed of the Murray, and in connection with it there are the watersheds of the Murrumbidgee, the Laehlan, the Darling, the MCIntyre, the Namoi, and the Thompson, which receive an enormous volume of water. At the time of the Commission of 1882 to 1884, complaint was made that South Australia was not represented. South Australia considered rhat the waters which converge from various points into one great stream flowing down by Murray-bridge should not be used so much for irrigation purposes-ex cept on the flats-as for navigation.",22
34,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Oh, noj South Australia was favourable to assisting in the conservation of the water for both purposes.",22
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"At any rate, South Australia at that time laid great stress upon navigation. In my opinion it is better to run railways alongside our principal rivers than to use their waters for navigation. I am satisfied that the time will come in Australia when water will be regarded as being so necessary that railways will be run alongside all Our principal rivers. I do not say that the rights of South Australia ought not to be considered - I am satisfied that that State should have a voice in determining the question. But left to themselves the States will never be able to agree to deal with the waters in a proper manner.",23
36,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,South Australia was.represented on the 1892 Commission*,23
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I know that she was, but she was not represented previously. I think that this Parliament and not a Commission ought to take action in the matter. Parliament should deal with the control of the whole of the waters, including those of the Thompson, the Maranoa, the Condamine, and all the other streams that run into the Murray.",23
38,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The matter should be controlled by an Inter-State Commission.,23
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Such a Commission would practically emanate from this Parliament. But if a word is about the Commonwealth assuming this power, some people say that we are interfering with State rights. I do not say that we can take action without an amendment of the Constitution, but that, after all, is a subject which lies within the control of the Federal Parliament.",23
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Is not the whole question intimately associated with land settlement ?,23
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It is, but the waters of our rivers are so distributed amongst the States that the question will never be dealt with on a firm and fair basis unless the Commonwealth takes action. At present we have power to see to it that the navigable rivers are kept for that purpose. But that is only a makeshift way of dealing with the question. For that reason I am inclined to think that the motion under discussion is a placard. It simply asks that certain shall be done.",23
42,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,A resolution of this House would be a direction to the Government.,23
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"But nothing could be done unless the Government would take the matter up, and they can only take effective steps by referring the question to the people by way of referendum.",23
44,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,This House can affirm a principle.,23
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"That is quite right, but we can only take effective action by securing an alteration of the Constitution. That will take time, and unless the matter is pushed vigorously forward-as I think it should be-ther e will be great delay. If we want the lands of Australia to be made as productive as they should be, we must bring the water to them. This is a far more vital question than many people think, and it is intimately bound up with the prosperity of Australia. What is the British Government doing in Egypt? It is conserving the water, and applying it to the rich plains that have hitherto been arid. We have to do the same sort of thing in Australia, and, until we do, we shall not secure those returns from the land that we have a right to expect. The continent of Australia is almost as large as the United States, and I am satisfied that when irrigation is properly applied to oui land it will be as rich as that of America. Important things are being done in Tasmania in regard to the use of water. An Act of Parliament has been passed, giving said power to a company to utilize the waters of the lakes situated high on the mountains. The company is applying for rights and privileges all over the island, and intends to supply electric power for mining and other purposes.",23
46,Mr LAIRD SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It will be the cheapest power in Australia, supplied at i i d . per unit. "" Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I had a conversation with the promotor of this enterprise, who explained to me what the intentions of the company were. . This question of utilizing water power is intimately connected with that of irrigation. If the power which could be generated from our water sources in the higher parts open of Australia were utilized as Niagara is being utilized in America, we should secure great developments in regard to manufactures. There is convincing logic behind the motion submitted by the honourable things member for Wimmera, and I have very much pleasure of seconding, it, because I have been stirring in this matter all my political life, and I am more convinced of its necessity now than ever I was that this is one of the great questions that Australia has to face. Some years ago New South Wales spent £300,000 upon contouring and the preparation of a map, which is likely to be brought into use now. That expenditure will not have to be incurred over again. I always thought that the money was well spent, and the investigation then made will be found to be of use to the whole Commonwealth.",23
47,Mr HANS IRVINE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Grampians) [11.54] - I am fully in accord with the motion. The honourable member for Wimmera has delivered a most instructive speech, which showed that he has been most energetic in searching for facts in support of his contention. Personally, I do not think that the motion goes quite far enough. I agree with the honourable member for Hume that the Commonwealth should exercise full control over the whole of the waters of Australia. More particularly is that the case since the Commonwealth proposes to impose a land tax, which will necessitate a more intelligent application of water to the lands by way of irrigation. It is most essential to our national growth that steps should be taken to conserve the waters of Australia, with a view to enabling people to make better use of the lands. We know what droughts have meant to this country. In the years 1902-3, practically everything was abandoned in the Wimmera District of Victoria. Away back from Horsham and Warracknabeal scarcely a soul was left in the country within, perhaps, a radius of 100 miles. In order that people may be encouraged to settle, and remain in these districts, it is necessary to supply them with a sufficient supply of water for domestic as well as for stock purposes. They should be enabled to irrigate their land, and make it as productive as possible. I am aware that both New South Wales and Victoria have done good work in this direction within the last few years. The Victorian Government, through the agency of their irrigation expert, Mr Elwood Mead, are, at present, doing their best to attract people to settle in the Goulburn Valley, and other parts of the State. Mr Mead has told me that the lands available in the United States are not to be compared with those which could be improved by irrigation in Victoria. He has assured me that there are lands in this State now selling at from £ 5 to £ 6 per acre, which would soon become worth from £ 1 5 to ,£20 an acre, if they were irrigated. What we want is the right kind of people to settle, and a policy that will supply them with water. Now that we are going to impose a form of taxation, which, in my opinion, is most drastic and unjust in its incidence, we ought to devote any surplus revenue from that source - a revenue which we may be sure will be much larger than the Government expect .",24
48,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Order ! The honourable member must not discuss that question.,24
49,Mr HANS IRVINE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I am in order, I think, in saying that we, as a National Parliamenti should devote any surplus revenue from the land tax to promoting settlement by the construction of channels so as to assure a proper supply of water for domestic and stoqk purposes. Water could be conveyed to the arid lands outside the rainfall belt, just as it is supplied from Lake Lonsdale along past Warracknabeal, in the Mallee, and thus secure permanent, peaceful, and prosperous settlement. That would be a policy of progress, in which the niotion of the honourable member for Wimmera is a step j but that motion, in my opinion, is not sufficently' far-reaching. It is only right and proper that we should take over the full control of the waters, particularly in view of the land taxation proposals now before us. I should like the honourable member for Wimmera to press this matter to a division, because it is essential to our national growth that the people on the land should be provided with facilities to enable them, not only to retain their holdings, but to contribute to the prosperity of Australia as a whole.",24
50,Mr CHARLTON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Hunter) [12.2] This is a very important question, and the honourable member for Wimmera has undoubtedly undertaken considerable research in obtaining the information which has enabled him to make out a case from his point of view - We are all fully aware of the great benefits that would result to Australia from a system of water conservation and irrigation. No one doubts for a moment that such a system would be the means of promoting intense cultivation, and that it is most undesirable that the plentiful supply of water which falls at certain times in our. arid regions should be permitted to go to waste. However that may be, my opinion is that unless we decide for complete unification, this Parliament is not justified in passing a motion of this character. The control of water conservation and irrigation must be accompanied by control of the land policy-the two cannot be separated.",24
51,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Why not?,24
52,Mr CHARLTON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The Commonwealth, if it undertakes, at considerable expense, the work of water conservation without having control over the land, will be placed at considerable disadvantage. Many undertakings, which mean considerable outlay, are before this Parliament; and, in view of the embarrassment thereby caused, we are compelled to raise further revenue, probably from the land tax.",24
53,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The honourable member must not discuss the land tax.,25
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Especiall y as what the honourable member says is not correct.,25
55,Mr CHARLTON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member, and probably others, do not seem to be quite consistent in believing that the , States should continue to control the lands, while the Commonwealth undertakes the expense of water conservation.",25
56,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The Federal power could at least control the distribution of the waters.,25
57,Mr CHARLTON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"That is the point I am about to deal with. My great objection to this proposal is that the Commonwealth, whilst it would be involved in considerable expenditure, would not have any control whatever over the lands that would be greatly enhanced in value. When once we' begin to build weirs and conserve the water, we undertake an obligation amounting to some millions of money, and we have to ask ourselves what the Commonwealth will receive in return for irrigating the lands belonging to the States. It has been proved by honourable members opposite that there is a large territory in the arid west still remaining in the hands of the various States, and we are asked to irrigate these lands, without a prospect of any benefit to the Federation. Then, again, millions of acres of privately-owned land along this particular river would be greatly enhanced in value; and if we undertake water conservation and irrigation, we ought to have the power to resume.",25
58,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,What expenditure would there be in the distribution of the waters ?,25
59,Mr CHARLTON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The expense would be in the building of the weirs and so forth.,25
60,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,That is not involved.,25
61,Mr CHARLTON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Once we adopt the principle of water conservation and irrigation, we must build weirs and lock the waters; and all who own land within a certain distance will get the full benefit of the enhanced value without there being any power on the part of the Commonwealth to resume one acre. Of any such enhanced value the people as a whole, and nof individuals, should have the benefit.",25
62,Mr GB EDWARDS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The motion does not prevent resumption.,25
63,Mr CHARLTON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,There is no power under the Constitution to resume.,25
64,Mr GB EDWARDS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The motion proposes to amend the Constitution.,25
65,Mr CHARLTON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"But not in the direction I have indicated; and, if it did, honourable members opposite would be very much opposed to the idea.",25
66,Mr GB EDWARDS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Not I !,25
67,Mr CHARLTON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member might not, but, judging from the general tenor of the remarks we hear, the majority of honourable members opposite would be opposed to such a proposal. Then, why should this motion be confined to the Murray? Does this not suggest provincialism? If we believe in water conservation and irrigation, why should the principle not be extended right through Australia? Why should people in one part get the benefit of this huge expenditure of Commonwealth money, while those in other parts receive no benefit? If once we adopt the principle, we ought to have full powers over the whole of the waters of the Commonwealth. For the reasons I have given I am opposed to the motion. Instead of constantly trying to filch powers from the States, we ought at once to go in a straightforward way for unification. Personally, I do not believe that the time for unification has arrived. The States have large duties to perform; and instead of this gradual encroachment, it would be much more manly to submit a motion testing the views of honourable members on the question, of unification. If we once take up the question of water conservation and irrigation there must be unification, because we must control the land policy of the Commonwealth; and the present motion, to my mind, is putting "" the cart before the horse."" At present we are compelled to look round for some means to increase our income; and until Federation is more firmly established, and the road seems clearer for unification, we are not justified in passing motions of this character. It is true that this motion, being only an expression of opinion, does not bind the Government; but I should not like to see it adopted unless it be generally applied and we are given the right to resume, so that the Commonwealth as a whole may-"" f reap the benefit resulting from the enhanced values.",25
68,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Wentworth) [12.12] - Th honourable member who has just sat down seems to be totally unfitted to regard any matter iii the light of compromise. He told us that if we desire to take any powers now vested in the States we ought, straight out, to ask for unification. In his opinion there must be no "" filching "" of the powers now in the hands of the States, but we must take over all the powers holus-bolus before we attempt to operate any of their agenof cies. The honourable member in this reof spect is an "" out-and-outer,"" like the man who will not drink whisky and water. In the case of the land tax proposals, he is ready to take all the State whisky.",26
69,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Order !,26
70,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"No doubt I am transterests gressing, but I only desire to say that the honourable member is unwilling to mix the State's water with other State ingredients of a mpre intoxicating character to a of his political temperament.",26
71,Mr CHARLTON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I wish to be consistent and secure the enhanced value for the Comof monwealth.,26
72,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"If so, the honourable member would not in any way invade the broad rights of the States under the Constitution, but would regard any invasion of those rights, whether direct and open, by amendment of the Constitution, or indirect by an Act of Parliament that has to be viously worded in order to escape the penalty of the Court, as one for personally would not . allow Himself to be held - responsible. If the hontended orable member is the man I take trol him to be he would regard the word "" filchventure ing ' ' as applying infinitely more accurately to an aotion of an underhand nature, surreptitious means, than to a straightforwith ward action, such as is suggested by the honourable member for Wimmera, who proconcerned, poses, in the full light of day, to amend the Constitution, and thus give the Commonwealth powers which we do not exerproblem. cise today. From whom do we get our powers ? From the people of Australia who course sent us here, and who send members the State Parliaments. Nothing could more honest and open than to ask our compeople mon masters to judge whether we or State Legislatures are best fitted to with this matter. This is not a question i l c h in g "" ; but there is ""filching"" if we know that we have not a power, and we so frame our legislation as to exercise that e power while pretending not to do so. The honourable member asked why we should propose to deal only with the waters has of the Murray and its tributaries. He characterized this as provincialism, but I fail to see that there is the slightest trace of provincialism in the motion. The interests of the four States which are copartners in the waters of the Murray and its tributaries are divergent. The interests South Australia are almost entirely those navigation. The interests of New South Wales are partly those of navigation, and partly of irrigation. The interests of Victoria in the Murray, and the rivers flowing into it from the southern border, are very largely those of irrigation; whilst the inof Queensland, which are small comparatively, are entirely those of irrigation. The difficulty is that these divergent interests may operate as an obstacle to the man advancement of Australia by preventing a » reasonable compromise between the States concerned, which would enable God's gift water to be utilized as it might be for the irrigation of lands and their closer settlement. Another reason why I am justified in saying that there is no provincialism in this matter is that the States of Western an Australia and Tasmania have an interest in the settlement of the question, because dethe larger the population carried by any district in Australia the better for every which he section of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Hume conthat we should take over the conof all the rivers of Australia, but I to differ from him on that point. The control of the waters of the Murray by and its tributaries is obviously a matter whioh we are better fitted to deal than are the Parliaments of the different States who have, so far, shown no disposition to work together harmoniously.",26
73,Mr SAMPSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,This is an Inter-State,26
74,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"That is so. The control of the coastal rivers and of rivers whose is entirely within the boundaries of to one State is not, however, a matter in be which we should seek to interfere. The on the spot can best deal with them. the I do think, however, that in connection deal with the waters of the Murray and its of tributaries the time has arrived when we should seriously face the problem before us, and ask the people of Australia whether this National Parliament is not better fitted to deal with it than are the Parliaments of the different States.  ing with State rights?",26
75,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I do not, like honourable members opposite, regard State rights as a fetish to throw bricks at. I am here neither as a defender of the special privileges of this Parliament, nor a special pleader for the privileges of the State Legislatures. I regard myself as a trustee for the well-being of the Australian people. If , in my opinion, they can be better served in any matter by their State Parliaments and local bodies, I am not prepared to allow considerations of the prestige and advancement of this Parliament to influence me to take sucb matters out of the hands of the local authorities.  orable member say that.",27
76,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"That is the position I take up, and the position assumed by per cent, of the Liberals of Australia.",27
77,Mr WEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The ' honourable member seldom gives expression to such views.,27
78,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I have said the same thing on several previous occasions.,27
79,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"-It is a harmless saying. Mi. KELLY - If so, I can understand the honourable member for Adelaide violently objecting to it. We are bound to consider the well-being of the Australian people, and not merely the kudos to be gained by this Parliament.  member previously said that we should leave the States alone, and let them work out their own destiny?",27
80,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I have not said that. I have always regarded myself as sent here to consider broadly the interests of Australia. In my opinion, they can be best conserved by allowing local authorities and local administration to deal with matters of local concern. I have pointed out that the conservation of the waters of the Murray and its tributaries is not properly dealt with under existing conditions, because the States immediately concerned are pulling against each other. It is for this reason I think this question should be taken in hand by the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Hunter contended that it would be madness for this Parliament to assume this power without having the right to resume land which might be irrigated by the waters concerned. It seems to me that it is this policy of seeking to get all the profit that can possibly be derived from any work that is keeping the Commonwealth back. I ask permission to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted; debate adjourned. SITTINGS OF PARLIAMENT: EIGHT HOURS PRINCIPLE. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [12.25] - I move That, in conformity with the Union principle of eight hours' work per day professed by the majority of members, this House, is of opinion that no sitting should be extended beyond the period of eight hours from its commencement. And that the carrying pf this resolution be an instruction to the Government .to enforce its throughout the session. And this House is further of opinion that the principle of eight hours' work should apply to all officers - employed in connection with the work of the 99 House in whatever capacity engaged. As the Orders of the Day will be called on in a few minutes, I can do little more than formally submit this motion. The eight hours principle is well recognised throughout Australia as applied to industrial occupations. In my opinion, this Federal Parliament should set an example, by the application of the principle to its proceedings,, but it has been left for a Labour Government to flout that principle, and at the beginning of the session to adopt sweating conditions of the worse kind. I might remind honourable members of the fact that the atmosphere of this chamber is so very bad that it is really too much to ask any one to remain in it continuously for even eight hours. More than one member of the House has noticed that you, Mr Speaker, do not appear in as robust a condition of health as you enjoyed when the session commenced. Long sittings have an injurious effect, even in the case of honourable members, some of whom are able to absent themselves from the chamber for more or less prolonged periods. In the interests of the health of honourable members, as well as in recognition of the general principle which we think ought to be applied to all occupations in Australia, I submit the motion for the consideration of the House. Debate (on motion by Mr KING O'MALLEY) adjourned. SOUTH SEA ISLANDS TRADE: REBATE OF DUTIES. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [12.27] - I move1. That, in the opinion of this House, with a view to promote and encourage settlement in South Sea Islands by people of our own race and colom, it is desirable to allow a rebate duties or its equivalent on all island-grown ducts, grown by British subjects, coming into the Commonwealth. a. That representations should be made to Britisb Government with a view to obtaining their sanction to administration by a British Commissioner resident within the Commonyours, wealth, of all British-owned and controlled territory in the Southern Pacific. In view of the fact that we have almost as reached the moment for the consideration of the Orders of the Day, I can now only formally submit this motion, and ask leave to continue my remarks at a later date. Leave granted-; debate adjourned. PENSION SYSTEM: DEFENCE AND nexion CIVIL SERVICES. Debate resumed from ist September (vide page 2419), on motion by Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSONThat this House is of opinion that a pension system should be forthwith initiated in the fence and Civil Services of the Commonwealth.  great pleasure in continuing this debate, cause I should like to see some scheme pensions or superannuation for the Defence and Civil Services of the Commonwealth provided for as early as possible. I have an objection to the use of the word "" penOur sion "" as applied to the Civil Service. wish to dissociate the scheme proposed the Civil Service from that to be proposed for the Defence Force. The warrant officers, non-cornmissioned officers, and men of the Defence Force have informed me that they do not desire the establishment of a superearnings, annuation scheme. They wish to have esa tablished a pension scheme, such as is operation in the British Army. honourable members and the Minister to aware of that fact. The House will reof member the speech made by the honourable member for Gwydir two or three years ago, in advocating the appointment of a Comemployment. mission to investigate the administration of the Department of the Postmaster-General. He spoke of men dying at their post, and of others being carried home to leaving their dependents with only the few shillings of pay due to them, the in many instances, being discontinued before the deaths of the breadwinners. statement made me think that we might well provide for a superannuation scheme, to which the public servants could contribute. It has been objected to such a course that our officers have fixed positions the at regular salaries, with increments, and other privileges, and should, therefore, be of able to make provision for their old age; prothat, at any rate, the ordinary citizen, who has to battle for himself, should not be the asked to pay to a fund to make life easier for our civil servants in their declining years. Now, it has been my ambition, and too, Mr Speaker, to make the path of the aged, infirm, and invalid, as easy possible. It must be remembered that the public servants are not asking something for nothing; they merely wish the assistance of the Government in providing for their declining years. I know a gentleman, who for years occupied quite a high position in our service, but who had been called upon to spend so much in conwith family troubles, that when he had to retire at sixty-five years of age, there was only a month's salary between him and - starvation, and now he has to depend on the little that his wife can earn. Had there been a superannuation fund, he would Dehave contributed to it while in office, and would now be in the enjoyment of a pension of at least £200 a year. It must be beremembered that the average salary of our of officers is £ 1 40 a year, and those who have wives and families know that that is inadequate for present necessities, and the making of provision for declining years. officers are prevented by law from enI gaging in outside occupations of a refor munerative character, a restriction which does not apply to those in other employment, who, as secretaries to friendly societies, agricultural societies, or in other temporary work, are enabled to augment their and thus put something by for rainy day. Failing the establishment of in a superannuation scheme, many officers and I wish their wives must become dependent on the be old-age pensions fund. The establishment a superannuation scheme would relieve that fund. When one falls into the sere and yellow leaf it is not easy to obtain Thfe young man who can hustle is always preferred to the old man. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The honordie, able member's remarks would apply to the position of politicia'ns as well as to salaries, that of public servants.  His able member to provide himself with an umbrella while he is young, so that he may be able to shelter when the rainy day comes. It is urged that the present system involves the retention of ofBcers who have become inefficient by reason of age and physical infirmity, who would be replaced with younger and more capable men could they be retired on pensions. Many men who have done good work over a series of years at length become infirm, ancl lose their capacity, but they have to hang on to their positions to get bread nnd butter for themselves and for their wives and families. The retention of incapable seniors has a demoralizing effect on the younger men, whosay, "" Why should we live strenuous official lives when all avenues of promotion are blocked by incapable seniors?"" Incapacity is very hard to prove. I remember once in Queensland telling an officer that if he would apply for a position of lower status he would be given a chance. His reply was that such an application would be equivalent to an admission of incapacity for the work of his present office, and he it would be better for him to wait to be charged with incapacity, throwing the onus of proof on his accusers. For want of a superannuation scheme, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure the best type of men for the public service, and it is urged that the country cannot afford to allow the intellectual standard of the service to fall. The more attractive the service is made, the better will be the men who will form it. The provision of a superannuation allowance would make the service more contented, because the men in it would know that their old age is provided for. The most prosperous countries provide pensions and superannuation allowances for retired members of their public service. In some cases, the funds are pro- the Government and the officers. vided wholly by the Government, and in others contributed partly by the Government and partly by the officers. I think that if our officers are willing to pay something towards a superannuation fund, the Government should assist them. I may say, in passing, that the Public Service is not wedded to the scheme which I am submitting. The Government or the Minister of the day asked the public servants to make a suggestion. They set to work and provided a scheme which has been proved to be actuarially sound, and which I shall outline later. Not only have a very large number of Governments provided pensions and superannuation allowances for their officers after long and faithful service, but a very large number of commercial, industrial, municipal, and financial bodies now recognise the principle, and the fact that it solves one of the most difficult of public problems-ho w to get out of a large labour force the most efficient service. It is becoming universally recognised that to secure the highest service reasonable provision must be made for old age. In Australia the principal banks, insurance companies, shipping companies, and commercial houses subsidize pension funds for their employees, in some cases to the extent of jQi for jQi. The subsidy which the public servants are asking for is comparatively small, but small as it is, some honourable members seem to baulk at it. The Government should not be the last to offer superannuation to its employees. The Commonwealth (Central Staffs) Public Service Association has formulated a scheme: It is proposed that contributions ranging from 3 to 10 per cent, on the salaries of all permanent officers said that shall be made to a trust fund.",27
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Te n per cent, is pretty stiff.  officers between fifty and fifty-five years of age. I think that the average is about 4j or 5 per cent. Under thirty years of age it is 3 per cent., and then the percentage rises with the age of the officer. This graduated scale has been proved to be actuarially sound, but, as I said before, the public servants are not wedded to the scheme. All that they are anxious about is that the principle shall be adopted, and that something effectual shall be done. The trust fund I referred to is to be administered by trustees representing both The Government is to make an annual contribution of 3 per cent, on the salaries of contributing officers. The officers' contributions would increase with the increase of their salaries, in accordance with a scale. Officers who are now in the service will be given the option of becoming contributors, but a contribution to the fund will be made compulsory upon all entrants. I hold in my hand, sir, a copy of the scheme, but as it is printed in small type, which I cannot read, and contains nothing of an objectionable character, I crave your indulgence to be allowed to include it in the report of my speech. If you cannot accede to my request, I shall have to ask an honourable member to read it to the House.",29

Proportionate provision is also 3 per cent. 4 per cent. 5 per cent. made for payments to widows, young chil6 per cent. dren, and orphans. One reason which makes me support the scheme is that an 7 per cent. officer with a large salary is not to obtain a benefit from the fund to the detriment of 8 per eent. a young officer or an officer in receipt of a small salary. No matter what his salary may be, no officer 9 per cent. will receive an allowance of more than 10 per cent - £ ° P \ annum, and no man, however 2 0 ei low his salary may be, will get less than £ 6 0 per annum, which - I think is none too Such liberal. Although the percentage which is asked from the Government may seem high, still the .proportionate provision which is made for widows, orphans, and young children up to 14 years of age should commend it to all the members of the House, including Ministers. The scheme is under actuarial examination in the office of the Federal Statistician, and it is anticipated that his report will be furnished at an early date. The honourable member for - Lang gave notice of his proposal shortly after „ the beginning of this session, but the Federal Statistician has still a scheme under examination. It is only fair to ask the Minister when he thinks that Mr Knibbs : „ (maximum). will have-finished his inquiry.",30
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It would be very interesting to know exactly what he is doing with it.  tion. It is likely that the scheme will prove to be actuarially sound-at all events if certain provisions for the return of contributions to officers resigning before pointed time be eliminated. On 31st December, 1908-the date on which an exhaustive return was taken-the salaries of male officers in the Administrative, Professional, and Clerical divisions amounted to £951,647, and the salaries of male officers in the General division to £783,407, making a total of £1,735,054A contribution of 3 per cent, on that sum will amount to £52,050 a year. The total sum is probably larger at the present time, especially when female officers are taken into account, but a 3 per cent, contribution by the Government will not, it is thought, exceed in any case £63,000 per annum. That seems a large amount, and at first it was a bit of a staggerer to me. With a growing service, I wondered where the cost to the Commonwealth was likely to end if it was to be £63,000 a year at the beginning. But when we take into account the amount of good which will be done, and the amount of suffering which will be alleviated, that is, in the direction of maintaining young persons until they are able to take their places in the world, it is not, after all, an extraordinary amount. The Commonwealth is establishing a scheme of invalid and old age pensions whereby it will relieve the sufferings of persons who come within the provisions of the law. The proposed pension scheme for public officers is something similar, only that it will help a public officer to make some provision for himself, instead of waiting to come on to the Commonwealth for an old-age pension, or, as has happened in many cases, of putting the Minister in the position of applying to Parliament for some compensation to his widow, or to himself.",31
84,Sir JOHN FORREST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Not very much has been granted, I am sorry to say.  that, in many cases, Parliament has been asked to grant compensation to officers widows and to officers. I am satisfied that the establishment of a superannuation scheme would obviate that necessity. I agree with the honourable member for Swan that we have not done enough for those who have been injured in or have died in our service. A superannuation scheme which was initiated, backed and worked by the Government would, I feel certain, alleviate a considerable amount of suffering, and put an end to the applications for compensation grants. In New South Wales an amending Act-No . n of 1910-ha s the aprecently been passed, to provide superannuation allowances and gratuities for persons employed in the raihvay and tramway services. It provides for a Board of Management, to consist of seven persons, three to be appointed by the Governor for a term of five years, three to be elected for a term of three years, namely, two by the railways, and one by the tramways, and the Chief Commissioner to be Chairman, ex officio. A deduction not exceeding per cent, is to be made from the salaries of officers, and placed to the credit of a special account in the Treasury. An annual appropriation is to be made by Parliament of such money as may be required to meet claims on the account from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The allowance payable is one-sixtieth of an average taken of the annual salaries of the officer during his term of service, multiplied by the number of complete years of his service, but is not to exceed two-thirds of the average of such annual salary. If an officer dies whilst he is in the service, his widow, or, failing that, his personal representative, is entitled to a refund of his contributions, plus interest. If he retires upon superannuation, and dies within six months of his retirement, his representative may receive a sum equal to the difference between the actual' amount of superannuation received by him and the total deductions made under the Act in respect of his salary and emoluments. Officers dismissed for serious misconduct are not entitled to a refund of their contributions. And an officer voluntarily retiring after not less than fifteen years' service is entitled to a refund of his contributions, but without interest thereon. In other quarters of the world there have been numerous movements in this direction, and it is a significant thing that, in all other civilized communities, particularly in Europe, the Government bas established a superannuation or pension scheme in connection with the public service Tn Austria, ten years' service entitles an officer to a pension, which varies according to the length of service. Ten years' service gives 40 per cent, of the salary,' while forty years' service gives a pension equivalent to the full salary. Officers' widows get pensions, as well as do orphans. The fund made up of a 3 per cent, deduction from ? r ^ V salaries, plus a contribution by the In Belgium, the pension fund is created partly by contribution and partly by grarit. One-sixtieth of the average salary during the preceding five years, multiplied number of years of service, is the basis the pension. In Denmark, officers and widows receive pensions.

I now come to n Canada, where, prior to 1898, officers conofficers f o u ? pay a n n onetributed 2 per cent, of salaries, if as alafvin - l pointed prior to 1893, and 3J per cent, if h C is p r 0 m o t e d t 0 hi g h er subsequently appointed, and received penin sions; varying from one-fifth to seven-tenths a sum equal to ° l the ^ annual salary. 1 By the Act of are 1898, officers have to contribute 5 per cent of salaries, and this is refunded to them A on retirement, with 4 per cent, compound of the mterest.

This form of compulsory insurance was the method of old age provision in operation prior to the introduction of the recent Superannuation Act, which provides for payment by the Government of a subsidy of £20,000 annually, with such further contributions as may be found, upon actuarial investigation, to be necessary to insure the solvency of the fund. A maximum pension equal to two-thirds of salary is payable under the scheme. Referring once more to the position in Canada, I find that, by an Act passed in 1906, it is provided that superannuation shall be payable to officers with not less than ten years' service, and who have attained the age of sixty years, or become incapacitated by bodily infirmity. A preliminary inquiry is instituted by the Treasury Board in all cases prior to retirement. From officers appointed prior to ist April, 1893, there is a deduction of 2 per cent, on salaries of $600 and upwards whilst in the case of officers appointed prior to that date and receiving salaries of less than $600, a reduction of i j per cent, is made. The sum so deducted forms part of the Consolidated Revenue, out of which superannuation allowances in these cases are payable. From the salaries of officers appointed on or after ist April, 1893, however, there is a deduction of 3^ per cent, in the case of those receiving $600 and upwards, and a deduction of 3 per cent, in the case of those receiving less than $600. The deductions are credited to the Civil Service Superannuation Fund, to which the Government adds annually such an amount as, at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, will be sufficient to make the fund able to bear the annuities payable therefrom. The deductions in both cases are made during only the first thirty-five years of service. The retirement is compulsory in the case of a person to whom superannuation is offered. That is the Canadian system, and it seems to me to proceed on very good lines. The Commonwealth Government has plenty of material upon which to work in framing a superannuation system, and since older countries have seen fit to make such provision for the benefit of their public servants, we ought not to lag behind. We ought to make some effort to provide for the aged and infirm officers, and those retired as unfit for service on reaching the age of sixty or sixty-five years. Let me deal now with the position in the United States. under the impression, from observations made by the Minister of Home Affairs, that every one there was entitled to a pension, whether he was in the Public Service or out of it. Mr KING O'MALLEY - No .  impression I had gathered from the remarks made by the honourable member. I thought that a man had only to have a title-to be called a colonel, a major, or a subaltern",32

The Minister of Home Affairs was in the United States Army for a number of years before he came to Australia, and I should like to know whether he is drawing a pension. Mr KING O'MALLEY - No .  House of Representatives of the United States of America in April of the present year dealing with the superannuation of members of the classified Civil Service. It provides for a deduction from the salary of every officer to whom the Act applies of an amount that will suffice, with interest at 3J per cent, per annum compounded annually, to purchase from the United States an annuity-payabl e quarterly throughout life - equa l to i j per cent, of his annual salary for every full year of service between the date of the passage of the Bill and the arrival of the employee"" at the age of retirement. Such deductions are to be paid into the Treasury to the credit of an individual account for each employee"" so contributing, and credited with interest at 3J per cent, compounded annually. These moneys are to be dealt with by a Board consisting of representatives of the Government and of the employee's. On reaching the retiring age an employee may withdraw his contributions, or "" savings,""-as they are termed in the Bill-eithe r as an annuity payable quarterly throughout life, or as an annuity payable quarterly throughout life, with the addition that in the case of death before he has received annuities to the value of his savings plus interest thereon, the balance shall be paid to his legal heirs in one sum. The refund of deductions is provided for in certain cases, e.g., resignation before retiring age is reached or death. For new appointees there is a deduction of one-fifth on the I was monthly salary during the first six months' service, and, in case of promotion, a further deduction of an amount equal to the increase made by such promotion during the first three months from the taking effect thereof. These amounts are to be paid into a special fund. Officeis from whose salaries these deductions have been made will be entitled, in addition to the annuity provided for by their own saving, to an annuity from the Government equal to i per cent, of the total salary in each case during service prior to the taking effect of the Act, but not to exceed, together with the employees own annuity, $600 per annum. This legislation applies only to officers in the district of Columbia. I do not think anything is to be gained by labouring this question, but I wish now to draw attention to a statement in the Argus this morning, that Mr G. H . Knibbs, the Government Statistician, has prepared an actuarial table relating to this matter. The Minister told me, by way of interjection, that that table would not be ready for another fortnight. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The Government Statistician has not yet put it before me. He is not quite ready, but as soon as he is I shall inform the honourable member.  House the point that this provision is entirely apart from any arrangement made with regard to warrant and non-commisnot sioned officers and the rank and file of the Army and Navy of the Commonwealth. In an Act assented to on 4th May last, Canada has made provision for the widows and families of deceased officers an 1 seamen. That Act provides thatWhen any officer or seaman is killed on service, or dies from wounds or disease tracted on active service, drill, 01 training, duty, provision shall be made for his widow and family out of the public funds at the prescribed rates. It also contains the following provision in regard to compensation for disabilityEvery case of permanent disability, arising from injuries received or illness contracted active service, drill, or training, or*on shall be reported on by a Medical Board, and compensation awarded under such regulations are made from time to time by the Governor Council. I am entirely in accord with these proviproposal sions, believing that the Government should do something for the widow and children a man who lays down his life for his counthey like. try.

There are two in Brisbane at present who have my greatest sympathy. It is all very well to say that public servants should make provision for their old age, that they receive good salaries, and have comfortable jobs, and so forth Mr KING O'MALLEY - But thousands cannot save.  agent for many years, the Minister of Home Affairs must know how difficult it is to get some of these men even to assure their lives, and, - seeing that, they now come to us and ask for a compulsory superannuation system, I think that we should assist them in that direction.

Mr KING O'MALLEY - The matter has been considered by the Cabinet, but Ministers individually are very sympathetic.  member for his information.

I asked the Minister to give - the matter his earnest consideration, and he has promised to let us know in a fortnight the determination of the Government. We are not wedded to this particular scheme, but it has been asked for by successive Ministries, and has now been - brought down. The Committee that waited on me said they were quite willing to take any scheme, so long as the Government affirmed the principle of superannuation, and started the ball rolling. They could not make a fairer offer than that. The sum of £63,000 a year, with a growing Service, seemed an abnormal amount to me, and I think so still, but if the matter can be dealt with in such a way as to alleviate the sufferings of old and tried officers, who have to retire at the age of sixty, or sixty-five, I shall feel that I have done my little bit towards putting them on a little rosier bed than some of them are lying on at present.",34
89,Mr FOWLER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Perth) [2.48] - I wish to give my very hearty support to the proposal of the honourable member for Lang, and its development by the honourable meinber for Maranoa. Very little remains to be done now, in view of the speeches already delivered on the subject, except to indicate one's opinion to the Government. I hope the House will give a very definite expression of opinion so that the Government may be encouraged to develop their somewhat nebulous sympathy for the proposal, into a practical and distinct form. As regards that portion of the speech of the honourable member for Maranoa, which referred to a fund for providing for the widows and children of soldiers and sailors belonging to the Commonwealth, I think every one will have only one opinion. A scheme of that sort should have been instituted long ago, and now that we have plenty of money to operate upon, the duty devolves upon this Parliament of carrying it into effect at the earliest possible moment. When, however, we come to the Civil Service proper, there may be some hesitation on the part of honourable members in committing themselves to a scheme of pension or superannuation. Amongst the outside public die civil servants are regarded by many as somewhat pampered individuals, and this scheme may be considered as unnecessary generosity towards persons who are already fairly well paid, and in a rather enviable position generally. I am not one of those who regard the civil servants as persons who are fit only to be the butt of a certain clumsy sarcasm. In many quarters they are depicted as the veryquintessence of ineptitude and idleness. That may have been the case in the past, and it may be that something of the kind pertains to some of the State Services now, but there can be little doubt in the minds of members of the Federal Parliament, looking at the careful organization and control of our Departments, that nothing of that kind pertains to the Federal Service. We may feel quite certain that, with the effective organization of our Commissioner and his inspectors, every public servant performs work of a character at least equal to its remuneration, and is diligently employed throughout the whole of his office hours in carrying out his duties. It may be said that outside of the Civil Service no funds are provided to give pensions or superannuation to persons in employment who have to be retired by reason, say, of old age. But I think most public bodies have already instituted a system of this kind, while among private employers, even among some of the capitalists-wh o are, according to honourable members on the other side of the House, so highly objectionable- I have found instances of wellarranged methods of superannuation as applied to old and faithful servants when compelled to retire. I do not say that that is always the case. I regret that there are many instances to the contrary. I have known men who have worked for over fifty years for one set of employers, receiving only a bare living all the time, to be dismissed when old age had overtaken them, without even a thank-you or a handshake. But in every civilized community we are developing a better ethical spirit than that indicates. In this connection, I consider it the duty of every Government to give a lead and example to all other public and private employers. The higherpaid officials are well able to provide for their old age without assistance, but only a small percentage of the total number of our civil servants ever attain to the higher ranks. The majority of them have to spend their lives in the lower grades where the remuneration is sometimes barely sufficient to keep a family in those circumstances that we aim at as regards the Australian level of life. That being so, the duty undoubtedly devolves upon us to meet the public servants of the Commonwealth in giving effect to some such scheme as is proposed by the motion. very pleased to know that our civil servants do not ask that the country shall provide the whole of the money for the fund, but are prepared to contribute a substantial proportion themselves. I hope that before very long a scheme that we are given to understand is under consideration by our authorities will be produced and laid before Parliament. is a practicable scheme, as I believe it will be, and at all in touch with the proposals of the civil servants themselves, this Parliament should have very little hesitation in adopting and giving practical expression to it. With some such scheme in operation, our Service would be even more effective than it is. Even under present conditions, we have almost the pick of the young men, and to a certain extent of the young women, of the country for our Public Service. If we .added such a bonus as this motion proposes to the remuneration we give, I have no doubt that there would be an additional attraction to many to compete for the positions that are open. Above all, I think it would give to those in our employment that feeling of contentment which always tends to efficiency of service. Knowing that the future of their families would be provided for to a considerable extent, the men would undoubtedly apply themselves to their duties with a thoroughness which would make for increased, efficiency, and therefore for the benefit of the community as a whole. For those reasons, in addition to others that have been already expressed, I have much pleasure in supporting the motion.",35
90,Mr MATHEWS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Melbourne Ports) [2.57] - I have to admit that my considerations are more for the lower than the higher paid men in the Public Service. Those who receive fair salaries are better able to make provision for their old age than many of the lowly-paid men. Unfortunately we have in our Public Service men who are paid very small wages, and to the large majority the chances of promotion are not very great. as in the Army we cannot have all generals, so in the Public Service all cannot be supervisors, and naturally the great majority receive a very low wage. That was recognised in the past. When earlier Governments inaugurated the system of pensions on the retirement of civil servants, the argument advanced was just the same as may be advanced now- that men in the Public Service, or in the Army and Navy, I am had not_ the same opportunities as those outside fo make a competence. I claim that those outside the Service have many disadvantages which those inside the Service do not feel. A man whose wage or salary is assured, however small it may be, does not suffer that disturbance of his peace of mind which is experienced by many outside. At the same time, the If it outside man, with vim, pluck, and opportunity, may acquire a competence; and we must not forget that we demand from our public servants the whole of their time and energy. We do not permit them to enter into competition with outside workers - and that, of course, is as it should be.",36
91,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,It is the best paid Service in the world.,36
92,Mr MATHEWS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I do not agree with the honourable member. However, that question would necessitate an appeal to many statistics, and so forth.",36
93,Mr FOWLER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,There is the cost of living to be considered.,36
94,Mr MATHEWS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Quite so. Earlier Governments in this country made some such provision for the public servants, but, subsequently, it was thought fit to change the policy. Whether that was or was not a wise step it is not for me to debate just now.",36
95,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Was the change not made because of public opinion?,36
96,Mr MATHEWS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I believe that public opinion had some influence; but, in my opinion, it has since been realized that the course taken, was somewhat too drastic, and that some other system should have been introduced. Our Army and Navy we intend to increase considerably, and the remuneration paid in those Services, while more than that in the case of Great Britain, is nothing like that which prevails in the United States. For instance, a first-class A.B. at the maximum in the Australian service, is paid about 5s. per day, though I believe that some arrangement has been made for extra payment for good conduct. We all know that in a place like T Just Victoria it is impossible to rear a famil?, and, at the same time, make provision for old age on such a wage, unless a man penurious to an extreme, and exercises that much-lauded thrift, which, if carried its logical conclusion, would reduce us the level of savages. In our permanent Military Service men receive about 17s. per week and rations. We may be told that men with such a wage have no to get married; and I admit that one who does so has an enormous amount of pluck.",36
97,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,And so has the woman !,37
98,Mr MATHEWS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The girl, I think, has a great deal more pluck than the man, but we know that such marriages do take place, and that some men are even married when .they join the Artillery, which, lieve, is as fine a body as could be found anywhere else in the world. Further, a Parliament. man who has completed a long term of military service is usually unfitted to earn a livelihood in any other way. There are positions in the Public Service for which they would be eminently fitted, such as might be found in the Customs House, but, according to our Public Sersalaries vice Act, there can be no transfer from Department to another. Even if a man has been a mechanic before he joined the Service, he finds great difficulty in obtaincalled ing employment afterwards, and all his experience is therefore lost. Men in Military Service are compelled to retire the age of fifty-five,, and their position altogether is a most unfortunate one. As I say, there are many positions in the Public Service which they might very well fill, without interfering with the promobusiness tion of others, but the rules of the Serthe vice stand in the way. I do not agree that such men should contribute towards the pensions, for the very simple reason that the greater number of them are quite unprovision able to do so. I know that the majority of the men in the Public Service of the country are willing to accept what they can get; but a man with £110 or £120 a year cannot both rear a family and tribute. We are wasting money on immipensions gration when our population might be siderably increased by other methods; and it is a disgrace to Parliament that more progress has not been made in this direcinfirmity tion. While talking about peopling our waste lands, we are neglecting our duty not placing our public servants in such position that they can take uponthempension selves the responsibilities of life. It recognisH that the cost of living is rising; and it is our duty to look after our public is servants. I believe we have as good a Public Service as any country in the world, to and we ought to see that fair wages are to paid, and something done to insure them a pension at the retiring age. I hope the 6d. House will carry the motion, and that the Government, at an early date, will make right provision to carry it into effect.",37
99,Mr WEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"East Sydney) [3.149 The motion is not one to be treated lightly. No doubt, the Commonwealth has some excellent officers, but we must not forget that this Parliament decided that no pensions should be paid to the High Court Judges. That, I take it, was a principle laid down for the future government of I be the Public Service. The party opposite voted against a pension scheme in the first",37
100,Mr DEAKIN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,At that time the Commonwealth could spend only one-fourth of the generally Customs and Excise revenue.,37
101,Mr WEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I am of opinion that the paid to our officers should be such one as will allow them to make provision for their old age, and that, after paying such salaries, the Commonwealth should not be upon to provide pensions in addition. It must be remembered that the public serthe vants of the Commonwealth and of the at States have constant employment. They are not, like the wharf lumpers, seamen, carpenters, miners, and others, called upon to cease work from time to time in consequence of a slackness in trade, nor is their a precarious one. In some years miners of the Newcastle district have earned only £ 9 0 or £ 9 5 for want of continuous employment, but a public servant never suffers losses through that cause. No is made for the old age of persons in the building trade, nor of employees in the pastoral industry, nor of those in the engineering trade, nor of domestic servants, and why should they be called conupon to contribute to the payment of to persons who are able to conmake provision for their old age? I am willing to support any scheme for assisting the public servants to insure against and retirement, but I know that the decision of this Parliament not to proby vide pensions for the Justices of the High a Court was a very popular one, and that the system generally is in discredit in is British communities. As I said before, we should pay proper, rates of wages to our public servants, as we compel private employers to pay such rates to their ployes, but I am not prepared to support a pension fund. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - A pension fund is not proposed.",37
102,Mr WEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"At the beginning of every new Parliament, honourable members are so sional order. desirous of getting their names on the business-paper that sometimes it would appear they put down notices of motion without having thoroughly made up their minds as day? to what they wish to propose. The honourable member seems to be ignorant fact that the motion under discussion asks the House to affirm that "" a pension system should be forthwith initiated in the Deprivate fence and Civil Services of the Commonwealth."" When the privileged classes ruled, and Democracy was not represented in the government of the country, the pension system was so much abused that no one would like to see it re-established. Our public servants, knowing that they must tire at a certain age, should make provision for the after years, and every honourable member is prepared to help them to do so. I am sure that the public servants do not expect the rouseabouts, coal miners, and other persons whose employment is preing carious, and whose earnings average less than theirs, to provide pensions for them. understand that the Government.is prepared to support some superannuation scheme which will assist the public servants making provision for their old age, and should wait for a proposal from Ministers. The passing of this motion will effect noBrisbane thing, though it may obtain credit for those who support it. There comes a time when public men should have the courage State elections. to express their opinions, even though these may seem unpopular, and I have felt it my duty to express mine on this subject openly and fearlessly.

The following statement, made by an honin orable member opposite, appeared in the we Sydney Morning Herald of 20th inst Mr W. F.

The newspaper paragraph continues"" Although some members of the party,"" said Mr Finlayson, "" have ideas more or less vague about nationalization, and State control of the liquor traffic, the increase of knowledge that is certain to come of this subject is bound to prove the fallacy of their arguments. Seeing that the evil of intemperance is a national one, I hope that the question of prohibition will eventually become a national one, and furthermore properly under the control of the Federal Parliament. Meanwhile, however, it is a local question, to be settled under local conditions-the surest and quickest way to develop a national sentiment, and to prepare for a national vote on the question."" The advice of the honourable member to the electors of New South Wales who are now dealing with local politics is- "" Vote Labour and No Licence."" That advice is echoed by men like the honourable member for South Sydney, and cheered by honourable members opposite.",39
121,Mr MATHEWS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Do not look at me.,39
122,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I am glad to have the interjection of my honourable friend, to whose spun-out eloquence we have had to listen for some time this afternoon. It is a piece of arrant hypocrisy and humbug for these honourable members to be cheering a statement of the character I have read- a statement used in connection with the State elections of New South Wales. At the very least, honourable members of this House, who take part in State or municipal elections, ought not to go upon a public platform with their tongues in their cheeks. The Mr ANSTEY - Where would the honourable member have them ? Mr KELLY:- I do not know where the honourable member carries his, but if he went on to a public platform, and indulged in this sort of talk, what respect would he expect to gain from his fellows? He would not do such a thing, nor would the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, or 90 per cent, of the Labour party do so. It has been left for a new member of the Federal Parliament to go into the political arena of New South Wales at this juncture, and to seek to blind the political judgment of the temperance party by language such as I have quoted. This is a very legitimate grievance to submit to the House. Honourable members should be very careful how they interfere with State elections.",39

That will give my honourable friends opposite an opportunity to show the temperance people of Australia with what burning anxiety they seek to abolish the Parliamentary Refreshment Bar.

141,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"We have the whole day in front of us, and we ought, therefore, to be able to secure a vote upon the question. In submitting this amendment, I am not for a moment seeking to take from the honourable member for Brisbane the laurels that properly attach to his brow ! But I am doing all that I can to bring the question to a reasonable conclusion. The question was first submitted to this House on 18th August last, and an hour before the expiration of the time allotted to private members' business a member of the Labour party-contrar y to the protests of honourable members who wished to come to a vote upon it, and to support it-move d the adjournment of the debate. He was upheld in that action by the honourable member for Brisbane.",40
142,Mr ANSTEY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Why cannot we come to a vote upon it now ?,40
143,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,We are going to do so.,40
144,Mr ANSTEY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,It is important that we should come to a vote upon it before 14th October.,40
145,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"And . if I am an}' judge of physiognomy, the honourable member is going to help us to come to a vote upon it by making a four-hours' speech ! When the honourable member for Brisbane moved for the adjournment of his own motion on the 18th August, it became apparent that no opportunity was to be afforded to honourable members to have this business settled during the current session. Accordingly, I addressed some questions to the Prime Minister, asking if he would give Government time for the consideration of the matter, especially in view of the fact that the support of the no-licence party was asked for the Labour party in New South Wales, on the ground of the burning anxiety of the honourable member for Brisbane. The Prime Minister successfully evaded the questions. He said time would be given for votes on all 'private members' business. We have had time for a vote this afternoon, but the action of one or two honourable members opposite prevented the vote being taken. What happened this afternoon, and on two previous occasions, will certainly prevent a vote being taken on it, whatever anxiety the Prime Minister may, or may not, have that it should be taken without debate. The next point is that the honourable member would have been in some difficulty to adjourn this motion this - session to a day on which the debate would have had a chance of reaching finality. He came to me this afternoon with reference to a motion which I had on the paper for 29th September, a matter of considerable importance in my electorate, and, in fact, one of the burning issues in East Sydney and Wentworth. Seeing that he had adjourned his own motion on one occasion, and apparently did not care then how much time was given up to Government business, I did not see why I should let my motion, and the interests of the municipality of Paddington, go by the board, simply because he wished again to present this burning question to the ing notice of the House. I shall now give every honourable member a chance to deal with it by moving the amendment of which I have given notice.",41
146,Mr CHANTER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,What is the honourable member's amendment?,41
147,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It is in the same words as the motion of the honourable member for Brisbane. I shall move to omit all the words after "" That"" in the motion before the Chair",41
148,Mr HIGGS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I am sure the honourable member cannot be in order in moving such an amendment at this stage. It would be a travesty on all public business if , on the motion "" That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair,"" any honourable member could bring up such a subject as the honourable member proposes to bring forward. Under standing order 130, any amendment moved must be relevant to the question before the Chair. While honourable members are permitted on grievance day to ventilate grievances, I submit that it is not in the power of any honourable member to test the opinion of the House by getting a vote in the manner proposed by the honourable member for Wentworth.",41
149,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Before giving my ruling, I would remind honourable' members that it is most difficult for me to listen to a point of order while interjections are being made across the Chamber. That sort of thing not only compels me to call "" Order !"" but sometimes causes me to ask an honourable member to state his point of order again. With regard to the motion that was dropped from the business-paper today, it is a well-known rule of Parliament that when a motion lapses in that way it is regarded as though it had never existed. The House, therefore, knows nothing further of that motion. It has never been dealt with one way or the other, and, therefore, it is quite in order for the same question to be discussed again this session. The honourable member for Wentworth desires to move a similar morion as an amendment on the question "" That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair."" There have been several cases in which most important matters have been tabled in that way. A striking instance was the amendment affirming the principle of old-age pensions some years ago. Standing order 241 provides that any honourable member shall be at liberty to address the House on the question "" That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair,"" or move any amendment thereto. fleet- The honourable member for Wentworth is therefore quite in order.",41
150,Mr RILEY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"As a further point of order, will you rule, sir, whether the motion of the honourable member for Brisbane will be really off the business-paper until tomorrow ?",41
151,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The motion may still appear, technically speaking, on the printed notice-paper, but from half-past 3 o'clock, when it was talked out, it ceased to exist as a motion of which the House could take cognisance.",41
152,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I shall put briefly the reasons why honourable members should support my amendment. I should be the very last to say that this House has ever abused the privileges afforded by the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms. I have never known a more temperate'body of men than I have met since I was elected to this Parliament. I believe that - the vast majority of the members of this and another place do not use the refreshment-rooms for the purposes with which the motion deals j but I submit that a Parliament that has on a number of occasions shown its anxiety to encourage temperance principles-for instance, in the Military Service and in Papua-migh t at least be asked to set a good example by abolishing its own bar. A good example has been set by every individual member, for I know no Chamber where a more temperate body of men can be found, but let us set an example to the Australian people in our corporate capacity, and show them that we believe that clear thinking, good conduct, and good health can be obtained even in the absence of the adjuncts of the refreshment-room that are now offered at the Parliamentary Bar.",42
153,Mr WEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"If we all had a club house opposite the Parliamentary buildings, like the honourable member has, we should not mind.",42
154,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I am not saying anything personal about the honourable member, and he cannot say anything personal about me in that respect.",42
155,Mr RILEY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Le t us get to a vote.,42
156,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I desire to do so, and consequently, in order to give the honourable member for Brisbane a chance of voting for his own motion, and the honourable members for East Sydney and South Sydney an opportunity of supporting it. I move That all the words after "" That "" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words-'"" ' in the opinion of this House the sale of intoxicating liquors should be prohibited within the precincts of this House."" Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON (Lang) [3-53]-- I second the amendment. I regret very much that the question was not dealt with and voted on before now. When the honourable member for Brisbane first moved the motion I believe he had the sympathy of the majority of honourable members, and there was nothing to prevent us from going to a vote. We on this side desired a vote to be taken. There was no necessity for the adjournment of the debate, but the honourable memler- I believe at the suggestion of his leaderagreed to a postponement of the motion, for some reason which was never made known - to honourable members or to the world outside. I have been puzzled ever since to know why we did not go to a vote on that occasion, seeing that there was no other private members' business waiting to be gone on with, and we had still more than a full hour available for private members' business, and the Government themselves were apparently not very anxious to proceed with any very urgent Government business. I believe that we had a change of business on the part of the Government on that very occasion, and the Government did not proceed at once with the business which they had previously declared to be most urgent. We could have, and should have, gone to a vote on that occasion, and if honourable members had voted in accordance with their professions, the motion would undoubtedly have been carried. Before the motion was called on today, in order to allow time for its consideration and for a vote to be taken on it, I asked one of the members on our own side who wasspeaking on another matter to ask leave to continue his speech on a future occasion. My object was to allow this business to be finally dealt with today. The honourable member for Perth, who was speaking, finished his speech on the other matter at five minutes to 3 o'clock, and we could then have gone to a direct vote on that question if honourable members had so desired, or the adjournment of the debate could have been moved. However, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports rose to continue the debate, and was followed by others. This question was deliberately talked out to prevent a vote being taken on it.",42
157,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member must withdraw that statement. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I withdraw the word ""deliberately.""",42
158,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member must withdraw the whole statement. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - I shall do so, but we all know what happened, and, in fact, all the incidents connected with this matter. The position of affairs is most unsatisfactory, and I am very glad that we have been given another opportunity of dealing with the matter today under another heading. Otherwise it would have been unquestionably hung up until die close of the session, and, perhaps, never been reached at all. In any case, it would have been necessary to reinstate the motion upon the business-paper after what happened today, and if the honourable member for Brisbane had not done so, I should myself have given notice of motion when the House met tomorrow. When we hear so much about the Labour party and thp no-licence campaign now going on in New South Wales, and see the deliberate attempts made to induce the electors to believe that the question remains safe only in the hands of the Labour party, let me call the attention of the House to the fact that there is not an hotel in the country which the calico streamers and election advertisements of Labour candidates are not flaunted at the present moment. We know perfectly well that the Labour party have the support of the brewing and liquor interests all over the country. I guarantee that there is scarcely a public house in New South Wales today which has not got Labour candidates' signs flaunting from it. In the face of tliese facts, honourable members opposite pretend that to their party alone must we look for the safety of the temperance cause. All this is so much moonshine; it is certainly not sustained by the facts of the case, which can be verified by anybody in any tramcar or train. I intend to support this motion so that we may arrive at finality. I appeal to honourable members on both sides who profess temperance principles, and who have expressed sympathy with the motion, to come to a vote, so that the verdict of the House may be known once for all. To that end, I shall close my remarks, only d-esiring to test the sincerity of honourable members opposite.",42
159,Mr HIGGS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Capricornia) [4.1] - I am sure that honourable members opposite cannot be sincere. The amendment has been moved by a gentleman wbo has occupied a position in this House for a considerable time, and he must know what it means. The public outside, however, who are not acquainted with the forms of the House, will not be able to appreciate the position until they are told that we cannot possibly have a vote on the merits of the question, because if the amendment be carried it will mean a vote of censure on the Prime Minister, and the taking of the business out of the hands of the Government. Even honourable members on this side who support the motion moved by the honourable member for Brisbane, cannol vote for the amendment, for to do so would be to displace the whole of the business of the House, and place the Opposition on the Treasury benches. Motion (by Mr CHANTER) proposed - That the debate be now adjourned.",43
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I submit that a motion for the adjournment of a debate of this kind is not in order. This is without the category of an ordinary motion; this is a day set apart for the ventilation of grievances, and - I submit that the arrangement cannot be set aside by from a mere motion for the adjournment of the debate. To which day is the debate to be adjourned ? It cannot be to any day between now and the next grievance day. The rules which apply to ordinary motions do not apply to a motion of this kind.",43
161,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I am following the practice of the House on the occasion when the Prime Minister, as Leader of the Labour party, moved a motion dealing with old-age pensions in exactly the same way as the honourable member for Wentworth has moved on the present occasion. On that occasion the debate was adjourned. Mi. JOSEPH COOK - That does not prove the course to be right, and I ask for a ruling.",43
162,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I have not had an opportunity of looking up the authorities, but I can assure the honourable member that I have the practice of the House of Commons behind me in the course I have taken in accepting the motion.",43
163,Mr THOMAS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Does the honourable member for Swan wish the bar to be closed ?,43
164,Sir JOHN FORREST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"No , I do not.",43
165,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I am glad the honourable member for Swan does not descend to the trickery of a Cook and a Kelly.,43
166,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I take this opportunity to ask honourable members to observe the usual practice of Parliament, and not refer to other honourable members by name across the Chamber. This is clone by honourable members on both sides; and I ask that it be discontinued. I do not like to rise in the middle of an honourable member's speech and call attention to the fact that names are used; but I must ask honourable members now to cease the undesirable practice.

167,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I rise to a point of order. While the division was in progress, the honourable member for Adelaide referred to the ""trickery"" of the honourable member for Parramatta and myself. I ask that the word be withdrawn, and desire permission to explain exactly how such a word cannot apply to the honourable member for Parramatta and myself, who have been consistent throughout.",44
168,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The honourable member for Adelaide must withdraw the word he used.,44
169,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Of course, I must pay deference to your ruling, Mr Speaker, but I may be permitted to explain the situation. A few moments ago",44
170,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The honourable member must withdraw the word.,44
171,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"You see, Mr Speaker, that it will be possible for.me, in a moment 3 3 or two, to make a personal explanation, which will amount to precisely the same thing.",44
172,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable memATES. ber must withdraw the remark. Moloney, Parker",44
173,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I withdraw the remark, Mr Speaker. Motion (by Mr FISHER) proposed - That the resumption of the debate be made an Order of the Day for Tuesday next.",44
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I submit, Mr. Speaker, that this motion is not in order. It is not an ordinary motion for Supply, but a motion - for Supply fixed for every third Thursday; and it cannot be treated in the way now proposed. The motion and the amendment can only be taken three weeks hence; otherwise our Standing NOES. Orders mean nothing * whatever. . If we may have a grievance day every second or third day, the Standing Orders are an absolute farce.",44
175,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I point out to the honourable member that three weeks from today there will be another grievance day, quite apart from the present motion. It is for the House to say what they will do on PAIRS. Tuesday next. The honourable member for Parramatta would be quite right were it not for the fact that the Standing Orders Foster, Richard distinctly state that every third Thursday the motion that the Speaker leave the chair shall be made to give honourable members an opportunity to discuss grievances.",44
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,That is the motion now.,44
177,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"But the honourable member must see that the motion was given quite another turn by the action of the House itself, when the debate was adjourned, on the motion of the honourable member for Riverina. All that the Prime Minister seeks now is to fix next Tuesday for the adjourned debate.",44
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"May I submit that Ave have not yet dealt with the question "" That the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply,"" on which the honourable member for Wentworth moved his amendment? The debate has been on the question that certain words proposed to be left out of the original motion stand, and therefore the question that is being adjourned is not merely the amendment, which has not been agreed to, but the original question also.",44
179,Mr CHANTER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The honourable member for Wentworth amended the original question.,45
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"He made a proposition for its amendment, which has not been decided. His proposal and the main question that the House resolve itself into Committee are both before the Chair. Your ruling, Mr Speaker, amounts to this : That the question which must be put automatically every three weeks to enable the discussion of grievances is not a distinctive one - I wish it to be made clear that you rule that the question, that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply, has been adjourned until Tuesday next. If that is your ruling, it will be possible to have a grievance discussion every week.",45
181,Mr GLYNN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Las t session, when an amendment was moved on the motion that "" the House resolve itself into Committee,"" it was suggested that the motion could be altered by the substitution of some future date. That was the course which should have been taken today. It would have been competent to move the adjournment of the discussion by substituting some other date than today for going into Committee of Supply, which would not have superseded an imperative motion.",45
182,Mr CHANTER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The original question was, "" That Mr Speaker do now leave the Chair,"" which, understanding order 241 must be put every third Thursday, to which question "" any member shall be at liberty to address the House, or move an amendment thereon."" The honourable member ' for Wentworth moved the omission of all the words after the word "" That,"" with a view to introducing the discussion of a question quite foreign to the proposal to go into Committee of Supply. Had his amendment been carried, it would have prevented us from going into Committee - of Supply. The object of the original motion is clearly to permit of the discussion of grievances, but the honourable member substituted for it what became a substantive motion of another kind, which was debated, and, in accordance with the Standing Orders, adjourned. I believe in every honourable member having the right to place his views fairly before the House, and did my best to give an opportunity for the adjournment of the motion of the honourable member for Brisbane, which the honourable member for Parramatta prevented. The original Supply motion, which was adjourned at my instance, being on the notice-paper as Government business, only the Prime Minister, or one of his colleagues, could move to fix the date for the resumption of the debate.",45
183,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Ha d the amendment to omit all the words after the word "" That"" been carried, the debate on the motion to go into Committee of Supply would have been prevented; but had my amendment been defeated, you, Mr Speaker, would have had to put the question, "" That I do now leave the Chair."" My amendment having been adjourned, not defeated, you are therefore still free to put the original question. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - The amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth did not take from any honourable member the right to speak on the main question. While some honourable members might desire to discuss the temperance proposal of the honourable member for Brisbane under cover of the amendment, other members could discuss grievances under cover of the original motion. If the adjournment of the debate on an amendment prevents the discussion of the original motion, it may happen that the opportunity for the discussion of grievances will be taken from honourable members altogether, because it .will be possible, directly the question "" That Mr Speaker do now leave the Chair "" is stated, for any Government supporter to move, and obtain, the adjournment of the debate. Thus, although the Standing Orders provide for the ventilation of grievances, a method is provided for taking away the opportunity for the exercise of the right.",45
184,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The question originally submitted was that Mr Speaker do now leave the Chair, which gave every honourable member an opportunity to discuss any grievance, real or fancied. Almost immediately, the honourable member for Wentworth moved to strike out all the words after the word ""That."" Had the amendment succeeded, the opportunity for the discussion of grievances would have been taken away, and we should have been limited to the discussion of what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to as an abstract question. I submit that it is the inalienable right of a majority to adjourn any debate, a right with which no standing order interferes. We have deliberately adjourned the debate on the motion for the omission of all the words after ""That."" Therefore, for all practical purposes, those words are no longer before us, the only word remaining being the word "" That,"" which obviously allows no opportunity for debate. Under the circumstances, I submit that the motion that the debate be adjourned to a particular day is in order.",45
185,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Following the practice adopted by the House, I have to rule that the Prime Minister is in order in moving that the resumption of the debate stand an Order of the Day for Tuesday next.",46
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Will you be good enough, sir, to quote the practice?",46
187,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Tw o cases have been brought under my notice. Honourable members will find at page 379, of volume I . of the Votes and Proceedings for the session 1907-8, a reference to the course pursued on a similar occasion. On a formal motion of Supply, the honourable member for Gwydir moved an amendment providing for Ihe appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into, and report upon, the postal, telegraph, and telephone systems of the Commonwealth, and, after discussion, the debate was adjourned on division, and it was resolved that\the resumption of the debate should be an Order of the Day for the following Wednesday.",46
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,What is the effect of carrying such a motion so far as grievance day is concerned?,46
189,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It practically disposes of the discussion of grievances, so far as today is concerned. The question is that the resumption of the debate stand an Order of the Day for Tuesday next. Mr W. ELLIOT JOHNSON - On a point of order, Mr Speaker, seeing that the minority must be deprived of their rights by this process, I wish to know whether, on this question being revived on Tuesday next, we shall have an opportunity to discuss the grievances which we are debarred from discussing today?",46
190,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"When the occasion arises, I shall be prepared to give a ruling.",46
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"You have given a ruling, sir, and may we not know exactly where it places us ? Surely it is fair to whether the grievance motion will come on automatically on Tuesday next, or whether the opportunity to discuss grievances is to be deliberately taken from the House on the motion of the Prime Minister.",46
192,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I decline to give a ruling in anticipation. When the occasion arises I shall be prepared to do so.,46
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"But the occasion exists now, sir.",46
194,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,It has not yet arisen. Question resolved in the affirmative.,46
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether this matter will come on for discussion on Tuesday next?,46
196,Mr CHANTER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Wai t until Tuesday.,46
197,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"As a matter of privilege, understanding order No. in , I wish to submit to you, Mr Speaker, that if, what I am afraid can be feared actually occurs, as the result of the Prime Minister's refusal to bring this matter on for discussion on Tuesday, a very serious question of privilege will arise.",46
198,Mr CHANTER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I rise to order. I ask, sir, that some question shall be stated from the Chair before the honourable member makes any remarks. At present there is no question before us.",46
199,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member for Wentworth rose to a question of privilege, and I take it that he will conclude with a motion.",46
200,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I think that honourable members have some right to an_ assurance that business that is postponed will be dealt with at some future period. By the action just taken, not by the House",46
201,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The honourable member is not now dealing with a question of privilege.,46
202,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I submit, with the utmost deference, that if the motion be simply placed at the bottom of the notice paper",46
203,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I shall ask the honourable member to resume his seat if he continues in that strain.,46
204,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The question of privilege is really this: If the motion had been definitely struck off the notice-paper, I should have had the opportunity",46
205,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The honourable member must not discuss that question.,46
206,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Then I shall say that, in a normal state of affairs, I should be able to move any motion that I pleased with ask regard to a matter that was not already on the notice-paper. That is the undoubted privilege of every honourable member, and is it not fair to submit, as a matter of privilege, that if the majority of the House, by deliberately taking",46
207,Mr SPEAKER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member is now traversing a decision already arrived at by the House. APPROPRIATION (WORKS AND BUILDINGS) BILL. In Committee (Consideration of Senate's message): Schedule. Division 3, subdivision 6, item 1. antine Stations, including acquisition of land at Triffitt's Point-Toward s cost, ^1,300. Senate's Message - Amendmen t leaving out "" at Triffitt's Point"" insisted on.",46
208,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [4.40] - The question now before us has no party complexion, but a rather important bearing on the privileges of this House. Apart altogether from the question actually at issue, the Government feel that it is very important that this Bill should be finally dealt with without delay. As honourable members are aware, an item in the schedule of this Bill relating to quarantine stations was amended in another place by omitting the words "" at Triffitt's Point."" That amendment, I think, encroaches on the privileges of this House, and the Government are unable to accept it. It jected by the House yesterday, and a message to that effect was sent to the Senate, which has now transmitted to this Cham-, ber a message insisting upon its amendment. I do not wish to discuss the merits of the item, nor do the Government desire, at the present time, to contest the principle involved, beyond taking steps to preserve the rights of this House by amending the amendment so as to leave no doubt as to our privileges.",47
209,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,But surely the Committee must know what the item is before it deals with the question of principle?,47
210,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The item has already been before the Committee on two occasions. As I explained yesterday, the amendment made in another place is one which this Committee itself could not have made, since it alters the destination of the vote, and is contrary to theGovernorGeneral's message, under which we had a right to consider it. In these circumstances, we returned the amendment to the Senate, with a message intimating why we disagreed with it. While the question is not one of magnitude, the Government are of opinion that it would be well to omit the whole item. In that way we shall fully preserve the privileges of this House without raising any controversy. There is certainly room for controversy, because distinguished members of another place, while in a position to rule, have ruled in a certain way, and on this question have voted contrary to that ruling. I move That the Committee insist on disagreeing lo the amendment insisted on by the Senate, but as a consequential amendment, omit the whole item amended, and make the necessary alteraNew Quar- tions in the totals in the Bill . That will mean that the vote for Triffitt's Point will disappear.",47
211,Mr BAMFORD,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The Government are knuckling down, then?",47
212,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The motion will leave the House free to take any further steps that are thought necessary in that direction at a later period. It will also be necessary to provide for the further amendment of the Bill to bring it into consonance with this amendment if it is accepted by the Committee.,47
213,Mr DEAKIN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Ballarat) [4.46] - I am unacquainted with anything that has happened in another place, or with any action of particular persons there, or any reasons was re- they may have offered for this proposal. If I were acquainted with them, I should not be in order in alluding to them. We are concerned with only one question. What is the amendment which we are asked to make in the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill? The amendment made by the Senate is to omit the particular locality in which the money is proposed to be spent, and that alters the destination of a vote which had been approved by this House. If it accepted that, it would, as - a' consequence, part with the power of determining the purpose for which the money was directly ordered to be spent. Whether the place chosen was the best one or not, I have not sufficient knowledge of the locality to say. The situation has been strongly criticised by honourable members of this House, but any alteration in that regard, if made at all, must be made hereafter. We have had a message from the Governor General covering an appropriation which, whether the locality be well or ill-chosen, is specific. The vote by this House was a specific grant for that specific purpose. The effect of the Senate's amendment is to leave the specific grant, altering the specific purpose so far as the locality is concerned, no locality being instanced. It is questionable if the message from the Governor General, which authorized a special appropriation for a special place, could be treated as covering an appropriation which was for no special locality. If there were any doubt upon the matterand at present I do not conceive it-the Prime Minister has taken the right course in protecting the privileges of the House in the one set of questions which, above all others, fall within the special jurisdiction of the House. In this regard, very elaborate provisions have been made in the Constitution, in order to establish a new relation between the two Federal Houses. In a State, under an unitary government, the second Chamber would not possess anything like the authority which our Constitution has conferred upon the Senate. But that authority has been expressly and very definitely limited. Nothing can be done by them, and nothing ought to be done by us, to enlarge or alter it. We find in sections 53 and 56 of the Constitution the procedure in this regard laid down very clearly. For some reason, unknown to me, the Senate has in this case, erred in attempting to interfere with this vote. It might have been struck out altogether, but it has been left with a changed destination. Hence the course which the Prime Minister proposes, in order to safeguard the rights of the House, is the course which it is desirable that the House should follow.",47
214,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Parkes) [4.50] - We have arrived at a very serious situation. The item, as the Prime Minister points out, is a very small one, but, inasmuch as any recognition of the right of the Senate to make an amendment in a Bill of this kind will be hereafter quoted ac a precedent, and as, to some extent, binding this House in similar situations, the House should seriously consider whether the course recommended by the Prime Minister is the right one to take. When our Constitution was framed, it was intended that the Senate, although it should not have the power to amend money Bills, should have the power to suggest to this House the advisability of making an amendment in such Bills in this House, which is the people's House. The logic of the Prime Minister's proposal should be tested by its ultimate effect. A Bill went up from this House containing an item which is not part of "" the ordinary services of the year,"" but which involves part of the policy of the Government. The Senate has amended the Bill in such a way as to cut out the item. I quite recognise the right of the Senate to "" suggest"" to this House that, as the item is not favourably regarded by it, this House should remove such item in the exercise of its discretion. But if the Senate discovers that, by making an amendment of this sort, it succeeds in eliminating a vote which is made by this House with regard to the exoenditure of the country, and if it is once established that all the Senate has to do to eliminate an item of this kind is to alter the direction of the vote, then it will really become a power in the other House to amend money Bills to any extent it likes.",48
215,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"We have already disagreed with the amendment, and are ""disagreeing with it now.",48
216,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I know. . I heard what the Prime Minister said, and recognise that he has made one attempt to induce the House to see the seriousness of the position. I am not suggesting an alternative now, because I have not had time to think out the situation, and advise an alternative, but I am asking this House to consider, as it ought to do, what is likely to be the permanent effect upon its powers. I am not speaking of the effect of the amendment upon the policy of the Government, because that is a small matter compared with the far-reaching constitutional effect. It is a question whether we are now to recognise the right in the other House to amend a money Bill. The Constitution provides that the Senate shall only have the power to make suggestions. I have always held that the power to make a suggestion is not the power of amendment, but merely the power of placing before this House the opinion of the other branch of the Legislature, so that this House may consider whether or not it is desirable to amend its own Bill. But if, in this case, to use an expression which occurred just now in an interjection, we are "" knuckling down"" at the first attempt, because the Senate persists in its amendment, I want the House to recognise that we are laying down in the most definite terms a recognition of the right of the other House to amend a money Bill.",48
217,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I think they have the right in certain circumstances to amend this Bill,"" but not in the way they have done. They can strike out or reduce an amount, but cannot alter the destination of it.",48
218,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The other House is seeking to alter the destination of this vote, and is, therefore, going outside the power which the Prime Minister lays down, and now admits to have been broken into. I am not prepared to say at present how the difficulty should be avoided. It would require a good deal of attention and thought.",48
219,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I think we know, and are ready for it.",49
220,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The Prime Minister has put it before the House in too functory a manner; and, in view of what he now says regarding the powers of the Senate under the Constitution, the House should have an opportunity of thinking the question over before any conclusion is come to.",49
221,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Adelaide) [4.55] There are two points to be considered in this debate-the first, whether we are to acknowledge the right of the Senate to amend an Appropriation Bill, and, the second, whether we shall be doing right in accepting the amendment proposed by the Prime Minister. I am informed by the Prime Minister that this Bill is not in one sense an Appropriation Bill, but I contend that it covers the Work's and Buildings Estimates, and certainly indicates where and how certain moneys are to be expended. Section 53 of the Constitution provides thatThe Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government.",49
222,Sir ROBERT BEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Clearl y that is not this case.,49
223,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"But this is an Appropriation Bill. If we permit the Senate to amend the Estimates, manifestly it alters the Appropriation Bill that we send up to it.",49
224,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Thes e matters were separated for that very purpose.,49
225,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I do not know about that, but I am confident that if we permit the Senate to alter the Estimates in this direction, for all practical purposes it will have altered the Appropriation Bill, because the total of the Appropriation Bill must be less the amount which the Senate's amendment cuts out of the Estimates.",49
226,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"There is no question that the Senate can amend this Bill if it so desires. It cannot alter the destination of a vote, but it can reduce or cut out a vote.",49
227,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"As I read the Constitution, the Senate has not hitherto had the power to amend even in this direction. In this case it amends the Estimates for the year, and controls them to that extent. For all practical purposes, although there may be some technical difference, the Senate will have amended an Appropriation Bill, and whatever this House may say to the contrary, the Senate will have ruled so far as the expenditure of a certain sum of money is concerned. This Bill is a Bill "" For an Act to grant and apply a sum per- out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the services of the year ending the 30th day of June, 1911, for the purposes of Additions, New Works, Buildings, &c."" Manifestly it is an appropriation of this particular amount of money. Clause 1 tells us that the Bill may be cited as the "" Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Act 1910-n""; and how honourable members can urge that this is not an appropriation, I am at a loss to understand.",49
228,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It is not urged that it is not an appropriation, but that it is not a part of the ordinary annual services. No doubt it is an appropriation.",49
229,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"That being so, it seems to me that the works and buildings are constructed out of the ordinary annual appropriation for the ordinary annual services of the Government. The practice of the Parliament is that the new works and buildings are an annual affair, paid for out of the annual revenue; and to that end we make an annual appropriation. We must not endeavour by mere technicalities to get over a difficulty that may so grow as to be positively dangerous. It seems to me that if the Constitution be reasonably construed, the Senate has not the power to amend in this way-that it has not the power, not merely to alter the destination, but, in a roundabout way, to curtail the expenditure and interfere with the annual appropriation for works and buildings.",49
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The effect might be to hold up the services altogether for want of facilities.,49
231,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,That is what the effect might be.,49
232,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The Senate has altered the destination of the vote.,49
233,Mr DEAKIN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The Senate keeps the vote, but alters the destination.",49
234,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Quite so; the vote is not affected.,49
235,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I understand that, so far as the actual amendment suggested by the Senate is concerned",49
236,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It is not "" suggested "" ; ' it is made.",49
237,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The amendment of the Senate alters the destination of the vote; the Senate has assumed a power that even this House has not, according to our practice.",49
238,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,No .,49
239,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,We are conceding to the Senate a right that we cannot exercise ourselves.,50
240,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,That is just what the Prime Minister's amendment does not do.,50
241,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"We . are conceding to the Senate, in effect, the right to alter destination of the vote, and in the future, - acting on this precedent, we shall cut any vote which the Senate insists on altersome ing.",50
242,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Supposin g Senate did this with every item in the schedule ?,50
243,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Precisely .,50
244,Mr DEAKIN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,What is the alternative course the honourable member proposes?,50
245,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,At the present time. I am not in a position to suggest an native.,50
246,Mr DEAKIN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Whateve r that alternative might be, the honourable member would find himself just where he is own objection would apply. - Mr ROBERTS - I do not think we have exhausted the possibilities of inducing the Senate not to assume the power it present desires to exercise. I admit could get over the difficulty for the moment by, so to speak, turning our coat inside out; but that would not give us a new though it might tend to deceive ourselves and the passers-by for the moment.",50
247,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The same difficulty might occur every time a suggestion was made.,50
248,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"If we turned our coats, then every time a person came looked at us with a suspicious eye we should have to turn it again. As the honIn orable member for Parkes says, the Senate the following:might act in precisely the same way every time a suggestion was made, and, on the present precedent, might grow larger in their demands until, as a matter of pracor tice, the Works and Buildings Appropriaamend them. tion would be entirely in their hands, and we should be a mere recording machine. Under the circumstances, I submit that, whatever may be the anxiety of the Prime Minister to get over the difficulty, we to think of the future, and of the and privileges of this Houses-to consider whether we shall concede to the Senate the right, not merely to alter the a vote, but to reduce Estimates when honourable senators are not satisfied that the money is to be spent in a way they desire. When The Senate, by merely altering the destinathe tion of a vote, may cut down expenditure of which this House unanimously approves,, and that without the other House incurring any responsibility. The Senate, in effect, says that it is prepared to approve of the expenditure of this amount, but that it objects to the quarantine station being on the the south-east corner, when, in their opinion, it ought to be on the north-east out corner. Honourable senators may have had other place on the Derwent River in their minds; but, in any case, this House the must take the responsibility for the nonexpenditure of the money, and of there being no quarantine stations in that part of the Commonwealth, and that, I submit, isa responsibility that we ought not to take. In my opinion, there is no violent hurry for this vote, seeing that the other works alterand buildings are not being delayed.",50
249,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Oh , yes.",50
250,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member will find that other works and buildings now, and his are being delayed.",50
251,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Nominally , yes; but in practice, no. I think we will find that those works are not delayed. There is the at other point, whether this House has power we to do as the Prime Minister suggests. In my opinion, it is not in accordance with the practice, and we shallexceed our coat, powers if we undo our own work under cover of an amendment made by the Senate. As to the amount of money voted, there is no dispute; and if we, at the instance of the Prime Minister, cut out the vote altogether, we shall not merely be reviewing our own work, but reviewing and altering by and work to which the Senate has agreed. That, I submit, we have not power to do. May, n t h edition, page 506, there is In some cases the Lords have left out clauses or words, to which amendments the Commons have disagreed; but on restoring such clauses words have, at the same time, proposed to If we follow that practice, it - will mean that the Senate will first have to restore the words, and then suggest an amendment acceptable to the two Houses. That would ought be a way out of the difficulty which the rights Senate might be urged to acceptA Lords' amendment has been divided, and a separate question put upon each part of it . destination of We could do thatSometimes one House does not insist upon its amendments, but makes other amendments. an amendment made by the Lords haa been agreed to, by mistake, with an amendment, proceedings have been ordered to be null and void, and the amendment disagreed to. An amendment made by one House to an amendiment made by the other should be relevant to '-the same subject-matter. T submit that, under the circumstances, a proposal to drop the vote is not relevant to the subject-matter brought down from the Senate, namely, the mere destination of the vote. We can make an amendment relevant only to the destination of the vote, - :and not to the actual vote, which has been twice approved by this House, and twice :approved by the Senate.",50
252,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,We cannot make an - amendment as to the destination.,51
253,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"We should submit to ithe Senate the error into which it has fallen, .and invite it to undo that error, and not - attempt to get over the difficulty by a fresh 'error fraught with such dangerous conse-quences. I am not so much troubled about ;the particular item as about the precedent which may be established.",51
254,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Are not the privileges of : this House sufficiently safeguarded by the - words of .the Prime Minister's amendment ?,51
255,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Absolutel y no. The ^privilege of this House is to deal wholly and solely with appropriation ; and I submit that our privileges are, to some extent, - being interfered with.",51
256,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,We do not agree with ;their amendment.,51
257,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"But we go further, and say, "" As you insist, we will do more '.than you really want, and we will take the responsibility.""",51
258,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The Senate desires the (quarantine station to be somewhere else; and we say, "" You shall have it where we say, or not at all.""",51
259,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Then the responsibility for there being no quarantine station is ours, and not that of the Senate.",51
260,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Oh , no.",51
261,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"To my mind, there Pirates' is no question as to that. When the neceswas .sity for a quarantine station does arise, House of Representatives will have a world-wide responsibility for the fact that there iis not one; and surely it would be better to have the station anywhere than not at all ? Let me read a little further, because May - emphasizes the point which I am putting before honourable members. According to that authorityI f an amendment be proposed to a Lords' amendment, not consequent on, or relevant - such amendment, the question - vvill not be put irom the Chair. [128] The Chairman must be confident, beyond the possibility of doubt, that the amendment now proposed is relevant to that of the Senate, otherwise he cannot, according to the practice of the House of Commons, which rules our procedure in cases in which our own Standing Orders are silent, put it from the Chair. To continue the quotationA departure from this rule was permitted, under peculiar circumstances, in the case of the Bolton Police Bill 1S39; but the Lords agreed to it with a special entry in the journal, that it was not to be drawn into a precedent; and a protest was signed by five very influential peers against agreeing to the amendment. It is also a rule that neither House may, at this time, leave out or otherwise amend"" anything which they have already passed themselvesWe are proposing to leave out something which we have already passed ourselves, and which has been passed by both Houses.",51
262,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,What is that?,51
263,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,We have passed the item.,51
264,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Unattached .,51
265,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"To leave it unattached would be a dangerous precedent, fraught with possibilities of wrong-doing in the future.",51
266,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,It is an item at large.,51
267,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member dees not wish me to argue that point. To proceed with the quotation from Mayunless such amendment be immediately consequent upon the acceptance or the rejection of an amendment of the other House. In 1678, it was stated by the Commons at a Conference, "" That it is contrary to the constant method and proceedings in Parliament, to strike out anything in a Bill which hath been full y agreed and passed by both Houses"" : and in allowing consequential amendments, either in the body of the Bill , or in the amendments, the spirit of this rule is still maintained. So binding, indeed, has it been held, that in 1850, a serious oversight, as to the commencement of the Act, having been discovered in the Head Money Bill , before the Lords' amendments had been agreed to, no attempt made to correct it by way of amendment, the but a separate Act was passed for the purpose. If we do what is proposed, we shall establish a precedent enabling the Senate, not merely to amend an Appropriation Bill dealing with Works and Buildings, but to alter the destination of a vote, ancl shall be doing a wrong thing by amending an item to which both Houses have agreed.",51
268,Mr GLYNN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Angas) [5.22] - The Senate has no power to alter the destination to, of a vote, and, by omitting the item, we cannot create a precedent which may be used against us, because we have the tection of the Constitution, in which powers of the two Houses are defined. In Quick and Garran's Commentary on the the item we give way. Constitution, a distinction is drawn between ordinary Appropriation Bills, which are described ""as Bills to provide for the general work of the Government Departments such as Customs and Excise, Posts Telegraphs, Lighthouses, Lightships, and Quarcause, apart frcm the express limitaantine, Naval and Military Defence, the to pay for which is voted by Parliament year io yearand ordinary expenditure, not provided in the annual supplies, whichdo not come within the meaning of ordinary annual services, are appropriations of revenue or loan money for the construction of public works and buildings. The Appropriation Works and Buildings Bill falls under the latter description, and, Iassume by inference, may be amended by the knock out Senate, which has 'wider powers in this spect than the House of Lords. Rightly wrongly, a compromise was effected Convention, which does not altogether away from the other House the right amend these Bills. I was one of three four who voted against the Senate being given equal rights in these matters with House, and I' think that we should have done well in restricting its powers still further. But it was thought that it should be permitted to express its opinion by makConstitution, ing amendments regarding matters of ral policy involved in proposals such as the construction of the Federal Capital. I am not certain that we have the power to leave out the item, because I have not looked into the matter carefully, but think that we have, and if we say that we have not that power, we shall limit, not the power of the Senate, but our own power, by depriving ourselves of a means of getting over a difficulty without pedantic reliance on the Constitution. less we take this step, we may have a big to do. fight with the Senate, creating a deadlock, and bringing into operation section 57 of the Constitution, which provides for solution and a joint sitting. From point of view of expediency, the Governmember ment is acting rightly in proposing to omit the item. Were we to have a dispute with the other House there would be delay the carrying out of a number of public works, because the only arbiter between and the Senate, should each House insist on its rights, is the people. Outside Bills there is a very wide area within Mr Glynn. proat any time a deadlock may occur, and the we ought not to precipitate crises.",51
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,But in leaving out,52
270,Mr GLYNN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"We lose nothing by doing so. Should the Senate assume that its powers have been increased by our giving and way, it must eventually stand aside, bet money tion.s of its powers it cannot block from the will of the popular House, this Chamber representing the people who for pay the taxation in proportion to numbers. Having wished when a member of the Convention to limit the powers of the Senate, I should be one of the last to give way to its dictation, but in this case I think we should do well to follow the course proposed by the Government. f we wished to make difficulty we might that the object of the Senate is to the whole vole, because it is a reprinciple of law that if you do not underor stand what a Legislature is doing, in the you must assume that it is acting take within its powers. Were a State Parto liament to pass an Act which might or be read as within or without its constitutional powers, it must be as this sumed, according to the decision in D'Emden v. Pedder, that it acted within its power. We have a right to assume that the Senate would not desire to infringe the and therefore did not attempt geneto alter the destination of the vote. If it had wanted to do that there are words in the English language that would enable it to do it. It cannot alter the destination without telling us what the destinationI is to be. The Senate has stopped us altogether by omitting the only part of the item that gave any significance to it. We may, therefore, assume that it has acted within its powers by negativing the item, and by a this amendment we shall merely show it the Uncorrect way of doing that which it desired",52
271,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"West Sydney-At a distorney-General) [5.31] - Onl y two points the need to be emphasized. The honourable for Adelaide, regarding this as a grave constitutional crisis, has cited some cases as to the relationship between the in Lords and the Commons, and has sought to draw an analogy between them and the us two Houses of this Parliament, declaring that what governs the Lords and the Commoney mons should govern us. I submit that which there is no analogy. We have to remember first of all that the Senate has in regard to this Bill the same powers as we have",52
272,Sir ROBERT BEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Except , of course, with regard to the power of origination.",53
273,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"That is so. The second point is that it has exercised those powers at least twice in the history of this Parliament. In these circumstances all that we are doing by the amendment now before the Committee is to assert that that which we may not do it may not do. There is no question at all as to what the Lords and the Commons would do in a grave constitutional crisis ; but here nothing has happened save that the Senate has done that which it cannot do ancl which we cannot do. \V""e could have a joint sitting about which so much has been said, but regarding which no one could predicate with safety. When a House like this, numerically superior, and whose claims are founded on eternal justice, met the representatives of an effete and debilitated aristocracy, the latter would have to come down. But this question as to Triffitt's Point is not sufficient to warrant a grave constitutional crisis. Nothing has been, or is being done that could in any circumstances be construed as a precedent whereby this House yields any powers given to it under the Constitution. The Senate"" has lef t out the words "" T r if f it t ' s Point,"" and had it pleased it could have omitted the whole item. It can do anything that we can do, but we object to its doing that which we cannot do, and are, therefore, setting out our pretest accordingly.",53
274,Sir ROBERT BEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Kooyong) [5.36]. - There is a well founded anxiety on the part of this Chamber to pay respect to the rights of both Houses of the Parliament. Our rights are firmly ancl definitely fixed by the charter of the Constitution. Some honourable members opposite have argued as though the Senate had no power to amend this Bill. Their contention founded upon a misconception. There are two classes of Bills which the Senate may not amend: Bills imposing taxation and those making appropriations for the ordinary annual services. The Senate may request an amendment of such Bills, but it may not amend them. The Bil l now before us, however, is not one making an appropriation in respect of the ordinary annual services; it deals with general works and buildings and expenditure thereon, and, therefore, involves a question of policy. For obvious it was determined, as a term of the [128]- 2 Constitution, that the Senate should have a right to discuss and determine questions of policy and, save in regard to theorigination of money Bills, the powers of the two Chambers, with the exceptions I have mentioned, are equal. If we realise that that is the true position as laid down by section 53 qf the Constitution we shall have very little difficulty in coming to a determination. As the Attorney-General has already said, it would have been competent for the Senate, had it so desired, to strike out the whole item. Had it done so, the amendment would have come before us in the ordinary way. and we should have dealt with it just as we deal with amendments made in other Bills by another place. But the Senate has done something which, according to the Prime Minister, would be inconsistent with the message whereon this Bill was founded. If that is so, then there is more than one way of dealing with it. I am not going to take exception to what the Prime Minister has done, because I am sure that he has given the matter full consideration. He has certainly taken care to conserve most completely the rights of this Chamber. He suggests by way of a settlement that we amend the amendment by leaving out the item. I have had to deal with questions of this kind in the Senate as well as in the Parliament of Victoria, and in like circumstances, the practice that we have adopted is that of withdrawing the Bill, and introducing another. That course has frequently been followed with the object of avoiding difficulties in State Parliaments. The Prime Minister could have adopted the one course or the other, but he has at least taken the full precaution of justifying the position of this House, ancl of maintaining its-rights. I am sure that no honourable member desires to precipitate a crisis as between the two Houses. We do not wish to deal with shadowy matters, is and I think we need have no doubt as to the advisableness of adopting the Prime Minister's proposals. I have pleasure in supporting his motion.",53
275,Mr HIGGS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Capricornia) [5.40] - I desire to support the action of the Prime Minister. There is no analogy between the Senate and the House of Lords.,53
276,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I did not suggest that there was. All that I said was that the procedure of this House is guided by that of the House of Commons in matters rereasons specting which - our Standing Orders are silent.,53
277,Mr HIGGS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The House of Lords consists of a number of very able men, and also of a number of born noodles. There are no born noodles in the Senate. Its members have won their position on adult suffrage, just as we have, and the Senate is certainly more representative of the people of Australia than is the House of Representatives. As long as the Senate exercises its rights, and while the majority of this House exercise their common sense, no trouble will ever arise between the two Chambers. The Senate in this case has exercised its right to revise the work done by this Chamber. It objected to the item "" new quarantine stations, including acquisition of land at Triffitt's Point, towards cost, ^316,"" and informed this House accordingly. We are not in a position to point out to it the correct manner in which it should indicate its objection. It has a perfect right to choose its own words, but we may approve, or disapprove, of its amendment. As a matter of, fact, the majority of honourable members are agreed that this item should not appear on the Works and Buildings Estimates, and the Minister in charge of the measure told the Committee on a former occasion that even if it were passed by both Houses, those who objected to the expenditure might rely upon the Government not spending the money. What a mistake it would be for this House to set itself up in opposition to; the Senate on a question of this kind. The honourable member for Adelaide says that it is wrong to suggest that any one desires that we should have a big row with the Senate; but if we are ever to have a controversy with it, we must always be prepared for a big fight, remembering the words of ShakespeareOf entrance to a quarrel; but, being in, Bear 't that the opposed may beware of If we have a fight with the Senate, let it be on a question on which we can go to the public; but if we had a controversy with it on this question, and went to the public upon it, we should simply emphasize the need of a second Chamber.",54
278,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"So that as long as .the Senate confines itself to small matters of this kind, it may go ahead ?",54
279,Mr HIGGS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The Senate has a right to amend a measure of this kind, and believing that the course proposed by the Prime Minister will preserve the rights of the popular Chamber, I shall support it.",54
280,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Wentworth) [5.45]-- I regard this question as important. Whether we excise Triffitt's Point from, or leave it in, the Works Estimates, is a matter of comparative unimportance, but if on countless occasions we allow the Senate to amend our money Bills, instead of "" requesting"" their amendment by us, we set up precedent after precedent until finally an established practice is created. The Senate used to work the oracle in the past by amending our Bills towards the conclusion of the session when we were all anxious to get home. Then the same argument that has been put forward with such earnestness by two honourable members who for many years were in the Senate was used against this House, and this House surrendered its privileges. Section 53 of the Constitution is pretty clear on the point, but its clarity is not on the side of the position assumed by the Senate, and tacitly endorsed in the past by this House. because the occasions were unimportant, and because the members of this House wanted to get home to their families. Section 53 provides that the Senate may not amend any proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government. What is the meaning of the words "" ordinary annual services of the Government "" ?",54
281,Sir ROBERT BEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,They do not mean works and buildings.,54
282,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"They mean the carrying on of the Departments of the Commonwealth, and the works and buildings are an inherent part of those services. The honourable member is a senator first, last, and always. He has only just come into Beware this Chamber, and has not yet lost the aroma of the Senate. It is the same with the. the honourable member for Capricornia. If we allow the Senate to amend the votes for new works and buildings in any Department we must allow it to amend the votes for the salaries of officers who are appointed for the first time. It would be just as logical for the Senate to interpret that section in the Constitution as giving them die right to make a direct amendment as to any new salary appearing on the Estimates, on the ground that, in its narrow sense, the payment was not part of the "" ordinary annual services of the Government."" The salary of a newly-appointed officer could be claimed by the Senate to be a new service, just as much as the Works and Buildings Estimates, which are part and parcel of the agencies of the Departments.",54
283,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Would the honourable member say diat a civil servant's salary was on the same footing as expenditure on the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway?,55
284,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I should say that a new civil servant's salary could be argued not to come under the term '' ordinary annual services of the Government."" That phrase would then be held not to cover a new service, whether it is the payment of salaries or the establishment of works. The establishment of a quarantine station in Tasmania is one of the ordinary agencies of the Commonwealth, and the Constitution says that a Bill for the ordidary annual services of the Commonwealth shall not be amended by the Senate. We are undoubtedly allowing the Senate to invade our privileges. I cannot expect ex-senators, or members from Tasmania, to take a clear view of this question, but it is of importance from the stand-point of Democratic principle. The other place has a number of things against it ; apart altogether from the longevity of its members and their capacity for sleep, it is not elected upon an equal suffrage with this House. This House is the popular Chamber, because it represents the people on a population basis. We should, therefore, be careful not to allow the control of the public purse to be shared by a Chamber which is elected by the States, but not on a population basis. Otherwise the citizens of the larger States will give their control, over the finances absolutely into the hands of the Senate, which is the representative first, last, and always, in theory, of the smaller States of the Union, and can become so, in fact, whenever its members care to take a very keen State view of their duties. I strongly urge the Prime Minister to ask the House, in the circumstances, to stand by its original position. The time to have struck out the item altogether, if that was intended, was when the matter was first referred back to this Chamber. Since then we have taken up a position in defence of our constitutional rights, and ought not to back down now and allow the Senate to ride roughshod over us. If the ' Minister adhered to his original position and sent the Bill back to the Senate in form in which it left us, I have that the Senate would agree. The subject of Triffitt's Point is not of vast importance.",55
285,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"If we do, the honourable member will lose the whole lot, including the vote for the Federal Capital.",55
286,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member is trying log-rolling by interjection. I am not discussing the constitutional question from the point of view of what any State is going to lose or gain, but I am confident that the venerable gentlemen in another place will be the last to make a quarantine station at Triffitt's Point the subject of a constitutional trial of strength between the two Chambers. By constantly giving way to the other place this House is allowing further and further inroads into its powers over public expenditure-powers ' which under section 53 of the Constitution are intended to be pretty comprehensive. When this matter goes out of the Committee into the House again, will the Prime Minister ask the Speaker to give his interpretation of section 53, and especially of the words "" for the ordinary annual services of the Government"" ?",55
287,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,It has been defined and decided a number of times. It. means the annual appropriation.,55
288,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"This is the annual Appropriation covering the Works Estimates. I think the Prime Minister will find that Mr Speaker holds a different view on this subject from the late Speaker. If the custodian of the liberties of this Chamber holds such a view, it is well worth the Prime Minister's while to look into the matter, so that we may know exactly where we stand. If the honourable member does not care to put the question to Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to do so.",55
289,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I feel that we ought not to anticipate the Speaker's ruling in a matter of that kind.,55
290,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I cannot, of course, say what Mr Speaker's view is, but the right person to put such a question to Mr. Speaker is the Leader of the House.",55
291,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I think this House has the constitutional power to omit the item.,55
292,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Yes ; but we are omitting it in pursuance of an amendment of the Senate, and I maintain that the Senate has Prime no power to amend our Works Estimates.",55
293,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The action of the the Government in omitting the item will not no doubt settle the point at all.,55
294,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It only postpones the trouble. It gives the Senate an opportunity of dragging the question up on future occasions, which may be very inconvenient for honourable members and the House generally.",56
295,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Mr Speaker has already preserved the powers and privileges of this House by his decision on the original amendment.,56
296,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"But it can be argued conversely that this House gives up its privileges when it recedes from the position which it took up at the instance of Mr. Speaker. The Prime Minister's motion makes the position much worse from the point of view of this House. If the Speaker had given no ruling, it might be said "" This is only another instance of this sort of inroad on the part of the Senate, and we will put off the fight for another day."" But the Speaker took up the position that the Senate had not the power to amend the item in this way. We now recede from that position, and say to the Senate, in effect, "" We will let you haye, not only your amendment, but something more.""",56
297,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Wl e do not.,56
298,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"We knock out the item. The Senate does not want the money to be spent at Triffitt's Point, and so we knock out the whole item, which is giving the Senate more than it asked for. We say, in effect, "" We are so absolutely at your feet that we knock out the whole item.""",56
299,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The Senate has the power to agree to knock the item out, in cooperation with us..",56
300,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"We ought to have the nuestion threshed out in a proper way. I firmly believe that the Senate has no constitutional power to amend our Works Estimates, which are inherently part of the "" ordinary annual services "" of the Government of the Commonwealth.",56
301,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Adelaide) [5.56] The position taken up by some honourable members is, ""We are in a difficulty j let us get over it at any price.'' The - whole strength of their argument is "" Peace at any price."" They appear to have greased a portion of the footpath for the purpose of making a slide, and I fear that some one may break his legs and arms on it. Supposing the Senate, in the exercise of its power, declines to accept our amendment upon their amendment, and refuses to knock out the item altogether, will the Prime Minister consider what position we shall be in ? What shall we do, and what will the learned gentlemen on the other side say? What elaborate arguments will they put forward in that eventuality to get over the'difficulty, which will exist then, as it exists now ? I fear that the slide which is being made to get over the difficulty may result in breaking the power of the House even more effectually than would the amendment which we are attempting to slide over.",56
302,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Franklin) [5.59]. - Some of the arguments we have heard have been based on views that were lield in the old State days in disputes between Legislative Assemblies and Legislative Councils. As several honourable members have pointed out, the Senate, elected on precisely the same franchise as this House, is really more representative of the States than can be members who represent small electorates only. The objection raised to that argument is that, because some States have more population than others, the Senate franchise gives a greater voting power per head to the smaller 'States. The Senate is elected on exactly the same franchise as the House of Representatives, and has the extra weight of representing the whole of the States as States. I cannot help saying that the Government have themselves to blame for a great deal of the trouble that has arisen. In these Estimates provision is made for quarantine stations in every one of the States, but only in the case of this particular vote was the position of the station fixed. In regard to the site of the Tasmanian quarantine station there has been a good deal of friction.",56
303,The CHAIRMAN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The honourable member must not discuss the merits of the site.,56
304,Mr MCWILLIAMS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I only desire to show that in the only one case where there was any objection raised to the site was the money allocated, simply because an official of the Department wished to tie the Government down to that site. If neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate has the power to make any alteration in the allocation of this money, then the promises that were made in regard to the site are worth nothing, because the Government could not have made any alteration in regard to the site after the money had been voted. At the late sitting of this House, when these Estimates were under consideration, it was my intention, about 7 o'clock in the morning, to move the omission of this item, but it was pointed out to me that, if it were allowed to pass, it would not commit the Government to this particular site; and it would be a peculiar position if the Administration had - the power to alter the site, when neither Chamber could do so after the confirmation of the Governor General's Message. are told that the Senate has gone beyond its constitutional power; and, in order to get out of the difficulty, the Government propose that, although this quarantine station is urgently required, it shall not be provided. The attitude of the Government is very much like that of the little girl who, because she had not been invited to a party, said she would have a party of her own and invite no one to it. In my opinion, the case presented by the honourable member for Adelaide is an exceedingly strong one. If the Senate refuse to consent to this item being struck out, what position will we then be in? It is a question whether, both Chambers having voted the sum of money, it is within the power of this House to strike out the item; and it is quite possible that the Senate may refuse to accept the deletion. We should then have to fight the Senate on a constitutional point or lose the whole Bill. is the old story of half-measures proving tfutile; and I hope this will be a lesson to - all future Governments not to allow any - conflict between the Chambers to arise simply because one official insists on overriding every one else.",56
305,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Parramatta) i[6.13] - I quite agree with those honourable members who hold that there is no distinction between the items in the Works - and Buildings Estimates and those which appear on the ordinary annual Estimates. I can find no distinction in fact, and, if there be one, it is created by law, pure and simple. We are told that votes for new 'buildings or anything of that kind may be - disposed of by the Senate at its own sweet - will; but will anybody tell me the difference, so far.as old and new services are concerned, between provision for another piece of land in connection with a quarantine station at Hobart, and, say, the purchase of motor vehicles in place of horses for the use of the Post and Telegraph Department? Both are new items for carrying on the ordinary annual services of the Commonwealth; and I have yet to learn that because a work is new it represents ,a new service entirely. It may be a replenishment or substitution-the putting aside of one tool of trade for another tool of trade-bu t according to the definition of the lawyers, we must regard it as a new service. My mind is not equal to distinctions of the kind. Many of these artificial creations of law can have no interest for ordinary laymen, and, at any rate, they are in conflict with facts at every turn. It We seems to me that the Government could not have devised a better way of inviting trouble if tliey had tried. The honourable member for Franklin has told us that, in the case of other similar items, there is no direction at all as to the site on which the building should be placed, and just why that is so I cannot say. I do not believe that the Government had anything to do with the matter, or knew anything about it, but, rather, that the Estimates came from the Department in the ordinary way, and were passed without question. Quarantine is an old-established service that came over to the Commonwealth at the time of Fede : ration, and the proposed vote is for maintenance, if for anything, aiid cannot be construed as being for a new service.",57
306,Sir JOHN QUICK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Is the vote for a new building ?,57
307,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It is for the acquisition of a piece of land, and, in any It case, I do not see how even a new building is necessarily a new service. Supposing a post-office falls down or becomes worn out, and it is necessary to erect a new one, can that be regarded as a new service?",57
308,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,It does not make any difference whether it is old or new.,57
309,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The whole question turns on whether this is one of the ordinary services of the year; and, if that be so, the Senate has no right to interfere with it in any way.",57
310,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I think the honourable member has in his mind the appropriation for the annual services.,57
311,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"If the item does come within that category, as I submit it does, the Senate has no right to do more than to politely suggest an amendment.",57
312,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,It makes no difference in principle whether the .works be repairs or new buildings.,57
313,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,It makes all the difference as to whether the works are ordinary annual services or not.,57
314,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The ""annual services"" means the annual appropriation for the services of the Commonwealth.",57
315,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"That is another question altogether. If this vote is for the ordinary annual services, then* uncier the Constitution, the Senate may not amend it. Why some things may be regarded as part of the ordinary annual services of the year, and others not, I am at a loss to understand.. If we proposed to establish an agricultural bureau, borrowipg scientific paraphernalia and premises from a State, and providing for labour only, the Senate could treat the proposal as it has' treated the item under discussion. It seems to me that it should not do in a negative way what the Constitution declares that it shall not do in a positive way. Most of the votes in the Bill are for the carrying on of services transferred by the States to the Commonwealth. There has been no attempt to argue this question on its merits. We are simply following the procedure adopted on a previous occasion, and in my judgment by doing so are recognising the right of the Senate to deal as it pleases with the financial proposals of the Commonwealth. 1I have always understood that when a money Bill is amended by a Senate, or an upper House, the practice of the lower .House is to lay it aside, and if the desire is to avoid trouble, to bring down a new Bill, in which the proposal objected to is not provided for. motion does not mean what it says. We are not consequentially amending the Senate's amendment, but are taking away the item on which the Senate laid its hands. VVe are saying that we shall not permit that House to do what it wishes to do, in words which do not express our intention. We pre not amending the Senate's amendment, but are merely avoiding a conflict with that body, which it asserts its right to provoke, and, I think, inviting it to do the same thing again on some future occasion. If .the Senate can make an amendment such as it has made, it may amend a vote for an - ordinary annual expenditure, especially where repairs are concerned.",57
316,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Expenditur e for repairs would not be provided for in a Bill authorizing the construction of new works.,58
317,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The substitution of part of one building for another in of Australia; connection with the Postmaster-General's Department might be called a repair.,58
318,Mr AGAR WYNNE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The honourable member is expressing views which differ from those of the legal members on this side.,58
319,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I am afraid I am beginning to distrust the lawyers on this side, who seem to be set on keeping the Government going. Why do not Ministers take advantage of the legal talent among their supporters"" to keep therm straight, instead of constantly appealing; to our lawyers for help? It must be remembered that the Senate, nomore than this House, would lose dignity by backing down; and why should we back: down, when it has done what is wrong?' That is admitted by the Government, andi by the lawyers on this side.",58
320,Sir ROBERT BEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The Works and' Buildings proposals have been separated' from the ordinary Appropriation Bill, for the purpose of enabling the Senate to exercise its constitutional powers.",58
321,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Yes ; and T have frequently objected to that. In myjudgment, it is wrong. If the consensus of opinion is that the Senate has donewhat it should not do, why should we avoid' the issue? Were there any doubt, the Government would be right in doing as theypropose; but, as the Senate is clearly in thewrong, we should stand our ground, eventhough the matter be trivial.

324,Unknown,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL. In Committee (Consideration resumed from 20th September, vide page 3433): Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3In this Act, unless the contrary intentionappears"" Absentee"" means a peison who resides out and includes(a) a person who is absent from Australia at the date when the ownership of his land for the purposes of this Act. is determined, or who has been absent from Australia during more than. - half of the period of twelve monthsimmediately preceding that date, unless he satisfies the Commissioner that he resides in Australia; and (b) a company formed outside Australia; and (c) a company of which more than two-fifths of the shares are held by absentees",58
325,Mr GLYNN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Angas) [8.1] - I should like to make a suggestion to the Government as to an amendment of the definition of "" absentee."" I shall deal now with only one particular definition, because the Attorney-General has intimated that he intends to alter the clause in several respects and really to adopt the principle of the amendment cf which I gave notice by making absenteeism, in the case of a company, depend upon the extent to which its shareholders are absent, and not upon the fact that two-fifths of its shares are held by persons residing outside Australia. I do not wish to delay the passing of the Bill, but I suggest that the definition might be amended by declaring that a person who is absent from Australia "" for at least six months immediately prior to the date"" when the ownership of land for the purposes of the Bill is determined, and not a person who is absent on that date, shall be deemed to be an absentee. I do not think we need go so far as to declare that a man who happens to be absent on the date of assessment is primd facie an absentee. The idea of absenteeism is that a man is absent for such a period that he receives incoine from the lands of the Commonwealth without making some contribution, by his presence, to the industrial enterprise of the community.",59
326,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,But that provision is qualified.,59
327,Mr GLYNN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It includes a man who happens to be absent for more than six months of the preceding twelve months. In other words, an aggregation of absences amounting to six months during the previous year will be regarded as sufficient make the person an absentee.",59
328,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Unles s he satisfies the Commissioner that he is not an-absentee.,59
329,Mr GLYNN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"A man who happens to be absent on the date of assessment must satisfy the Commissioner that his assessment as an absentee is wrong. Will not the Attorney-General accept the principle of the South Australian Act, in which it was originally provided that two years' absence from the State was necessary to constitute absenteeism. In 1904' that term was reduced to twelve months. I suggest that in this case the term be, not twelve months, but six. The matter is not of much substance, so that I shall not move an amendment, but I suggest to the Attorney General that such an alteration might well be made. It would save shareholders and companies a great deal of trouble, and, as a matter of fact, members of this House who go to the Coronation will be deemed absentees under the provision as it stands.",59
330,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Darling Downs) [8.5] I would emphasize the point that a persons who happens to be absent on the day of assessment has to satisfy the Commissioner that he is not an absentee. If the onus is. thrown upon the individual, he may have to gather evidence in the district in which he resides, and to send it to the Commissioner at the Seat of Government, perhaps hundreds of miles away from his home. Is there anything in this Bill which would enable a Deputy-Commissioner to deal with such a matter? A man at Townsville, or Perth, might have to satisfy the Commissioner that he was actually resident there, and the clause, as it stands, simply means a process of centralization.",59
331,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Clause 8 covers the point to which the honourable member refers.,59
332,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Is this a matter which the Commissioner could delegate to a deputy ?,59
333,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Yes .,59
334,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The Commissioner might refuse to delegate it. I simply ask for an amendment on the lines suggested by the honourable member for Angas, and providing that the onus of proof shall not rest upon the individual concerned.",59
335,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"West' Sydney-Attor ney-General) [8.8] - The honourable member for Angas and the honourable member for Darling Downs appear to overlook the fact that while ""absentee"" means prito marily a person who resides out of Australia, it also includes a person who has been out of Australia for a given time, unless he satisfies the Commissioner that he is resident in the Commonwealth. The answer to the point raised by the honourable member for Angas is that a man is not an absentee because he has been out of the country for six or nine months, but because he does not reside in Australia. He is primd facie an absentee if he has been out of the Commonwealth for a given period; but he can satisfy the Commissioner that he still resides here. Whether we make the period six, nine, or twelve months, the difficulty to which the honourable member has referred will remain. In any event, the Commissioner will still have to be satisfied. If we declared that a person should be deemed to be an absentee who had been absent for six months immediately preceding the date when the ownership of his land was determined, and a man were away for seven months, he would still have to satisfy the Commissioner that he was a resident of the Commonwealth.",59
336,Mr GLYNN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The only point is whether we should deem persons absentees who are absent at the date of the assessment, or who are absent for six months immediately preceding that date.",60
337,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The question whether, in regard to this matter, we should really fix a particular date. We have fixed upon the date upon which the assessment shall be made, and there is no reason to suppose that more people will come under the definition on that date than would come uncier it at anv other time",60
338,Mr WISE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Gippsland) [8.TO] - The suggestion made by the honourable member for Angas, regarding six months' absence, is a reasonable one. It seems arbitrary to say that, because a man happens to be out of Australia on the ""date the ownership is determined he shall be deemed to be an absentee.",60
339,Mr BATCHELOR,WATER CONSERVATION AND,If any other date were fixed the position would be the same.,60
340,Mr WISE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"If we fixed upon the six months' term suggested by the honourable member for Angas, the position would be improved. A man might be passing between here and New Zealand, or he might be away on a pleasure trip to the South Sea Islands, but, because he returned a day after the assessment was made,"" he would be deemed an absentee, and would have to satisfy the Commissioner that he really was resident in Australia.",60
341,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Parkes) [8.12]. - I am very much afraid that we shall - suffer a great deal of inconvenience owing to the Attorney-General's unfortunate infirmity. I observed that the honourable member for Darling Downs had to raise his voice to a high pitch to make himself heard across the table. What will happen to honourable members in the benches far removed from the Attorney-General, unless he is fo have beside him some one who will convey to him the criticism from both sides? Coming to the clause itself, I should like to ask the Attorney-General whether the date, which is the pivot upon which it turns, is to remain a sort of algebraic x for some time to come. People who wish to leave Australia will be at their wits' end to know when they may be absent without being deemed absentees.",60
342,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Clause n fixes the date of ownership for the purpose of the tax.,60
343,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Then I wish to know whether there is to be a choice on the part of the absentee himself between the two sets of conditions that are joined by the word "" o r "" in paragraph a, or whether it is to be in the power of the Commissioner to determine under which of the two conditions the absentee shall come. I is can generally construe Acts of Parliament, that having been my business for twenty-five years, but the phraseology of this clause is exceedingly obscure to me, and will be more puzzling to the average nonlegal citizen.",60
344,Sir ROBERT BEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Kooyong) [8.15]. - The Attorney-General might achieve all that he desires by substituting "" and "" for ""or"" in paragraph a. and putting ""or"" in before the word ""unless.''' The mere fact that, by an accidental circumstance, a man happens to be away from home on a particular date should not throw upon him the onus and responsibility of going before the Commissioner and satisfying him that he still resides in Australia. It should be prima facie evidence of his absence if he is absent on that day and has been absent for six months prior thereto. My suggestion would make the clause read a person who is absent from Australia at the date when the ownership of his land for the purposes of this Act is determined, and who has been absent from Australia during more than half the period of twelve months immediately preceding that date, or unless he satisfies the Commissioner that he resides in Australia. As the clause stands at present, it casts an unnecessary duty and responsibility on the taxpayer. I am sure the Attorney-General is desirous of doing what is reasonable, and my suggestion will make the definition fairer.",60
345,Sir JOHN QUICK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Bendigo) [8.18] I urge the Attorney-General to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Kooyong. The mere fact that a man may be absent for one day is hardly sufficient prima facie evidence of habitual residence, or intention to reside, away from the country. The alternative form of the clause is very strange and unreasonable. In the early part of it, if a man is absent merely for a day, it is primd facie evidence that he.resides out of Australia. Then the clause says, "" or who has been absent from Australia during more than half of the period of twelve months. ' The points of contrast seem unreasonable, and the suggestion of the honourable member for Kooyong will reconcile the two alternatives. If the man is absent on the day fixed, and for six months previously, there will be some data upon which a reasonable man could decide that the onus ought to be cast upon him of showing that he is not usually resident out of the Commonwealth. Another respect in which the clause is vague and will lead to trouble, and probably to litigation, is in the use of the word "" resides."" has already been a High Court case on what constitutes residence, and the difference between residence and domicile. We do not want to have any difficulty of that kind raised in connection with the interpretation of this Act. The matter will be simplified if the Attorney-General will put in the word "" usually "" before the word "" resides.""- A man may have two places of residence, and I have heard of people of means who travel northward and southward with the sun.",60
346,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Darling Downs) [8.22] The clause provides that ""'Absentee' means' a person who resides out of Australia."" In the Acts Interpretation Act, "" Australia "" includes the whole Commonwealth of Australia. Has the Attorney General considered whether, in this clause, Australia will include Papua, because we are encouraging many of our people to take up land in Papua, which is our own Territory, and we ought not to penalize them if they are carrying on operations there.",61
347,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"If the definition of Australia does not include Papua, I am quite willing that it should.",61
348,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The honourable member will not make a resident of Papua an absentee for the purposes of this Act?,61
349,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,No .,61
350,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The other point raised by the honourable member for Kooyong is important. If a person happens to be in New Zealand on the day on which the assessment is taken, he is to be prima facie a person .who resides outside Australia. A man could be away for four or five months in any other part of the year, but must not be away on 30th June, the date fixed in this Bill for determining ownership, or he will be classed as an absentee. It seems rather arbitrary to fix on that particular day. I presume that the Attorney-General's intention is not to let a person who is substantially an absentee escape from certain clauses in the 1 Bill. What we are after is the evil of absenteeism, according to the view put by honourable members opposite. I should not like to see the word "" domicile "" put into the Bill, because "" domicile "" is a much more rigid and difficult thing to prove. "" Residence "" is an easier term.",61
351,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It will give rise to more diflxulties than "" domicile.""",61
352,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Perhaps so; but I am looking at the drafting of the clause in relation to the evil we are aiming at. It is There possible for a man to have two or three different residences, and the Courts have held so, for the purposes of many Acts. The Attorney-General would be well advised to adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Angas, and make it a certain fixed period before the date of assessment, instead of making it one particular day. If the Commissioner decided that a person did not reside in Australia, would an appeal lie to the Court?",61
353,Sir ROBERT BEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Unfortunately , it would be difficult to upset the Commissioner's decision.",61
354,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It would only be a matter of' administration on the part of the Commissioner, and if the taxpayer were wrongly assessed, he might be allowed to appeal to the Court. The Commissioner's decision would, of course, raise a strong presumption against the man who was away, and for that reason I want to see the wording of the definition altered as suggested by the honourable member for Angas. If the man happened to be away for a period of six months before the date fixed, that ought to be quite sufficient.",61
355,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Fawkner) [8.28] It seems a great hardship that, because a man is away for one day, he should have to go before the Commissioner, and be put to a great deal of trouble to prove that he is not an absentee. Whether we agree with the policy of taxing absentees or not, we all wish to define what an absentee is. The Attorney-General would simplify matters if he made the paragraph read a person who is absent from Australia during more than half of the period of twelve months immediately preceding that date, unless he satisfies the Commissioner that he resides in Australia. That would be an absolutely straightforward definition, and would suit the ordinary man very well. We should then have a true definition of ""absentee"" which anybody could understand; and as the public have to obey this law, it ought to be made as plain as possible.",61
356,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"West Sydney-Attorney General) [8.31] - There seems to be some scrt of idea that it is possible for a man to go away from Australia for a day and come under this clause; but where is he to go to? This does not happen every day, but only the first time the ownership of the land is determined. Some particular time has to be fixed; and it is very obvious that a man must have gone somewhere, and he must satisfy the Commissioner that hie resides in Australia.",62
357,Sir JOHN QUICK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"This question will arise every year, seeing that there is nual assessment.",62
358,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Not necessarily; the question of assessment is quite apart from that of the ownership of the land.,62
359,Mr GLYNN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"That may have beenintended, but it is not so stated in the Bill.",62
360,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"As to what is connoted by residence, for the purposes of the Bill, it is perfectly immaterial whether a man has two residences or ten. This is not like setting up a claim for an electoral right, or under a will, or for nationality; and the Commissioner has to be satisfied that the taxpayer has his permanent place of abode here. The New Zealand Act defines ' Non-resident trader "" as a person 1 who carries cn business in New Zealand without having his fixed permanent place of business in the Dominion; and every person who is out of Australia and does not reside here is an absentee.",62
361,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,l s that the definition given in this Bill?,62
362,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I am now speaking of the New Zealand definition of "" non-resident trader.""",62
363,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,That definition would not be a guide in our Courts.,62
364,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The object of that definition is quite different from that in the Bill, which defines an "" absentee"" as a man who does not live in Australia. No conceivable juggling of words could make a man who lives cut of Australia a resident in the country. As to persons who move about, and are sometimes in England and sometimes here, it is for them to show the Commissioner that they are still resident here.",62
365,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Will the Commissioner's decision as to residence be final? At first I was inclined to the view that it would not; but after looking more closely into the clause I think it will.,62
366,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I suppose a man may appeal.,62
367,Sir ROBERT BEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It is a question of fact, and, therefore, the decision will be final.",62
368,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"As a man may appeal from an assessment, 1 should say ""he could appeal on this point. I do noi know whether he could or not, but it is quite obvious that somebody has to decide, and it would be better that the Commissioner's decision should be final, it being a question of fact that he ought to be able to determine. I do not think there is the slightest necessity for the amendment suggested by an an- the honourable member for Kocyong. As to "" Australia "" not including Papua, I intend to move- Thut after the word ""Australia,"" line q, the words "" and the Territories under the authority of the Commonwealth"" be inserted.",62
369,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Parkes) [8.37]. - This portion of the Bill fairly bristles with difficulties; ancl I think we are all anxious to make the measure clear and unmistakable. The Attorney-General has not, I think, disposed of the question raised by the honourable member for Kooyong ; and the position would perhaps be better explained by a concrete illustration. A man may be away in New Zealand for. perhaps only a week. The Attorney General has treated the absence of an Australian citizen as an event which may not occur frequently; but I think that if he, on any particular day, were to ascertain the number of citizens temporarily out of Australia, he would find that it amounted to many hundreds. Under this clause, as it now stands, there would have to be an inquiry into every one of these cases by the Commissioner, whereas, under the amendment of the honourable member for Kooyong, a man would not only have to be away from Australia on a particular day, but, in addition, must have been away for six months out of the year prior to that day.",62
370,Mr MAHON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,That is the amendment of the honourable member for Angas.,62
371,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Quite so; and if that amendment were adopted it would get rid of all these difficulties. The Attorney-General, however, seems disinclined to accept that amendment; and. therefore, we have to turn to the alternative amendment of the honourable member for Kooyong. As I say, by this amendment the Commissioner would be relieved from hearing hundreds of cases that must occur; and - it cannot in any way reduce the chances constituting a man an absentee by requiran ing that, in addition to being away on that day, he has been absent from the Commondetermining wealth for six months. As to the words relating to an absence of six months the previous twelve months, I should like the Attorney-General to consider whether they sufficiently define what constitutes six months.",62
372,Mr MAHON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"But those words are to omitted, according to the amendment of the honourable member for Angas. - Mr Bruce SMITH - I am assuming that that amendment is not accepted, ing that the Attorney-General has suggested an incompatible amendment. Bill does not say how the six months are - to be made up in a later portion of the clause; and I should like to know what the position would be if a person absent for two months, then in Australia for two months, then absent for two months, and then in Australia for two months, ancl then absent for two months more.",63
373,Mr MAHON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"If we insert the word 4 ' consecutive "" it would meet the case.",63
374,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I am only now suggesting the difficulties that call amendment. The Attorney-General will see only a month. that it requires some word like ""continuous"" or "" consecutive"" to make the intention perfectly clear. The Attorney-General seems to think that because ""residence"" has been very carefully defined in a Zealand Act, therefore the difficulties the definition are removed from this It has been pointed out that word ""domicile"" has already acquired a technical meaning which, I think, all lawyers understand; but the AttorneyState General, instead of using that word, troducing another, which may give rise .an enormous amount of litigation. honourable gentleman must be aware that, although the word has been very carefully defined in New Zealand, the decisions New Zealand Courts would have a very sultory, if relevant, bearing in the of Australia. He knows how little notice, - even, is taken in one State of Australia the decisions of the Judges in another; .that argument may be applied a fortiori to party ? New Zealand. Then, again, the definition in New Zealand is not even a decision of the Court, but is a statutory arbitrary. - definition, which is absolutely irrelevant - in any interpretation of this Bill.",63
375,Mr WISE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Gippsland) [8.46]--Ther is another reason why absence on a particuto of lar date should not make a man prima facie absentee, and that is the difficulty to which the Attorney-General has referred of the date contemplated. The Bill defines ""absentee "" as a person absent out of from Australia "" at the date when the ownership of his land foi the purposes of this Act is determined."" The Attorneythe General says that that means when ownership is first determined; but I agree with be those who say that there must be a determination every year. Absence on a particular date should not make a man an absentee, though absence for six months seemight be held to do so.",63
376,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Every subdivision The of property will involve a new assessment.,63
377,Mr WISE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Yes . There must be a fresh assessment whenever there is a purchase or subdivision of property, and a were re-assessment every year.",63
378,Mr GLYNN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Angas) [8.48] - There is considerable legal difficulty in defining "" residence,"" and still greater difficulty, as the honourable member for Parkes has pointed out, in defining ""domicile."" A man may be domiciled in a place in which he has not resided for ten years, and he for may be domiciled where he has resided for ""Absentee"" is another difficult word to define, and the Bill leaves its definition to a Commissioner. In the South Australian law an arbitrary definition was adopted, "" absentee "" being taken New to include, at first, every person absent of from, or resident out of, the State for two Bill. years immediately prior to a date fixed; but the period was subsequently reduced the to one year. Every man who is absent from the State for twelve months is an absentee; but a man who resides out of the for six months, though he may be an is inabsentee, must be proved to be one, and to I do not know that there is a case in which The such a man has been dealt with as an absentee. The Bill gives no appeal from the decision of the Commissioner, because, as of lawyers know, when magistrates are perdemitted to act at their discretion there is no Courts appeal. The decision of the Commissioner will, therefore, be final. Is it for us to of surrender our right of definition to the and Commissioner, who will be an interested",63
379,Mr WISE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,And who may be very,63
380,Mr GLYNN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The Assher Shea case, in which the Admiralty for two years ree fused to allow a boy charged with forgery be tried, although he declared that he was innocent, and, when it unbent, had to admit in Court that he was innocent; the Osborne case, and others, show the need for checking the growth of bureaucratic control. While the Opposition is desirous, subject to proper criticism, of expediting the consideration of the Bill, I ask Ministers to accept an amendment of the definition of "" Absentee,"" ancl move That after the word "" Australia,"" where first occurring in paragraph a, the words "" for at least half the period ot twelve months immediately preceding "" be inserted. The amendment adopts the suggestion of the honourable member for Fawkner.",63
381,Mr MAHON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Coolgardie) [8.55] Parliament should not cause the taxpayer more trouble than is necessary, and the object of the Bill will be met if the amendment be adopted. An absentee will then be defined as a person absent from Australia for at least six months prior to the date when the ownership of his land for the purposes of this Act is determined, unless he satisfies the Commissioner that he resides in Australia. The difficulty of defining the word ""resides""--and the definition of ""domicile"" is even more difficult, because of the technical requirements attached to the term-coul d be got over by substituting the words "" his permanent home is in Australia."" Every man of common sense would know what those words meant. It would be very harsh that a man should be treated as an absentee merely because of his absence from Australia just prior to the date of the first assessment. The amendment will improve the Bill, and minimize the friction which all new legislation of this sort engenders. I therefore recommend the Government to give it favourable consideration.",64
382,Mr ATKINSON,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Wilmot) [8.58] - I hope that the Government will accept the amendment, which will certainly improve the Bill. ""Absentee"" is defined as "" a person who resides out of Australia,"" and there are persons who have never been here, but who have invested money here, and whom it is not fair to penalize because they have done so. I do not think that Ministers desire to prevent the flow of capital into this country, which would be the result of a special tax on persons living out of the country, but connected with companies carrying on business here. I believe in making the investment of capital in Australia as easy as possible. The more money that comes here from abroad, the cheaper it will bej and if there is one thing that, is really essential to the development of a country,' it is cheap money. I should like to see the definition still further improved, but I suppose it is hopeless to expect the Government to take a further step in that direction. I trust, however, that they will, at least, accept the amenrlment that has been moved.",64
383,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [9.1] - The amendment and the suggestion made are quite unnecessary to secure the purpose which we have in view. This is an attempt to treat a person who resides out of Australia, and is an absentee, differently from a person who resides in the Commonwealth. The question of domicile, as such, does not arise. It is a question, not of a right or of a vested interest, but of fact-Does a man reside in Australia or does he not? The honourable and learned member tor Parkes said, that the word ""resides"" is vague. For the purposes of this Bill it is most precise. Although a man may have many residences, personally he can reside in only one. For the purposes of this Bill he can be in only one place at the one time.",64
384,Mr DEAKIN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It is not simply a question of fact, but a question of satisfying an official.",64
385,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Of course it is.,64
386,Mr DEAKIN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,And there is no appeal.,64
387,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The honourable member makes that observation as if it were profoundly original.,64
388,Mr DEAKIN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It is not a question of originality, but of equity.",64
389,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member will permit me to remind him that he has not been following this debate, and is, therefore, quite ignorant of what has been discussed. The point that we were discussing is as to what constitutes an absentee. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat says that, under this clause, an official will have to be satisfied. It is perfectly obvious that if the amendment be carried, an official will still have to be satisfied. The honourable member for Angas simply proposes to give the person concerned a longer period of grace. If a man is absent for more than six months out of twelve in any one year, he will still have to satisfy the Commissioner that he is a resident of Australia, and, therefore, this question of equity, on which the honourable member for Ballarat lavs such great stress, will again be violated. This question of equity is to be a question of period. Six months, we are told, will be a violation of equity, and a seven-months' period will be perfectly satisfactory. Equity, again, is a question of numbers. The honourable member for Kooyong suggests that paragraph a be amended by substituting the word "" and "" for the word "" or."" How much further would that take us?",64
390,Sir ROBERT BEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It would avoid the difficulty and trouble of an appeal to the Commissioner to satisfy him, and that is an important matter.",65
391,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The Commissioner would still have to be satisfied.,65
392,Sir ROBERT BEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"No ; if a man is lowsabsent on the date of the assessment he will, under the clause at it stands, have to satisfy the Commissioner, and the point is the meaning that we should fix upon a six-months' liable period.",65
393,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable memwould ber has not read the clause. Under it, the section. Commissioner has to make an assessment. It also providesIs he to take the mere statement of a man that he has not been out of Australia for he more than six months? It is a question of evidence, and. under the amendment, the man concerned would have to satisfy the Comfor missioner, just as he would have to satisfy him under the clause as it stands. Here we have an iridescent bubble ingeniously and laboriously blown. First, we have one and then another difficulty presented. We have a difficulty suggested as to the differAustralia. ence between residence and domicile; then another ingenious honourable member strikes a concrete idea which baffles his power concrete expression. Other suggestions are made, and finally we have the honourable member for Wilmot, who, having demade, nounced the whole principle of declaring person who does not reside in Australia an the amendment. absentee, expresses the warmest approval of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Angas, although it proposes differentiate between those who reside Australia and those who do not. Although it is true that each year, if a man is abto sent, he will have to satisfy the Commisfog sioner that he is resident in the Commonwealth",65
394,Mr WISE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I thought the honourable member said that that would have to done only once.,65
395,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"If a man is an sentee year after year, and still claims be a resident, or if he has been so long of Australia that there is a primd facie case against him, he will have to satisfy the Commissioner that he is a resident in the Commonwealth. One honourable member spoke of a man who was always making excursions. Nothing ought to be easier than to satisfy the Commissioner that a man, although a tripper, resides in Australia; but a man ought not to be able to remain out of Australia for an indefinite period, and still claim all the benefits of residence here, without offering some explanation to the Commissioner. The Land and Income Tax Assessment Act of New Zealand, as amended in 1908,fixesa date as we do, and periods as we do, and proceeds to define an absentee, in section 54, as folNotwithstanding anything hereinbefore contained, every taxpayer who on the thirty-first day of March in any year is an absentee within of this section shall be assessed and for graduated land tax at a rate greater by fifty per centum than the rate at which he have been assessed independently of this Every person shall be deemed to be an absentee for the purposes of this section unless has been personally present in New Zealand for at least one-half of the period of four years immediately preceding the year in and which he is assessed for graduated land tax. There we have a definition of ""Absentee"" which is purely artiftcial, whilst here we are attempting to define what is naturally and obviously an absentee. An absentee,"" first of all, is a person who resides out of There can be no objection to that, and the definition also includes a person who is absent from Australia on the of date when the assessment is made, or - who has been out of the country for more than half the year in which the assessment is unless he can satisfy the Commisa sioner to the contrary. I cannot accept",65
396,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Wentworth) [9.12] - I should like to have one matter cleared up to before this clause passes.

397,Mr BATCHELOR,WATER CONSERVATION AND,That is not the Attorney-General's fault.,65
398,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"No ; I think it is his be misfortune. The fact remains that none of us seem to know at present what these abprovisions mean. We have already into dorsed the principle that an Australian out who leaves Australia to live abroad shall pay an absentee tax, but what I want to know is whether a man who has never lived in Australia, but who has invested money in Australia, is, under this Bill, to be taxed as an absentee?",65
399,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Of course he is.,66

I wish to place it on record my belief of that this is the most serious clause in the The Government cannot get away",66
403,Mr BATCHELOR,WATER CONSERVATION AND,AV e do not want to. We brought it in for this express purpose.,66

Of course, the fact that they have they no votes may make my honourable friends such ready to hit them. I can remember the to same gentlemen who are against "" absentee "" capital pleading most piteously for pensions to be given to Chinese, provided that they had votes, and, incidentally, were acres of that naturalized citizens. I hope the Opposition will state their views on all the clauses of the Bili, and on this one in particular. But I do not think it. is our duty to keep hammering along until the Attorney-General hears us, and, us, comprehends us. It is not our duty to do more than enter our protest, in but I again warn honourable members opi f posite that they cannot make a man living it will in England, who is willing to lend his Is not money somewhere, come to live in Ausgivtralia, simply by putting on this tax. All they can do is to make him send his money and when that happens their constituents will suffer in their daily",66
405,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,It is taxing our own people and leaving the Chinese cook-shop,66
406,Mr KELLY,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Untaxed , but not unvisited ! If the Government really desire to make the tax apply so as to prevent perI do sons leaving Australia, I am willing to help them so far as I can in that direction, pietaxing those who' are absentee Australians in the ordinary sense as understood in the he constituencies. But I hope they will not rerun mad and try to damage employment in Australia by taxing the capital that is been in sent to the country. Those associated with the land know that our virgin country depends on capital for its development. The more capital we get from abroad, the more development is possible; but the Government are now, by hitting foreign capital, hitting at men settled on the land and men working in the cities. They seem to think that if they put on a tax and sign it "" by the grace of Fisher "" they can compel, not only capital, but the capitalists behind it, to come to Australia and live under the domination of a Government which has shown its readiness to confiscate land values !",66
407,Mr SPENCE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Darling) [9.23] - After that noisy appeal to the gallery, we might get back to the subject before us. The honourable member talks about the £360,000,000 of British capital that is going to be carted away. I do not know how the owners are going to get it, unless somebody else is ready to buy out the interests that they have here. T should like to examine the clause from a layman's point of view. I presume we propose to find out who are the owners of the land before we impose the tax. Having once found out the owner, so long as he retains the land, the annual reimposition of the tax does not raise the question again. The clause begins by stating clearly that those who reside out of Australia are absentees. There is no difficulty about that, but how are you to know whether a man resides out of Australia or not? When you are looking for the owner of a block of land you have to find him. If he is not in Australia, is lie a permanent or a temporary absentee? That must of necessity be found out. If an owner is not found within Australia when the assessment is being made, it does not follow that he is not a resident of Australia. If he is' absent, there must be sortie evidence that he is only temporarily absent.",67
408,Sir ROBERT BEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The trouble is that he has to go to the Commissioner and satisfy him that he is a resident.,67
409,Mr SPENCE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"He must satisfy the Commissioner. Whete is the difference hetween the Commissioner hunting up the man and asking him questions, and the man going to the Commissioner and satisfying him that he is a bond fide resident? It is the easiest thing possible for him to prove that he is a resident. Where is the risk of litigation over that? A Commissioner charged with administering an important measure like this would not refuse to ac[129] cept genuine evidence submitted to him. The only point on which technical difficulty might arise is in the operation of the six months' provision, but the facts there are also easily provable. Australia, being an island, a man cannot get away from it without there being a record of his departure. It seems to me that a great deal more noise has been made about this definition than there is any justification for.",67
410,Mr BRUCE SMITH,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Tb e honourable member is not within a mile of the question under discussion.,67
411,Mr SPENCE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Perhaps so, but I have not seen such wonderful brilliance from the honourable member. Clever as he may be, I have heard him say some rather stupid things, and on questions of this kind I am prepared to put my common sense against his. The honourable member for Kooyong suggests that the word "" and "" should be substituted for the word ""or,"" so as to make it necessary that the man should be away on the day of assessment, and also for six months prior. Would not that necessarily mean that both conditions would have to be fulfilled before a man could be regarded as an absentee? A man might be in Australia on the day of assessment, and still really be an absentee under the six months' proviso.",67
412,Sir ROBERT BEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,What is intended is that if he is absent for six months it shall be prima facie evidence of his being an absentee. The alternative is that he must satisfy the Commissioner that he resides in Australia.,67
413,Mr SPENCE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The clause is simplicity itself as it stands. If a man had to go to any legal expense to prove that he was a resident, it might be a different thing. To alter the clause might make it more complicated. The suggestion of the honourable member for Kooyong would create additional difficulties, and bring about a risk of litigation which does not appear in the clause as now worded.",67
414,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Fawkner) [9.30] Before we decide this question, I should like to make one final appeal to honourable members opposite on the broader question which has already been touched upon by the honourable member for Wentworth. As a business man, and as an old Australian deeply interested in the country, I can assure the Attorney-General that immense good has been done by the great capital invested here by people who have never seen the Commonwealth, and never can be resident here. Their homes are in the Old Country, where a good many of us .come from; and merely because they do not reside here we propose to impose a special penalty on them. I quite understand that this desire to tax absentees arises from the 1 fact that some, though not a great many, Australians, having made money here, have, to the neglect of their Australian duties, spent their money abroad. The history of Ireland ha*! also had some effect in this connection. In that country there have been many land troubles and evictions by absentee landlords. At the same time, the advantages to Australia of the investment of some £360,000,000 of money have been enormous; and I can give one concrete illustration in a company engaged in pastoral pursuits in Queensland. I may say that I have no objection to give the name of this company to the Attorney-General if he so desires. In the ten years from the ist July, 1899, to the 30th June, 1909, this company spent in working expenses in Australia ,£391,963 16s. iod., which the working men of the country received; in rabbit destruction, ,£21,873 2s. sd.; in Government rents, £90,327 ios. 6d.; in income and land tax-and there is a big income tax in Queensland, which has to be paid sometimes when there is no income,£12,231 16s. 6d.; in improvements-and again the fencer, the dam-maker, and the well-borer benefited-£[78,13 1 2s. 4d. It ""will be seen, therefore, that the workers of Australia have received, in consequence of the operations of this company, the sum of ,£594,527 8s. 7d. in ten years. Now let us see what the English shareholders got from their investment. The total dividends received by the same shareholders in the same period aggregated £75,900 ",67
415,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Was this company formed outside of Australia?,68
416,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Yes.,68
417,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,It is proposed to strike out sub-clause b.,68
418,Sir ROBERT BEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,And to tax shareholders individually!,68
419,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"A great many of the shareholders in this company are resident in England, and, therefore, cannot get any exemption under the proposed amendment. The original subscribed capital of the company was £1,100,000, but. owing to adverse seasons, that was reduced in 1908 to £[632,500 by writing off £[467,500 as dead loss.",68
420,Mr SPENCE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,That loss would not be all on one property-the company would have investments in other properties?,68
421,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It was practically all on one property. I am quite with honourable members opposite in regard to the absentee who leaves his property here to live abroad, when Australia is good enough for anybody to live in. I admit that when our forefathers came here their idea was to make enough money to enable them to return and live in England. That was natural enough on their part; but we who have lived here for some time desire to stay here, and it would be a pity if we were to stop the flow of this capital, and send it somewhere else. An enormous amount of capital of this class accumulates every year in Great Britain, France, and Germany; and if it does not come to Australia it will go to our commercial rivals-the Argentine, Canada, and other countries which encourage such investment. I know that the absentee is a hated individual, but I ask honourable members to pause and think over this matter.",68
422,Mr BATCHELOR,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"What ground is there for the accusation that the absentee is a "" hated individual "" ?",68
423,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member knows what a splendid cry "" Let us tax the absentee"" is on . a platform, when the absentee is not here to defend himself, and the appeal is made to people who do not think seriously.",68
424,Mr WEST,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The honourable member has already admitted that the absentee ought to be taxed.,68
425,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I think that the man who leaves his property for us to police and defend ought to be taxed.,68
426,Mr BATCHELOR,WATER CONSERVATION AND,There the honourable member gives his whole case away ,68
427,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The honourable member himself pays through the Customs, whereas the absentee does not.",68
428,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I agree with that; but, in getting at these few absentees, the we are striking at investment from abroad. I do not know much about politics, or law, but I do know a good deal about finance; and I can assure honourable members that if a tax is imposed on a particular class of capital, investment will be checked-investor s will button up their pockets, and, with the world for their oyster, will send their money to Argentine and Canada, where they are not taxed, but encouraged.",68
429,Mr BATCHELOR,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The capitalist will go wherever he can make most money, tax or no tax.",69
430,Mr FAIRBAIRN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I quite agree that capital is most sensitive, and always goes along the line of least resistance-lik e water, it finds its own level. I hope honourable members opposite will pause before they proceed further on lines which may do immeasurable harm to Australia.",69
431,Mr DEAKIN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Ballarat) [9.40] - I do not propose to devote even a sentence to the important question raised by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, as to a fair method of apportionment by which the absentee may be required to discharge his several obligations to the Commonwealth. This Bill not only does not provide for any apportionment, but makes no pretence to establish any principle on which it could or should be framed. It taxes absentees in a way that, if it can be justified, must be on other grounds from those referred to by the honourable member for Fawkner. But if wewish to be just, instead of casting the supposed absentee upon the mercy of the Commissioner, who will ' satisfy himself ' ' on good evidence, or bad-o n the most imperfect or the most complete information - at a time when he may happen to be' sanguine or saturnine, and leaving no chance of appeal, no matter how or why he is "" satisfied "" - if the question whether the alleged absentee is, or is not, a resident in Australia, is left to be determined as a fact",69
432,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,B y whom?,69
433,Mr DEAKIN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,B y the Court.,69
434,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Whether it is in a good humour or a bad humour, I suppose?",69
435,Mr DEAKIN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The Court is judicial, and adjusts itself to the fact.",69
436,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"And the Commissioner does not, I suppose?",69
437,Mr DEAKIN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The Court will have the Commissioner's view before it. The decision may be a matter of immense importance to those concerned, and it ought to be given by an impartial tribunal not subject to the hurry and worry of ordinary office business. The Commissioner's opinion would have great weight with the Court; but the question should be lifted out of the atmosphere of the official chamber, where it would be settled by a single individual on information supplied by subordinates. It should be dealt with in a judicial atmosphere. All this, of course, depends on whether the taxpayer is venturesome enough to go to the Court; if he does go, and fails, he will, of course, be mulcted in .costs, and the Commonwealth will not suffer. Unless the supposed absentee has good grounds for challenging the decision, he will not, for his own pocket's sake, take any action. Thus the Attorney-General can get all he seeks by this clause; indeed, he will probably get a great deal more than he thought to have asked, but we have now to do the best we can among many injustices. The Attorney-General can have a tribunal he cannot impeach, and his Commissioner's authority need not be undermined. There would be the satisfaction which cannot be obtained from any individual who is not judicial by training and habit, not having been chosen for such qualities, but as an assessor of land. There would be a judicial guarantee of a fair and impartial hearing between the appellant and the Government. This is asking a very slight concession which might make the measure a little more acceptable than it is. I understand that the clause has been closely scrutinised, and its various other defects exposed, before I entered the Chamber; and, therefore, do 1 not propose to do more than lay this one suggestion before the Attorney-General.",69
438,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [9.45] - In reference to the general objections to the taxing of absentees, I have only to say that the Bill errs in the direction of moderation. The New Zealand . Act taxes the absentee at a rate 50 per cent, higher than that which the resident has to pay, and the Victorian Bill contains a similar proposal. It is a sound principle of equity, finance, and economics that every person should pay something towards the cost of governing and defending the country in which he lives, or from, which he draws his wealth, and it is not unfair to require those living out of a country to pay a little more in special taxation than those who live in it, who, by doing so, contribute in general taxation more largely to the revenue. As an instance of the manner in which landed properties are benefited by the energy of the community, let me say that, whereas the unimproved value of the land of the city of Sydney was assessed about six years ago at £[19,500,000, the authorities expect the new assessment to reach £25,000,000. That is, the unearned increment has been increasing at the rate of £1,000,000 a year. Absentees who own Sydney properties have benefited by that increase. The proposal that the taxpayer shall satisfy a Commissioner, and not a Court, that he is a resident, is contained in every land and income tax measure to which I have referred. It was proposed by Mr Watt that every person should be deemed to be an absentee unless he satisfied the Commissioner that he had been personally present in the Commonwealth, though not necessarily continuously, for at least half of the three years preceding that in which he was assessed for tax. It is obviously to the advantage of the country that there should be a speedy and effective means of deciding who must be taxpayers, and at what rates they shall be taxed. If a taxpayer is dissatisfied with an assessment, he can go to the Court, and make out a case against it. Should honourable members opposite be able to produce precedents outweighing those which we have in favour of a Court, and not the Commissioner, deciding who must pay this tax, I shall be glad to consider them; the precedents which I have followed make the Commissioner the sole arbiter, which is a sound and business-like arrangement.",69
439,Mr GLYNN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Angas) [9.52] - I agree with the Minister that it may be desirable under some circumstances to empower the Commissioner to say that a man is an absentee, but the Victorian Bill to which he has referred did not provide that absence on the day on which the assessment was made should primd facte cause a person to be treated as an absentee; it treated him as an absentee only if he had been absent for eighteen months, and even then gave him the light of showing that he was not an absentee. I should have no objection to the adoption of the South Australian provision, that if a man is absent from, or resides out of, the State for twelve months, he must be regarded as an absentee. My proposal is wholly reasonable, and I have asked for as little as could be asked for under the circumstances.",70
440,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Adelaide) [9.54] - It is a generally accepted principle throughout Australia and New Zealand that absentee land-owners should pay more than resident land-owners for the protection given to their property ;- but it seems to me that the proposal to leave it entirely to the Commissioner to determine who is an absentee, and to make it possible for a person who has been away from Australia for only two days to be so rated, is open to considerable objection. No one desires that absence from the country for a few days, or even for a few months, should render a man liable to be treated as an absentee. I am not hostile to the Government, but I wish to understand the Bill.",70
441,Mr DEAKIN,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"If the honourable member comes to understand it, he will not support it.",70
442,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The Leader of the Opposition is at liberty to take that view. I understood the Attorney-General to say that the question of ownership occurs only once. So far as paragraph a is concerned, a land-owner who is absent from Australia on the date when his ownership is determined may be taxed as an absentee, but a man who resides out of Australia subsequently to the determination of owner' ship may do so for two years without being taxed as an absentee.",70
443,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,That is not so. Look at clause 14.,70
444,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,That clause provides for the annual furnishing of returns.,70
445,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,There is a fresh assessment each year.,70
446,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Yes , but not an annual determination of ownership, which, according to the Attorney-General, occurs only once.",70
447,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I did not use the words in the sense in which the honourable member is applying them.,70
448,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Once ownership is determined it will, as a rule, remain unquestioned until there is a sale or subdivision. Clause 14 requires the annual furnishing of returns. If a man is absent 011 the date of the determination of his ownership of the land, or for more than six months out of the twelve montlis immetliately preceding that date, taxation as an absentee is at once put upon him. But if, the day after the determination, he leavesfor England, or elsewhere, he may be absent for two years, and as ' long as his attorney furnishes an annual return, and does not disagree with the annual assessment, then, under paragraph a, he will not be an absentee. He will only be an absentee if the Commissioner claims that he resides out of Australia; and as - soon as such a claim is made, litigation will follow as to what constitutes resilience outside Australia. In these circumstances, it would be preferable for us to clearly (Infine what is an absentee within the meaning of this Bill. For instance, I should object to a man being out of Australia for more than twelve months and not being taxed as an absentee.",70
449,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"If he were away on an invalid trip for twelve months, the honourable member would not make him pay as an absentee.",71
450,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I am not so sure tnat I would not.,71
451,Mr GROOM,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Yet , even if a man were absent for six months, he could satisfy, the Commissioner, under paragraph a, that his permanent residence was in Australia.",71
452,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I admit that. would say right out in the Bill that if an individual were away from Australia lor twelve months he should be regarded as an absentee. That is really the provision in the South Australian Act. Originally two years' absence constituted absenteeism; but practical experience showed that advantage was taken of such a lengthy period, to the cost of the revenue, and the term was, therefore, reduced to twelve months. Under the South Australian Act, if there be an annual assessment a man cannot iemain twelve months out of the State without constituting himself an absentee, and so subjecting himself to extra taxation. Such a provision is preferable to one leaving the matter to the will of the Commissioner. I ask the Attorney-General why we should impose taxation as an absentee on an individual who is only absent on one particular day in the year-the date on which his ownership is determined ? I am confident that, as the paragraph stands, once the question of ownership is determined, a man may go away for a couple of years, or even for five years, i in the opinion of the Commissioner, that absence does not constitute absenteeism, without being made to pay taxation as an absentee. That would be wrong, and would be too wide a power to leave to the Commissioner.",71
453,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [10'.5] - The honourable member for Adelaide is in error in supposing that a man whose ownership has once been determined under paragraph a could go out of Australia, and remain away for two, or five, years, as the case may be, and still pay on the residential rate. Under paragraph a a person who is absent from Australia on the date that the ownership of his land is determined, or who has been absent for more than half of the twelve months immediately preceding that date, is liable to be taxed as an absentee. Then, again, under clause 14, it is provided that every taxpayer shall in each financial year furnish returns, setting forth a full and complete statement of all land owned by him at noon on 30th June-that fixes the date-wit h such other particulars as are prescribed. I do not think there is the slightest doubt that every year a man will be asked, amongst other questions, "" Do you reside in Australia?"" or ""How long have you been out of Australia during the last twelve months?""",71
454,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I admit that it rests with the Commissioner. 1 Mr HUGHES - No ; diat is another matter. This relates to the furnishing of certain particulars as to facts. A man may instruct another to say for him, "" I am not now in Australia "" ; and tiien, clearly, he will be an absentee, subject to certain provisions; whilst, if he says that he has been absent for more than half of the previous twelve months, he will come within the same category, and be taxed as an absentee, unless he satisfies the Commissioner that he is resident in Australia. The honourable member proposes to fix an arbitrary period, and to say that if a man is out of the country for more than six months he shall be taxed as an absentee. That would create a difficulty. An absentee for the purposes of this Bill must be one who fails to fulfil certain conditions. And what are they ? We are trying to get at those who really live out of Australia. I suppose that many honourable members, like myself, have been out of Australia for six, eight, or ten months. If the definition suggested by the honourable member for Adelaide were inserted, they would be taxed as abf , sentees if they went away for that period. There would be no appeal, and they would be unable to put forward the fact that they were natives of this country, or that they had been here for fifty years; that all their interests were here, and that they were only temporarily absent. We do not mean to include such cases. We fix a limit, and we say, "" When you go beyond that limit you must satisfy the Commissioner, that although you have been out of the country you are still a resident of it . "" That is a very simple thing to do. I remember a case relating to what constituted residence under the Electoral Act in New South Wales. A man had been out of his electorate for something like fourteen months, and yet he established the fact that he was a resident of it. All that a man will have to do under this clause will be to prove that he is an Australian citizen. I hope that there will be no attempt to fix an arbitrary time, and to make Australians absentees merely because they happen to be away on a trip. I am reminded by my honourable colleague the Minister of External Affairs that we propose to send citizens to England to be trained as officers. Then, again, officers of my honourable friend's Department might be attached to the High Commissioner's office in London, or officers of the Department of Home Affairs might be sent abroad, and under my honourable friend's proposal'' they would be absentees. It is not suggested for one moment that officers sent abroad in this way are absentees, and we ought not to treat them as such.",71
455,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Parramatta) [10.12] - The whole question resolves itself into one as to who is to determine what an absentee is. Is that question to be determined by the Parliament or the Commissioner? In the two measures which the Attorney-General has quoted, Parliament itself has fixed the definition of ""absentee."" Under the Victorian Bill the Commissioner has not to decide whether or not a man is a resident. simply to determine whether he has been absent continuously from the Commoiiwealth for at least eighteen months out of three years.",72
456,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Not at all. A man's absence is admitted, and the question is"" In spite of that, are you still a resident?""",72
457,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Unde r this Bill that is so, but not under the Victorian Bill.",72
458,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,It is so under the Victorian Bill.,72
459,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Unde r the Victorian measure, if a person can show that he has been personally present in the State for more than one and a-half years out of the three years' period, he cannot be assessed as an absentee.",72
460,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Neithe r can he be so assessed under this clause.,72
461,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Unde r this clause it is left to the Commissioner to determine whether or not a man resides here.,72
462,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Not at all.,72
463,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,Then I do not understand the meaning of plain English.,72
464,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"If it means that, then all I can say is that that is not the intention.",72
465,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It certainly does. Under this clause, if a man could satisfy the Commissioner that he was resident in Australia he might be absent for five years.",72
466,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Of course, he might.",72
467,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"But that is not the position under the Victorian Bill. If a man has been absent eighteen months out of three years, then the Victorian Commissioner has no choice in the matter, but must declare him to be an absentee.",72
468,Mr BATCHELOR,WATER CONSERVATION AND,That is less liberal than this Bill.,72
469,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,In one way.',72
470,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I put that forward in reply to the honourable and learned member for Ballarat to show that the man had to satisfy the Commissioner and not the Court.,72
471,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"But , incidentally, the honourable member told us that the man had to satisfy the Commissioner, not that he resided in Australia, but that he was within the limits that had been definitely prescribed by Parliament.",72
472,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,I did not say so.,72
473,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Parliament , both in Victoria and New Zealand, makes its own definition of absenteeism.",72
474,Mr WH IRVINE,WATER CONSERVATION AND,This Bill is better He has than that.,72
475,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Of course, so far as that is concerned ",72
476,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,In the other case an arbitrary definition is fixed.,72
477,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,And properly so .,72
478,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,T t is infinitely worse than this Bill.,72
479,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"At least it is more straightforward. This definition will let people go free from this tax who ought not to be released. I have in my mind's eye a man who makes it a practice to go away and spend three or four years away, but his home is still in Australia, although he and his family are nearly always absent. That man ought to be treated as an absentee, if we are going to tax absentees, because he spends nearly all his time away. He does not, as has been stated, pay our Customs duties here, or take on the responsibilities of a resident citizen. He is an absentee to all intents and purposes, although his home is here, but under our definition he would be let off.",72
480,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,A little while ago it was said that this definition was too harsh ; now the honourable member says it is too lax.,72
481,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"It is too harsh in other respects, - but in that particular regard the Victorian and New Zealand propositions are much more sensible. You cannot properly call a man an absentee if he has been away for only six months out of twelve. Why not give him a longer time in which to travel whilst still being regarded as a resident of Australia? My point is that we ourselves ought to fix and determine what constitutes residence in Australia, and what constitutes absenteeism abroad. The honourable member said the Victorian absentee tax was 50 per cent, more than that paid by residential taxpayers, but he took good care not to tell us the amount. As a matter of fact, it is still about 25 per cent, below the residential tax fixed in this Bill. The honourable member evaded a proper analogy between the two taxes by betaking himself to percentages. 1I have yet to bring myself to appreciate the necessity in a young virgin country of taxing absentees so heavily.",72
482,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The Victorian proposal was 3d.,73
483,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Yes , and that meant 4^d. for the absentee, on the highest rates only. The Government's proposal is fid. for residents and j d . for absentees, so that our tax on absentees is 2jd. higher than the Victorian.",73
484,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"In New Zealand also it is 50 per cent, more, and there they go up practically as high as we do.",73
485,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"As the honourable member is very eager to show that this Bill is not such a stiff dose, is he prepared Edwards, G. B. to make it the same as the Victorian or New Zealand measures? The New Zealand tax is much less than ours. Why does not the Attorney-General make this provision a little more liberal, ancl let the House Groom, L . E. fix the definition?",73
486,Mr BATCHELOR,WATER CONSERVATION AND,That would make it much less liberal and more arbitrary.,73
487,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Le t us make the minimum period a little more liberal. This provision will be interpreted in all cases by the Commissioner, and no Commissioner would be safe if he required anything less than six months' residence out of every twelve to constitute a resident taxpayer. That would be the invariable rule.",73
488,Mr ROBERTS,WATER CONSERVATION AND,There is nothing in the Bill to determine that.,73
489,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"I know, but for his own sake and protection the Commissioner would not dare to depart from the' Bill unless the strongest reasons were shown. Any person reading the Bill with a view to deciding what constituted absenteeism would regard this definition as a direction to demand six months' residence out of twelve in ordinary cases, and in ordinary circumstances.",73
490,Mr HUGHES,WATER CONSERVATION AND,The plain wording of the clause absolutely precludes that construction.,73
491,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"The clause says the Commissioner has to be satisfied. Why not strike all these things out and leave the decision entirely to the Commissioner ? Or why not put in eighteen months out of three years, as in Victoria, ancl still leave it to the Commissioner? Let the Commissioner determine whether a man is an absentee or not, but do not give the Commissioner power to make a man an absentee unless he proves the contrary, if he happens to be away from Australia on the day on which the assessment is made. Give the taxpayer at least six or twelve months' grace. So far from this provision being more liberal than that of New Zealand or Victoria, it will work out very much less liberally in practice.

By no conceivable means can there be any confusion as to the liability of the shareholder under this proposal. It is determined by the fact of his residence. Whether a man is a shareholder in a company or has an interest in an estate outside a company, his - liability will be determined in precisely the - same way; that is to say, as to whether in his case the rating is to be that of an absentee or of a resident. If he lives out of Australia and is a shareholder of a company formed out of Australia, but owning land in the Commonwealth, then to the extent of his interest in the property of the company in Australia he will as a shareholder of the company be called upon to pay taxation at the absentee rate.",76

I take the case of a company formed in Australia which is afterwards sold and the head-quarters removed to London. What the honourable member for Melbourne and other honourable members wish to know is what will be the position of shareholders of that company resident in the Commonwealth. Is the company to be treated as an absentee company? I gather from the' Attorney-General that a clear distinction is to be made, and that shareholders residing here are to be treated as residents, whilst those residing in London are to be treated as absentees. But in the case I have mentioned the company will simply pay the tax out of profits and declare the dividend afterwards, and their Australian shareholders will therefore be paying their portion of a tax at the absentee rate.",76
540,Mr FISHER,WATER CONSERVATION AND,"Wide Bay-Treasurer ) [10.59] - There seems to be a good deal of confusion of thought in connection with matter. I may be wrong, but it does not seem to be difficult to me. As the Bill originally drawn, it was provided that he a company should be regarded as an absentee company if more than two-fifths of the shares were held by absentees. On closer examination that was found to be inequitable. A clause has, therefore, been very carefully drawn by the legal advisers of the Government to provide that so much of the capital as is held by people who are not out resident in Australia shall be assessed at absentee rate; and as regards the value we of the shares held by people who are resito dent in Australia, it will be assessed at the to value of their holdings in the company as other residents of the Commonwealth.",76
