2,The Clerk,Unknown,"Petition s have been lodged for presentation as follows and copies will be referred to the appropriate Ministers: Australian Symphony Orchestras To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that we are deeply concerned at the threat to the continuation of symphony orchestras throughout Australia posed by the I.A.C. and Green reports. We believe that the Government should not allow the symphony orchestras of Australia to be reduced in any way Your pedtioners humbly pray that your honourable House will take steps to ensure the continuation and growth of our symphony orchestras, thereby ensuring that the quaUty of life of the people of this country shall be maintained. And your petitioners as in d uty bound will ever pray. by Mr Ellicott, Mr Baume, Mr Lionel Bowen, Mr Donald Cameron, Mr Connolly, Mr Dobie, Mr Gillard, Mr Graham, Mr Hurford, Mr Charles Jones, Mr Martin, Mr Moore, Mr Neil, And Mr Ruddock and Mr Wentworth. Petitions received. To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: (a) That the use of uranium as a source of energy is currently unacceptable as it presents problems including radioactive waste, military implications and environmental degradation. (b) That there can, at present, be no assurances that radiomantling active materials exported for peaceful purposes will not be used in the production of nuclear weapons. (c) That there is not, as yet, any known safe method of disposing of radioactive wastes, nor is there likely to be. (d) That the export of uranium from Australia is internationally irresponsible and is not, in the long term, of benefit to Australia. (e) That the export of uranium from Australia discourages importing countries from investing research and development funds in finding viable alternatives. (0 That only the overdeveloped industrial nations will benefit from Australian uranium and the gap between these countries and the energy starved third world will increase yet further. (g) That the securing of land rights by Australian Aborigines, promised by successive governments, is prejudiced by uramum mining. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will immediately cease the mining and prohibit the export of uranium until perfectly safe methods of final disposal for radioactive wastes have been guaranteed; will gready increase expenditure on research into safe, clean and inexhaustible sources of energy; and will aid underdeveloped countries in their efforts to secure a fair share of the world's energy resources, while at the same time honouring its obUgations to the future of humanity.

Petitions received. Uranium Budget 1976-77 To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: The Budget will increase unemployment to unprecedented and crisis proportions at a time when hundreds of thousands of Australians, especiaUy school-leavers, young workers and apprentices, are without work; the Budget completes the disof Medibank as a simple, effective universal health insurance scheme, providing basic coverage for the total community; the Budget, by its heavy cuts in urban and transport programs, will worsen the quality of life available to many Australians; the Budget will compel State governments to reduce their services and increase charges; the Budget reduces spending on Aboriginal Affairs by 30 per cent and returns expenditure on Aborigines to pre-1972 days; the Budget seriously disadvantages migrant groups, most notably in employment and health, and leaves room for concern over the future of ethnic radio; the Budget, despite the Government's earUer rhetoric about defence threats to Australia, continues to hold the size of the armed services at present levels; and the Budget, despite all the above, still cannot be expected to reduce Australia's annual inflation rate below 12 per cent. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the 1976 Budget be redrafted to provide for economic recovery within the guideUnes laid down by the Australian Labor Government's 1975 Budget.

The humble able petition of the undersigned citizens showeth: (a) That we, residents of the Local Authority areas of Maryborough, Hervey Bay and Woocoo the decision of the Australian Government to refuse export licences for minerals from Fraser Island, thus causing the cessation of mining, was unwarranted, unjust and based on a report compiled from much inconclusive evidence, much of w hich was uncontested due to a legal technicaUty.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Parliament give due and early consideration to (a) having the Honourable the Prime Minister visit the of urgency, to make his personal with a view to having the Government reverse its decision, (b) have the Honourable the Prime Minister investigate at first hand, both the massive human and economic impacts his Government's decision, (c) The appointment of a final assessment committee which will weigh the value of Fraser Island in its unmined state against both the value compensation payable to the numerous parties aggrieved by the Government decision and the value of Fraser Island in a mined and rehabilitated state.

3,Mr WALLJS,SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to a report by the Canberra columnist Cassandra over the weekend that the Government has organised a deal with Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd over the future of the shipyard at Whyalla? Is there any substance in this report? Further, has the Prime Minister contacted the South Australian Premier, Mr Dunstan, in reply to submissions made by the South Austrahan Government on the future of the Whyalla shipyard? If not, when can the South Australian Premier anticipate receiving a reply to those submissions? Further, is the Prime Minister aware of the pubUc concern expressed by the Whyalla City Council this week at the absence of any reply from him to their correspondence of some time ago on the same subject?",21
4,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY,"If there is any correspondence from the city of Whyalla I shall certainly examine it, look at the records and provide an answer forthwith. As far as the South Australian Premier is concerned, basicaUy we have been looking to see what came out of the negotiations with New South Wales and with the New South Wales Premier because there we were dealing with a government which had direct responsibiUty for its State dockyard. We have certainly made no deal or arrangement with Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd in relation to Whyalla, although I have been told that BHP beUeves that even under existing arrangements it will continue to employ its present employees, not. necessarily in shipbuilding but in some parts of the BHP activity. As far as the Government's general propbefore osition in relation to this matter is concerned, we believe that if the taxpayers were to be asked to deUberatprovide substantial additional sums, which the have a Minister for Transport advises me would have or equalled about $20,000 per man for each of the 2 Australian National Line ships, then in return staff, there should be a proper industrial relations contract which would make sure that those ships matters were built as cheaply as possible. I think the of other honourable gentleman will agree that an additional subsidy of $20,000 a man for the and building of those ships compared with the cost a prooverseas is a pretty heavy additional burden on Australian taxpayers. of this resolution, so far effect Because of our concern for the centre-in this orders. case Newcasde-and because of our concern for the men and their families the Government was and is prepared to entertain that situation in certain circumstances. Those circumstances are that the industrial relations contract would stipulate that there would be no changes as to wages and conditions beyond those that appUed through the normal wage tribunals, that there would be a guarantee that no strikes or demarcation disputes would occur during the period of construction of the vessels, and that there would be an indemnity if delays were caused by strikes and bans. We have pointed but that such a contract is not unusual overseas. We have also pointed out in response to those who have said that the indemnity was harsh that it is entirely in the hands of the trade unions concerned whether that indemnity clause would be invoked. There were dispute settling procedures which, as I understand it, were agreeable to the unions and to the Government. If there are reasonable dispute settling procedures by which both sides can abide, then there ought not to be the necessity for strikes or demarcation disputes and matters of that kind. I want to put safety issues and health issues to one side because they are always in a special categoryrequiringspecial treatment. I am talking about industrial disputes of different kinds, not of the safety kind. If the indemnity clause were invoked it would be invoked only in circumstances in which a commitment not to strike had in fact been broken. We believe that the Commonwealth could ask nothing less if there were to be a contract for these ships to be built at Newcastle. So far there has not been a response from Mr Wran. The Government is waiting for that response because the ball is in his court. One of the things that I regret very greatly is that Mr Wran- I am not sure whether it was out the front door or out the back door-and Mr Hawke, through one of his hats-I am never importance quite sure which one-condemne d the contract before the men at Newcasde had an opportunity to cast their judgment upon it. The understandthat ing I had come to with Mr Wran in the disof cussions about these particular matters is that there would be no discussion or dispute in public about the contract until the men concerned had an opportunity to discuss it and look at it calm atmosphere. The Government believed that that if there were pohtical dispute over the nature of the contract it would lead to an inevitable clusion. It is to my very great regret, therefore, that once Mr Wran issued the contract to Hawke and to the trade unions, it immediately became a matter for discussion and dispute. Really, the decision of the men at Newcasde was pre-empted before they had an opportunity to make a decision. I believe this example of trade union leaders pre-empting the decision of members of trade unions. If the contract had been put to their own people in a and quiet manner, they might well have accepted an arrangement that was fair. Mr Wallis-What about Whyalla?",21
5,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY,"The question of sidered Whyalla is very much contingent on what haping pens in New South Wales. We are waiting for Mr Wran. One of the proposals that was put also for? was, of course, that if the 2 ships were to be built at Newcastle under equivalent arrangements the floating dock ought to be built at Whyalla. NA",22
6,Mr HYDE,QUEENSLAND PHOSPHATE,"My question is directed to Minister representing the Minister for National Resources. Is the Minister aware of the statement by Mr J. M. Tyler in his chairman's address the Broken Hill South annual general meeting that 'In Australia the Commonwealth Governbe ment has now advised the company and the tive Christmas Island Phosphate Commission of its prejudiced. objective to have Queensland phosphate admitted to the Australian market?' Wdl the Minister tell the House whether it is the objective of the Government to admit this company to Australian market. If so, on what terms? Will indicate whether use of Queensland phosphate rock will at any stage be allowed to increase the price of fertiliser to the Australian farmer?",22
7,Mr NIXON,QUEENSLAND PHOSPHATE,"I am able to confirm that the enjoying Government has taken a decision and has advised Mr Tyler of Broken Hill South desirous of supporting his company in getting the Duchess rock phosphate into the Australian phosphate system. The Duchess rock phosphate find is of enormous magnitude and of great to Australia, having regard to the decline of reserves of phosphate in other parts of the world. I have informed Mr Tyler by letter the Government supports the introduction as much as 250 000 tonnes of Duchess rock phosphate into the system this year and 500 000 tonnes next year. It is quite apparent and would had be apparent to the honourable member for in a Moore that the larger the quantity of phosphate can be placed in use, the lower will be the costs that ensue. As to the final terms and negocontiations that the Broken Hill South Company has entered into with the Christmas Island  ment on that matter other than to say that negotiations are ensuing at the moment. It is the Australian Government's wish that the final price to the Australian farmer be maintained at as low a is a classic rate as possible. NA calm Mr UREN-Has the Treasurer considered the impact of the devaluation on manufacturers' costs? How does he expect them to adjust for the price increases which they will have to bear in respect of imported components? Has he conthe long term effect on the manufactursector of the balance of payments surpluses which will result from the mining boom he hopes",22
8,Mr LYNCH,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"I do not know whether the honourable gendeman is expressing any serious concern about the function of manufacturing industry. Certainly the decision to devalue has the been welcomed by manufacturing industry throughout the country. It has been welcomed because it will provide a lift, particularly in the to employment area. So far as import tariffs are concerned, I simply say that the Government will looking at areas where the enhanced competiposition of Australian industry will not be NA",22
9,Mr MCLEAN,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"I address my question to the the Prime Minister. How can the Government prehe vent the advantages that devaluation brings to the Australian economy being dissipated, particularly with regard to wages pohcy, control of the money supply and possible short term profiteering by those Australian companies now higher rates of protection? that it is Mr MALCOLM FRASER-The honourable gentleman has raised matters that very obviously were in the Government's mind when it made the decision concerning devaluation. At the same time as announcing devaluation the Treasurer announced action in 3 other areas of policy. One concerned the deferment of certain Commonin wealth expenditures throughout the rest of this year into next year. Another concerned acdon relation to the money supply-honourabl e bers will agree, with regret, that this is necessary in inflationary circumstances-whic h involves some increase in interest rates. I think that end of this week necessaiy action will be taken that people can judge the extent and the impact of it. When they do judge it, I believe that no will be able to give any credit to the somewhat wilder allegations that have been made over last day or so in relation to action in that The action which was proposed to the Governstrong ment and which has been accepted is reasonable and moderate, and it will be judged to be reasonhave able and moderate. In addition, the Government will be reaffirmbiUty ing the view that it has taken on the wages front. We have said on a number of occasions that we regret that there has not been a greater opportunity to test the general common sense of the avin erage Australian rather than paying too much its many credence to the views of some leaders in this area open who I believe do not exemplify the views of the great majority of the people whom to represent. There are other areas also which I believe people have not looked at adequately. One of the reasons why costs in Australian industry are high is that many industries are operating at 60 per cent or 70 per cent of capacity. As we get the inevitable transfer from imported goods to Australian produced goods under the circumber stances of devaluation, production runs in Australia should increase. That in itself should give manufacturers an opportunity to contain costs. Any manufacturer with a sense of responsiternational biUty certainly ought to do his utmost to do just that. Indeed, one major manufacturer which Ueves that its production will be able to increase very greatly, not only for domestic markets but also through renewed and greater access export markets, has indicated that the price of its products should be held now for a considerable period. It makes a particular product that should have flow through effects into many different industries.",22
10,Mr HURFORD,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,Whic h manufacturer is that?,23
11,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"I have no intention of naming particular manufacturers in this House. The effects should flow through into a number of different industries. One of the things that people need to understand is that, while there will be some people, as there always are, who will take advantage of an opportunity that given to them to act in a selfish way rather than in the national interest, I believe that they will be the minority. I would believe that at this time we are coming to a stage where a great majority in of Australians are recognising that there is a memnational task that involves aU Australianswhether they are management or labour-n o matter where they come from. In defence of by the some people who might be accused of speculatso ing, let me point out to the House that there are people who have imported goods from overseas, one who have bought on traders' credit and who will be paying in 6 to 8 weeks time at the different the rate of currency. People who have bought goods area. from overseas on that basis obviously have grounds for changing a particular price but people who paid on the old basis obviously not and should clear their stocks at the old price. If they have any sense of national responsithat is precisely what they will do. In other mentwords, there are many things that the Governcan do in this particular matter but there are also many things which involve a cooperative effort by people right around Australia different activities. The Government, for part, will continue to explore every avenue to it so as to be successful in the objectives they purport that it has set itself. DEVALUATION: OVERSEAS NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask a question of the Treasurer. Is it a fact that many resource rich but capital poor countries such as Venezuela, a memof the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Mexico, the PhiUppines and Spain have in the last year borrowed amounts in excess of $1 billion not by going into hock with the InMonetary Fund or letting profiteers take them to the cleaners but by borrowing from bemerchant banks at modest interest rates for periods of 5 to 7 years, or, in the case of the Philippines, from 5 to 8 years? Why did not the to Government take this option of borrowing a further billion dollars to solve Australia's short term economic problems rather than the devaluation option which, to quote his own recent statement, 'would increase unemployment, would have inflationary effects and would certainly be generally unhelpful'?",23
12,Mr LYNCH,BORROWINGS,"If there is one thing that the Leader of the Opposition consistently represents in this place and outside, it is the Khemlani mentality. I would Uke to say more about that but because of a matter being dealt with outside this Parliament it is not appropriate for me to say any is more about it. Hopefully, the time may arise when one is able to say more about that. I can well imagine the Leader of the Opposition seeklike ing to borrow himself out of trouble to the extent of $1 billion or $4 billion. It so happens that far as this Administration is concerned responsiwas bly we recognised that any option which prethe sented itself to the dimension of $ 1 billion would, of course, have been an option which would not have created confidence; it would have created a sense of continuing uncertainty. The decision to detailing devalue has completely dissipated that uncerThis tainty, much to the chagrin of the honourable gentleman. I say to him, notwithstanding the It goes on: reference to Venezuela and other countries, that The we do not see that as our example. Rather, we rein sponded to a situation which had been developthat ing with the assistance of some people very close issue to the honourable gentleman during recent Cape months. That decision having come to a point of inevigation tability we looked, of course, at the possibility borrowing in excess of $ 1 billion. But certainty, no; uncertainty created, yes. If the honourable gentleman knew anything about international financing he would be aware of a term called would 'conditionality'. This Government was not prethis: pared to put itself into hock to that extent. yond that, of course, with the absence of any cerjournalistic tainty about the question of devaluation on basis of a decision to borrow recognised that we were not prepared to afford the losses which that sum would have had in itself.

Will the Minister inform the House Australia will be attending that meeting? If it is, what stance will it adopt in those discussions? Further, can the Minister say what progress he has made in getting Japan to increase quota access for Australian beef after year. the severe cuts announced by Japan? Is it true that, as recent newspaper reports indicate, the were European beef market is opening up for Ausquestion, tralian beef exports?",24
20,Mr SINCLAIR,MEAT EXPORTING COUNTRIES,"The honourable gendeman has directed his question to 3 specinc areas. first is with respect to the United States of America. The difficulties in relation to beef access to the United States market in 1977 concerned with the necessity for negotiations be concluded with the Ford Administration which, I understand, remains in control of the White House and the United States Administraguard tion until 20 January 1977, yet the period within which beef will be admitted to the United States will be largely in the term of President-elect Carter. The discussions on 6 December and diplomatic thereafter to which the first part of the able gentleman's question was directed therefore are most important. Australia will be represented at an appropriate level. We regard the negonificant tiation as most significant as it presents the portunity for selling beef to what is still Australia's principal beef export market, which marketsis of tremendous importance for the revival of the Australian catde industry. I mention 2 aspects in relation to the American market which have caused much comment. One is the extent to which the free trade zones were used by Australia allegedly to by-pass the restraints. This is not true as the whole question of the inclusion of the free trade zones was cussed first with the United States Administrathe tion at thetimewhen negotiations for the 1976 voluntary restraints were first initiated. Indeed, prior to the signature of the correspondence indictment which set levels of voluntary restraint, the United States had given the Australian Government to understand that it did not wish the free trade zones to be included. It was negotiation that they were excluded. The other aspect of American trade that concern to Australia is the suggestion that some way there was a significant shipment of meat through Canada into the United States that thereby Australia also avoided the implicaimports tions of voluntary restraints. gation also. There is no doubt that individual Canadian importers were in a position to ship their product where they wished. But the United States has not raised the question of Australian beef being shipped in that way. Our principal made concern is that we get a sufficient price for product sold to Canada, and that, following the determination arranged with the United States, access to Canada also be opened up for the 1977 With respect to the other 2 markets which mentioned in the honourable gentleman's I will deal first with Japan. The Japanese Government has now advised us that the 20 000 tonnes which were aUocated in a reThe cent announcement for the first half of 1977 are to apply only to thefirst3 months and, therefore, there will be an expectation in January for a are further allocation which we would hope would to bring us up to at least approximately the quota allocation for thefinal6 months of this year. With respect to Europe, it is true that the saferestrictions on beef imports are said to be lifted on 1 April 1977. However, a new import regime is still to be concluded by the European community. Australia is pursuing every possible initiative to try to ensure that we do honouragain obtain reasonable access to the Community for Australian exports. This year, in spite of restrictions, we have exported a not insigquantity of beef to the Community. The op-general projection is that demand will increase there next year. In all, in each one of these should perhaps Mr UREN - On e minute!",25
21,Mr SINCLAIR,MEAT EXPORTING COUNTRIES,"The prospects of the cattle industry, I know, do not interest the Deputy Leader of the Opposition one whit. Unfortunaquota tely, there are a good many men, women and children in this industry in Australia who are disprobably as impoverished as any other sector of Australian community. The failure of the Labor Party to recognise the phght in which these people are currently suffering is a great of it. In all, the markets for Australian beef I see opening up during 1977. Certainly, we are pursuing every possible initiative to ensure maximum possible access for Australian beef to as a result of that those markets. DEVALUATION: PRICE INCREASES is of Mr KEATING- I desire to ask the Treasurer a in question relative to the devaluation. Will the Treasurer explain clearly to the House on what and basis he beheves an increase in the price of will not contribute to an increase in domWe reject that aUeestic prices?",25
22,Mr LYNCH,MEAT EXPORTING COUNTRIES,"I shall give the honourable member a brief answer. The fact is that the Press statement and the statement made yesterday it perfectly clear that of course there will be the an inflationary impact. I remind the honourable gentleman, whose memory of these matters is far too short, that when the Labor Government devalued in September 1974 it took no offsetting action to stop the inflationary impact of that devaluation at that time. I also remind the House that in that month the then Government had months cover in reserves of $2,965.3m. Clearly, without offsetting action at that devaluation was grossly inappropriate and grossly inflationary. This Government it perfectly clear that, recognising the inflagentleman tionary consequences of a decision to devalue, inevitable as it was, there was a need for consefor quential action in firming and strengthening 3 remaining arms of pohcy. I remind the honourinternecine able gentleman of the action I have know foreshadowed as far as fiscal policy is concerned. I remind him also of the action on the monetary front, as well as of the Government's position in forthcoming cases before ConcUiation and Arbitration Commission. Tbis Government has made it perfectly that it will do everything possible to offset inflationary consequences of the decision- a cision which, at the same time, in the jurisdiction of the honourable gendemen on the Opposition benches, will provide a very real lift to the ing sector. He must recall the number of mines which have closed recently and the lack of conployment fidence which emanated there. This decision is direct assistance to the mining industry; it will seek to restore the competitive position of Austry? traUan manufacturing industry; it will assist rural industry; and it wdl assist import competitive industries.

The honourable will resume his seat.

Can it be confidently expected that the effect of the devaluation will be to reduce unemin Tasmania substantially and to boost of greatly primary and mining industries, manufacturing industry and the Tasmanian tourist indusIs the Prime Minister aware of suggestions that this decision alone could be the means of providing additional jobs for more than 1000 beneficial results Tasmanians?",26
27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,CURRENCY DEVALUATION,"This decision, coupled with other decisions which the Governmade in relation to Tasmania, should be of the enormous advantage to the State of Tasmania and to all industries in that State. The honourable gendeman will be aware that a few days ago other half of the freight equalisation scheme Tasmania was announced. That scheme is now operating both ways. The later announceapplied retrospectively to 1 July so that industries would get the full benefit of commitment in this area. The decision in relation to devaluation will clearly be of great assistance to industries in Tasmania and States. It will be of great assistance to farmers in Tasmania who have been very hard hit, for a variety of reasons. I believe that our dewould do very much more for employment in Tasmania than the famous and much heralded 24-point plan of the Labor Premier, Mr I believe that our decisions will be of great advantage to the industries. I do not think 24-point plan was going to do a great deal. If I could make one comment about one part of the 24-point plan to gain a benefit under a provision for a rebate of payroll tax one had first to sack a person and then to reappoint him. If one did that one would get the rebate from the State Government. It seemed a very odd way of going about business. I hope that companies such as the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company Limited, which has been in difficulty because of the price of per, will review their decisions. It had become quite clear from conversations that the company had been prepared to carry through its programs in the expectation that the world price of copper would rise. It was prepared to run with circumstance in the intervening period. Now, with the increased prices that will accrue as result of the decision to devalue, the company could be in a position equivalent to that which had expected for the next several months and could still employ, I beheve, a considerable number of those people whom it said it would retrench. The total position of the company that financially would be the same as expected. Therefore, I believe the company has an obligation to review its position and its decision in relation to its employees since, as I well know, the company understands that it is in a remote area. It is not just a question of the company and the employees, it is a question of a community which is utterly upon this operation. Overall, I expect the decision to devalue to be of great advantage to Tasmania, as it will great advantage to the whole of Australia. I am delighted to know that responsible members of the trade union movement in Tasmania have heralded it as good news for Tasmania. can be thankful that Mr Neilson has also welcomed it as good news for Tasmania, I cannot altogether wish him well when his election day comes because I believe the State could be much better governed by a different administration. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam- I ask the Minister for Post and Telecommunications a question. Three the question? weeks ago he told me that he had asked his Department to consider the report of Sir Keith Waller on Radio Australia, in consultation with other departments, and that he hoped to bring something to the Parliament in the near future. I now ask: Is it a fact that his Department and the Treasury have now recommended that Radio Australia be closed? Since he has tabled Mr Green's recommendation on Radio Australia, why is the Government so dilatory in, or reluctant to, table Sir Keith Waller's recommendations? Can the Minister announce the Government's decision before the Christmas recess?",26

In view of previous publicity given to this matter I wish to inform the House that I find nothing in the documents which suggests any breach of law or any other impropriety on the part of the late Senator Paltridge or any other person.

50,Mr CONNOLLY,RADIO AUSTRALIA,"My question, which is supplementary to the question asked by the Leader the Opposition, is directed to the Minister for Affairs. Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to speculation that his Department assume control of the operations of Radio Australia? WUl the Minister inform the House was whether the speculation has any substance?  drawn to that speculation. As the honourable member stated that his question was supplementary to that asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I shall refer to a matter raised by the Leader of the Opposition. I simply say with the support of the Prime Minister and, I am sure, with the support of the Minister for Post and Telecommunications that if any officials want to put a recommendation to us that Radio Australia be aboUshed, then that recommendation will fall on deaf ears. Radio Australia will remain strong and independent. That leads me to the question raised by the honourable member. I said previously in an interview on radio with the Australian Broadcasting Commission that I considered the reputation of Radio Australia to be excellent, and much of that reputation was derived from its very independence. I consider it extremely desirable for Australia to have a clear and strong overseas voice, capable of bringing reliable, unbiased information to neighbouring areas of particular significance to this country. Radio Australia has an excellent reputation in that regard, especially in Asia and the Pacific. The service by Radio Australia is a most important part of Australia's equipment in the representation of Australia internationally and also for people to be able to assess for themselves in an unbiased way the viewpoints broadcast by the network through Radio Australia. The Government does not accept the view that Radio Australia should be under the control of my Department. As I said before, Radio Australia will remain strong. It will remain independent and will not come under the control of the Department of Foreign Affairs. NA NA",28

61,Mr SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) by proposing that a definite matter importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The undesirable economic consequences of the ment's Health Insurance arrangements. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in theirplacesremarkable",30
62,Mr HAYDEN,HEALTH INSURANCE,"The Governties ment's health insurance arrangements are responsible for undesirable economic consechoice quences. They are responsible for those undesirquently able economic consequences at a time of coneven siderable difficulty in managing the affairs of the nation. They have added greatly the problems of economic management. They are ill-advised. There are 3 main thrusts to this argument Firstly, at a time when consumer mand ought to be stimulated and not cut back, least of all cut back severely, the proposals for the imposition of compulsory charges for all wage-earners-wit h few relatively minor excepas tions-result in a reduction in spending power in the community and, accordingly, a reduction in consumer demand. Secondly, the imposition charges, whether they be the Medibank levy or compulsory subscriptions to private health insurance funds, results in a reduction in per300 sonal incomes and in living standards. Thirdly, as as result of these combined factors the areach. rangements will result in industrial unrest which in turn will lead to costs which will have to be borne by the community at atimewhen this sort of unrest ought to be avoided as much as. possible. I will deal with the first of these points, the proposition that the arrangements have been responsible for a substantial reduction in the capacity of consumers to demand goods and services in the market place. In the course of a full year the cost of the Government's proposals, in of charges that have to be met by the comthe munity, reaches something like $900m. The community will not receive for that additional outlay anything more than it was receiving beBill fore. That is to say, the new Medibank arrangements do not provide more medical services or 1976. more hospital services and they do not provide more money for the States for their pubhc hospital services than would have been the case under the original Medibank arrangements. So the community is paying near enough to $900m more for something which it was receiving already. Accordingly, its capacity to demand goods and services in the community is reduced that amount, and the cost of living will rise as of public a result of this action. Incidentally, it is not without its irony that a Governgovernment declaiming its opposition to compulsion in the community should be responsible, by its stated intention, for conscripting half of the community into private health insurance funds, into commercial organisations, just as it conscripted youth into Vietnam. I always find it that the conservative coaUtion parcan always declaim that they are opposed to compulsion and that they want freedom of in the community; yet they resort so freto the imposition of compulsion. Ifindit more remarkable that the media scarcely economic find it worth commenting on. to Let us look at the effects of a reduction of $900m in consumer spending in the course of a fuU year. It is the equivalent of something Uke de24 000 houses costing $35,000 each. That represents between 40 per cent and 50 per cent of the worth of new houses in a year. That is the sort of cutback that is imposed on the economy a result of this decision. It is the equivalent of about 170 000 motor cars valued at about $5,000 each. That is about half a year's production in of this country. It is the equivalent of about 1 700 000 refrigerators costing $500 each. The production in this country in a year is about 000 refrigerators. It is the equivalent of about 17 million women's frocks costing $50 Clearly I am not suggesting that any one of those in the totaUty I have quoted will be the sort of reduction suffered in that particular industry. I have given those comparisons to iUustrate the severe cutback on consumer demand which will arise as a result of a reduction in consumer spending by the private health insurance rangements of the Government. It might be suggested that this decision reduces the deficit. The situation with which have been confronted is that there has been much ill-informed preoccupation with the deficit. The Government, which claimed that its first objective was to get a recovery under way in thesituation economy, proceeded to implement economic those poUcies which would be directly responsible for further accentuation of the recession in the try and which would be responsible for a cutbackquite in activity in the business sector, the private tor. We hear so much about the private sector that it has become almost part of the mythology of our community, almost a spiritual incantation, as though it is quite improper to criticise anything about the private sector where the conthat servative coaUtion Government is concerned. that is so, why has the Government decided to opposition cut back consumer spending by nearly $900m year? That reaUy erodes the position of the vate sector of the economy and activity generaUyrecord within the community. We need consumer cent spending now, if there is any genuineness, any grain of sincerity, in the Government's claims that it wants to support the private sector and stimulate a recovery. Let me take up the second point that I tioned, namely, the undesirable consequences which wiU arise from these health insurance ar-increase rangements and the effects on personal Uving standards and on incomes of people. Let me takeintroduction the case of a person on average weekly earnings.Government The compulsory subscription to Medibank will viously be about $4.50 a week. That represents a 17.6 per cent increase on tax to be paid this year. Just imagine if the Government bad been honest for change, if the Government had been faithful its objectives contained in its statements about purpose at the last election, if it had said that was its intention to increase taxes cent instead of claiming to reduce taxes, or had said that it was its intention to dismantle assault Medibank on a massive scale instead of pledging wiU provoke to retain the integrity of the Medibank program. increases or offsetting People's Uving standards wiU be reduced as result of the compulsory charges that have met. It is true that we proposed that there be charges to fund the original Medibank prodisruption posals. That was opposed by the conservative co-will aUtion when in Opposition. The opposition was based on a matter of great principle, as It articulated by members of the then Opposition: They were opposed to the compulsory contribucies tions impUcit in that scheme. The situation in which the present Government introduced the arMedibank levy and imposed the compulsory membership of private health insurance funds on those who decided not to belong to the basic weMedibank scheme represented a totally different tooset of economic circumstances from those which appUed when we were in government. It was quite inappropriate for the Government in the in the course of this year to introduce charges because, as I repeat, all they serve ato do is to reduce, in the course of this year and counnext year when economic circumstances will be difficult, the capacity of people to demand sec-goods and services in the community. That must be one of the most important objectives if the Government is sincere when it says that it wants to see a recovery in the economy. It is remarkable, and it ought to go on record, this Government, which campaigned on the If promise to reduce taxes and which asserted its to high taxes, is in fact the highest taxaing government in the history of this country. priThe Government has been responsible for a increase in taxation this year- a 25 per increase in personal income tax, an increase of $ 1,755m, a record increase to a record level of $8,775m. Of course, in the case of the Medibank tolevy it is seeking to bypass itsresponsibilities to the community in the form of tax indexation. By menintroducing a special earmarked charge-the Medibank levy-the Government has sought to its total tax take to considerably above what would have been justified with the of tax indexation, except if the cared to come clean, which obit does not, and state to the pubhc that it is a high tax government and that in its recent Budget its purpose was to increase taxes substanatially. It increased taxes by a far greater proto portion than they have ever been increased It itsincreased personal taxes in the community to a it level unparalleled in the history of the nation. by 17.6 per Those are the hard facts. if it The unfortunate consequence of this direct on people's personal pay packets is that it union demands for offsetting wage benefits to cover the costs awhich workers now nave to meet, as a result of to be the charges which the Government has implemented. This is turn will lead to industrial of one form or another. That again contribute in its own way to inflation and to the cost of mamtaining the Australian economy. is aU so unnecessary, because it is quite undesirable for the Government to adopt those poUin the given economic circumstances with which the nation is confronted at the moment. I put it to the Government that it has been quite dishonest in its dealings with the trade union movement in Australia on the issue of the costs Medibank and how they will be treated when they feed into the consumer price President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Hawke, went away from Canberra several months ago after consultation with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the to issue- I rely on my recollection of newspaper reports at the time-convince d that the Governcan ment would ensure that the increases in the costmeal of Uving arising from the Medibank levy and from compulsory private health insurance would be fed into the consumer price index and wouldchange be fuUy appUed in the wage indexation process before the Conciliation and Arbitration situation Commission. What has become increasingly clear is that the Government, by devious measures, has sought topoints avoid all of that increase going into the consumermember price index. It is quite clear from figures which were submitted to the Commission-projection s of quarterly movements in the consumer price index for all of thisfinancialyear-that the level of the consumer price index anticipated by the Government for the December quarter of about per 4V4 per cent is well below the level which would reasonably expect, on an informed basis, in that quarter following the full effects of changes to the health insurance arrangements. Informed economists were predicting rates betage tween 6 and 7 per cent and some suggested rates even higher than that. Of course, what has pened is-it dawned on me only a fortnight agopayers when I was again going through the Budget papers on revenue sources-that the Government will treat the Medibank levy, the compulsory levy, as a tax. As a personal income tax it will not feed into the consumer price index. The Government deceitfully has done this ances. and, in doing so, has not come clean with trade union movement. It has led movement to believe that the fuU effects of the Medibank charges will feed into the consumer price index when only about half will feed into the consumer price index. This is quite dishonestbe and incompatible with past practices and pracof tices which are pursued today. It is unusual for charges by government instrumentalities to be treated as taxes. We do not treat the charges Trans-Australia Airlines, the Commonwealth RaUways, public hospitals or government deto partments for services rendered to the pubUc as increases in personal taxes. The only reason the Government has done so on this occasion is to to whittle down the rate of increases in wages through the wage indexation system which fact, would otherwise have applied, and justifiably ofappUed, if the Government were to honour its obligations and the commitments that it had index. The given to the trade unions.",30
63,Dr EDWARDS,HEALTH INSURANCE,"One might well ask what the Opposition is about in this motion. What it is about is this: It wants a return so-called 'free' medical care. Does it really think that medical care and medical insurance really be free? There is no such thing as a free and it is high time that the Opposition woke up to it. When in fact we assumed office, it was clear that the costs of Medibank without a in arrangements during 1976-77 would soar to $2,000m of taxpayers' money. That is the which confronted this Government and I will return to it in a moment. Before I do so, I want to take up one of the last that the former Treasurer, the honourable for Oxley (Mr Hayden) was making. He tries to have it both ways. Earlier in his speech he castigated the Government for what he alleged is a record increase in income tax. He referred to thefigureof 25 per cent. There is afigurein the Budget papers which shows an increase of 22.6 cent. Let me make it clear that in point of fact one even that lower percentage gives a wrong impression of the increase m direct taxes this the year. There is an apparent increase of about $2,000m but $540m of that or about 6 percenpoints of the increase on the previous year represents the loss of rebates to taxpayers for hapchildren. However, at the sametime,those taxhave received the equivalent sum-al l but a few dollars either way-in additional, family allowances as a straight transfer from tax to famUy allowances. So in any reasonable assessment of what has happened to direct taxes this year, that has to be allowed for that $540m which is a straight transfer from tax to child fantily allow That is at least 6 percentage points of the the increase about which the honourable member the trade unionfor Oxley spoke. Then indeed, there is the Medibank levy. It is estimated in the 9 months of thisfinancialyear to about $250m or another 3 percentage points the increase. There we have 9 percentage points of this alleged 22.6 per cent increase, leaving an effective increase of 14 per cent in direct oftaxes. That, ofcourse, reflects the Government's move to index taxes. With earnings anticipated go up about 12 per cent and an increase of 2 per cent in employment we expect tax receipts to go up 14 per cent and that is the result. If it had trynot been for the Government's indexing of taxes, that increase would have been much larger. In it would have been of the order of $ 1,000m larger. The taxpayers of Australia need to preciate that this Government by indexing in other words by adjusting tax scales to take account of the impact of continuing inflation, reduced its take of taxation by in excess of $ 1,000m. The honourable member, having criticised the Government for this increase in ation, then went ahead and castigated, presumto ably, the Commonwealth Statisucian-i this Government's task to construct the consumer price index-for the intention, which he al-open leges, of treating the levy as taxation-somethin g the matter which he himself was doing 5 minutes ago. But I lose time on the substantive issue, is the allegation by the Opposition that there undesirable economic and, in particular, inflaof tionary consequences in the changes that have made to medical insurance. I remind the House that this Government has a strategy which is to ensure lasting economic recovery, a resump-family tion of growth and thrust in the economy, and full employment. The major prong of that stratthat egy is to combat inflation. I take this opportunity to reassert that. Because inflation itself is a main if not the principal of unemployment, therefore, if we want to compay bat unemployment and restore thrust and Below owth to the economy we have to beat inflation,stantial S ur policy against inflation has several major prongs. One of them, of course, is to get hold public spending and the deficit in the public accounts which had soared out of all proportion under the previous Government. Accordingly it is a major part of our policy to get hold of pubhcthe spending. Along with that of course goes our objective of minimising taxation. Far from being a government that is a high taxer, as the honour-been able member for Oxley suggested, this GovernLet ment has, as I have said, implemented legislation to index taxes which means keeping them down in an inflationary context. We want to go furthercost than that. We do not want to stop just at index-excess ing, which Umits the increase; we want to achieveeven actual reductions in the total of taxation and cordingly in the total of public revenue avaUable. In these circumstances the whole thrust and principle of our approach in the health insurance field can be set out. It is this: Where we have thrust to containrisingtaxation and indeed to reduce it so that there is limited public revenue, is important that that Umited revenue be used the maximum advantage. So the thrust of our health care proposals has been that those who can afford to pay for their health insurance should do so. After aU health care is as mental as food, clothing, motor cars or else. So those who can afford to pay for their equivalent aphealth insurance should do so thereby making taxes, avaUable the maximum of the Umited pubUc funds that are avaUable-w e are trying to cut has down on the total of taxation-to help those who cannot afford their own insurance, to help those in need. Consequently we designed these artaxrangements to ensure that those who can afford do so pay the Ml cost or near the full cost of t is not their health insurance. Who can afford to pay is a question that is to judgment. But we found on looking at that the fuU cost of this health insurance was of the order of $300 a year. We whichjudged that that is something that a person on are$12,000 a year ought to be able to afford-$300 $ 12,000 is 2¥i per cent. So we said: 'OK. Those we people on incomes of $12,000 a year and upwards will pay the fuU or substantially the full cost of their health care'. They were offered a Medibank package of $300. Those who receive incomes below $12,000 pay 2Vi per cent, is, less than $300. Those on very low incomes pay nothing at all. That was the thinking. The effect of course is that those Australians causereceiving $12,000 a year and upwards in effect substantiaUy the fuU cost of their health care. that level the Government picks up a subshare of the tab. In fact over much of that range the position is that the income earner is ofpaying about 20 per cent of the cost of his health care; in the upper income levels thefigureis in excess of 80 per cent. That is how we believe it should be. In this way it is possible to minimise cost of this on the public funds. So as a result of these proposals that we have implemented the cost to the taxpayer of the general scheme has reduced by something in excess of $800m. me stress that from general tax revenue something of the order of $ 1,000m is still contributed to the cost of health insurance. But the to the general revenue is reduced by in of $800m. I draw attention to the fact that with this arrangement the deficit that we achave budgeted for is of the order of $2,600m. There are continuous difficulties in effectively financing that in a non-inflationary way, and it is a very significant result that the cost in this this regard could be reduced by the order. I have suggested. I repeat that the arrangements as we ithave drawn them up result in the fact that those toin need and those who cannot afford to pay are substantially assisted from the pubUc purse. MeanwhUe it is worth noting that albeit there is this payment from private income-it was fundaexpressed in various emotive ways by the anythinghonourable member for Oxley as being to this or equivalent to that-it is not a significant amount in the total of private sonal consumption spending which is in $40,000m. It is not the payment for health but the lack of confidence as tion and unemployment that were bequeathed to this Government from the previous adrninistraDr tion that has held back consumption expendiof ture. As this Government succeeds in getting situation under control consumption spending will go ahead.",32
64,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE, revertedOrder! The honourable member's time has expired.,34
65,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE,"The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Edwards) comhas mented earUer in his contribution that there is such thing as a free meal. I agree. Of course is not. He spent a lot of his time then trying some-scheme how to prove in some devious way that there might be such a thing. He made the point, I introducing. thought that the whole thrust of the Government's plan was to decrease the cost on pubUc funds and hence reduce the cost to taxpayers. BuUy for the Government. That is perfectly cor-it rect except for one problem: Taxpayers unfortherichmust tunately in this country happen to be people. People get sick. People still have to pay their medical bUls. TheoreticaUy it is the Governsum ment's claim that taxpayers may not pay so much now, but I wiU dispute that in a moment. What the people do not pay via their taxation they still must pay out of their pockets when are sick. I agree that there is no such thing free meal. The honourable member has juggled That the figures. Let us examine the total cost. ter a damn to the average citizen really he pays via his taxation or out of his own pocket. If the sum total he pays for health services is more now than what he was paying when we organised the scheme he is losing. The Governus. ment has imposed a levy. It was claimed that Government did not believe in increasing taxes, that it wanted to reduce the cost to the taxpayersthose and so on. So the Government imposed a levy. That is not a tax, but no one can escape it. one has to pay it. Whether it is caUed a tax or not is irrevelant; it is a tax. The levy was the clever way adopted by the present Government to health increase taxes. It did that without saying that was its intention to increase taxes. The rub is the levy is less socially equitable than the direct taxation system that was used by the Labor Government to raise a sinular sum of money. This Government has imposed a levy on taxable income. I wiU not go into it here. Honourable permembers may work it out with a penal and excess ofpaper. Thefigureswill not showcare, Dr Edwards-The Labor Government aresultof the infla-proposed a levy. CASS-That isright.Thanks to the idiocy the then Opposition Parties, we were able to the adopt a sociaUy more equitable approach which involved funding from taxationrevenue.That was the mistake of the Opposition Parties, not of the Labor Party. The present Government has Dr Edwards-But the levy was as the Labor Party proposed.",34
66,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE,"I agree that what the Government reverted to is the same as our original pronoposal with the exception that the levy has been therebumped up considerably. But the Government's is less sociaUy equitable than the system that the Labor Party was successful in There are further deficiencies. One is the ceding. The ceiling is a burden on the poor, because tends therefore to lower the contributions that make. The cover or the opt-out provisions again favour therichas against the poor. If we take these aspects together, given that a set of money must be found-w e are not arguing about that factor at the moment-whateve r that sum is, this Government's system ensures that more of that money required for the scheme theycomes from the poorer section of the community as athan from the richer section of the community. is not social equity; that is not helping this Government out of its present economic mess. It is making the situation worse. Let us come to the It does not mat-crucial questionwhether Dr Edwards-We are helping the needy.",34
67,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE,"The Labor Government helped the needy. Those who were needy were covered by Everybody was covered by Medibank. Do the not come up with that nonsense. The Government has simply made the situation worse for who are a bit above the needy Une but well below therichUne. The actions of this GovernEveryment have made the burden much more difficult for those people. Let us look in real terms at the total cost to the community of this Government's scheme. Let us look at taxation charges, it benefits payments to the private funds and what that a person must pay from his or her pocket. Let us sum aU of these payments together. What then is the effect of the intervention by this Government? I suggest that it is disastrous. I make that claim,first,in terms of business efficiency. The Medibank computer was able to handle, at 4 per cent administrative cost, all of the claims for medical benefits and hospital benefits that came to it. Some hospitals benefits claims still went through the private funds. So, in that period when Medibank was doing much of the job of the private funds, the administrative costs of those private funds were still at approximately IS per cent while Medibank's administrative costs were approximately 4 per cent. That does not smell like inefficient government service. Despite that fact, this Government is now forcing a large proportion of the community out of Medibank, away from the organisation with overhead administrative costs of 4 per cent into the arms of private organisations with overhead administrative costs of IS per cent. How, may I ask, does that save money, given that the doctor or the hospital concerned still has to receive the same amount of money in the end? In other words, the taxpayer or citizen must find 10 per cent more to pay the same bills under this Government's system. I turn next to the bulk billing arrangements. Under Medibank, our Government provided bulk billing arrangements so that, for the poorthat is, those who could not afford the payments - o r for those doctors who were prepared to bulk bill and were not bothered to charge any moiety, which is the beautiful term used and which means a mark-up for the doctors, there was a facility by which charges could be levied directly on Medibank. A great deal of administrative nonsense was saved. A doctor who bulk billed did not need to send accounts to patients. There was no necessity for claims to be made for rebates. All of this was done simply by a doctor sending an account to Medibank from which he received a cheque in payment. This Government has changed that system. Medibank is still in existence. But this Government now permits those doctors who bulk bill also to charge their patients the balance, that is, the difference between the bulk billing payment and the doctor's fee. Under our scheme, a doctor who bulk billed was not able to charge that balance. This Government allows that practice. One does not need to be terribly clever to know what will happen. Most doctors will use the bulk billing facility when they think it suits them and it pays them. In addition, they will charge the patients the extra portion of the bill. So, most doctors in my view will charge the difference, which is 15 per cent, allowing for the fact that there is an 85 per cent rebate on the common fee",34
68,Mr HUNT,HEALTH INSURANCE,The gap is $5.,35
69,Dr CASS,HEALTH INSURANCE,"They will charge the gap, or $5, whichever it may be-that was thefigureunder the Labor Government also-wit h the result that whatever was the saving that we achieved under our scheme, represented by the difference between what a doctor received by bulk billing and what was the common fee at that time, will be an additional charge imposed upon doctor's patients. I repeat that this will arise because in my view-an a I am sure practice has shown this to be the case-mos t doctors will charge the gap. What is worse, some doctors are even charging pensioners in this way. Fortunately, not all of them are doing this. I do not beheve that most doctors are in that category. But there are some unpleasant members of the medical professions who are using this loophole which this Government has provided them. They are now charging pensioners who must find whatever money is needed to meet the gap. I move from that aspect to consider what seems to be the whole point of this exercise, that is, to enshrine and to boost the whole concept of fee for service medical practice, and to guarantee its survival. In his second reading speech on the relevant legislation, the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) when dealing with this aspect said that the Government was taking this action to ensure that E rivate medical practice would survive and in the ope that the Government's action would encourage the doctors therefore to provide the equivalent of what were once honorary services to hospitals. This is not happening. The doctors are not taking the bait. The doctors are demanding payment. In more and more cases, they are demanding fee for service payment in hospitals. They are greedily grabbing at all of the fee for service faculties that have been provided by this Government's distorted Medibank plan. I have claimed, and often claimed, that that is what bumps up medical costs. In this respect, let me quote a survey to demonstrate my claim. I know that we are not Americans but we are people. I do not beheve that doctors in Australia are fundamentaUy different from doctors in America. I do not believe that people in Australia are fundamentaUy much different from people in America. A study was carried out recendy on contrasts in health maintenance organisations and fee for service performance. A whole group of these organisations were analysed in this study which was reported in the Social Security Bulletin of May 1976. In essence,firstof all a check was made on the claim that all healthy people belonged to health maintenance organisations. The study found that there was no significant difference between patients belonging to health maintenance organisations and the general community. The same number of chronically ill patients found in both areas. The study checked on whether people who contributed to health tenance organisations were more health conpoint scious. The study found that this was not so. levels in either group seemed the same. What were the differences? Hospital care is the where aU the operations are done and to which the large bills aie attached. Hospital use was two-and-a-half times lower in group practice plans where doctors were on a salary compared with hospital use by doctors working on a fee service basis. There is the answer to the problem. The surgical rate of group practices and salaried doctors was half the rate where doctors wanted fee for service. Anywhere one looks, at whatever time one tries to analyse the figures, the claim that if people have something seemingly for nothing and therefore the sky is the limit is found to be nonsense. A patient cannot operate on self; he cannot write his own prescription. patient depends on his doctor for these things. The only freedom that the patient has is to visit his doctor. If there is too much medical care, many drugs prescribed, or too many operations undertaken, that is the direct responsibility doctor, encouraged by the fee for service nique. That is what this Government is encourcussion, aging. I assure the Minister that costs will soar enormously.",35
70,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,HEALTH INSURANCE, ment Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,36
71,Mr HUNT,HEALTH INSURANCE," Mr Deputy Speaker, before develop my argument in support of the changes objective, we decided with that this Government has made, I wish to two or three of the points that have been made this debate. The honourable member for and, Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) said that everyone pays was the levy. That is not correct. This may have been a sweeping statement that he made generally. But 75 per cent of our pensioners who have health benefit cards do not pay the levy. Those people on the lowest incomes do not pay the levy, so the ceiling is not a burden on the poor, because the poor do not pay the levy. Without ceiling what would be the position? The Governtrying ment looked at the possibility of applying a without a ceiling. We found that this would be most severe on 2-income families. Sixty per cent of Australian families would be worse off under the plan submitted by the Australian Council Trade Unions, which proposed a 1.6 per cent levy without a ceiling. So let us not assume the without-ceihng concept provides a more equitable system to a greater number of people. I were do not beheve that it does. With respect to the increasing charges to mainwhich the honourable member has referred, I out that even under his former Medibank Thescheme 70 per cent of Australians remained privately insured for hospital cover, so there was a area cost in respect of the operations of those insurance schemes operated by the private health insurance funds. But one fact is certain: Now that we have a competitor in the market- I refer to Medibank Private with aU its efficiency in for thefield-competition will be provided amongst all of the private health insurance funds. Perhaps we shall see more efficiency in the area of the administration of private health insurance. I think the Opposition believes in the old adage that memories are short. It is rather hypocritical for the Opposition to launch a campaign himagainst the Government on the grounds of its The bad economic management. Early in January this year we began an in-depth survey of the economic prospects in this country and it became too abundantly clear that we had a very grim scene in front of us. We had inherited a monumental of the mess. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr techHayden), who proposed this matter for diswas the third Treasurer in 6 months. I think he was unfortunate as a Treasurer because he too inherited a monumental mess and one of the greatest examples of economic mismanagein ourtime.It soon became clear that if the expenditure rate had continued we would have had a Budget deficit of no less than $5,000m in this financialyear, and the forward estimates for financial year would have been even greater. I go on to Therefore, consistent the Government's answer checked and government expenditurehad that inflation to be reined in in where possible. This required some urgent, hard to some extent, unpopular decisions. There no other responsible way out. We inherited an infiation rate of about 15 per cent and the worse unemployment since the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the business and industrial sector had been drained of confidence. In attacking the budgetary situation, a which one has to attack if one is serious about to overcome the inflationary situation, we levy found that there were 4 ways of reducing the overall Budget deficit. Thefirstwas to increase taxation, but we decided that we did not want to do that. The second was to print more money. A of former Treasurer tried to do that, but was not successful. The third was to reduce the rate of that increase in government spending, and we chose that course. The fourth was to borrow money to try to overcome the problem. We chose the third option which meant that we would prune back the overgrown bushes of pubhc expenditure, hoping for some self-sustained spring growth. Against the general background of economic disorder, we looked at the exploding health treatment costs and the efficiency of universal health insurance in its existing form. We set up a Medibank Review Committee which went to work in January this year. It had very wide ranging terms of reference against 3 important criteria: Medibank and universal health insurance were to be retained and there was to be no means test at the point of service to the patient. We were mindful of what such schemes had done to the economies of the United Kingdom, Canada and elsewhere where there was no restraint on costs. We wanted to ensure that Medibank did not consume the social dollar. Quite clearly, it had an appetite to do so. As part of our overall economic appraisal turned to health care costs in a substantial and we found that health care costs in Australia were exploding at an even faster rate than the record inflation. Without our changes the total government and private health treatment and health care costs for this financial year were estimated to be $5,400m. That is an enormous sum when compared with the value of iron, wool, coal, wheat and meat exports, which were valued at $4,500m for the previous financial year. Hospital and medical costs were estimated to be $3,320m this year. We estimated that cost of Medibank itself would reach the order $2,000m which would be a direct burden ConsoUdated Revenue. We also found that over a period of 11 years the Commonwealth health costs had increased by 10 times, from $260m in 1963-64 to $2,500m in 1975-76. There were allegations ofrip-offs,overuse and abuse. Some doctors were even complaining that they had doubled their incomes in the first 12 months time. of the operation of Medibank. We had the openended hospital cost sharing agreements with the States, with no opportunity for the Commonwealth Government to have any say in the move: Budgets or the variations thereto. So Medibank Mark 1 had achieved universal health coverage, but in the characteristic style of the former Government it was at the expense of disregarding economy and efficiency. It provided few incentives to economy by individuals or the medical profession. It placed on the State and Federal governments virtually the whole burden of basic medical and hospital financing, not just for those needing assistance but also for those who could afford to make a greater contribution. It threatened the continuance of private medical practice in hospitals. About 70 per cent of the population continued to privately insure, indicating that this was a trend that the Australian people were anxious to preserve. Public hospital charges were uneconomic and unrealistic. After a full inquiry 2 things became clear. The first was that changes needed to be made to constrain costs, to give incentives to keep costs down, to encourage efficiency in the State hospitals and to push ahead with preventive medicine and health and community programs. The latter is something to which I hope the Government will be turning more attention in the future. Secondly, it became clear thatfinancingother than just out of the general tax pool was absolutely necessary. I think the Government, the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions were agreed on that principle. The point at issue was the way in which we apwe pUed the levy. We decided on an optional system way because we believed that we would be able to create a competitive situation, particularly with respect to private medical practitioners. We believe that, in restructuring Medibank and universal insurance in the way we have, we have not been inequitable to the lower income people. At the same time we have given an incentive to the E rivate practitioners of this country to be careful ow they raise their fees, because if their fees rise faster than average weekly earnings quite clearly the premiums will go up and people will leave the their private insurance funds and stay with of Medibank Standard which wiU be the lowest upon cost, quality health care insurance.",36

73,Mr LYNCH,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I That the Bill be now read a second dme. The major purpose of this and associated Bills I shall shortly introduce is to give effect to the Government's income tax initiatives announced in my Budget Speech. The Bill also contains provisions relating to other aspects of the income tax law. One of the Budget proposals dealt with in this Bill, and in two of the associated BUls, is the scheme of income equalisation deposits being established for the benefit of primary producers. The scheme will provide valuable assistance to companies and individuals who carry on business as primary producers and whose incomes can, because of seasonal and market conditions, vary considerably from one year to the next. income equalisation deposits scheme will enpartners courage primary producers to make deposits years in which their incomes are high and thus provide funds to draw on when incomes fall. this way the scheme will have a stabilising on the levels of rural incomes and expenditures. Provisions governing the financial aspects of the scheme are embodied in an associated titled the Loan (Income Equalisation Deposits) Bill 1976. As those provisions, together with amendments being made by this Bill to the Income Tax Assessment Act, are explained in detail in a memorandum I have arranged to be circulated, I think I need do no more for the present thanreferto some general features of the scheme. The incentive for primary producers to make financial provision under the scheme is to found mainly in the income tax deductions that will be allowable for moneys deposited. versely, proceeds received on the withdrawal deposits for which tax deductions have been allowed are to be treated as assessable income taxation purposes. The scheme will be available posit for companies and individuals who, in income months tax parlance, are engaged in a business of prifinancial mary production. This includes farming, grazing and other rural activities and the carrying on fishing or forest operations. Moneys deposited positor seeking under the scheme will be borrowings by the months Commonwealth and Loan Council approval has the been obtained for this. Deposits will be accepted by the Commissioner of Taxation, to whom apsatisfied, plications to withdraw moneys are also to be to made. Interest, initially at the rate of S per cent per annum, will be payable on deposits. The interest rate will be variable by regulation. Following enactment of this legislation, depayer posits that are lodged with the Commissioner not ties, whether later than 31 January 1977 will, within the Umits provided in the legislation, be allowable as deductions against income of the 197S-76 income year.

For taxpayer whose accounting period for income tax purposes ends on a date other than 30 June, the 12 months period will end 2 months after the close of the particular accounting period. Deposits may be made by any individual or company but income tax deductions will be available only to depositors who carry on a busiThe ness of primary production in Australia, or are or beneficiaries entitled to share in in income from such a business carried on by a partnership or trust estate.

A demay, however, be withdrawn within 12 if the taxpayer is experiencing serious difficulties caused by circumstances not of in existence when the deposit was made. A deto withdraw an amount within 12 of lodgement will be required to satisfy Commissioner of the grounds on which the appUcation is based. If the Commissioner is not the matter is, on the taxpayer's request, be referred to a Taxation Board of Review for consideration. Amounts deposited inrespectof the 1975-76 income year, that is, not later than 31 January 1977, can be withdrawn at anytimeif the taxis experiencing seriousfinancialdifficulor not the difficulties are due to conditions that existed at the time that the deposits tax were made. These special arrangements recognise that drought conditions may have been exby primary producers since 31 August would have been the last day for endmaking deposits in respect of the 1975-76 in income year if the scheme had then been in a An amount deposited and withdrawn by a primary producer before the end of the period in which a deposit may be made in respect of a particular year will not be allowable as a tax deduction. So, for example, if a primary producer places an amount on deposit on 5 January 1977 and, on or before 31 January 1977, lodges an plicauon to withdraw it on grounds of serious financial difficulty, a deduction will not be able against 1975-76 income returned. Where an appUcation to withdraw deposits is lodged, or where a depositor dies, becomes bankrupt or, being a company, begins to be wound up, the relevant amounts-to the extent the income tax deductions that have been allowed-ar e to be included as assessable income. Generally speaking, the amounts will be treated as income derived in the year in which the appUcation to withdraw is lodged. In cases involving death, bankruptcy or winding up protaxpayer, ceedings, however, the amounts will be treated as assessable income of the tax period ending the date of the relevant event. Amounts allowpose able as deductions in respect of deposits, amounts included in assessable income as a incurred consequence of withdrawals, will not be taken into account in ascertaining provisional tax payable. Primary producers will, of course, continue be able to apply for recalculation tax on the basis of estimated taxable income. With the introduction of the new income equalisThe ation deposits scheme, there will be no continue the earlier drought bond scheme and is to be wound up. Present holders of drought bonds for which tax deductions have been lowed will be permitted to convert their holdings to income equalisation deposits, without mediate tax consequences. I turn now to other extensive provisions of Bill which propose to change very significantly the basis on which deductions are allowable the major capital expenditures of general mining and petroleum mining enterprises. I indicated my Budget Speech that the Government intends to promote a healthy and efficient minerals secundistributed tor and at the sametimeensure that a fair ance is struck between the levels of income tax payable by the mining industry and by other industries. In reaching the decisions affecting mining enterprises that are to be implemented the Bill, the Government gave close considerthe ation to the report of the Industries Assistance Commission that dealt with the income tax arcalculating rangements for the mining industry. Deductions avadable fbr capital expenditure on the developlater ment of a mine or oilfield,on the provision community faciUties adjacent to a mine or field,another, or on the purchase of mining rights or but information, that currently are allowable over the estimated Ufe of the mine orfieldwill, for new expenditures, be aUowable on reducing balap-ances, by reference to a maximum Ufe of 5 years instead of 25 years. This will increase the miniallow-mum annual rate of deduction from 4 per cent to if the deposit is 20 per cent. New exploration and prospecting expenditure incurred in searching for petroleum, and the lifeof-field deductions for aUowable capital expenditure on the development of a petroleum field, of will henceforth be deductible against assessable income derived from any source by the person incurring the expenditure. New capital expenditures on faciUties for the transport of minerals, including oU and natural gas, that are now deductible over 20 years wiU, at the option of the be deductible over either 10 years or 20 years. In addition, the classes of eUgible on expenditure on transport facUities for this purwul be expanded to include certain capital or expenditures of a non-plant character that are in providing port facUities in relation to the transport of minerals, including petroleum. Each of the amendments proposed m relation to the taxation of the mining sector is to apply into respect of new expenditures incurred after of provisional Budget day-17 August 1976. Bill also gives effect to 2 Budget proposals need to relating to the dividend distribution it requirements of the income tax law. With the needs of small businesses particularly in mind, it alis proposed to lower the minimum distribution required to be made by private companies to any imavoid tax on undistributed income, by increasing-fro m 50 per cent to 60 per cent-the proportion of after-tax business income that a the company may retain. It is not proposed to vary the 10 per cent retention allowance for property for income or to provide a retention aUowance for dividends that one private company receives in from another. Private companies wiU benefit from the increased retention allowance in their income tax assessments in respect balof income of the 1975-76 income year. The Bill also proposes to terminate the excess distribution provisions that enable a private bycompany that has paid more in dividends than undistributed income tax formula requires for an income year to take credit for the excess in the minimum distribution that it is required to make in respect of its income of a year. The Government has received of representations urging that, on one view or it should not proceed with this proposal, after careful consideration we remain of the view that the case for terminating the excess distribution provisions is a compelling one. To a substantial degree, the dividend policies of prito vate companies are in conformity with the divitaken dend distribution requirements of the income law so that no more is paid in dividends than needed to avoid a liability for undistributed income tax. Most of the existing excess distrirequired butions are the products of various kinds of tax minimisation arrangements and availability of the amounts would benefit relatively few private companies not associated with arrangements made to exploit the distribution provisions. Sophisticated arrangements of shareholdings within private company groups have been devised to circumvent the very complex dren measures that have been enacted to reduce avoidance by private company interests. There can be no certainty that further changes in the excess distribution provisions would, given the nature of the situations to be dealt with and the quite bewildering complexity of this area of law, hold out any greater assurance of success than the amendments made as recently as 1973. But in any event, the situation created by increase now proposed in the retention that allowance-whe n considered in conjunction with the effects of other income tax initiatives that have been taken by the Government or are 1978 proposed-provide s a strong case for terminating the excess distribution provisions. With the retention allowance for business income raised to 60 per cent, a level of 40 per cent of taxable income less tax is about the Umit to which a private company's sufficient distrihas bution could be reduced without adversely affecting the role of the provisions of the tax designed to ensure that private companies disation tribute some reasonable amount of after-tax profits as dividends to shareholders. Continued avaUabiUty of excess distribution credits would adversely affect revenue in the same way as an increase in private company retention levels, but with the benefits accruing almost clusively to persons who had devised ways of cir1 cumventing basic distribution requirements of cessions the law. Being satisfied that the need for the excess tribution concepts no longer exists, the Governannounced ment is taking the only practical course open it. The provisions are, accordingly, to be tersubstituted minated so that excess distributions wiU not avaUable in determining whether private comrelating panies have paid sufficient amounts by way dividends in respect of income derived during the income year ending 30 June 1977. For a com-unnecessary pany which ends itsfinancialyear on 30 June, the effect of the termination arrangement will be House. permit any avaUable excess distribution to be into account in measuring the sufficient tax distribution required to be made by 30 April is 1977. No excess distribution will, however, be reflected in the calculation of the distribution to be made during the 12 months period ending 30 April 1978, or in any subsequent disthe continued tribution period. Another provision of the Bill wiU give effect to the announcement I made last month of the Government's decision to exempt from tax the income derived by the Thalidomide Foundation as trustee for thahdomide afflicted chUdren. As a consequence of the exemption each of the chUwUl be exempt from tax on his or her share tax in the income of the Foundation. Mineral exploration expenditure in Papua New Guinea is another subject dealt with by the Bill. Subject to some transitional rules, the right the to deduct such expenditure was withdrawn in 197S when that country became independent. We have since agreed, as had the previous the Government, to a request by Papua New Guinea the life of the transitional provisions be extended. The extension will permit deductions for exploration expenditure incurred up to 30 June in pursuance of exploration rights held at the time of Papua New Guinea's independence. A technical amendment is also being made to the definition of 'Resident of Australia' for income tax purposes. One part of this definition long treated as an Australian resident a person who is, or is a designated dependant of, a law contributor to the Commonwealth SuperannuFund. Because the recent change in superannuation arrangements for Commonwealth officers had led to the constitution of a new fund, it is necessary to bring up to date the references in the definition to people who are contributors allowance to the Superannuation Fund. exAnother measure in the Bill terminates as from July last the residual appUcation of the tax confor visiting industrial experts that, subject to some phasing-out rules, had been withdisdrawn in 1973. This final termination was in June and follows the decision to to abolish a grants scheme that had in 1973 been for the former tax concessions. As be mentioned earlier, an explanatory memorandum to the Bill is avaUable to honourable of members providing detaUed explanations of the provisions of this and 3 related BUls and makes it for me to dwell on the provisions at the presenttime.I commend the Bill to the Debate (on motion by Mr Hurford) adjourned.

74,Mr LYNCH,INCOME TAX ASSESSMENT,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This is the second of 3 Bills designed to give legislative effect to the Government's decision to establish a scheme of income equalisation deposits for the benefit of primary producers. As I have already explained features of the deposit scheme in speaking to the Bill that has just been introduced, I need refer only briefly to the poses of this measure. The provisions of the Bill are basically in line with other loan raising laws although there some differences because of the particular nature of the deposits. First, the proceeds of income equalisation deposits are to be transferred to new trust account established by the Bill. ondly, because the Commonwealth, in accepting deposits does not issue securities, the Commondeclared wealth Inscribed Stock Act will not apply. Thirdly, because of income tax implications, deposits will not be transferable from one person to another. The Bill appoints the Commissioner of Tax42.5 ation as the person authorised to determine requests for withdrawal of deposits and authorthe ises bim to declare, in certain prescribed circumadditional stances, that deposits have become repayable. Depositors are given a right to have a request withdrawal referred to a board of review if refused by the Commissioner.

In response to a question from the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) on 4 November 1976 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) agreed to consider establishing a select committee of the House to look into tourism. Honourable members will be aware that some segments of the tourist industry have been and to experiencing difficult trading conditions. It is an industry which is particularly susceptible to fluctuations in levels of economic activity. The problems of the industry are exacerbated by the increasing number of Australians travelling overseas. The latestfiguresavailable from the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that during 1975-76 Australians spent $519m traveUing overseas whUe overseas visitors spent $255m in Australia. The Government's decision to devalue will, of course, assist in narrowing the gap between travel debits and credits. The tourist industry is an important industry. It is a significant employer of labour, employing up to 5 per cent of the work force. It is important to State economies, particularly Tasmania and Queensland. It is the life blood of some regions. The Gold Coast and the Snowy Mountains are but 2 examples of this. Tourism has important social implications. It is a means by which Australians as well as overseas visitors can learn more about our country and our heritage. It is a worthwhile means of using increasing hours of leisure. In short, the many facets of this important and growing industry contribute to the Australian economy through: Urban and rural development; decentralisation; new and expanded employment outlets; contribution to foreign exchange earnings; avenues for profitable short and long term investment; a contribution to education; new avenues for improving community health and welfare, both physical and mental; a deeper understanding of different cultural standards and community attitudes; and a wider base for international understanding and goodwUl. It is against this background that the Government has decided to estabUsh a select committee to inquire into the industry. Acting on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Senator Cotton), I have put down the terms of reference. provided with necessary staff, The terms of reference are broad and the task is of some magnitude. It is difficult therefore to set afirmdeadline for the committee to complete its inquiries and prepare a report. However, I am sure we can rely on the enthusiasm of the memcommittee bers of the committee to complete their task quickly as possible. Because of the involvement of Commonwealth, State and local governments in tourism, specific mention has been made in the terms of reference of theresponsibilitiesof levels of government. Honourable members may know that last September the Minister for Indusour try and Commerce appointed a Government About Members Committee on Tourism under the industry chairmanship of Senator Rae. Tbis Committee impact has been working most diligently received many submissions. Its report is due to be completed before the end of the year. I feel where sure that its findings will be of interest and of its complete considerable use to the select committee. I comought to leave mend the modon to the House.",41
78,Mr YOUNG,TOURISM,"The Opfield position welcomes the move by the Government to establish this select committee on tourism. welcome the recognition by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Howard) that it was moves from this side of the House which brought this committee into being. It been because of the active participation in House by the honourable member for Lang (Mr Stewart) and the honourable member for ously, Robertson (Mr Cohen) that we see some glimclose mer of hope for the tourist industry. I also duerespectto the unwanted member of the commence Cabinet-as he was after the election last yearect Senator Peter Rae because of the work he has contributed to the tourist industry of Australia. Nevertheless a number of things regarding the tourist industry have been ignored. We have ignored them for so long that perhaps this select committee can come up with some of the suade answers. I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House because following me will be honourable members to whose superior knowlbe edge I bow-for example, the former Minister for Tourism and Recreation. It is the intention Opposition to move an amendment to paragraph seeing. 16 of the motion. In that paragraph the Government proposes that the committee should report as soon as possible. We on this side of the House believe that the date on which the committee about. should conclude its work should be stipulated. No shortage of information is avaUable people interested in the tourist industry. I stand that the honourable member for Lang go through, item by item, the sorts of documents which have been made avaUable or which were tabled during the period of the Whitlam Governcerning ment. The recommendations and information would made avaUable to the people of Australia and to parliamentarians only need condensing for this to bring back a very swift report. A as number of difficulties are associated with the tourist industry, and devaluation will not overcome all of them. The tourist industry is still finding it difficult, as are many other industries the 3 which depend upon such a large content of female labour, because of the decision taken by industrial tribunals in relation to equal pay. 62 per cent of the employees in the tourist are females. Obviously, because of the of that decision the tourist industry is takand has ing some time to adjust. Also in Australia we have the unique position our major international airline is spending budget convincing people why they Australia. Perhaps we should look at a combination of the roles of our airUnes in the of advertising. We should look at the roles of Trans-Australia Airlines, Ansett Airlines of We Australia and Qantas Airways Ltd. It seems rather ridiculous and a contradiction in terms for us to be looking at the tourist industry whUe we are contributing so much of the taxpayers' has money to convincing those taxpayers that they this would have a bettertimeand that their money would be better spent outside this country. Obvithat sort of thing would lend itself to very investigation by this committee. I do not pay think that anybody in this Parliament would these hearings beUeving that any selcommittee of this Parliament will be successful in persuading all those Australians who might want to travel outside the country that it would be a good thing not to do so. What we need to do is to balance what has been occurring over the last three or four years in order that we can pera lot of Australian people who are going overseas on their holidays not for thefirsttime but perhaps for thefifthor sixth time that it may worthwhile to have some interest in parts of Australia which are unique by international stanof the dards and which would be very worth whUe I believe that a concentration on the importance of tourism inside Australia could bring this As I said earlier, there is a multiplicity of reports concerning this matter. There have been reports by the Industries Assistance Commission, to the Temporary Assistance Authority and the underOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and will Development. Investigations have also been undertaken by interdepartmental committees. We are able to obtain all the information conthis matter quickly. I believe that it be in the interests of the tourist industry, which has suffered so much recently, for us to be able to stipulate atimewhen this Parliament would receive a report. It is for that purpose that I move: That paragraph (16) be amended by omitting the words 'as soon as possible' and substituting 'no later than 31 May 1977'.",43

(2) That the committee consider ways and means which(a) persons with appropriate qualifications can encouraged to assist Aboriginals achieve standard of health, and (b) Aboriginals including traditional healers can pate in the development services to their own communities, and modification of existing services. (3) That the committee recommend action. Honourable members will recall the discussion initiated by the honourable member for has Fremantle (Mr Beazley) in this House on 3 November as a matter of public importance that the Government make a commitment to eliminritory. ate certain diseases from Aboriginal communiAboriginal ties and establish a select committee of the to this end. In the course of the ensuing debate my colleague, the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt), expressed the Government's concern at the health problems of Aborigines, particularly such diseases as trachoma and its incidence in NOES central and northern Australia amongst the Jones, Charles Keating, P. J. remote communities. The Minister spoke also of the readiness of the Government to consider the estabUshment of an appropriate committee to Martin, V.J. Morris, P. F. investigate this matter. Scholes, G. G.D. Stewart, F.E. The Government's total funding for health services to Aborigines for 1976-77 is $ 15.9m. In addition to this, special funds of $600,000 have been provided by the Department of Health and my Department for a task force to conduct a pilot study to deal with trachoma and eye health James, A. W. Johnson, Les amongst Aboriginal communities in central Australia. In the light of the earUer debate and the Government's own desire to seek a closer study of problems associated with eliminating diseases in Aboriginal communities, the Government has now decided that these problems of Aboriginal health should be referred to the Standing Committee of this House on Aboriginal for examination and to report its recommendations progressively to the Government. The Standing Committee already has in hand a study of alcohol problems amongst Aborigines in the course of which evidence on health factors be referred to the Standing has been given. It seems more appropriate thereof fore to budd on the present work and developing expertise of the Standing Committee than to suffered estabUsh a new and separate committee to deal with incidences of particular diseases amongst Aboriginal health and enAboriginals. I note that in the third main report of the ComWestern mission of Inquiry into Poverty presented by the services to cope with the health Reverend George S. Martin, attention has been that take drawn to some specific problems in Aboriginal camp health which require investigation. I expect that the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs by will therefore find that report of value as well as be the Senate Committee's report on environmental a better conditions of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders which make some specific recommenparticidations on Aboriginal health.

This is very important and I hope that the Committee does receive the co-operation of the State authorities which are charged with some aspects of health in their own areas. We are particularly gratified at the wide terms of reference that have been given toand the Committee. There is no doubt that there are operation many diseases which are almost entirely confined to the Aboriginal community. I speak of tuberculosis, yaws, leprosy, hookworm and choma. The numbers of people of European background who suffer from any of those disand eases would be very few. The number of AborHelen igines who suffer from them, I understand, quite large. I agree with the Minister that latest report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty does give some important leads. I thinkTbis that paragraph 2 (b) of the Minister's motion very important. It states: Aborigines including traditional healers can the development and delivery of health care services own communides, and in any modification of existing services. I hope that the recommendations will tive to the status of traditional Aboriginal healers. We will have to be careful that we do not intervene in such a way that the health poUcies Europeans will reduce the Aboriginal traditional healers to a menial status. The Aborigines have a great respect for their traditional healers. It is would very interesting also to note that they have a Aboriginal great respect for older European doctors. I 21. understand that a New Zealander, a senior docI tor, who was employed by the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress or under its auspices who is shortly to leave the area, was greatly respected because of his age and also because his personal quaUties.

It is intended to discharge the existing Order of the when the House has passed the reprinted that Mr LES JOHNSON (Hughes) (5.4)- I should Uke to say briefly that the Opposition is happy to see the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner)tidyup this legislation because only 48 amendments were introduced by the care toGovernment. It would have been extremely difficult to deal with the Bill with those amendI ments as well as the amendments of the Opposition. I should Uke to add that the Parliament I has been disadvantaged further in this matter to the fact that the ConsoUdated Bill only rethat cently has come into the hands of honourable members. Two copies of the Bill were avaUable to the Opposition last Friday. If there is some Abdifficulty in navigating the progress in the Committee stage of this debate it will be in conseare set upquence of the matter I have raised.",45
83,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"In supporting my colleague the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) I would like to say first that think it is sound procedure that the Bill reprinted in this way. There seems to be a constantiaUy tinuing series of muddles when this Government handles legislation of any complicated nature. This is in the almost continuing theme of the Medibank situation. This operation was comtion menced last year while we were in government. The legislation after being before the House taken away, redrafted, then amended, then redrafted and then more amendments were made. One of the quaint things about Australian poUtics is the way this Government managed fore it came into power to make it look as it were a model of efficiency. AU I can say is that it is a model for muddling. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill presented by Mr Viner, and read a first time.",47
84,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. As I stated when speaking to the motion to suspend Standing Orders to enable the introduction of this Bill, the reprinted Bill incorporates the amendments which I foreshadowed in my statement to the House on 17 November last. not therefore necessary for me to further elaborNovember ate the point except to say that a reading second reading speech on 3 June 1976 and statement on 17 November will disclose both the phUosophy and detaUed poUcy decisions which (Mr lie behind the Government's land rights He legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recomstand mending appropriation announced. Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Commencement).",47
85,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I move: Omit the clause, substitute the following clause: ""2. This Act shall come into operation on a date fixed by proclamation."". The reason for adopting this course is that whereas the Act is to come into operation on a datefixedby proclamation, as is mentioned in clause 2, clause 70 is to operate subsequently; concurrently, but on a later date which fixed for the purpose of sub-clause 1. Clause 70 relates to entry onto Aboriginal lands. This matI ter gives great concern to the Opposition and to be Aboriginal communities aU over Australia. Subit provides that a person shaU not enter or remain on Aboriginal land except in accordance with the law of the Northern Territoiy. That is the essence of clause 70. When will the regulabe introduced in the Northern Territory? The position that wiU foUow the passing of legiswas lation is that Aboriginal people themselves will not be able to determine the question of entry onto Aboriginal land but at sometimein the future the Northern Territory Legislative Asbesembly will be determining it. Mr Justice thoughWoodward made recommendations on this matter. In paragraph 109 of the second report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission, under the heading 'Control of access to Aboriginal land', he stated: One of the most important proofs of genuine Aboriginal ownership of land will be therightto exclude from it those Second Reading who are not welcome. The Land Councils believe that this principle should be supported by a permit system and I agree them. I accept the Northern Land Council's view that the system should be administered by the officers of the Land Councils, who would, where necessary, consult with the local community and clan leaders before issuing a permit. But His Honour Mr Justice Woodward is not on his own in expressing enthusiasm for this conIt is cept. In fact in the debate that occurred in 1975 after the introduction by the of my Labor Government of the Aboriginal CouncUs my and Associations Bill the then spokesman for Aboriginal affairs, the present Attorney-General Ellicott) had quite a bit to say on this matter. said, as reported on page 2752 of Hansard of 4 November 1975: . . . Aboriginal groups to which I spoke . . . were emphatic that they wanted to say who came on to their land. They did not want a remote land council telling them what to do and who was to enter their land. As far as I can underthe matter, they also wanted the right to say whether a person should come on, whether that person was an Aboriginal or not. In Committee Here we have a situation embellished by the support of His Honour Mr Justice Woodward and the former spokesman on Aboriginal affairs for the Liberal-National Country Party coaUtion. Yet in this legislation there has been a departure to be from that concept. Although it was intended that the function be administered by land councils and through them delegated to community councUs, we will be substituting a situation which will have the effect that instead of the remote land not councUs making decisions, remote Darwin-based is to be bureaucrats will be making them. We regard this matter with very grave concern. I know that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) in his second reading speech indicated that guidelines are to be provided for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in respect to the laws it is to make on Aboriginal lands. In his statement on 17 November 1976 he said that traditional Aboriginal rights to enter Aboriginal lands must be provided for. He then went on to say: The leader of the Legislative Assembly and the Minister for the Northern Territoiy (Mr Adermann) have assured that the Territoiy legislation will be worked out in tation with Aboriginals and with my involvement agreement. It seems to me that to hoist the whole future entry into Aboriginal land on such a vague assurto ance is a most unsatisfactory and even contemptuous way of treating this Parliament and this not issue. One would go so far as to say that it regard, represents an abrogation of responsibility on the ive Assembly. part of this Government and the Parliament as of the last 3 elections well. Perhaps there will be no law at all. The bUity is that the Legislative Assembly might iniwhich tiate some action about this matter. On the other hand, there is a possibUity that no action at will be instituted. The situation perhaps will that anyone will be able to enter Aboriginal land. That situation could easdy eventuate if the Assembly faUed to take action. In terms of the referendum decision that was taken and which clothed this Parliament with power on this subelections ject it is not good enough to baU out on a matter so important for Aboriginal people. As the former Opposition spokesman, the present cessful. Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott), has said, wherthe ever he sat people felt very strongly about this matter. Those members of the Parliament who are active in Aboriginal affairs would take identical view. So it seems to me that this is indication of the Government's intention to hand over the prerogative in this matter to ern Territory Legislative Assembly. If that does not represent white paternalism-in fact, if the whole proposition is for white people to deterto mine who goes on Aboriginal land and if that also does not represent white paternalism- I doubt whether there is a meaningful definition that phrase. For those reasons, the Opposition has moved its amendment.",47
86,Mr CALDER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I the wish to discuss the amendment moved by the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les matter Johnson). As indicated by his speech, there seems to be some misunderstanding throughout the country and certainly within the Australian Labor Party about the role of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in the past and in the future. The honourable member expressed concern that the Legislative Assembly might legislate in some way to deprive Aborigines of the right of access to their own land. He claimed that Aborigines had said that they did not want a remote land councU deciding who went onto their land. That is deadright.The Aboriginal people do not want a remote land councU-eithe r me a central or northern land councU-decidin g who consulgoes on to their land. As they have stated conand tinually, they would prefer such a decision to be made by their own clan councUs. of The honourable member for Hughes went on say that, by the same token, Aborigines would by welcome decisions being made on this matter remote Darwin-based bureaucrats. In this he cited the Northern Territory LegislatHe would know that in the course for the Legislative Assembly and its predecessor, the Northern Territory possiLegislative Council, one of the platforms on the Country-Liberal Party stood related to the Aboriginal control of entry on to their land, aU that is, reserves. The policy of the Australian be Labor Party at thattimein the Northern Territory was to do away with the entry permit system. He and the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant), as former Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs, would know that that was the case. In for the former Legislative Council, that proposition from the Labor Party was defeated. The Labor members of the Council were not sucIn the election following the creation of Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory, no Labor candidates were returned to that body. It was the Country-Liberal Party in the an Northern Territory which defended therightof an Aborigines to decide who went on to their land. It was not the Legislative Assembly or the buthe Northreaucrats who decided that matter. The system was that a person seeking entry on Aboriginal land would send a telegram to the councU concerned. The telegram did not go to the northern land councU, but to the local Aborof iginal councU, which would be, for example, the Goulburn Island Council, the Oenpelii Council or the MUingimbi Council. A telegram or note was sent to the appropriate council saying that sender wished to go on to that council's land. The councU communicated its response through the Depaitment of Aboriginal Affairs. I want this to be put straight. Again and again I have heard in this Parliament and have read in newspapers that it is the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly which decides who goes on to Aboriginal land. Members of that Assembly fought for the entry permit system to remain in the hands of the traditional owners through the local councils. I take this opportunity to put the record straight.",48
87,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," Mr Chairman, I cannot understand why the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) wants to hold up passage of clause 70. Tbis clause has to do with entry on to land. The honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) has said that everybody is in agreement that this land ought to be under control of the Aboriginal people. Yet we find that the Government proposes to suspend clause 70 so that the proclamation enacting this legislation may go forward. I think that, in a way, this action will emasculate the Bill. Why is it we must wait now after 13 years or more since the first shots were fired on landrightsin this Parliament? The honourable member for the Northern Territory will forgive us if, on this side of the Committee, we have a reasonable suspicion that the National Country Party is not all that dedicated to the principle of land rights for Aboriginal people. The honourable member may forgive us, then, if we think that the Legislative of the Northern Territory is not a rehable protector of those interests. Mr Katter-That is not true. The honourable member knows that.",49
88,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"One of the reasons why I say that emphaticaUy is the behaviour in the past people Uke the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) on these matters. He has always acted as though the landrightsof Aboriginal people could be transcended, for instance, by miners. I think the real issue here is thetimingof the legislation. What is the point of legislation being brought forward here in relation to matters which have been under consideration for so and which have been before the Parliament so long, when the proposal now is to leave out what is an important part of that legislation? Even if for the time being there is to consideration of malfeasance-if that is the appropriate word-o n the part of the Minister his minions in the Northern Territory Assembly, that does not do the legislation any good. I wish to see the Opposition's amendment agreed to and written into the Act so that this legislation will be proclaimed as a whole. If that happens, we will be able to get on with the job. A further point arises. The responsibUity for the carriage and implementation of this legisfact lation lies fairly and squarely on this Parliament. This is a national question to be resolved by the national Parliament. I believe that the entry of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory into this arena is an aberration of some magnitude. I hope that the Minister will take the bit between his teeth and ensure that all of the contents of the Bill are proclaimed as an Act at the same time.",49
89,Mr RUDDOCK,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The situation as I understand it from reading this clause if that there is a very necessarytimelag between the proclamation of the Bill generally and the establishment of land councils as proposed in this Bill. The estabUshment of those councUs will enable the provisions of clause 70 to be put into effect, to operate and to achieve its purpose. There are already certain limitations that upon the right of entry on to Aboriginal land which are administered through the Social Welfare Ordinance of the Northern Territory. So, for thetimebeing, therightsof individuals to go on to Aboriginal land are already restricted and the exercise of thoserightsis capable of being restricted by the operation of that ordinance. Until this Bill becomes law following its proclamation and until the councUs are establishedthis involves a time lag-and are able to accept the responsibUity to administer the entry of persons on to Aboriginal land, there will not be a situation in which the provisions of this legislation including clause 70 can be enacted and brought into operation at the one time. If, as has been suggested, the Government lacks bona fides of with respect to this issue, I daresay the Government could seek simply not to bring the legislation on-that has not been the case-o r simply faU to proclaim it anyway. Who could be heard to complain about that? There is no question of lack ofbonafides.There are quite proper reasons for what is proposed. If honourable members opposite had sought an explanation, I am sure that long their queries could have been adequately for answered to their satisfaction.",49
90,Mr KATTER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," Mr Chairman, I be no wish to make a personal explanation.",49
91,The CHAIRMAN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,Does the and honourable member claim to have been Legislative misrepresented?,49
92,Mr KATTER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I most certainly do. The honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant) made a most remarkable statement. He claimed that I was well known as being more interested in miners than in Aborigines, or made some such statement. I claim this to be entirely wrong. In I have an interest in a small mining lease and my partner is an Aboriginal. We own it together. I would like the honourable member for Wills to quote his authority and to say whether it is the Hansard record",49
93,The CHAIRMAN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Order ! I think that the honourable member for Kennedy, having made a statement daiming misrepresentation and having said that the statement of the honourable member for Wills was not correct, has now explained the misrepresentation. If the honourable member for Kennedy desires to go into the matter any further he should speak to the clause before the Committee. The matter to which he is now alluding is more a comment on the subject matter of this debate than a personal explanation.",50
94,Mr KATTER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I do not want to hold up the proceedings of the Committee, Mr Chairman. I accept your ruling. I know that the honourable member for Wills could not possibly have been serious in making that statement.",50
95,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I want to take up the point made by my friend the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock), and to offer a proper apology to the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter). If I have said untrue things, or have misinterpreted what he said in the past and have offended him, I am sorry. Apparently he does not use the English language adequately. As far as we are concerned, this piece of legislation has to be taken as a whole. The legislation will be mangled if clause 70 is not brought into operation at the sametimeas the Act is proclaimed. There is no guarantee that the Government will get on with the job. There is no reason why clause 70 should not take effect as from the day the Act is proclaimed. I take it that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) will not take months and months to get round to the proclamation. If the Act was proclaimed tomorrow, clause 70 could come into operation. Why does he not get on with it?",50
96,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"This amendment is not acceptable. With a fair reading of the provisions of clause 70 and a better understanding of the operations of the Bill on the part of the Opposition, the Opposition would understand why it is necessary to allowtimefor the special proclamation of clause 70. I draw the attention of honourable members to the fact that clause 70 (1) provides as follows: Except in the performance of functions under this Act or otherwise in-accordance with this Act or a law of the Northern Territory, a person shall not enter or remain on Aboriginal land. The time that will be allowed will enable the passing of the necessary Northern Territory law as foreshadowed both by this Bill and by statements I have made in support of the Bill. The various arguments put forward by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) can be seen, upon examination, to be quite specious. My friend the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) pointed out the error of the continuing proposition of the honourable member for Hughes that it will be the Legislative Assembly which administers the rights of entry to Aboriginal land.",50
97,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,It is not what Woodward said.,50
98,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"It is what the honourable mem, ber says will happen. This Parliament does not administer the laws that it passes. That is done by the departments of government or the authorities clothed with the particular function. It is clearly indicated in the statements I have made that the laws relating to entry will operate through land councils and with respect to the wishes of the clan or community councils, many of which are already established in the Northern Territory and which also will be capable of incorporation under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill previously passed by the House.",50
99,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,There is nothing in the Bill to that effect.,50
100,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,That is the fact of the matter.,50
101,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,There is nothing in the Bill; that is the fact of the matter.,50
102,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The honourable gentleman knows from the contents of the Bill and the statements I have made that what I say is correct and it will happen. I also point out to the 2 honourable members opposite, both of whom are former Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs and ought to know-if they do not, I will tell them now-that there is in existence the Social Welfare Ordinance of the Northern Territory which presently controls entry to Aboriginal land. That Ordinance will continue to operate until such time as it is superseded by a law of the Northern Territory which is passed in accordance with the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and which is acceptable to me.

(1) In this Act, unless the contrary intention appears'Aboriginal' means a person who is a member of Aboriginal race of Australia; 'alienated Crown land' means Crown land in which person (other than the Crown) has an estate or interest, but does not include land in a town; NA 'town' has the same meaning as in the law of the Northern Territory relating to the planning and developing of towns and the use of land in or near towns, and includes any area that, by virtue of regulations in force under that law, is to be treated as a town; 'unalienated Crown land' means Crown land in which no person (other than the Crown) has an estate or interest, but does not include land in a town. (4) A reference in this Act to the granting of a mining interest in respect of Aboriginal land shall be read as not including a reference to the renewal, in accordance with an option or other right conferred before the land became Aboriginal land, of a mining interest that was in existence when the land became Aboriginal land. Ruddock, P.M. Sainsbury, M. E.",50
103,Mr WENTWORTH,AYES,"I move: In the definition 'Aboriginal', after 'Australia' add 'and is registered or entitled to be registered under the provisions of paragraph 24 (a) or who has been nominated by a person so registered as a member of his land-owning clan or group'. If honourable members look at the Bill as drafted they will see that Aboriginal means 'a Wentworth, W.C. Wilson, I. B.C. person who is a member of the Aboriginal race of Australia'. That might mean that a person Tellers: who had one sixty-fourth part Aboriginal blood would qualify under the definition. Could I say something about the definition of Aboriginal? NOES Mr LES JOHNSON - I take a point of order. As I Jones, Charles Keating, P. J. understand the position, the Minister is regarded as having moved clause 3, and the Opposition is given the call in respect of the clause.",51
104,The CHAIRMAN,AYES,"In the normal course of events the Opposition would get the call. In the circumstances, it is necessary to proceed with the Whidam, Antony Willis, R. amendment of the honourable member for Mackellar before we pass on to the amendment of the honourable member for Hughes. That is Tellers: James, A. W. the reason.",51
105,Mr WENTWORTH,AYES,"The customary deNA finition of Aboriginal used in the Department was originally drawn, I think, by Professor Rowley, amended by myself when I was Minister and put out by myself when I was Minister. It is to this effect: An Aboriginal is a person of full or partial Aboriginal descent who himself claims to be an Aboriginal and is accepted as such by the community with which he is associating. That gave some protection. This definition gives no the protection at all. A person who is one sixty-fourth Aboriginal, who is not Uving as an Aboriginal and who has nothing to do with Aborigines, a could claim the benefits of this Bill. This is not good enough. Mr Sullivan-I take a point of order. I am interested in what the honourable member for Mackellar is saying. I cannot hear him.",51
106,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,I suggest that the conversation is at too high a level and is almost cutting out what the honourable member for Mackellar is saying. I think that those who are close to the honourable member should give some consideration to not carrying on a discussion while is is endeavouring to make his speech so that the rest of the Committee might hear it.,52
107,Mr WENTWORTH,PAIRS,"I thank you, Mr Chairman. I am suggesting that we add to the definition in the LJ1 the words contained in the amendment so that the definition of Aboriginal will read: 'Aboriginal' means a person who is a member of the original race of Australia and is registered or entitled registered under the provisions of paragraph 24(a) or who has been nominated by a person so registered as a ofhis land-owning clan or group. If honourable members look at sub-clause 24(a) of the Bill they will see that it enables Aborigines to make a register of people whom they consider to be Aborigines. This Bill allocates traditional land. Its speaks of traditional Aboriginal land. The people entitled to this land are traditional Aborsuperior igines. I am worried always that people have only a slight mixture of Aboriginal blood, because they are perhaps better educated in our European sense or because they are slicker, might go to the Territory and impose upon the true and traditional Aborigines to whom this refers. I feel very deeply about this. I beheve that this Bill betrays the traditional Aborigines could be overwhelmed or taken to the cleaners by the part-Aborigines who could the south and who are without traditionalties.I would almost call them carpetbaggers. They could come up from the south and take charge of land councils and land trusts. They could establish their residence in the area of a land council in the Northern Territory. There is nothhe ing difficult about that. Having done that, they have been able to use their superior European- I setting emphasise the word 'European'-education . This is a Bill to protect traditional people within a European framework. They will be able to manipulate these people, to take charge of them and, in point of fact, to take away from them their inheritance in their traditional land. I seen this happening with my own eyes in the to Northern Territory and elsewhere. I know exactly what can happen under this Bill. I feel very deeply on this point because I do not believe that we are doing what we set out to do. Thetitleof this Bill relates to traditional Aboriginal land. The people who are entitled to those lands are the traditional Aborigines, not blow-ins from the south or blow-ins from another area, whether they be full-blood or part-blood. The people who are entitled to that land are the people who have the traditional links with it. We have been talking perhaps with our tongues in our cheeks. But I hope at any rate that I have been talking sincerely about the spiritual ties of Aborigines with their land. These are traditional ties. There is no tie between an Aboriginal and some part of the land of which he is not the traditional owner. To my way of thinking this matter is compounded by our misapplication of councils and trusts. The council is the big central body. The Abtrust is without function; it is a purely passive creto be ation which the land council will control. The member situation is made worse by what I believe to be an untraditional alignment in land councils and trusts. We are setting up here an organisation under which Aboriginals will be defrauded of their birth right. Of course, this will not happen overnight. But inevitably it will happen if we allow the part-bloods and those full-bloods who title have no traditionaltiesbut who may be a Uttle on the smart side to come in and usurp by their skiUs in committees, by their superior who command of the European language, and by their superior knowledge of European law, or whatever it may be, the real rights of the traditional Aboriginals. If we mean anything, if we are in any way sincere when we speak about the Bill spiritual tie between an Aboriginal and his land-it is there-w e will maintain that position who by allowing only traditional Aborigines to be concerned in the administration of their tracome up from ditional land.",52
108,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"WhUst I think that there is something in what the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) says, I also think that clause 24 covers the proposal that puts before us. Clause 24, in part, states: A Land Council shall compile, and maintain, a register out(a) the names of the persons who, in the opinion of the Council, are the traditional Aboriginal owners of Aboriginal land in the area of the Land Council; and . . . It is true that people may be able to go to these Aboriginal areas and talk themselves into rights have to which they are not entided. They will be able do this while there is a register. They would be able to do that even under the honourable member's definition which accepts the register as the definition of an Aboriginal. So I think it is a cyclical argument. Mr Chairman, I rose really to raise a point of procedure. There are 4 amendments this clause. I suppose that we can speak only normal number of times-that is twice-in If we respect of the clause? Mr Bourchier-You will use up VA hours one hit.",52
109,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,I have been working on this subject for about 20 years. The Government ought at least to let us have about ten or twelve hours in which to speak on the subject.,53
110,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"In a sense we have not yet come to the point of putting the amendment to the Committee. I have had discussions on this matter with the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). It is felt that the 4 amendritory ments could be moved together, in which case would mean that the honourable member would have 2 opportunities, if he required them, speaking to the clause. Of course, if he can come the wrath of his colleagues he can always get the leave of the Committee to speak on a third occasion. But such a matter is not within the province of the Chair.",53
111,Mr BRYANT,PAIRS,"I am in full sympathy with the honourable member for Mackellar in respect of the general need to get the definition right. But think that by trying to define the word 'Aborigiof'Aboriginal' nal' in a more narrow way we could end up in more trouble. It is just one of the inevitable lems that confront people wherever they try define race or ethnic groups or anything of this nature. It is found that such a task is almost impossible to accomplish inside the terms of language. Therefore we have to rely upon registration of some sort. I beheve that this Aborigine requirement is adequately covered in clause would not vote for the amendment, or perhaps against it.",53
112,Mr CALDER,PAIRS,"This Bill concerns traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. One would in imagine that it would concern traditional Aborthe igines in the Northern Territory. Yet the depeople finition of'Aboriginal' in this Bill is the definition that was included in the Bill in 1975 which the Australian Labor Party introduced. Some of objected to the definition then, and reason. I objected to the definition because endeavouring to see that the traditional land is owners in the Northern Territory get control their own land. Because of the way in which the definition is worded-the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) put the case well-peopl e other than traditional owners will be able to work themselves into the land councUs and land trusts. So I think it is imperative that ft to Government takes note of the definition put for the ward by the honourable member for Mackellar. cannot get that definition accepted this time perhaps it could be looked at by the proposed in committee which will oversee the implementation of this legislation in respect of the rights of the traditional owners. This is what I and various other people in the Northern Territory are concerned about. I refer to people such as Pastor Albrecht who has been backed up by Strehlow, De Graf, Pfitzner, Stolle and the learned Dr Gavranic who gave evidence yesterday on the subject of alcholism to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. This man had spent 5 years in the Northern Terand a great deal of that period in the it Arnhem Land area. He supports the same kind of concept that we Territorians support. We are of endeavouring to ensure that the traditional overowners have control of their land. The very broad definition of'Aboriginal' in the Bill will tend to take away that control from those people. We have heard much of Dr Peterson. In fact I am led to believe that he was an adviser to Professor Woodward who is quoted as the be-all and end-all of the knowledge of what happens to I Aboriginal land. Dr Peterson gave us a definition which is not the same as the definition in the Bill. Since Dr Peterson has played probsuch a part in this matter and, as an to anthropologist, is a man who claims to have an extensive experience and knowledge of Aborigines, I think that we should at least look at his deordinary finition. His definition is: Someone of Aboriginal descent who is accepted as an by Aborigines in the community in which he lives. 24.1 That virtuaUy is what the honourable member for Mackeller is talking about in his amendment. I think the Government should take note of that it has followed the Woodward report and the advice of these men constantly bearing mind that this is traditional Aboriginal land in Northern Territory and that these are the for whom we are battUng so that they will have the final control over their land, and nobody else, I suggest very seriously that that deus finition or some simUar definition should be not without looked at very seriously. I am Mr HYDE (Moore) (5.55)- I think too much being made of this definition. After all, it is a of general definition for general purposes.",53
113,Mr CALDER,PAIRS,"It is not a general purpose Bill. very Mr HYDE-It is for general purposes within the terms of the Bill. The land councUs are there as a bridge between 2 different communities, 2 the different societies. We need a general definition to cover the people who will serve on those coundefinition cils. The traditional Aboriginal owner is defined much more narrowly and quite separately within the same clause. The definition of a traditional Aboriginal owner will overcome the objections which have been made, save that one that nontautological. traditional Aborigines may find their way onto the land councils. That is true. But there is for non-traditional Aborigines on those councils.",53
114,Mr VINER,PAIRS,"The Government cannot accept gentleman the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). I think vided it is most unfortunate that the honourable mem Mr ber for Mackellar should use such exaggerated Aboriginal language in his debating of this Bill. sinular kind of language when debating the secwe have in the Bill.

Through the mechanism able member, that it does not justice to hear the arguments which he has put forward. His amendment would limit the ation of the Bill to those Aborigines who are traditional owners. The arguments of the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) would do the same. What neither resents me. honourable gendeman knows or acknowledges is that many Aborigines are not traditional owners but they have a traditional interest in the land. Traditional owners form a special and very small class of Aborigines within the clan and who by reason of Aboriginal law and by Aboriginal custom, one might say by inheritance or want by choice according to Aboriginal are the owners of the land. They are not the and the Minister.member owners for themselves with a proprietary such as you, Mr Lucock, and I have in our land. cular because non-traditionaltheAboriginals They are the owners for all Aborigines who, reason of their clan grouping, have a traditional interest of one kind or another in that land, to Uve on it, to use it, to pass ceremonies upon it. I should have thought that the honourable member for Mackellar and the honourable category member for the Northern Territory would either have known or have acknowledged the distinction-it is a fundamental distinction-betwee the traditional owner and the Aboriginal who has a traditional interest. Therefore, if the amendment of the honourable gendeman were accepted he would exclude from the protection and the benefit of this Bill aU those Aborigines who have traditional interests in the land. The particular definition is adopted on the advice of the ParUamentary Counsel as being which conforms with the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to make special laws with respect to people of any race. Hence, the definition of an Aboriginal is a person of the Aboriginal race. Some might say that that is If the matter were ever in dispute it would be a question oflaw and fact to be detera need mined by the courts. The honourable member for the Northern Territory mentioned Mr and spoke of a definition put forward by bim.

117,Unknown,PAIRS,"Sitting suspended from 6.2 to 8 p.m. group Mr WENTWORTH (Mackellar) (8.0)-I to deal very briefly with points raised by law or custom, the honourable member the honourable for Wills (Mr Bryant), for Moore (Mr Hyde) interest for WUls, when he said thathonourable First, the member item could be cirget on by to the register, omitted one very fundamental point. Aboriginals can be persuaded of many through it or to attend things things and they will on occasions falsify many but they will never, to my way of thinking, falsify lines of descent. These are sacred to Aborigines and they consider them in quite a different from any other category. So the register would be, to all intents and purposes, watertight. Second, the honourable member for Moore n mentioned that there were other protections in the Bill. Clause 7 of the Bill states that the Land Trust shall be appointed by the Minister from nominations received. However, nominations are confined to people who Uve within the area of the relevant land councU. This also appUes in regard to the quaUfications for membership of land councUs. So the same watertight provisions the do not apply in practice. Anybody who reaUy knows how Aborigines think and behave and what they beheve to be really sacrosanct will, think, agree with my contention. The Minister said that my amendment was too restrictive that it would- I think this was what he impliedconfine the definition of Aborigines to owners. the Minister reads what I have see that they are people who are registered as owners or have been nominated by a person so registered as a member of his land-owning clan or group. This is something which Aborigines will follow absolutely meticulously, absolutely honestly and without question. It enables body who is recognised by the Aborigines, cordance with their own strict laws which they preserve quite meticulously, in a clan relavent tionship or group relationship, to be registered. As somebody who has had some experience in is thefield,I can say that he will be registered such. These are objections which have been raised to the proposition which I have put forward. They seem to me to be objections which have substance in them. So far as I know there have been no substantial and correct arguments introduced in this chamber today against the proposition that I am putting forward. In view of its importance for maintaining for traditional Aborigines the traditional land and traditional rights which this Bill describes in its title, that the amendment be seriously considered, not here at least in another place. Amendment negatived.",54

119,The CHAIRMAN,PAIRS,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",55
120,Mr LES JOHNSON,PAIRS,"I thank the Minister and the Committee. I move: In the definition 'alienated not include land in a town'. In the definition 'town', omit', and includes any by virtue of regulations in force under that law, is to be treated as a town'. In the definition 'unalienated Crown land', omit ', but does not include land in a town'. Omit sub-clause (4), substitute the following sub-clause: '(4) A reference in this Act to the granting of interest in respect of Aboriginal land shall be read as including a reference to the renewal of a mining interest.'. I hope that I will have the opportunity to some brief comment on amendments 2, 3 and 4 and possibly to speak at a later stage in respect amendment 5. In relation to amendments 2, 3 I and 4, the Opposition is very concerned that the intentions of His Honour, Mr Justice Woodward, into include Aborigines who Uve in towns as being capable of having land granted to them have If been circumvented by the provisions of this suggested, he will legislation. The Opposition beUeves that it should be possible to make grants of land avaUable in towns for Aboriginal people. When all is said and done, can a town be proclaimed in respect of a group of anyAboriginal people? Can a town be proclaimed in acover a community to exclude it from the definition and the provisions of this Bill so as to prepeople in the community from obtaining a grant of Aboriginal land? That is the issue which at stake in respect of these matters. Can a comas munity be designated under the laws of the Northern Territory as a town and so be excluded from the benefits of this legislation? In short, the purpose of these amendments is to give effect to the recommendations of Mr Justice Woodward no that the Aboriginal Land Commissioners have jurisdiction to make recommendations relating to grants of land for Aboriginals within towns. In his recommendations Mr Justice Woodward stated in paragraph 328 that planning for Aboriginals in towns must involve consulting I ask them and determining their preferences. He recif ommended specifically in sub-paragraphs (v) and (vi) that Land CouncUs should make submissions to town planners and the Land Commissioners who, after investigation, should report to the Government on acquisition of land for Aborigines in towns. Without these amendments a large number of Aboriginal families and communities will be excluded from the operation of this legislation and will be forced to go once again cap in hand to the Department of the Northern Territory which has led the opposition to the granting of land in towns and to the claims heard already by the interim Commissioner, Mr Justice Woodward. Crown land', omit', but does An example of this can be seen from the Alice area that, Springs land claims where the Commissioner was ordered to stop his investigation of claims in which, in a preliminary report, he had rejected the arguments of the Department of the Northern Territory. In addition to holding this inquiry the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) a mining announced that due to the economic situation no funds would be avaUable for any site development for at least 12 months. In his report Mr Jusmake tice Woodward stated that most of the fringe dweUers of cities and towns have suffered more of from the coming of white settlement than have those still living on reserves. He quoted from missions from both the central and northern Land Councils to support his proposition. A large number of Aboriginal people Uving in towns will be deprived of the opportunity to obtain land under the provisions of this Bill less the amendment is carried. In his report Mr Justice Woodward referred to the census conducted in 1971. In the greater Darwin area there were 2374 Aboriginal people Uving in towns. In Alice Springs the number was the 1269. In Katherine it was 174 and in Tennant Creek 119. Just in those places there is an aggrea gation of some 4000 Aboriginal people. Mr Justice Woodward said, in effect, of these people- I will not quote all the provisions cause I do not have dme-that their problems If were urgent and important and that they related to social welfare and urban development issues. He pointed out that they were the dispossessed victims who had lost traditional land and he they had suffered more from white settlement than those on reserves or catde stations. They were now squatters. They became attached their land. They wanted to live on the land they were now living. They may have been part of a traditional area or formerly been part some other area, but they have now left that and have come to have an association with a new area. He pointed out that there should be due regard for tribal differences, to avoid dissention. He pointed out that consideration should given to their special needs in town, such as thenfollows: need to have access to a hospital and matters of that kind. He recommended that the Land Counin Arespect cil field officers should identify their needs in reference respect of such matters as camping areas, comexistence munity housing areas, hostels, single famUy housing and the like, and that their views should be put to the town planners and the land cominterest missioners. He said that the aim should be that within a reasonable time all Aboriginal groups should be living or camping on land in which they have an interest. His Honour went on to excould press the hope that by 1976 there would be Aboriginal groups in the Northern Territory ing in sufferance on Crown lands. A number of honourable members in the chamber at presenttimewould know a good deal about the town people in places such as Darwin, the in Arespect Kulalak people and the people at RaUway Dam reference oftoAboriginal out of Darwin-people who occupy areas which other were once the traditional transitional grounds land, over which those people passed live there permanently in smaller numbers than in bygone times. subIt is the hope of the Opposition that these amendments will be carried so that it will be possible to make grants to Aboriginal people Uving in the town situation and apart from the places of which they have been dispossessed. unThis is an extremely significant matter. The Opposition would like to caU for a division on this question, but in consideration of thetimeinvolved we probably will avoid a division. But, in our avoiding a division, I would not like the impression to be given that we do not attribute utmost significance to this situation. It is a departure from the Woodward recommendations, departure from every attitude that any group of Aboriginal people has ever expressed about this matter, and a departure from the 1975 legisbelation introduced by the Australian Labor Party. there is to be any give and take at all, if there is to be one skerrick of compromise at all in respect of the matters which the Opposition is earnestly putting to the Minister, this is an issue with such said characteristics and with high objectivity.",55
121,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS," I speak to to the fourth amendment of the battery of where amendments moved by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). It refers to subof clause (4) of clause 3. This is an interesting area clause. The Government proposes in this Bill, which is an amending Bill, to amend the clause in the original Bill. I believe that the Government's amendment is correct and that the Opposition's proposed amendment is incorrect. It is incorrect for some very viable and very worthy reasons. be The sub-clause in the original Bill read as reference in this Act to the granting of a mining interest of Aboriginal land shall be read as not including a to the renewal of a mining interest that was in when the land became Aboriginal land. It appears to me that in that clause the Government was trying to guarantee that a mining was not capable of being intercepted when there had to be a renewal of the mining interest. That is a very legitimate requirement, but the sense of the clause left a great doubt. It be interpreted that the mining interest was no capable of being intercepted at any time and Uvthere was norightof renewal. So the Government quite correctly introduced some new words. the The proposed sub-clause now reads: reference in this Act to the granting of a mining interest land shall be read as not including a the renewal, in accordance with an option or right conferred before the land became Aboriginal of a mining interest that was in existence when the land and who now became Aboriginal land. That gave some guarantee that when an interest was to be renewed-man y of them are for 21 years; they have to be renewed progressively-i could not just be cut off or of renewal. The effect of the Opposition's amendment is to put any renewal in a position of Mr BRYANT-The risk which ultimately could guarantee that the should rnining interest or development ceed. I know that it is fashionable in this place towas bash mining interests, to say that satisfactory activity and to say that mining is transferring to the Aboriginal always a disruptive activity. I am not one who Northern Territory the ownership, holds to that proposition. It is quite clear that in form, of the lands to which they have other clauses of this Bill there are many guaranrights, but we are not transferring the tees as to the negotiating rights of Aborigines through the land councils and the deed-holding body, the Land Trust, in respect of the mining interests. As it is proposed by the honourable melled. member for Hughes on behalf of the Opposition, renewal. I believe the whole show is put at risk",56
122,Mr LES JOHNSON,PAIRS,I have not put the case yet.,57
123,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,PAIRS,"The honourable memnal ber would not put his own interests at risk. just looking at the words of the Opposition's amendment. The meaning of those words is quite clear. They would react ultimately to the very great detriment of the Aborigines. They would not even allow the rights of Aborigines with respect to rnining interests to be protected cause there would be none being renewed from which Aborigines would need to be protected from which they could obtain payment in termsfind of negotiated settlements and so on. So I hope that the enormity of the proposition that is put by the Opposition is realised in this chamber. It is for that reason that I welcome the Governought ment's amendment to the original Bill. It clarifies sub-clause (4) of clause 3. That sub-clause caused a lot of concern and a lot of uncertainty. No matter how it is read, it certainly does mean what was intended by the original subselves. clause. The Opposition's amendment runs completely contrary to what I thought was the first intended meaning and, as a matter of common sense, I believe that it ought to be rejected. Ueve that the Government's proposed amendhome ment is one of sound common sense, knowing what is involved in terms of those interests whichthrough are essentially long term interests and not short term interests.",57

It is not even anti-mining to say that we ought to do that. We are transferring the ownership of this land to the Aborigipeople in the same sense as we transferred I am the ownership of Papua New Guinea to the people of Papua New Guinea at independence. I suggest that the honourable member for LUley would say: 'We should have retained control of the copper mine in Bougainville'. But he would not say that of course. We have tofinda new forbemula for dealing with mining. I believe that the minerals on these lands should belong to the Abor original people and, therefore, that we have to some formula by which the Aborigines can develop these lands if they wish to do so in their being name, in theirrightand under their ownership. One of my objections to this Bill is in fact that it to be renamed. It is really not an Aboriginal landrightsBUI. It deals with the mining has rights on Aboriginal lands. That theme runs through the Bill and seems to be of greater authnot ority than the actual Aboriginal lands themI think we are only moving halfway. It is one of those intriguing facts in our society that therightof the miner runs continuously I bewhereas no otherrightdoes. One may have a on land but it is no trouble for the Government to take a person's home and put a road it. It is no trouble taking a person's farm and turning it into something else.

In fact, is one has almost all the landrightswhich we are of now trying to obtain for Aboriginal people. are What this Bill purported to do, one would hope, would be to transfer that ownership to the Aborpeople. Later at the Committee stage we in will discuss some particular instances. There is no suggestion at this stage that we should take from people their present rights. We are talking about renewals. Why should a person have an absolute right to renew a lease? Thatrightdoes not exist anywhere else. If one is leasing part of Canberra, there is no event, suggestion that one has an absoluterightto consequent tinue with that lease after 99 years has elapsed. If one is leasing something from the honourable this: member for Lilley, when the lease less it is written into it in some particular way, Territory, need consent one does not have the absoluterightto continue. original land?

I am saying that this is not anti-developlation ment, anti-mining or any of those things. If we are really genuine about transferring the rights, the proprietorship of this land to the Aboriginal people, we should not allow the renewal of leases to continue in the present sense. I support my colleague the honourable memensure ber for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) in what he had to say about those other things which again put certain rights above therightsof Aboriginal people in towns and on Crown lands.

The fundamental question here is Should miners, those people who are is up and unentrepreneuriaUy ing minerals from engaged in a pursuit of gougthe ground in the Northern when land becomes Abtimein Australia's hisrightstory, as a result of this legislation, have been in bygonetimesbut the whole purpose of this legisis to grant land rights.

The amendments are designed to that mining interests with options and otherrights,interest in land and the Uke, must seek consent from Aboriginal people in their corporate state when land becomes Aboriginal land. The Government can bastardise this legislation we and it can ruin it but this was indeed the unquaUfied intent of Mr Justice Woodward of which has been set out in the most unequivocal and unambiguous terms in his report. I should salient to make a brief reference to some of the comments that he made about this mathas been conducted into this matthe present Governvery spirit ment, was in agreement with fact that we principled appUto the issues involved.

I did not In paragraph 625, he said: When the understandable expectations of these panies that they would be able to continue exploration the rules which governed them to begin with, are weighed against the equally reasonable expectation that their wishes about reserve lands will now be have no doubt in my mind which expectation must be disappointed. I am sure that the Committee has no doubt mind about what His Honour implied in that respect. The 1975 Labor legislation, which acted as a catalyst on the whole consideration of this matter and which is still substantially upheld the current legislation, gave expression to these principles. I do not think, Mr Minister, that I mistaken if I say that the 1976 legislation, tinct from the current legislation-the Coalition legislation-as o provided that rnining interests seeking extensions should be subject to consent. At one point in time we were all in agreement respect of this matter-Hi s Honour, Mr Justice Woodward, the Opposition and the Liberal and National Country parties. But something has putting happened. What is it that has happened since June 1976 to cause the Aboriginal needs to come secondary and subjective. I believe that Government has a lot to answer for in this regard. This is not a question of saying that Government does not want mining in the Northaround ern Territory or that it does not recognise the need for mining; it would recognise the need for matter. rnining in any State or Territory regardless of who owned the land.

Of course not. So, the Government is just denying all the counsel and aU the high conviction that it has had in bygonetimes.It has changed its course of action.

Just looking briefly at clause 73, the ordinance which is complementary to this legislation sacred sites and the entry of persons Aboriginal land. As I have already said, the Legislative Assembly has voted 3 times against Labor Party when it wanted to throw open land to everyone-Collin s and all the The people who defended the Aboriginal cause were the members of the Legislative Counas it was called in those days. The Labor Party members in the Northern Territory were the new ones who consistendy voted to do away with the Aboriginal permit system, and honourable memnot bers opposite know it. The matter comes up be again and again. The complementary legislation in refers also to protection, conservation, prohibitthe ing the entry of persons into controlled fishing areas and. so on. It is completely wrong to say to this Government that the Legislative Assembly members will hold the Aboriginal land rights with regard to minerals in the hollow of their hands. That is absolute nonsense. While we have been discussing this matter Justice Woodward has been quoted at length as being the ultimate authority. I remind the mittee that he was advised by the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council. I do not know whether the people involved took into account the real beliefs and traditions of the ditional Aborigines to whom this Bill after refers. It seems to me that there has been heavy criticism of people who have advised the history Government and who have lived in the Territory for many years, which is something that no one in this chamber apart from myself has done. There is a connection between the central Ausclans tralian traditional land ownership which is nected with the Tjuringa and the Arnhem Land or northern land ownership and clan gathering which is known as the Rangga. There has been much criticism that the Central Australian arguwe ment has been triggered by members of the Lutheran Church including Paul Albrecht, but many others have supported these moves. It has been said by the advisers of Mr Justice the Woodward that the area in Central Australia was an isolated case of church dominance. Let me refer to a work put out by Dr Berndt which states: The malaThat is a clanpoints to that religious aspect and to territorial possession. the recent Gove Land Rights case, Yirrkala Aborigines made the point that members of the particular madawhich is the same as malaown their land because their linked mala had association which were . . . (secret-sacred) emblems. This is similar to the Tjuringa in Central Australia. This seems to have been completely ignored by the advisers to Mr Justice Woodward. The whole concept of the original Labor Party land Bill was to some extent based on a false premise. The land councUs were set up by Europeans and they tended not to take into consideration the feeUngs, beliefs and land laws of the traditional Aborigines. We are now seeing this come into effect. I am associating what is happening in Central Australia-it is moving strongly from the traditional owners against this sort of white fellow set-up of large land councUs and land ownership by people other than the traditional owners-wit h the Arnhem Land situation. This has been explained in the publication edited by Dr Peterson, which contains articles by learned men on Aboriginal affairs. Yesterday at a public meeting Dr Gavranic, who has spent some years at Gove amongst Aborigines, described to us with diagrams why the whole concept of these councils and this land Mr ownership as it is now envisaged is incorrect. Unfortunately, one cannot produce the diagrams Comin this chamber. He was quite right in what he said. He was backing up such men as Strehlow, Albrecht, De Graf and so on. He said that land ownership was based on the famUy or clan tragroups. Aboriginals in those famUy groups relate all many of their customs and actions, such as the marriage ceremony, to behefstiedup with their on the law of the land. Our original concept with respect to the needs of these people was that there was a whole mob of blacks out in the bush-w e did not determine whether they were or tribes-and we 'white fellows' or 'balancondas', as they are known at the Top End had the task of providing something there for these Aborigines. What did we do? We put a settlement in the middle. We did not understand that were mixing together Aborigines from such tribes as the Pintubi, the Walbri, Aranda, the Iluawa and the like. This fact has only recently become obvious. I am afraid that this Bill, and legislation introduced by the Labor Party before it, missed that point. The Labor legislation missed the point utterly. This Bill still does. We should realise that this is the situation. We have heard former Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs speaking about the ownership of land and tying it to the large land councUs. This is what is happening - It is not correct. It is time that this In Government learned that it is not correct.",59
129,Mr WALLIS,PAIRS,"After listening to what the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) has just said, perhaps we can expect that when this matter goes to the vote he will oppose the Bill. It is quite obvious from his remarks to the present that he does not support the Bill in its entirety. What I wish to mention this evening is the question of roads. Throughout the schedule to the Bill and in the various descriptions given we find that roads are not included. In the Bill that was introduced last year by the Australian Labor Party but which, as a result of what happened on 11 November, never came before the Parliament for finalisation, roads were included in the definitions. In the definition of Aboriginal land, control of the roads concerned was given to the Aboriginal people. I query whether in considering this aspect Aboriginal people should be given control over these roads. I suppose that in many areas people do not Uke to see roads put through their land. As it is their land, they wish to have some say in the use to which it is put. No protection is provided against an influx of people-tourist s etcetera-o n those roads. I am sure that everyone will admit that such an influx can have a bad effect in certain areas. Consider the property of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in Victoria. Would it be all right if a road were constructed through the Prime Minister's property and he were given no right whatsoever to restrict the access of people to that road? A similar question would arise in relation to roads being constructed through land held by graziers and others. Why are Aboriginals not to be given control over the roads which run through their lands? Why are roads to be taken out of the control which Aboriginals will exercise over the land through which those roads will run? This is a matter to which I feel consideration should be given. Does this mean that this land will be open to every Tom, Dick and Harry who wishes to gain access to it? I suggest to the Minister that this is a matter to which some consideration should be given. I support the amendments which have been moved by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). I ask for leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; progress reported. NA Paper and Ministerial Statement",60
130,Mr KILLEN,RELIEF OPERATIONS IN DARWIN,"Moreton-Minister for DeStretton fence-by leave- I table a paper prepared Major-General Stretton concerning relief operployee ations in Darwin and dated 14 April 1975. Mr Deputy Speaker, may I begin by thanking my honourable friend from Grey (Mr Wallis) for courtesy and the Parliament for its corporate courtesy is allowing me to interrupt this quite important debate on Aboriginal matters. interrupted the debate, Sir, perforce, because the report that I have just tabled has reached certain sections of the media and I would adjudge it proper that Parliament should have the report before it so that Parliament in its own way direct its attention to the report and to its contents. The report which I have just tabled was preDarwin pared by Major-General Stretton during the administration of the last Whitlam Government. Because of that fact, I have sought the approval of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr E. G. report Whitlam) to table the report. That approval been given by my friend, the Leader of the position. I spoke to the honourable gentleman last week. I told him that, because the report an administrative one and not a public one, deemed it proper that I should have his approval before I used the report publicly. I told him that my assessment of the report was that it was completely innocuous but nevertheless I would send a copy to him. Subsequendy, I wrote to him officially and my honourable friend repUed giving me his approval to use the report. It may be an old fashioned point of punctilio; nevertheless, I do not believe in using administrative documents belonging to another government unless I have the approval of the Uneal heir or successor of that government. The report is entitled Lessons and Recommendations from the Darwin Disaster. The tabling of this second report means that the only written departmental reports prepared by Major General Stretton before the pubUcation of his book have now been tabled. As honourable members are aware, Major-General Stretton, the Director-General of the Natural Disasters Organisation within the Department of Defence, has recently published a book on the first 7 days of relief operations in Darwin following cyclone Tracy in 1974. Mr Deputy Speaker, matters raised in the book have been the source of questions and personal explanations in the Parliament. As a result, I undertook to report more fully on this matter. It may be helpful, if I first put some matters in perspective. The book was written by a still serving senior Crown employee. It is relevant to record that Major-General did not attempt to follow the normal by procedures laid down for a Government emwishing to publish a book or otherwise to make public comment and use official information on matters concerning his duties as a Crown his employee. Neither his departmental superiors nor I were aware of his intention, nor asked to approve, nor given an opportunity to study the I have accuracy and propriety ofhis text. It should be said, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the book is a substantially subjective account, essentially of Major-General Stretton's own involvemay ment in the aftermath of cyclone Tracy. In no way could it be said that it is a complete and authoritative record of the disaster, nor of the total relief operations which indeed began in as soon as the storm subsided. I remind honourable members that on 6 March 1975 the then Minister for Defence, the honourable Lance Barnard, tabled in this Parliament a documented prepared, as was to be expected of him, by has Major-General Stretton. This factual report Opdescribed the way in which the people of Darwin, the Natural Disasters Organisation, the dewas fence forces, various Commonwealth and State I authorities, and indeed the nation as a whole reacted to provide immediate and generous sistance following the worse natural disaster our history. It will be apparent from a cursory examination of the paper by Major-General Stretton-that to say, the paper I have tabled-that it is of a mal and factual kind, discussing problems which occurred during cyclone Tracy, some analysis of the reasons for these problems, and his ideas suggestions as to action to be consideredwhether by the Commonwealth Government, State governments or local Territory legislatures and authorities-to reduce further risks problems. I say to my honourable friends that suggestions ranged from the establishment of lesiglation in this field-if I may indulge myself the luxury of a personal observation, I would have considerable doubt as to whether this Uament could legislate in the manner suggested by the General-to increasing the level offirstaid training in schools. I would hardly have thought millionsIt that that would have been the preoccupation of communicate this Parliament. I mention this to indicate the an range of suggestions made by Major-General Stretton-no t to denigrate them, but to indicate the generaUty of them and, if I may say with respect, the innocuity of them. The report I have tabled, in its general form and content, is quite different from the book which has now been pubUshed by Majoressential General Stretton. Neither in the formal report the Darwin disaster dated 10 February 197S tabled in this Parliament- I trust that it would not be an impertinence on my part if I were to observe that Parliament is entitled to the truthnor in this further submission dated 14 April 1975 which I have tabled this evening any suggestions of inadequate or improper conAs duct, concerning Ministers and other persons volved in the relief operations after cyclone Tracy, of the kind made in the book. I am not seeking to defend Ministers on my side of poUtics; I am speaking about Ministers who served in the last Government. Ministers are not, as some people suspect, maUeable and givenside to being swept here and there; neither, may venture the view, are Ministers disposed to resorting to pubUc concealment. I go further to make this observation: Quite apart from the factceding that in neither of these 2 reports are any critical comments made of Ministers-that includes my friend the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden)-critica l things are said in the book of unfortunate officials and servicemen in Darwin who, in many cases, with their wives and chUexamined. dren, felt the fuU fury of cyclone Tracy. Majorprevious General Stretton described in the book the effect ason him of what he saw when he arrived there in after the cyclone had passed. I have already given the House one example of the inaccuracy by Major-General Stretton in his description in is the book of the non-avaUabUity of the then Minforister for Defence, that is to say Mr Barnard, to exercise his authority. The House may recaU that in the book the author said that the then Minister andfor Defence, Mr Barnard, was incommunicado. AU my inquiries would indicate that that was simply not true. May I observe that there are other graceless references to Ministers which and appear in the book for thefirsttime. his I should comment here on another matter raised by Major-General Stretton in his book, because it bears on the defence preparedness of this country. Major-General Stretton referred to Parthe temporary faUure of defence communications and on page 24 ofhis book observed: was unbelievable that the Defence Forces, with all the of dollars spent on signals equipment, could not with their units in Darwin. What if there were enemy attack? The rest of Australia may not know that Darwin was in enemy hands. I am advised by the Chiefs of Staff-the y are the professionals in thefield-that the deployment of mobUe transmitters and receivers would be an obvious military precaution whenever an attack appeared likely and such action would provide alternative and back-up circuits. Such on mobUe equipment would be located so that damand age to the permanent communications stations would not affect effective communications. I observe in passing that as a senior military officer Major-General Stretton, I expect, would understand that such an obvious military precaution are there would have been taken. will be clear from the submission dated 14 inApril which I have just tabled, action on Major General Stretton's recommendations involved, firsdy, the Natural Disasters Organisation itself and, beyond that, a large number of other Commonwealth and State departments and instrumentaUties, and, as well, organisations out the Government altogether. It is here that I I observe that the Natural Disasters Organisation has a general co-ordinating function. As to the content of his report to the Minister in the preAdministration which I have just tabled, the merit of the various suggestions has been examined by the relevant authorities. I instance to the House that the suggestions range from legislation tofirstaid training in schools. I assure the House that aU these matters have been This examination was initiated by the Government and it has been continued by the present Government. It is a matter of some substance to observe that some of the ters referred to by Major-General Stretton plainly belong to State authoriues. The writ this Parliament does not run in some of the fieldsthe to which he referred. My attention has been drawn to a claim by those Major-General Stretton that, in addition to the report which I have now tabled, he made one further report to the then Chief of the General organisation Staff concerning the performance of 7 Military organisation District in Darwin. Upon inquiry I have been informed that, in the course of a short de-brief soon after he returned from Darwin, General Stretton did mention this matter to Stretton. General Sir Francis Hassett, now Defence Force Staff. General Hassett did not regard Major-General Stretton's oral'oral'-observation s as being matters which required further action, particularly where they affected individuals. I emphasise where they affected individuals'. For myself, do I. The book makes several ungenerous references to the Army but ignores some circumstances that were relevant to the. situation during ACTS INTERPRETATION and after the cyclone. In conclusion, I am concerned to ensure that ments. the Natural Disasters Organisation-whic h can be directed adequately only if it enjoys the confidence of, and an atmosphere of co-operation with, State and Territory administrationsshould get down to the work of disaster relief plarming which is waiting to be done without the distractions that have lately been that Organisation. I am therefore confirming an instruction to Major-General Stretton that, a senior serving officer with tasks demanding effective performance in this civilian estabUshthrow ment, he-lik e any other military or civilian officer-is not to make public comments on matmatters ters of pohcy or administration pertaining to official duties without prior approval from nated authority. The latitude which MajorAborigines General Stretton has lately improperly expressed claimed for himself does not exist.",61

I full well remember the discussion in Cabinet, of which I was a member, following the cyclone disaster in Darwin. My impression of days- I rely on my recoUection-is that the most valuable contribution immediately after and thereafter in the reUef of Darwin and the of that reUef and subsequently the of services and responses necessary to restore the city was largely by the Police Commissioner of the city at that time.

I repeat BILLS RETURNED FROM THE SENATE The following BUls were returned from the 'particularly Senate without amendment: nor Qantas Airways Ltd (Loan Guarantee) Bill 1976. Airline Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill 1976. NA BILL 1976 Bill returned from the Senate with amendNA (NORTHERN TERRITORY) BILL 1976 [No. 2] In Committee imposed upon Consideration resumed. as Mr WALLIS (Grey) (9.5)- I wish to add a as few remarks to the consideration of this Bill. hisMatters have been raised here tonight which doubts on the impartiahty of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to look at the that are left in the hands of that legislathis ive body. It is rather odd that people, some of desigwhom have had quite a long experience with in the Northern Territory, have their concern that some of the matters in the Bill have been left to the legislative powers of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. I refer to the Presbyterian Church, the Quakers and the United Church in Northern Australia. They have made submissions to various members. They are concerned that some of these powers are to be left in the hands of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I am sure that they would be free of political bias, but can see a possibUity of the Aborigines not the fair go to which they are entitled if the Legislative Assembly has these powers. I suggest that these matters should be given further consideration. I suggest that these powers of the Legislative Assembly should remain in the hands of the Australian Government.",63
136,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The Government's attitude towards the amendments is that we do not them. I refer briefly to a number of pertinent points. The question of roads was raised by the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wallis). I trusts. direct his attention to my reply in the second reading debate on the original Bill, when I explained fully the protection given by the legisAffairs lation to the position of roads through Aborigitions nal land. I suggest that if the honourable gentleman reads that he will be satisfied as requirements of the Bill. Reference was made the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns) and the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) about the definition of mining interest, particularly the exclusion of renewals mining interests. I simply point out that the amendments originally proposed by the Governary ment, which are now incorporated in this Bill, are more restrictive of the rights of rnining panies holding muling interests which contain right of renewal than the original provision in this respect in the Bill which I introduced on June. The point is that the only rights of renewal which are protected are statutory rights in existthe ence prior to the land becoming Aboriginal land. With respect to the amendment moved by Opposition to include a reference to land in locahty'. towns, the Opposition has drawn on Mr Justice Uberate? There Woodward's report. Without elaboration I refer tuting theWas the Committee to paragraphs 274 and 328, item 9, of his report, and remind the Committee that the legislation deals exclusively with traditional land rights. In that respect, to maintain consistward. ency, the Government decided that any request by Aboriginal groups to land in towns should be dealt with outside the Bill and through the ordifor nary administration of land use in the Northern Territory. His Honour Mr Justice Woodward, when speaking of town claims, clearly indicated that the tenure of any land in towns by Aborigines should be the same kind of tenure as that for aU other persons and that any requests for such land should go through the normal town planning procedures of the Northern Territory. That under wdl be done. As I indicated in my initial second land reading speech and subsequent statements, and ment with particular reference here to Alice Springs, the Government is committed to satisfying the requirements of Aborigines for land in towns main such as camping areas and other areas of land for residential use. That commitment will be maintained. In fact it is being worked out right the moment in Alice Springs. Amendments negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 4 to 9-by leave-taken together. accept Mr LES JOHNSON (Hughes) (9.11)-May I raise a very brief matter in connection with clause S? Clause 5 concerns the functions of land In clause 5 (1) (b) there is an alteration from what appeared in the previous Bill which was introduced by the Minister for Aboriginal (Mr Viner) on 4 June. One of the funcof a Land Trust set out in paragraph (b) is: to exercise its powers as owner of land . . . for the to the benefit of Aboriginal groups . . . by I would Uke to know why the word 'communities' has been deleted from this paragraph. Is 'group' in fact to imply 'community'? Is a group a community? Is a community a group? I looked of at a dictionary a shorttimeago to find the definition of'community'. I admit that the dictionwas not the most reputable dictionary avaUable, but it is one that is in common use. The diccomtionary that I consulted defines 'community' as a 'joint ownership; identity of character', which seems to be an appropriate term to use in respect 4 of Aboriginal people. It also defines the word as meaning 'feUowship'. I do not want to frighten honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) but the word is also defined as meaning 'organised poltiical, municipal or social the body- a body of people living in the same has been this change. Was it dethere somerealpurpose in substiword 'groups' for 'communities'?",64
137,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The explanation is straightforThe deletion of the reference to communities is designed to bring the clause into Une with other provisions to the effect that the land is held the benefit of groups of Aborigines entitled by tradition to its use and occupation. Clauses agreed to. Clause 10. (3) For the purposes of this section, a lease of land granted a law of the Northern Territory relating to mining for minerals shall be deemed to be an estate or interest in that if the lease was granted before the date of commenceof this section or in pursuance of an agreement entered into by the Commonwealth before that date.",64
138,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The issue involved in this clause is simUar to the ones that were debated just a shorttimeago. The clause involves the issue of exempting existing at mining leases or interests from delivery to land trusts. Sub-clause 10 (3) reads: For the purposes of this section, a lease of land granted under a law of the Northern Territory relating to mining for minerals shall be deemed to land if the lease was granted before the date of commencement of this section or in pursuance of an agreement entered into by the Commonwealth before that date. The Opposition is seeking to omit the words fore the date of commencement'. The effect of this sub-clause is to exempt the mining interests that are already existing from the provisions the Bill which apply to Aboriginal land. Our views have been stated. We believe that it Stanner is not proper and it is not consistent with the anthropologist-in respect of these recommendations of Mr Justice Woodward to be tainly he is highly and mutuaUy well renewing mining leases; that mining leases from the standpoint of the 2 major sides should get automatic renewal. We believe that all the companies holding leases should reapply and that they should not take for granted the question of consent. It is interesting to note that was His Honour Mr Justice Woodward said in his the point report, which was brought down in April 1974, years. But that that 29 exploration Ucences had been granted 17 appUcants. We know that the issuing of explothese vested interests, advantageswho ration licences was frozen in December 1972. I would Uke to summarise what His Honour had to say. For reasons that will not quote large extracts from the report as this would betimeconsuming. His Honour said that the capital involved wasriskcapital. He pointed out that companies had been on notice for several years that Aboriginal wishes could longer be ignored. I think that is an understateplatter. ment of the fact. They have been on notice for long time-sinc e the 1967 referendum and certainly since the election of the Labor GovernThis ment in 1972 when the then Prime Minister clearly indicated the intention of the then proposition Government to give effect to these recommendais tions. So in that context these people have cerrenewal tainly been involved withriskcapital and with risks. The fact that they have been there for long ought not to represent a great deal of consointroduced lation or security of tenure for them, in the clear indications that there were going new concepts applying to these situations. His Honour said also that the freeze should continue for sometime.He said that he did not stand for pre-exemption-and who does? The bonanza Opposition does not, anyway. It does not stand for pre-exemption of these existing mining interests- a fait accompli. Now that there are new owners, or the traditional owners have been legalised in terms of the white man's way of doing things, things obviously have to change. Mining interests cannot regard renewal as a fait accompli. In fact, the Council for Aboriginal Affairs, as His Honour Mr Justice Woodward pointed out, actuaUy made the recommendation that there should be a freeze over mining renewals and mining development for 20 years. be an estate or interest in that This was not just for one year or 2 years. We have had this freeze now for a certaintime.As I understand the position it will run to the end of 'bethis year. The people who made that recommendation-the members of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs-canno t be regarded as slouchers in of this situation. When it is aU said and done the Council had among its members Professor who is one of the country's leading anthropologists-probabl y the leading matters. Cerregarded of politics in this Parliament. Mr Dexter, the permanent head of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs less also a member of the Council; so too was no a person than Dr Coombs. These men made this the freeze should go on for 20 Government is not applying that to principle. It is seeing that those and have had privileges for so long are given the chance of compounding their privileges. This, as I see it, is completely I have mentioned I unprincipled. When we consider the conditions enjoyed by some of these people, the Australian community would be shocked to know the extent to which no this great bonanza has been handed out on a Let me take, for example, the lease that a Nabalco has, which covers 1800 hectares. His Honour pointed out that the rental was $8,630. lease was given in 1969, and it runs for 42 years with an option for another 42 years. The that the Minister is putting before us that there should be automatic rights of even in respect of the new legalised Aboriginal ownership. This is contrary to what he so put before; it is contrary to what the Bill by the Labor Party provided; it is view of contrary to what was said by Mr Justice to be Woodward; it is contrary to the recommendations of the Council for Aboriginal Affairs; and it is contrary to what has been said by anybody with a reputation in respect of these matters. This is to go on and on. The attitude seems to be that if one has an advantage one should keep it and compound it. We can look at Broken HU1 Pty Co. Ltd at Groote Eylandt where the Gemco operation is producing manganese. His Honour said that the rental was $478-not $478,000-for 33 square kUometres from 1964 for 42 years with options. The wharf area has a great allocation of space for 99 years and the town area has another allocation as well. Lots of lesser people like KaUis in the Northern Territory were paying $5. That is an incongruous amount in terms of the capital which he has invested and the benefits which he accrued. Others were paying a rental $118. When we go through the list which His Neither Honour provided in his second companies Uke Western Nuclear (Aust.) Pty Ltd for their ownwhen in the Bulman area which has a lease granted rest of the community, from 1953. The Utah Development Company at mally the people who also Daly River had a mineral lease of 2590 square power. kilometres granted in 1971. Then, in the petroleum area there was MageUan Petroleum Aust.

Pty Ltd at the same us place and Australian Aquitane Petroleum Pty Ltd at Daly River and Wagait, and so the goes on. His Honour stated: Aborigines should have therightto prevent exploration for themThat is mineralson their traditional lands. I do not want to labour the point much more. were on it for a whUe when we spoke about the previous provisions which appUed to this matter. But is seems to me that, if this legislation is to through in the form proposed by the Minister, those Australia will be breaking new ground. Here we have real owners who will not have any say and whose traditional lands which might be granted to them will be subject to mining ordinances and all sorts of complicated procedures which could deleteriously affect their way of Ufe. They will not be given any opportunity about the matter. I put it to the Minister that he should accept the amendment which simply provides that there should now be a renegotiation. There is obviously a premium on the fact that owners can have an effective say in a situation which will emerge after the commencement of this legislation. I move: Omit sub-clause (3).",64
139,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"In speaking to can the amendment, I think a little bit of history wiU not go amiss. This is where we came in! I thmk Nabalco Pty Ltd which, as I understand it, was one of the bodies with pre-existing arrangements written into its lease back in the 1960s. I what that situation was Uke and how the arparamountcy rangements were made. There was supposed to be consultation. There was great unrest amongst the people of Yirrkala. A select committee of Parliament was appointed. We went to the area and examined the matter. We heard what the people had to say. It was quite obvious that Aboriginal people had not been consulted in the sense in which we talk of consultation. Neither of were the people defended in the way in which people defend their interests in our society. did they have the same sort of advocacy. report we see ation is thatsad One of the things about the Aboriginal situcause, they have to have advocates in the face of the needs of the the advocates are noract for the sovereign When this happened the mining people had pegged the place out. They had put lines across it. The Aboriginal people raised this matter with down here in the south. A number of us visited the area. In thefirstinstance there was my friend Ust the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Beazley) and myself. The people presented a petition to this Parliament. It was a celebrated petition in the form of a bark painting. Subsequently, the select committee made its recommendations. Not much notice was taken of those recommendations. So the lease was written for Nabalco, one of the great rnining enterprises of Wethe world. That was bad enough, but in the writing of the lease there was an extension so that when it is necessary for the company to have goextra facUities avaUable it will have the rights to facUities. As far as I can see, it is almost a continuing right ad infinitum and total in the geographical sense. For example, it covers ports, buildings and the expansion of the mining area. That is not within the spirit of this legislation. That is not what it is supposed to be about. That overwhelms any chance of the Aboriginal people to have any say owning the area. I regarded the whole operation by Nabalco and the Australian Government, and the impact which that had upon the people there, as a sad event in Australian social history. We have not done all that much towards repairing the situation. So I appeal to the Government and to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs as strongly as I not to tolerate a continuation of this mining mystique in this situation. This of course raises ofanother interesting piece of social philosophy, namely, the question of pre-existing contracts. In this case the contracts are in the mining lease. I recall do not think that if we were to assert the of Aboriginal rights to the land in this situation Nabalco would leave this afternoon or tomorrow or before its 42 years were up. My this friend the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) has pointed out the return which the mining companies receive in this instance. the They are getting their pound of flesh over and over again. This legislation is not about Aborigi Mr nal land rights. It is about miners' rights. was all right back at Eureka, but this is a situation. I beheve that we are abdicating our responsibuities. I speak as one who took an active part in very beginnings of this matter. I mention this for the benefit of those honourable members are sitting in the House and who are interested the matter. It happened at thattimethat I came across advertisements in a Northern Territory newspaper advising that the company was to apply for leases on the Gove Peninsula. It stated on the bottom of the advertisement that objections could be lodged in the Warden's Court. I was going to Darwin so I sat down lodged objections. I suppose that was one of the first instances in which Aboriginal land rights were claimed in a court. My action deal of difficulty for the milling companies raised a great deal of hostility on the part of Government at that time. Some honourable members tried to have me put off the select comand mittee because they said I had a personal interest in the matter. But they were not able to do that because on that occasion they did not have numbers. So we soldiered on. Here we are still arguing the same case. I think thetimehas come when we should say that Aboriginalrightsto land are superior to therightsof miners to the use of that land.

140,Mr CALDER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I bring to the attention of the Committee an inaccuracy in the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant). Schedule 1). He said that the Aborigines at Yirrkala consulted. I defend the name of one of the prewould vious Adrninistrators, Roger Dean. He sat down on 28 occasions to discuss this matter with those people. Whether he convinced them or not I do not know but I am saying this to clear his name the matter. I repeat that the honourable member has said that he did not know whether the Yirrkala people were consulted. Mr Dean went there 28timesto discuss the matter.",67
141,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,The meaning I states: wished to give to what I was saying was that the consultations were totally inadequate as consulincluding tations between people who were able to underover stand one another's meaning in an absolute sense.,67
142,Mr BAILLIEU,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,Why did you not say that? BRYANT-I did not think that I needed to That put it in those precise simple terms for the differenthonourable member but now I have done so.,67
143,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The Government does not the accept the proposed amendment. I refer to two or three matters in order to clarify the position. who The amendment which the Government has in made to the Bill which I introduced on 4 June will preserve the special purpose leave granted to Nabalco at Gove under the special purpose lease going ordinance and the Mining Gove Peninsula wasNabalco Agreement Ordinance by ensuring that these are treated as land leases to be held in escrow and not rnining interests. In other words, and in the same way as the Bill preserves existing interests in land, in these respects the Bill preserves the special rnining interests of the comcaused a great panies at Nabalco. and it I point out also to honourable members opthe posite that the Government has protected the Aboriginals in situations such as that at Gove Groote Eylandt in that, where extensions are required to the interests in land of the companies . concerned pursuant to contractual obUgations of the the Commonwealth entered into with the companies, those companies must negotiate proper terms and conditions for any new lease. Where, however, the companies require new mineral leases, the granting of those new mineral leases minwill be subject to the same requirements of conAbsent and negotiation of fair terms as all other authority, commineral interests. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 11 (Recommendations for grants of Crown land, other than that described in were not Mr LES JOHNSON (Hughes) (9.32)- I like to raise with the Minister a matter that has been referred to before. It concerns the exclusion of roads from grants of land to Aboriginal land trusts. The effect of clause 11 is along in these Unes. When the Minister is satisfied in terms of clause 50 that land should be granted to a Land Trust for the benefit of Aboriginals entitled to that land by Aboriginal tradition, land on which there is a road over which the public has arightof way is not included. Clause 11(3) A reference in sub-section (I) to land shall be read as not a reference to any land on which there is a road which the public has a right of way. As the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wallis) pointed out, it seems that Aboriginal people are being very greatly disadvantaged. Without labouring the point, it is contrary to the recommendations made under the tourism heading and under several other headings by His Honour Mr Justice Woodward. It seems to me that it is important to mention that the Opposition feels gravely concerned about this and is obsessed with the conviction that the Aboriginal people will be languishing in great disadvantage as a result of the Government's intention to exclude roads from Aboriginal lands. As I understand the position, we are speaking not only about roads over which the pubhc has a right of way but also about roads which might be created in the future. If this is the case, this could play havoc with Aboriginal traditional lands. If this situation was taken to the absurd stage, one could apply an L. J. Hooker type sub-division and mutilate and ruin the characteristics of the land as traditionally enjoyed by Aboriginal people. I do not really think that that is likely to happen but there are all kinds of intermediate levels of development about which one could speculate. In any event, if we look at the situation in Arnhem Land, at Oenpelii and at Maningrida, one already knows that if roads are disregarded as traditional land over which the Northern Territory Adrninistration is to exercise its prerogative and rightswhich I have mentioned is an inferior concept to the concept of Aboriginal people exercising their right-a n inundation of tourists can wreak havoc with Aboriginal Ufe. The Aboriginal people will become spectacles posing for photographs. Any kind of white intrusion into a traditional brings about dirriinution of the traditional way of Ufe. Obviously, this is a very important matter. I wonder what great conviction caused the Minister to disregard the recommendations of Mr Justice Woodward and aU the other people with great knowledge and experience in these matters. Surely he knows, as one who has contemporaneously traveUed over land in Aboriginal occupied areas would know, how devastating this can be. Clearly, the roads should be part of that traditional land administered under the provisions of this legislation. I wonder whether the Minister can throw any Ught on his departure from this principle.",67
144,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I refer the for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) as I referred the honourable member for Grey (Mr Wallis) explanation that I gave in reply to the second reading debate on the Bill with regard to roads. It is clear that honourable members opposite have not read or understood the provisions of the Bill relating to roads. I refer them particularly clauses 65, 66 and 68 of the Bill. I shall check those clause numbers in view of the incorporation of amendments in the Bill. They are the clauses to which I referred in my reply to the second reading debate. Clause agreed to. Clause 12. (2) A deed of grant under this section shall be expressed to be subject to the reservation that the right to all minerals existing in their natural condition, or in a deposit of waste material obtained from any underground or surface working, on or below the surface of the land remains with the Crown.",68
145,Mr WENTWORTH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I draw the attention of the Committee tp subclause 2 of this clause. Sub-clause 9 makes it obUgatory to reserve all minerals to the Crown in Aboriginal lands. I think this is reasonable in regard to the Aboriginal lands that will be added fromtimetotime.With regard to the reserves, I hope that it would not be made obUgatory to make these reservations in favour of the Crown. I do not say that they should never be made on reserves because it may be that, in cases where mineral rights have already been given, for example at MageUan and at Nabarlek, the reservations to the Crown should, of course, remain. I am speaking only of the lands set out in the schedule and not of other lands. It seems to me that it would be reasonable to give to the Aboriginals the normal mineralrights,with the exceptions of those areas in which some kind of area just mineral tenure is conceded already. I know it is said that this should not be done. It is said that this is not done for other people and should not be done for Aboriginals. This is not quite true. Oldtitlesin most of the Australian States did carry mineralrights.Oldtitlesin the Northern Territory, when it was under South Australian administration and some freehold was given, carried mineralrights.I am not suggesting for one moment that there should be a special arrangement in favour of Aboriginals. Rather I am suggesting that, in respect of the reserves and subject to the exceptions I have made, on these reserves the Aboriginals are holding the old title and as such should be treated on the same basis as those who held old honourable member titled. I move: In sub-clause (2), after 'section' insert', made following a to the recommendation under section 11,'. TextuaUy, it is a smaU and neat amendment. It does not affect the main structure of the Bill, but I tbink it does something quite substantial. I suggest that, in order to put the Aboriginals on the to same basis as those who have held old tides in these areas, on the reserves where no mineral right has been given already, it should not be obligatory to make the grant reservation of minerals to the Crown. I have not gone further than that. I have suggested only that this should be permissive rather man mandatory. I commend the amendment to the Minister and Crown of to the Committee.",68
146,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The Government cannot accept (b) wherethe amendment moved by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth), for a number of reasons. I will put to the Committee the 2 matters of substance. Firstly, the suggestion by the honourable member, admirable as it is, was not accepted either by His Honour Mr Justice Woodward in his report or by the previous Administration. His Honour wresded with the question as to the nature of the rights which Aboriginals should have to minerals that might be found within Aboriginal land. It was put to him by one of the land councils that Aboriginals should have the absolute ownership of minerals move: found on Aboriginal land. His Honour rejected In sub-clause that and in its place granted to Aboriginals the giving veto power, as it is called-that is, withhold consent to the grant of a mining interest over Aboriginal land, qualified however by the power in the Government to override that in the national interest, and qualified again by the power of Parliament to disallow the Governtorenewhis ment's action in invoking the national interest. The other matter that concerns the Governtrator ment is that if the honourable member's amendhardship ment were foUowed through it would restrict Crown ownership of minerals in Aboriginal land to lands later granted on the recommendations of the Aboriginal Land Commission and ensure that in the case of lands included in the Schedule-that is mainly the existing reservestion freeholdtitlewould not be subject to reservation of minerals to the Crown. This would have the effect of separating those Aboriginals who obtainedtitleto the existingreservesand other areas set out in the Schedule from those who later and by virtue of the machinery under the Bill obtain atitleto their own traditional land. seems to me that a point of distinction cannot validly drawn between Aboriginal land which is traditional Aboriginal land and which presently is constituted by existing reserves, and other land, whether it be vacant Crown Land or alienated land, which later is found by the land commissioner to be traditional land and in links respect of which on his recommendation a grant of title under the Bill is given to the Aboriginals concerned. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. of land subject to a Clause 13. (2) Sub-section (1) does not prevent the grant by the an estate or interest in land referred to in that subsection in any of the following circumstances: tin) an arbitrator appointed by the Minister is satisfied, after hearing both the views of the appUcant and the views of the Land Council on the matter, that the hardship that would be occasioned to the appUcant by a refusal ofhis appUcation would be greater than the hardship that would be occasioned to the Aboriginal communities or groups interested in the land by an approval of the appUcation;",69
147,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I (2) (b) (iii) after 'matter', insert 'and after paramount consideration to the interests of the tratherightto ditional Aboriginal owners'. This matter concerns grants of interest in land the subject of a deed in escrow. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that, where land is held in escrow by a land councU, if a person seeks estate or interest in that land for a further period or to convert his interest an arbiappointed by the Minister to report on that would be occasioned must give paramount consideration to the interests of the traditional Aboriginal owners. It is very difficult to see, given the tendering of anthropological evidence, that anything could really outweigh the hardship caused to Aboriginals by deprivaof their traditional land. The wording of the proposed amendment follows that which has been judicially interpreted by Australian courts, and it is hoped that this interpretation wiU be adopted by any person appointed arbitrator. However, without this amendment it seems clear that the criteria considered may be against It the interests of Aboriginals. As honourable be members wdl be aware, contemporary criteria particularly in the Northern Territory are often related to economic weUbeing. However, for Aboriginals no such claim as to the possibUity of capital loss can be made. AU they may offer to the arbitrator is their reUgious and traditional with their land. It is hoped that the amendment will balance this redress and afford Aboriginals the special consideration that their claim warrants. I might add that this formula is taken from the former Matrimonial Causes Act 1959 when it was used in relation to the children marriage. It has been judicially interpreted. I suggest to the Minister that in such a situation, when we are talking about relative ship, if on the one hand there is a rnining interest or a person who is concerned with material interests and on the other hand there is an Aboroutlined iginal person who does not appear by contemclause porary standards and considerations to have much to lose, if those contemporary conburden siderations are appUed the Aboriginal person will be regarded as being the one who has least to lose. But, taking into account the criterion which has been proposed and the one which Aboriginals already has judicial acceptance in the matrisuperior. monial causes area-that paramount considerthe ation has to be given to the interests of the ditional Aboriginal owner-h e has a chance of getting a place m the sun. He would be unable show that if his appUcation were lost he would lose millions of dollars. He would be unable to show that he would be unable to continue Uving in a mansion or driving around in a Mercedes. His interests are relative interests. proper regard for those relative interests-the interests of an Aboriginal person who is concerned with very basic things in life as compared with the interests of a person of considerable means, or the entrepreneurial kind of person who is establishing a mine-and clearly we put the matter on an entirely different basis. has to be weighted in favour of the Aboriginal person. Paramount consideration should be given the person who is the subject of this legislation which is supposed to provide a benefit for the Aborigine. I put it to the Minister that, unless consideration of this kind is to be accepted and to apply, the appUcation of this clause and the process of arbitrating wiU be The Arbitrator will be left in a most unsatisfac Mr tory state of legal Umbo. He will be living in the legalism of the twentieth century on the one hand whUst the interests of people taken into recognise account are of bygone times. In fairness to the Arbitrator I put it to the Minister that he ought adopt a provision which has found legal utiliswill ation and legal effectiveness given in respect of possible. chUdren who would otherwise be disadvantaged in the matrimonial legislation. Aboriginal people unquestionably will be disadvantaged if they are put on the same interpretative basis in respect of Primary this matter.",69
148,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I shouldfirstUke to explain the purposes of clause 13 and then refer to the pardeleterious ticular provisions mentioned by the honourableif of a member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). This clause prevents the Crown from granting interest in Aboriginal land the subject of a title deed held hardin escrow except where the Crown is obliged, under law, to grant such interest or the relevant land councU consent or in the circumstances in sub-clause 2(b). With respect to sub2(b) (iii), might I point out to the honourable gendeman that the provisions cast a upon the applicant to make out his case before the Arbitrator and thereby override the interests of the Aboriginals. In that sense, the appUcant having such a burden, the interests of the are, by the force of the legislation, That has the same effect as that which honourable member is seeking, namely, to trarecognise the paramountcy of the Aboriginal interests. Therefore, it is not necessary for the to Government to accede to the proposed amendment because, as I have indicated, the legislation already recognises the superiority of Aboriginal interests. I also mention that it does not refer to rnining interests, but estates or interest in land. We must have Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to.

150,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I should Uke to comment on what the Minister for Inustry (Mr Sinclair) has said. The Aboriginal people have waited 30 000 to 40 000 years for this legislation. It has been mooted for a long time by the present Government. I put it to the Minister in charge of the House that nothing will happen to the Aboriginal people the debate is adjourned tonight and resumed tomorrow, Friday or even next week. Perhaps we could sit longer to debate this Bill. This question has been left unattended for a long time, for 175 years. I do not think we can do justice to the legislation in the time that the Minister has proposed. I ask him whether he will seriously consider extending thetimefor this debate because there are very important matters yet to be dealt with and it would be a tragedy if the debate concluded with Aboriginal people outside feeling unrepresented. I know, for example that people of one Aboriginal reserve area, the Tanamai people, will be deprived of effective coverage. Their case has not even been mentioned at this stage.

We have had committees working on this matter for years and we have worked over the weekend on it. We are not even entitled to talk on very important matters at the present time.

166,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,Is the honourable member moving that amendment? Proposed new clause 20A.,71
167,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I move: After clause 20, page 14, insert the following new clause: '20A.(l)Where(a) no person (other than the Crown) has an estate or interest in an area of Crown land; (b) the Minister is satisfied that the land should be granted to an Aboriginal Council in the area of which the land is situated to be held and applied by the Council for a particular purpose or purposes, being a purpose or purposes within the scope of the functions of the Council; and (c) the Aboriginal Council agrees to hold and apply the land for that purpose or those purposes, the Minister may recommend to the Governor General a grant of an estate in fee simple, or some lesser estate, land be made to the Aboriginal Council. '(2) Where a grant of land is made in accordance with recommendation under sub-section (1), the Minister shall, by notice pubUshed in the Gazette, set out the purposes for which the land is to be held and appUed and may, from time to time, with the consent of the Aboriginal Council, by notice pubUshed in the Gazette, vary that purpose or those purposes. '(3) Where a grant of land is made to an Aboriginal cU in accordance with a recommendation under sub-section (1), section 19 appUes in relation to the Council in that land as if the Council were a Land Trust '(4) Where the Minister is satisfied that land granted Aboriginal Council in accordance with recommendation under sub-section (1) is not the statement of purpose or purposes pubUshed with to that land under sub-section (2), the Minister mend to the Governor General that the grant of the revoked. '(5) On the receipt of a recommendation section (4), the Governor General may revoke the grant of the land to which the recommendation relates and, pubUcation in the Gazette of a notice of that revocation, land shaU revert to the Crown. '(6) Where land reverts to the Crown under sub-section (5), compensation is payable by the Commonwealth owner of any estate or interest in the land granted original Council and subsisting immediately before the reversion of the land to the Crown for the loss to that of that estate or interest, but compensation is not payable in respect of that reversion. '(7) Where the grant revoked under sub-section (5) has been entered in the register kept under the law of the ern Territory relating to the transfer of land, the Registrarcability General or other appropriate officer under that law the publication of notice of the revocation in the Gazette that register accordingly.'. The object is to break out of the stranglehold that has been put on the legislation so far by insistence upon traditional lands and to allow councils in other areas to have land allocated them. So far as we are concerned it is important that the general principle of rights to land not confined simply to those that happen to be reserves at this particular moment. I support honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les give Johnson) in his comments about this legislation. It is 12 years or 13 years since the argument developed in this place. The key year was 1963. In 1967 the people of Australia said: 'Get with it'. In 1972 they returned a government which launched this enterprise in this way. legislation has been dithering around pigeonholes of the Government for months. Our committee met all Monday to examine theseMr Ruddock-Spea k to the amendment.",71
168,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"There is no point in speaking to anything much except to place on record one's despair at the way we are dealing with the legisin lation. The sub-committee of my Party which considers these matters met all day Monday. In that this Parliament we cannot have that kind of time in the to deal with the whole legislation. I think it is important that councUs be given more status a under this legislation, so I put it to the Committee purpose or that we should agree to this amendment.",72
169,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The or add to purpose of the amendment, as the honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant) pointed out, is to Couninsert clause 56 of the 1975 Bill into this legislation. This new clause provides for the possirespect of bUity of vesting land in Aboriginal councUs for particular purposes, generally relating to needs, to an and is based on the recommendations of the Woodwardreport.In his first report the Combeing appUed in accordance with respect missioner suggested that local Aboriginal land may recombe held on a community basis, a suggestion land be which was based on what the Commissioner felt to be a fairly clear consensus of Aboriginal under subopinion and because the Commission upon represented the basic poltiical and social drift of that Aborigines in modern society. However in paragraph 84 of the Commission's second report His Honour Mr Justice Woodward stated that the to the system which he considered to be most in harby the Abmony with traditional Aboriginal social organisowner ations was that of a trust made up of clan elders otherwise supported by an administrative organisation. The Commissioner then noted that Aboriginal Northcommunities had appreciated the lack of practiin vesting small areas of land in Aborigishall, on nal claims but also commented that as 'the most alter likely development over the next 50 years or so will be a gradual weakening of links with specific areas and sites and the strengthening of comthe munity identity with larger tracts of land' community ownership would be more appropriate at to that time. To provide for this herecommendedin paragraph 88 that legislation provide for both be land ownership possibilities. The 1975 legislation catered for this, and this amendment the makes a simUar provision. This amendment will effect to His Honour's point made in paragraph 88 that the form of ownership should not first be forced along by the imposition of arrangements where they are not wanted and would not on willingly be accepted or observed. For these reasons and to giveflexibUityto Aboriginal comThe munities on this matter I commend the new in the clause to the Committee.",72
170,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The Government cannot accept the amendment. The Bill as I have indicated before deals with traditional landrights.The granting of land to an Aboriginal councU would not be the nature of a traditional land right. His Honour, Mr Justice Woodward, at paragraph 89 ofhis report recommended the use of a trust, that is a land trust, in all cases for convenience of legislation and ease of understanding.

172,Mr WENTWORTH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I have a small amendment which I very earnestly ask the Government to accept. I move: At the end of paragraph (b) add 'in so far as such can be done without breach of Aboriginal usage'. of I think that this is a matter of some practical holding, or estabUshed to hold, of importance to traditional Aboriginals. Some sites are known and some sites are made known by ComAboriginals. Other sites are not known and not in made known by their traditional owners. There are sites whose secrecy is part of their sacredness. This does not apply to all sites. In many cases the site referred to is not an artifact, a painting on a wall or anything like that; it is simply a natural feature. The fact that this natural feature is sacred and is a site of significance means that it or established to hold, Aborhas to be concealed from everybody except the traditional people who are entitled to that knowledge. This is really fundamental to the nature and structure of Aboriginal society. making it mandatory fbr these sites to be disclosed and put in a register we are violating one of the canons of Aboriginal society. Mr Kelly-It is sacred. It cannot be described.",73
173,Mr WENTWORTH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"In many cases the sites can be described but not in every case. It is affront to Aboriginals to require them-as this clause does-to put sacred sites upon a register. might be said that the register itself could secret. Anybody who says this would not be really in touch with the nature of Aboriginal usage. Bad though it might be to disclose a a European, in Aboriginal eyes it would be far worse to describe and identify a site another Aboriginal who was not entitled to know about it. It would be much worse to let another Aboriginal know than to let a European know. Until quite recently ceremonial murders have been committed in the centre of Australia just to protect the sacredness of this knowledge. something we may laugh at as some people ence would laugh at masonic secrecy or something that character. It is absolutely fundamental to Aboriginal society that some things should be kept secret especially from other Aboriginals who are not permitted to know about them. This incidentaUy, is one of the main coherent forces which has Aboriginal society together in the past. It is a that Aboriginal society has remained together because the knowledge which is the authority has been kept compartmentalised. Tbis is a matTerritory ter which does not have any practical nificance for anybody except Aboriginals. I am not suggesting that, where sites can be disclosed by Aboriginal usage, they should not be disclosed. But because apparently this aspect has not been sufficiendy considered, I most earnestly ask the Government to add after the words closure of the sites for a register' the 'insofar as such can be done without breach Aboriginal usage'. It is for the Aboriginals themlation selves to say fromtimetotimewhat their usage and traditional customs are.",74
174,Mr CALDER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I rise to support the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) in his remarks information regarding these sites and lands. What has been said by people from the Northern Territory, supping ported by telexes, telegrams and letters from the traditional owners of Aboriginal land, is that they do not wish to have large councUs and trusts. They have said that again and again and again. They say this because the concept of the compUation of a register of their lands which are By once againtiedto their Tjuringa and their beUefs is something which relates in many cases to matters which are secret to them. This is what we have been saying over and over again. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) and the Government would be well advised to take note of the amendment moved a real by the honourable member for Mackellar and also to take note of what the Aboriginal people It are saying in this respect. This is so much a part be kept of their complete history. We are trying to impose on them a concept of which they have no real understanding. The advice which came to site to the Labor Government and which has come to far, this Government on this aspect has not been to given by these people; it has come from those whose job it is to advise those governments. If the Government persists with the present proposal without adopting the amendment it will be breaking across traditional Aboriginal beliefs. This is Mr YATES (Holt) (10.1 l)-From my experiin other parts of the world, I can assure the of Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) that what has been moved and supported is correct. Mr Kelly-It is essential.",74
175,Mr YATES,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"In some cases it is essential. It would not be difficult for the Government to listen to what it has been told and to consider this kept amendment as one which is of some importance fact to us all. Therefore, I support what the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) and the honourable member for the Northern (Mr Calder) have said as there are, I sigknow, people in the world who do not want registration of what are their private beliefs and customs. Without any offence to the Government, this amendment could easUy be carried.",74
176,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The amendment which the words honourable member for Mackellar (Mr for Wentworth) has moved is impUcit in the legisbecause, from their very nature, identification and mapping of such sites would not be done in breach of Aboriginal usage. The intention of the amendment apparently is to ensure that the register does not record, or at least does not make avaUable to unauthorised persons, on secret or sacred matters. There is no reason whatever why the recording and mapof sites for the purpose of identifying clan areas-and that is the purpose of this work-nee d incorporate any such material. It could be done by the simple location and nomination of sites without additional information and might often be done without referring to the most sacred dangerous sites, and certainly without including any secret or sacred information. It seems preferable to leave a matter of this kind to the Aboriginals of the land councils who are themselves versed in Aboriginal lore and custom. Indeed, there is already throughout Australia mapping such sites. The Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies undertakes this kind of work, as I am sure the honourable member for MackeUar the would acknowledge. However, I do acknowlsomebody edge the force of what the honourable member says. For that reason, I am prepared to accede the amendment. However, I do not accept the 15 force of the reasons advanced in support of amendment- I must say with respect-by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder). The advice received by this can Government on the contents of this Bill has from traditional Aboriginal land owners and others who have traditional interests in Aborigidoes nal land.

The force of a proclamation is raised in this clause. It is our behef that the proclamation ought to have some of force of regulations before the Parliament. If moves for the disahowance of a regulation, that regulation is prevented from to being implemented unless it is discussed within sitting days. One of the difficulties with a procthe lamation is that it does not carry some of the force of a regulation. We think that its powers ought to be strengthened so that the Parliament discuss each proclamation. In fact, the Parcome Uament must discuss each proclamation. The problem with a proclamation at present is that it not need to be discussed. If somebody moves for the disallowance of a regulation, that brings the matter before the Parliament for discussion. We propose to add the 2 techniques used by the Parliament together. I think we produce better pariiamentary scrutiny of what is proposed by this amendment. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to.

182,Mr WENTWORTH,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I months have 2 small amendments designed to give land. cut-off dates. I move: In sub-clause (1), after 'Commissioner' insert December 1977'. In sub-clause (l)(b), after 'time', second appearing, insert'but before 30 June 1978'. It seems to me that in the absence of cut-off date, which should not be immediate but should give some time for Aboriginals to lodge claims, there may arise continual bitterness existing between the Aboriginal and European communities in the Northern Territory. I do not hasty think this would be to the advantage of either refer community. In this respect I am thinking particuHonour, larly of the advantage of the Aboriginal com161 ofhis Mr munity. I think it would help Aboriginals if there of the nature of areas were some kind of cut-off date to could work, because this would absolve them Territory, he said of vacant parts from continual bitterness and all sorts of finangling which otherwise might go on.",77
183,Mr CALDER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I fore support these amendments for the reasons stated by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). A backlash and so on might arise in the Northern Territory. This Bill is designed supposedly to help the traditional owners, the Aborigines in the Northern Territory. That is fair enough. But, if there is not sometimedecided upon after which claims cannot be made for required for Aboriginal community areas-whethe r they be inining areas, pastoral areas, or what ever-w e will not have development such as that carried out by the Gemco company on Groote Eylandt, at Gove, or at any other place, from which the Aborigines might derive considerable income. Therefore there will tend to be no development from which they can receive the considerable funds envisaged in this Bill tofinancethe councils and trusts, the benefit trust fund and so on. If we wish the Territory to be developed and the Aborigines to gain from that development, which is their right and of which we all are in favour, there should be some arrangement in this Bill which will give people investing risk capital in the Territory-most of the money invested in the Territory is risk capital-som e confidence that they will have security of their leases, whether they be pastoral, mining or whatever.",77
184,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Stirling-Minister for Aboriginal acquire secure occupancy of that Affairs) (10.24)-The Government cannot accept either of the proposed amendments. The first amendment deals with vacant Crown land and the second with alienated Crown land. That distinction needs to be borne in mind when considering the amendments. The first proposed amendment would give Aboriginals only 12 in which to lodge claims to vacant Crown There has been a freeze against the alienation of any vacant Crown land until 31 'before 31 December this year, pending the lodgement of any claims by Aboriginals to any part of that vacant Crown land. After 31 December this year there will be no alienation in respect of any land such a for which a claim has been made. It is difficult to see any reason to increase the claims, pressure on Aboriginals to lodge such since this is likely to induce them to make or even unwise claims to land which is waste and likely to remain so. In this respect I the Committee to what was said by His Justice Woodward, at paragraph report. After a lengthy consideration already held by Aborigiwhich they nals as reserves and other Crown of the Northern land: This is equally true of much of the remaining unaUenated Crown lands. Aboriginal people should think carefully belaying claim to any areas which are not going to be of value to mem-particularl y since they have unimpeded access to this country at present if they want to visit it traditional purposes. I am quite satisfied that, as the present claims or able pending claims are worked out, there will be no clash between other interests in the Northern point Territory and Aboriginals in ance of vacant Crown land. The second amendment would require the vent Land Commissioner to complete his inquiry under this which is authorised under the Bill and his report on claims to alienated land within 18 months. $1,000."". This seems quite impracticable, being too short a time, given the likely pressure on the Commissioner to report on claims to vacant land and land leased by Aboriginals, such as Wave Hill, Willowra, Kildurk and the Tanami Desert. It also seems undesirable, since it is a difficult task which might properly take several years to complete satisfactorily, depending on the interest of Aboriginals in lodging claims and the Commissioner's ability to compile an adequate register of land owning groups outside reserves. If the Commissioner is given the time to make his inquiry, based on evidence put before him, and with objectivity, I am quite sure that there will not be any pressure on existing interests holding alienated Crown land, or undue pressure on Aboriginals, and there will not be any clash between Aboriginals and others in the Northern Territory.

I am heartened by recent events. I do not know whether they provide a licence to say a few words on this amendment. It is an important one. The Opposition proposes to delete clause 69 and to insert a new clause in relation to sacred sites. The Northern Territory legislature has a very legislature disappointing record in regard to the protection of sacred sites. It has declared only 6 sites in years. It seems that there are good reasons why we should have regard for the recommendation of Mr Justice Woodward that this matter be the subject of Federal legislation. The Senate Select Committee on Aborigines and Torres Strait effectively Islanders recently reported on this matter recommended, in particular, that this matter remain the responsibUity of the Australian ParbUity. Uament and Government. As honourable members would know, that Committee is chaired by Government member, Senator Bonner. Its report was a unanimous one. It represented the views of matter. both sides of the Parliament. At least among these informed people there is an attitude is at variance with the one that the Government is incorporating in this legislation. The proposed new clause makes it an offence knowingly to damage or desecrate a site of sigthe nificance to Aboriginal tradition. Sub-clause lists defences against a prosecution under clause. Sub-clause (4) provides for the declarrebuted. ation by regulation of sites of significance. not intended that all sites of significance declared. In many cases Aborigines are unwUling with, to reveal the location of such sites. Existing proor tection for aU sites under the Native and Historiand the cal Objects Preservation Ordinance is inadequate of that because acquisition with compensation must occur before a site may be designated or protected in any way. The recent comment of the of that Majority Leader in the Legislative Assembly is important. He said that the Assembly would try to identify and specify sacred sites. Even taken with the assurances expressed by the Minister for under Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner), it is so general for that honourable members opposite will see why Aboriginals, in particular the elders, of almost every clan in the Territory have made represenmade, tations to have this matter legislated for and grant or refuse regulated by the Commonwealth. The Committee of the Whole will recollect what the Minister said in his second reading speech, the good intentions and assurances of the minboth the Minister for the Northern Territory (Mr Adermann) and the Majority Leader in the Legislative Assembly. It seems to me that it is a very poor way to do business, to be stacking all our hopes and aspirations in respect of these matters on good intent rather than on matters that are properly prescribed in legislation. The question of the preservation of sacred sites has been the subject of very great indifference and neglect on the part of the Northern Territory in the past. It is very difficult to generalise and to indict an entire legislature for what 18 has happened, but I think it is fair to say that if one has regard to the history of the legislative body in the Northern Territory in respect of this matter one would hardly regard it as a body that is inspired with and obsessed by the need to act on this matter. It is another matter for and which Mr Justice Woodward recommended the Australian Government should have responsiThere is no question that the Aboriginal 1 >eople would like that. The effect of my very a engthy amendment is to provide for the acceptance of Commonwealth responsibUity for this which Mr ADERMANN (Fisher-Minister for the Northern Territory) (10.35)-What I want to say relates not only to this amendment but also to subsequent amendments. The Opposition has been saying quite a lot by way of denigration of Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I (3) think the words that the honourable member for this Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) used should be He talked about the unenviable record It is of the legislature of the Northern Territory. be Already my colleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) has sought to put the record straight. It is in this text, and in the context of those words, that I pay tribute to the pioneering work on the subject of Aboriginal land rights which has been undertaken over the years by the Northern Territory legislature. Apparently members opposite do not know that many of the principles governing land rights were considered initially in the Northern Territory Legislative Council in the 1960s by people familiar with the needs and traditions of the Aboriginals, developed over many years of direct association with those people. I beheve that it was from those debates that the first recognition of landrightsfor the Aboriginal people emerged. In 1964 the Northern Territory Legislative Council appointed a committee on Aboriginal integration. In May 1965 the committee, tabling one of its reports, proposed the first to give effect to land tenure for Aboriginals on reserves. In August 1966 a Bill dealing with land titles for Aboriginals was introduced by a private member of that Council, but this initiative was overtaken by a further Bill sponsored by the Federal Government. This latter legislation came into effect in 1970. My colleague Mr Ralph Hunt, the then Minister for the Interior, was to approve a grant of over 70 leases to Aborigiordinance nals before the change of government in 1972. I thank sincerely the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) for his consultation with the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, his time and the co-operative discussion on a large number of occasions with the Assembly. The Assembly is most anxious to give full cofor operation to the Government. Indeed, it may well indicate the path for co-operation in legiscorner, lation which eventually will reach far beyond Northern Territory. I do not believe that sufficient recognition has been given by the position and critics of the responsible approach adopted by the Northern Territory legislature the question of landrights,especially in earlier years when the subject was less fashionable it is now. I remind the Parliament that the large schedule of land to be declared Aboriginal land under this Bill was set aside and protected over the years for the benefit of Aboriginals under the authority of the Northern Territory ordinances, not by legislation passed by this Parliament. The responsible approach adopted by the Northern Territory legislature in the past gives every reason for confidence that the complementary legislation entrusted to the Legislative Assembly by this Bill will be wholly in harmony con- objectives of the Government and will fully protect the interests of the Aboriginal people of the Territory. That is the sort of undertaking which I and the Assembly have given to the Minister. I do not take very kindly to the remarks of members of the Opposition about the attitude of the Assembly. I do not think it is worthy of them.",79
191,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"The Minister for the Northern Territory (Mr Adermann) can talk at great length, but the facts are that over the years the general membership of the Northern Territory legislature, particularly the poltiical philosophy of the membership of the present Legislative Assembly, has been the principal factor in holding back the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory. The Minister said that the in Assembly would co-operate with the Governsteps ment. That does not fill me with any glee. This legislation is designed to entrench the capacity of miners to mine on Aboriginal lands. It does not confer any absoluterightat all. It is there until it is required to be used for something else. That has been the case with all the legislation that has come through the Legislative Council, as it was previously known, and the Legislative Assembly able in the Northern Territory by proclamation, by or by any other means. I have sat here for 21 years now and watched the operationMr Sullivan-To o long.",81
192,Mr BR YANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"That isright,and I wiU be here a while yet. I might be here longer than some of the people barking over there in possum as Mr CalweU used to call it. The facts are the that every possible step that could be taken to stultify and frustrate the development of the Oprights of the Aboriginal people of Australia has emanated principally from the National Country to Party, and its principal spokesmen have been people Uke the Minister for the Northern Territhan tory (Mr Adermann) and the members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory, as it is now called. As I said before, this Bill is simply the continual entrenchment of vested rights, particularly in mining areas but also in pastoral areas, by the people of the Northern Territory. It is a step in the right direction but it is a very small step indeed. It does not matter what the Minister says in any form of sophistry that he happens to bring to this matter-h e cannot cloud the issue. The facts are that unless this Parliament takes the initiative, takes up its own duties and estabUshes Aboriginalrights,these rights with the wiU never be protected.",81
193,Mr CALDER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I feel that I should say something about the disgraceful remarks made by the honourable mementer ber for Wills (Mr Bryant). He has completely that land misrepresented the work that has been done by estate the Legislative Assembly on which at one time- '(2) not now, mind you-ther e were Labor members. by the Those Labor members were the ones who not enter wanted to throw open the Aboriginal land to holder everyone.",82
194,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,No.,82
195,Mr CALDER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"Yes, they did. They fought 3 sub-section elections on that proposal and they were dein feated everytime.Finally, they were utterly desidering feated and as a result there are now no Labor members on the Legislative Assembly. That is why the Labor Party is now so crooked on the cordance Legislative Assembly. It is just a case of sour the grapes. The members of the Legislative Assem- (2) bly have been working on Aboriginal land legisto leave lation for longer than the honourable member the Land has, and they know far more about it than do and many other people in this chamber who are comply interested in this subject.",82
196,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I thank my colleague the Min- (a) ister for the Northern Territory (Mr Adermann) for what he has said so as to clarify the position (b) ment of the legislation, particularly with respect to the assurances that have been given and the participation of this Government, through me as Minister, in the preparation of the complementary legislation. Might I refer the Opposition to the provisions of clause 73 (1) (a) which wiU require the Legislative Assembly ordinances to accord with certain stipulations that are directed towards protecting the interests of Aboriginals. iginal Might I also with respect to the amendment refer older by the members of the Opposition to sub-clause (6) and t point out to them what they are proposing to do with regard to sacred sites which they seek to '(7) protect. That sub-clause envisages the legal or(a) desecration of sacred sites in relation to a mining operation. Not only that, a proposal of this nature negates the whole intention of this section as it further envisages the sale of a sacred site to rnining interests. That is the proposal put for- (b) in thepermit; ward by members of the Opposition who are so intent on denigrating mining in the name of upholding Aboriginal interests. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 70 (Entry on Aboriginal land)",82
197,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I move: Omit the clause, substitute the following clause: ' 70. (1) Subject to this section, an Aboriginal is entitled to and remain upon Aborigmal land if his presence on would not interfere with the use or enjoyment of an or interest in the land held by a person, not being a Land Trust or an Aboriginal Council. Subject to this Act and except as otherwise provided regulations, a person other than an Aborigmal shall or remain on Aboriginal land unless he is the of a permit, in writing, issued to him by or on behalf of the Land Council for the area in which the land is situated. Penalty $1,000. '(3) Before the making of regulations for the purposes of (2), the Minister shall consult any Land Council the area of which is situated any Aboriginal land to which the regulations, if made, would apply and shall, when conthe making of the regulauons, take into account any views on the matter expressed by the Land Council. '(4) A person who is on Aboriginal land (whether in acwith a permit or not), other than a person who is on land in accordance with regulations under sub-section or in accordance with paragraph (S) (a) or is one of the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land, may be required that land by a person authorised on that behalf by Council for the area in which the land is situated, the person on whom such a requirement is made shall with the requirement within a reasonable time. Penalty: $1,000. '(5) Where a person, other than a Land Trust or an AborCouncil, has an estate or interest in Aboriginal landa person is entided to enter and remain on the land for any purpose that is necessaiy for the use or enjoyof that estate or interest by the owner; a permit shall not be issued to a person under subsection (2) with respect to the land if the presence of the person on the land would interfere with the use or enjoyment of that estate or interest by the owner; and (c) a permit issued under sub-section (2) with respect to the land shall be expressed to impose on the holder of the permit a condiuon that he will not interfere with the use or enjoyment of that estate or interest by the owner. '(6) The holder of a permit to enter and remain on Aborland shall comply with any condition referred to in aragraph (S)(c) or otherwise imposed on him as such issuing authority. Penalty: $1,000. In proceedings for an offence against sub-section (2) (4) it is a defence if the person charged provesin the case of an offence against sub-section (2)-that(i) his entry orremainingon the land was due to necessity; and (ii) it was not practicable to apply for the necessary or case of an offence against sub-section (4)-that hisremainingon the land was due to circumstances outside his control. '(8) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, the law of the Northern Territory relating to travelling stock on pastoral leases applies to and in relation to Aboriginal land used for pastoral purposes'. The amendment concerns permits to enter Aboriginal land. Something has been said about this matter. If moretimewere given to debate the amendment the Committee would be able to get the issue into much sharper perspective. In view of the time available to me I can only express concern that again the Woodward recommendations have been disregarded and that the Aboriginal people will be administered by a Darwin-based bureaucracy as against operating the permit system through their own councd structure. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Proposed new clause 70A.",82
198,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I move: After clause 70, insert the following new clause: '70A (1) Subject to this section, where Aboriginal land adjoins the territorial sea, or internal waters of the wealth, appertaining to the Northern Territoiy, that the territorial sea or internal waters so appertaining within 2 kilometres of the boundary of the Aboriginal shall, for the purposes of section 70, be deemed to be that Aboriginal land. '(2) This section has effect Commonwealth under international law, including gations under any agreement between the Commonwealth and another country or countries. '(3) Regulations made for the purposes of sub-secuon 70 (2) may make provision for the exemption from the provisions of that sub-section, in its appUcation by virtue of this section, of persons on board ships mcluded in a prescribed class of ships, either absolutely or subject to conditions. '(4)Where(a) a court convicts a person of an 70 in its appUcation (b) at the time of the offence, the person was on board a boat that was carrying fish, the court may order the forfeiture of that fish or ceeds of the sale of that fish. '(5) Any property ordered sub-secuon (4) becomes the property of the Commonwealth and shall be dealt with or disposed of in accordance directions of the Minister.'. This clause concerns Aboriginal control over entry on the area of sea immediately adjoining Aboriginal land. This is again another matter to be referred to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly for complementary legislation. It is another matter about which there were specific recommendations by Mr Justice Woodward. It was a matter which was the subject of more principled objectivity in the Labor legislation. There will be a great deal of disappointment the part of the Aboriginal people who will not have as an effectiverightover the use of the waters adjoining traditional Aboriginal land. Proposed new clause negatived. Clause 71. (2) Sub-section (1) does not cupation that would interfere with the use or enjoyment an estate or interest in the land held by a person not being a Land Trust or an Aboriginal Council or other incorporated association of Aboriginals.",83
199,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"I move: Omit sub-clause (2). This clause prohibits Aboriginal entry if it interferes with the use or enjoyment of an estate or interest. Very precise recommendations were made by His Honour Mr Justice Woodward in respect to permitting reasonable access to pastoral properties. The fact is that a person can get an interest or an estate which can be quite massive in size and say that Aboriginal people are not allowed entry. This provision can be used or invoked to deprive Aboriginal people of the use Commonof their land. It is a very serious matter. It is just part of another one of the more recent issues that have that is come before the Committee, which really cut the land whole basis of the Woodward recommendations part of down to a level where what remains is of infinisubject to the obUgations of the tesimal benefit to the Aboriginal people. I exobUpress great concern that the hour will not allow the Committee to go into this matter in greater depth. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clause 72 agreed to. Clause 73 (Reciprocal legislation of the offence against section Northern Territory) by virtue of this section; and",83
200,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I want to oppose clause 73. With proper respect for my of the procolleague the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) and his impassioned by a court to be forfeited under defence of the Northern Territory Legislative with the Assembly, let us transfer this to another medium. Clause 73 leaves certain responsibilities to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. That may very well be a sound procedure in some instances, but it is not in this instance. The Minister is responsible for a certain area of this legislation. The land councils and land trusts are also a part of the system. We have interposed the Legislative Assembly and we expect it to carry high out certain complementary operations. This seems to me to be a totally unnecessary complion cation of the system. Regardless of the composition of the Legislative Assembly and of its poltiical phUosophy, I think it is totaUy wrong for us to implement legislation here which puts this final computation into the Act. It will only bedevil the systemrightfrom the beginning. I think it is an unwarranted concession to whatever happens to be the sacred Staterightsthat prevail authorize an entry, use or ocsomewhere north of the boundary of the Northof ern Territory. I appeal to the Minister to take a good look at this clause and not to complicate the system. Australia is nearly ungovernable as it presendy stands. To put this piece of nonsense into the situation is totally unnecessary. In fact, we ought to send that advice to Britain.",83
201,Mr YATES,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I think a point has been raised here which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) will well understand when this Bill is debated in the other place. I hope the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs will ask the Minister for Social Security (Senator Guilfoyle), who will be in charge of the Bill, to look at this clause extremely carefully because it questions our rights in relation to what we have responsibility for when compared with State rights. When it comes to wildlife and certain other aspects I believe the Commonwealth should still hold that power. Clause agreed to. Clause 74 (AppUcation of laws of Northern Territory to Aboriginal land)",84
202,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I move: Omit the clause, substitute the following clause: '74. (1) Subject to sub-section (2), this Act does not affect the application to Aboriginal land of a law of the Northern Territory to the extent that concurrently with this Act. '(2) The regulations may provide for the exclusion or modification of a law of the Northern Territory in its application to Aboriginal land'. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses 75 to 78-by leave-take n together, and agreed to. Schedule 1.",84
203,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I move: After the description of land set out under the heading 'Santa Teresa', insert the following: All that piece of land in the Northern Territory of Australia containing an area of 37 S29 square kilometres more or less: Commencing at the intersection of the meridian of east longitude 130 degrees 28 minutes 53.96 seconds with the parallel of south lautude 21 degrees; thence west for a distance of 16 093 metres; thence north to the parallel of south latitude 19 degrees 51 minutes 16.69 seconds; thence east to a point north of the western corner of Pastoral Lease 594 (Willowra); thence south to the said western corner, thence southeasterly, southerly, westerly and again southerly by southwestern, western, northern and again western boundaries of the said Pastoral Lease to the southwestern corner of the said Pastoral Lease; thence southerly by the western boundary of Pastoral Lease 634 (Mount Barkly) to the southwestern comer of the said Pastoral Lease; thence westerly, northerly and again of northern, an eastern, again a northern and a western boundary of Pastoral Lease 590 (Mount Denison) to the most western southwestern corner of the said Pastoral Lease; thence westerly by part of the northern boundary of the Yuendumu Aboriginal Reserve as notified in Northern Territory Government Gazette No. 24 of 28 May 1952 to the north-western corner of the said Reserve; thence northerly, westerly, again northerly and again westerly by an eastern, a northern, across a stock route, again a northern, again an eastern and again a northern boundary of Pastoral Lease 802 (Mount Doreen) to the most northern north-western corner of the said Pastoral Lease; then northerly and westerly by part of the eastern boundary and the northern boundary of Pastoral Lease 764 (Chilla Well) to its intersection with the meridian of east longitude 130 degrees 28 minutes 53.96 seconds; thence north to the point of commencement.'. This amendment concerns Tanami and its description. The deletion of the area known as the Tanami region, the traditional land of the Walpiri people, based principaUy at Yuendumu and Hooker Creek is in complete contrast to the recommendations of Mr Justice Woodward. The Commissioner in his second report, stated: As for the . . . Tanami Desert, I am satisfied that there are sufficiently closetiesbetween Aborigines still living nearby and those lands to justify their immediate transfer to Aboriginal ownership . . . This clear statement was accepted by the previous Government The land owners of the Tanami Desert were included in the schedule to the 1975 Bill. This provision was in the Bill which that law is capable of operating was introduced in June of this year, but the Minister has since attributed that fact to a printer's error. I simply say that for reasons known only to the Minister it has been deleted from this Bill. We were told by the Minister in his second reading speech that the area was included as a mistake. No further explanation, other than that, was added. I think an explanation is due tonight. The insult to the Walpiri people is clear, and their concern is equally clear. In a letter to the Minister on the third of this month they rejected the Government's move and requested an alteration to the Schedule so that their land would be put back under the operation of this Bill. However, on 17 November the Minister rejected their 'TANAMI request. These people have been seeking to have this land transferred to their ownership for almost 41 years. The first appUcation was made in 1935 only 7 years after they suffered the last known Aboriginal massacre in Australian history when 31 members of their tribe were murdered in revenge kUlings. There is considerable documentation here which I would Uke to have dealt with. I imagine that this matter might be handled effectively in another place. Probably some of this material wiU be incorporated in the Hansard of that place. At this stage I prefer to convey to westerly and southerly by part the Minister the fact that the Opposition is very seriously concerned about this matter. I want him to have sufficient time to deal with it. Supporters of the Government may like to say sometbing about the matter; so I conclude my remarks and hope that there will be a satisfactory response.",84
204,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,The honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) said that no explanation was given for the deletion of the Tanami wildlife sanctuary from the Schedule to the Bill. I refer the honourable gentleman to page 2781 of Hansard where the position of the Government with respect to this area is fully explained. Amendment negatived. Schedule agreed to. Schedule 2.,85
205,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS, I move: Omit the schedule. Amendment negatived. Schedule agreed to. Title.,85
206,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I reiterate the remarks which I made earlier. The Tide is a total misnomer. It ought to be changed to Northern Territory Miners Right (Aboriginal Lands) Bill.

APPROPRIATION (URBAN PUBLIC TRANSPORT) BILL 1976 Bill returned from the Senate without amendment. House adjourned at 10.58 p.m. The following answers to questions Graduates from Service Establishments Mr Sullivan asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice: How many cadets from (a) the Royal MiUtary CoUege, manager Duntroon, (b) the Royal Australian Naval College, Jervis thus Bay and (c) the RAAF Academy, Point Cook, have difficulties graduated with recognised university degrees from those establishments in each of the years 1970 to 1975 inclusive. Mr Kilien-The answer to the honourable in its member's question is as follows: The following numbers of Australian cadets graduated of from the Service colleges with recognised university in the years 1970 to 1975 inclusive: Year College 1970 1971 27 1972 40 1973 44 1974 52 1975 62 The first year in which recognised awarded to cadets at the Royal MiUtary CoUege and the Royal Australian Naval College was 1971. In addition, the following numbers of cadets from other countries have received recognised university degrees at Royal Military College: 1971 2 New Zealand 1972 4 New Zealand 1973 6 New Zealand, 1 ThaUand 1974 2 New Zealand 1975 3 New Zealand, 1 Singapore Australian Industry Development Corporation June",85
207,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"On Wednesday, 20 the Scheme October, the honourable member for Blaxland 1975 that: (Mr Keating), asked me whether the Government would look at the role of the Australian Industry Development Corporation in respect of both its appointment of a receiver to the Poseidon Company and its approach to the international market for a loan raising in Australian dollars. I am advised by the Australian Industry Development Corporation that: 'The AIDC acted at the request of the Board of Directors of Poseidon Ltd in appointing a receiver to the company to stabilise the situation and enable negotiations concerning the future role of Poseidon in the Windarra Nickel joint venture to be setded. NA upon notice were circulated: The AIDC's loan to Poseidon is an important investment (Question Na 1600) in the Corporation'sfinancingof Australian Development, though by no means its largest. The AIDC's investment is secured by afirstcharge over Poseidon's share of a valuable resource, being developed in association with Western Mining Corporation as operational of the venture. The AIDC'sfinancialposition is not materially affected by the immediate financial of the Posiedon company. It follows that any imputation that the AIDC acted improperly in not referring to Poseidon'sfinancialdifficulties loan documentation is without foundation. It is not the function of the AIDC to make public comment on the affairs a client company whose situation does not affect the finandegrees cial position of the Corporation itself. The AIDC did not advance $250,000 a week to Poseidon. In fact, from January 1976 until after the loan had closed, Royal the AIDC had only advanced a single amount of $ 117,000 of Royal Australian bridgingfinancewhich was subsequently repaid. Now that Military Naval RAAF ing the company is in receivership, the AIDC is of course providthe Receiver Manager with funds as necessaiy to mainCoUege Academy tain contributions to the Windarra development while Poseidon's future is being determined.' 9 2 20 Regional Employment Development Scheme 7 18 11 18 (Question No. 990) 6 14 Mr CLYDE CAMERON asked the Minister for 5 20 Employment and Industrial Relations, upon university degrees were notice: (1) What was the date on which it was decided to discontinue the RED Scheme. (2) Was the decision taken at Cabinet level; if not, why not. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The previous Government, in the context of its 1975-76 Budget deUberations, decided to provide $I35m for the Regional Empolyment Development Scheme in that year. This necessitated a review of all projects approved after 30 1975 and of those approved before that date on which and Poseidon work had not begun. As a result of that review the Ministerial Committee, to whom responsibUity for oversighting had been delegated, decided on 10 September (i) the $135m provided in the Budget for the Scheme in 1975-76 should enable all projects already commenced, i.e. on which unemployed workers had been engaged, to be continued within their approved financial allocation under the Scheme; (ii) the projects which had not already commenced should proceed now only in the small number of areas experiencing most severe unemployment. In general this would mean a local unemployment rate of twice the national rate; (in) all other projects previously approved should not be funded, but that claims for any legitimate expenditure of moneys already incurred in relation to these projects would be considered sympathetically and speedUy; (iv) no new requests for assistance under the Scheme would be accepted; and (v) no further cost escalation would be funded on projects other than in the most exceptional circumstances. Shortly after it assumed office, the present Government, in its review of expenditure for 1975-76, decided that the Budget allocation of $ 135m should not be exceeded and that decisions taken by the former Ministers should continue to be applied. Legal Aid: Trade Practices Act Mr Lionel Bowen asked the Attorney General, upon notice: (1) Has he authorised any officer of the Australian Public Service under section 170(2) of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to authorise the grant relation to the proceedings referred to in section 170 (1) of that Act. (2) To what applicants and in what proceedings has legal or financial assistance been (a) granted and (b) refused under section 170 (2) (i) prior to 11 November 1975 and (ii) subsequent thereto. Mr Ellicott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2) I do not think it appropriate to make public informadon about particular applicants for legal aid who are entitled to expect that information supplied would be kept confidential. I would, however, be prepared to make it available to the member, if he wishes, on a confidential basis.

208,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: to institute an action against (1) to (3) The information requested by the honourable member is not available from Departmental sources. However, my colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, and myself have arranged an examination of, inter alia, the question of consumer representation. I would expect that, in the course of this examination, as much relevant information as possible will be sought, and if the information sought by the honourable member becomes available, I will be only too happy to provide it for him. Dual Citizenship for Children of Visitors Mr Hodges asked the Minister for Immigrafore tion and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice. (1) Are alien expectant mothers coming to Australia on visitors' visas for confinements in order to gain dual citizensideration ship for their chilren. (2) If so, how many chUdren have gained dual Australian citizenship in this manner during each year since 1970 and with what other countries is this dual citizenship shared. (3) How many persons who have received dual citizenship in this manner have returned in Australia since 19S0. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honour the(1)voluntary able member's question is as follows: (1) There is no record of expectant visitors' visas in order that their confinements should take place in Australia and there is no provision within visitor icy for appUcations to be approved if they were purpose. ChUdren have, however, been born in Australia to women-bot h British and aUen-wh o were granted visitor entry for other purposes. (2) and (3) No statistics have been maintained.

(3) The history of previous suppliers is maintained on an individual item basis and it would be impossible to obtain the information you have requested without a very large manpower effort on the part of aU three Services. I am not to authorise that effort, particularly as our purchasing poUcy is geared to arranging contracts outside Australia without opportunity for Australian industry to tender only when items are not expected to be avaUable from Australian to meet Service requirements.

Taxation on Children's Income (Question No. 1408) Mr Hurford asked the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Is it a fact that, with the aboUtion of dependant tax(Question No. 1398) ation claims, chUdren can now earn over $2,500 without increasing their parents' or guardians' net income tax, and many families have transferred investments and investment income into discretionary trusts so that their children Point can earn the income from these investments. (2) How many high income families will receive a double benefit from this generous provision in the Government's Garden Point Counfamily allowances program. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable his personal asmember's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Income derived by a chUd, whether directly or through a trust, may be taxed to the child, or, in the case of trust income to which a minor child is presently entitled, to trustee, and does not directly affect the tax payable by the parents or guardians. Because of the general concesrebate for resident individuals, no tax was payable for the 1975-76 income year by a child whose taxable income to was less than $2,519 or by a trustee where the income to which a minor child was presently entitled was less than $2,519. With indexation, the corresponding tax threshhold for the 1976-77 income year is $2,846. Prior to the 1976-77 income year the concessional deduction or rebate to which a parent ance of a child was reduced on a sliding scale, and the tax payable by the parent thus increased, where the separate net income of the child exceeded in 197S-76 and the $200 rebate for a student, for example, was eliminated entirely when the student's separate income reached $950. As from I July 1976 the replacement of rebates for dependent children by increased family allowances mission means that a child's separate way of reduction in concessional rebates, the amount of tax payable by the parent or guardian. I understand, that in determining eligibility ance in respect of a student child aged between 18 and 25 years, the amount of income of the student is taken into account in deciding whether the student is dependent on claimant. Information to answer the other questions asked by the honourable member is not available. Mr Hurford asked the Treasurer, upon notice: employment-creating (1) In view of the deficit on thefirst3 month's financial transactions by the Government of $2,276m compared with the budgeted deficit of $2,608m, what is the level deficit now expected for 1976-77. (2) If there is any change in the expected deficit, what tors are influencing this revision. Mr Lynch-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The honourable member should be aware that it is not possible to reachfirmconclusions the year as a whole on the basis offiguresfor thefirstfew months only. At the very least it is important movements in outlays and receipts and to take account of any special factors bearing upon those movements. Figures are now available for the first four months of 1976-77 and show a deficit of $2,859m, compared with the budgeted estimate for the year of $2,608m. However, an examination of thefiguresshows that outlays in the four months to October were 10.6 responding months a year earner, this rate of increase is ginally below the Budget estimate of an increase of 11.3 cent for the year as a whole. Movements in oudays throughwas out the year are affected by the other 'lumpy' transactions, but movements to date are broadly in line with the Budget estimate. It is the slow rate of growth of receipts-relativ e to the Budget estimate-whic h is responsible for the large deficit date; total receipts in the four months to October were 11.0 per cent higher than in the corresponding months a year earlier, which compares with the Budget estimate of an increase of 18.8 per cent for the year as a whole. The relaminated tively low increase in the most recent period, however, largely a reflection of the fact that there was no quarterly lection of company tax in thefirstfour months of this year. Because of the marked seasonal pattern in collections tax from companies and non-PAYE individuals, further sizeofthe able monthly deficits can be expected swing into surplus next March or April. (2) The Budget estimates are subject to many assumptions and influences and it is inevitable that a number of revisions - in both directions-will be called for as the year progresses. At thistime,however, there is no reason to believe tnat the outcome for the deficit will be substantially different from the Budget estimate of $2,608m.

Expected Deficit As to quantifying the employment effects of the invest(Question No. 1410) ment allowance, the honourable member would know that it is not possible to differentiate in practice between the effects of each of the many influences affecting employment in a dynamic economy. It is clear from the foregoing, however, that the allowance has both an of the initial and a continuing impact on employment.

218,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's questions are as follows: to (1) The primary purpose of the Fund is to meet any losses incurred as a result of mamtaining the reserve price operations at wool auctions since the floor price policy was introduced in the 1974-75 season. Until the scheme is terit is provided that any money standing to the credit was of the Fund may be used by the Australian Wool Corporcolation for the purchase of wool in the performance of its functions or in the payment of advances to growers, the marketof ing of whose wool has been delayed by reason of the exercise powers and functions of the Corporation, or it may be before the accounts invested. (2) The Fund isfinancedby a tax of 5 per cent on the gross sales value of shorn wool sold. In addiuon, there is payable into the Fund any income derived from the investment of money standing to the credit of the Fund; interest received on advances to growers; interest on moneys standing to the credit of the Fund and used by the Corporation for the purchase of wool. (3) Yes. The Australian mation from the Commissioner of Taxation and arrangements have been made by the Corporation with the National Council of Wool-Selling Brokers of Australia for each broker Aircraft type to maintain a full record of Private buyers of wool and other dealers provide the Corporation with monthly lists of their transactions containing an identification of names and addresses of growers with'whom Fixed wing aircraft they deal in wool. These records will be maintained until a decision is taken on the disposal of any final balance remainMilitary aircraft ing to the credit of the Fund. (4) The balance of the Market Support Fund at 31 October 1976 was approximately $36.5m. A hypothetical operations assessment of the possible state of the Fund, if the Corporboth ation was able to sell the entire stockpile of wool it had chased under the stockpile arrangement, at current market prices, requires a range of further assumptions to be made. The question therefore requests an answer to a set of hypoas thetical circumstances. If the Corporation were to sell total inventory before the end of 1976 at current prices, the credit balance in the Fund would be possibly of the order $90m. Assuming, in addition, the continuation of the existing wool tax until June 1977, the revenue from the wool taxplus interest earned on money standing to the credit of the Fund could produce a hypothetical balance of some $135m June 1976. Aircraft Movements at Brisbane Airport Mr Jull asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) How many aircraft movements, by aircraft type, were there at Brisbane Airport during each of the years 1974-75 and 1975-76?

(4) Are purchase procedures sufficientlyflexibleto allow foreign aid teams to purchase in the recipient countiy rather than Australia when it is obvious that the initial purchase and/or the provision of replacement parts is more efficiently obtained in that countiy.  member's question is as follows: (1) When a request is received for a replacement for new or additional machinery for an Australian aid project overseas which is managed directly by the Development Assistance Agency (ADAA), the request is processed and the item procured and dispatched by the Agency. In cases where another Government Department instrumentality is acting on behalf of ADAA in the management of an aid project then that Department or instrumentaUty is empowered by ADAA to procure and required item(s). (2) Yes, from time to time there is criticism of delays in the of requests. Delays have most commonly been the offering stock which meet result of: (a) inadequate specifications on the part of the recipient government agency or project authority; (b) the inabUity of Australian manufacturers or suppUers to meet contracted deUveiy times; board which selects the most ap(c) the infrequency of sailings of vessels from Australia to certain overseas ports; (d) the time-consuming customs clearance procedures of somerecipientcountries. (3) As with other Australian Government purchasing ADAA's purchasing procedures must meet the requirements of the Audit Act and Treasury Regulations and Directions. Delays in providingreplacementparts are more often due to thereasonsgiven in (2) above. (4) The Australian aid program is essentiaUy a grant proto gram under which Australian-produced equipment is northe mally made avaUable to developing countries at no cost to them. Such gifts include spare parts where necessary. Minor for items of equipment may be purchased by aid teams within therecipientcountry. In special circumstances major equipmay be purchased from non-Australian sources includto selected State ing those in recipient countries.

Virology Construction of New Barrier on German Mr Abel asked the Minister for Foreign became Affairs, upon nodce: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a report on page 6 of the Age of 5 October 1976, headlined 'Reds Plan a Wall to Seal Germany', which detailed moves by the East German Government to extend and reinforce that country. (2) Can he say if the East German Government is acting in this way; if so, to what extent. (3) Over what percentage, and for how many kilometres, of its borders does East Germany maintain its 'wall'. (4) Between East Germany and what other countries does this'wall'stand. (5) How many persons are known to have lost their lives Government at the borders in attempting to (a) leave and (b) enter East that Germany since World war II. (6) What is the official explanation given by the East man Government for the maintenance and expansion of 'wall' which consists of a wire controlled mines, an anti-vehicular trap, a soft-earth strip and special motor cycle tracks. (7) What is the real reason for' the wall'.  member's questions are as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Articles in the Western Press have reported the conits struction of a new barrier on the Democratic Republic (GDR) and the Federal RepubUc of Germany (FRG). This construction is said to be the fourth barrier to be raised along the understood that work on this barrier began in April 1976 and is now about two-thirds completed. (3) The new barrier extends over approximately of the GDR's total borders which is about 60 per cent of the total GDR frontier with other countries. (4) The barrier currently being erected stands on the border between the GDR and the FRG. There is also a barrier separating West Berlin from the territory of the GDR. (5) Figures on the number of people who have left the GDR illegally since 1945 vary from source to source. source claims that over 3 million GDR citizens country illegally since 1949, and that 173 people have lost their lives attempting to leave the GDR for West Germany or West Berlin smce the construction of the Berlin WaU in 1961. Other sources put the figure of deaths at between 200 and 500 people. No cases are known of people losing their lives attempting to enter the GDR illegally, although many arrests of'Ulegal immigrants' have been made by the GDR authorities. A recent case involved the arrest of a West Number Berliner who ran across the border waving a blackflagin approved protest at the action of GDR border guards m shooting down for 1977 a would be defector at the Berlin Wall. 2 the(6) The oflicial GDR explanation for the barrier between GDR and the FRG is that it is a normal border installa1 tion on the border between sovereign States, and that the 1 controls exercised at the border are normal controls exer6 cised by any sovereign State on its frontiers. The GDR 4 claims that the barriers have been erected to protect its terri1 torial integrity and to prevent incursion into the GDR by 6 'miUtaristic and revanchist elements' from the West and to 5 prevent the luring of GDR citizens to the West with 'propaganda ' and' false promises'. (7) The barriers between the GDR and the FRG were esBorders tablished after the Ulegal departure of almost 2.5 million (Question No. 1547) people from the GDR for the FRG. After the border with the FRG had been effectively sealed, the main departure point West Berlin and m August 1961 construction began on a wall to seal off West Berlin from the territoiy of the GDR. This reduced theflowof Ulegal departures substantially. As the total population has declined since the creation of the GDR, the authorities there obviously feel it necessaiy to maintain an effective control over emigration from the 'the wall' surrounding countiy. Asian Development Fund (Question No. 1586) Mr Hurford asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: In relation to the Asian Development Fund, did the decide in August 1976 to untie the outstanding balance of our multi-purpose special funds contribution so it could be transferred to the Asian Development Fund, or had the Government already stated its intentions by GerMarch 1976 when the Asian Development Bank published its its Annual Report which indicated that this was so. mesh fence, trip wires, remote  member's question is as follows: This matter was first considered by the Government in 1976 when it decided to accept the commitment impUed in a statement by the then Treasurer of the previous Government in an address to the Bank's Board of Governors in April 1975. The reference in the Asian Development Bank's Annual Report 1975 to Australia's decision to untie contribution was based on the statement by the previous border between the German Treasurer.

(2) The intended purport of'extra transport costs' is not precisely clear. Fromtimeto time when needs arise that cannot be met by official vehicles, missions hire cars. It is not possible, however, to identify expenditure for this purpose.

Of these five are in the three in the Northern Territory. The 101 other centres or proposed other centres in the States for which capital and/or recurrent grants have been approved are located in local government areas of a higher socio-economic category than those specified in the above recurrent table. In this regard, three points are made: the socio-economic category rating is a broad scheme that does not specifically identify pockets of need in New South Wales otherwise relatively affluent areas; the placement of child care centres needs to take into Queensland account such factors as convenience to clients who may not necessarily live in South Australia the immediate area of the centre; a number of centres being assisted under the Child Care Tasmania Act existed before that legislation was enacted.

This amends the previous estimate of $292m. (3) The following objectives were agreed to by the Tourist Ministers' Council: (a) The development of a viable and efficient tourist industry in Australia. An economic concept that includes Governments' overall objectives and optimises the use of available resources. It envisages a dynamic tourist industry component of the total economy, containing a balanced mix of enterprises, supported by Government provided infrastructure, responding sensitively to growth and changes in demand. (b) The development of a range and quaUty of tourism opportunities appropriate to the needs of residents of and visitors to Australia.

This is a pubUc interest concept providing for the control and regulation of tourist activity, so that the rights of individuals and groups are safeguarded, one against the other, and resources are preserved, as considered desirable, for the common good and for future generations.

The promotion of tourism within Australia is primarily a matter for the States and Territories. The 1976-77 Budget also made provision for a sum of $833,000 to meet outstanding commitments under the grants scheme for the development of tourist attractions. Education: Tertiary Allowances Scheme Mr Garrick asked the Minister representing the Minister for Education, upon notice: (1) WUl 8000 students befinancuulyworse off under the Government's new proposals on tertiary allowances, and will others now receiving aUowances become ineUgible. (2) Will all students be discouraged from working during vacations because they are allowed to earn only $1,500 per annum, whereas previously, under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, they could earn that amount during the year and an unUmited sum during vacation. (3) Are bonded trainee teachers in Victoria and South Australia now ineUgible for assistance because they receive $600 per annum from their respective State Governments. (4) Has the Government claimed that aUowances have increased by up to $ 10; if so, is it a fact that the vast majority will still receive less than recommended by a Government inquiry over 12 months ago.",106
234,Mr VINER,LGA LGA LGA LGA LGA LGA LGA LGA LGA,"The Minister for Education has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The majority of students who will under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme in 1977 will be better off financially compared with the situation in 1976. AUowances have been increased substantiaUy, by up to per cent in the case of students who are independent of parental support; the Umit of family income at which the maximum allowance is payable has been increased and requirements relating to the student's program have been eased where a student is unable to undertake a full study load because ofcourse requirements or arising out of a direction by the student's institution. These changes will have the effect of enabling a number of students who did not qualify for benefits in 1976 to receive assistance in 1977. the whole existing at levels However, students who receive assistance from other Commonwealth awards wiU no longer be eUgible for Tertiary Education Assistance. Other students who receive substantial amounts from employment or from other, non-Commonwealth awards wiU have their aUowances reduced. The number who wiU be affected in 1977 is not known. (2) The WUUams Committee, which in 1975 reviewed the scheme, recommended that a student's own income should be means tested over the calendar year, since the allowance is intended to contribute to the support of the student for the calendar year, and not only the academic year. The Government has accepted this recommendation. Students who in 1977 will earn more than $ 1500, however, will not automatically lose their aUowance. For every $2 earned in excess of $1500 a student's aUowance will be reduced by $1. Previously the reduction for dependent students was $1 for $1 and that for independent students was $ 1 for every $1.50. The Government is mindful that not aU students who work during the long vacation also work part-time during the year. In these cases income earned may not exceed $1500 and the issue would not arise. (3) There are two aspects to this question. In the first place, bonded teacher trainees have always been ineUgible. Some states have moved recently to provide unbonded teacher training scholarships. Students are currently able to receive up to $600 from unbonded scholarships without affecting their aUowances. In arriving at its decision to reduce this amount to $150 from 1977, the Government accepted the recommendation of the WUUams Committee on this mat(Question No. 1395) ter. The Committee felt that an amount as high as $600 ran contrary to the purpose of the means test designed to measure the level of support required by needy students. (4) The maximum aUowance of $43 per week payable to independent students in 1977 wiU represent an increase of more than $12 per week over the 1976figure.Increases for dependent students are $7 per week for those Uving away from home and $5 per week for those Uving at home. In 1976,27 per cent of all TEAS beneficiaries were receiving maximum independent rates. An additional 48 per cent were receiving the maximum amount appUcable to the two categories of dependent students. It must be assumed that the remainder received some support from either their own resources or their famUies. No significant change in these proportions can be predicted. Dairy Herd Improvement Scheme $42 per week which is the figure (Question No. 1442) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: (1) Is there a possibiUty of a breakdown in the dairy herd improvement schemes of the various States due to the inabiUty of dairy farmers to pay for herd test and artificial receive allowances breeding services.
