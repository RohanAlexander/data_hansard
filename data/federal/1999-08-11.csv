That is rather leading lights in the government in terms legislation, which has been in place in England and why, at one minute to midnight with the debug systems that may have a Y2K problem, at a normal price-whatever that might be-after 2004 before this is operable in that context. I suppose it is appropriate for the government that is about par for the course. But to be putting laughable; it really does demean and diminish here. I wish the government would get off these real concerns. The issues that this bill, the 1999, is dealing with are long standing, and this this area of intellectual property rights, and be a moving feast for decades and decades adjustments. It is not a fixed scene; it is have to move with it. This move is very late in the process, companies. I suggest that the government have they will find that we will be supportive of is not picked up here but which should be-it amendments through the parliament, the fact the decompiler is itself a computer program, fact restrict an Australian user from using a the government may seek to achieve here could like, imposed by the supplier.

He really has unfortunate because he is seen as one of the of this issue. That perhaps may well explain why since 1993, is finally being addressed here Y2K bug, we are bringing in amendments to help but only after the supplier makes it available due process. So I reckon it will be about to be solving the Y2K bug in about 2004this forward as a Y2K issue at this time is the importance of what is actually happening trendy, fashionable issues and understand the Copyright Amendment (Computer Programs) Bill is only part of it. With the shades of grey in of power and control in computer software, it will to come which will need almost annual moving out there continually and, as it moves, we which has been a major disadvantage for our to recognise that and to be monitoring it, and constant adaptation. I will give an example that is the logical place for it. Having got these is that the supplier of the decompiler, because exercises property rights as well and could in decompiler to decompile certain products. So what well be thwarted by non-tariff barriers, if you same situation as we always are in this country, and their own international corporate powers as how, in order to overcome a trade barrier or to the fact that the decompiler is self-owned by restrict how it is used. That is not picked up NA 8488 It should be recognised that the legislation software to have access to the full software, not is not picked up at all either: when you buy we bought the FIll s-we bought the aircraft to get the software in the FIll s. It is a operating program and the supplier says, 'By code. You can't have that, because that is From their point of view, they separate the do not say it on their material, but what As far as I am concerned, if you buy artificial differentiation between source and amendments will go some way towards moving is because if we can remove the capacity for the for them to supply the whole lot, rather than in many cases, the supplier of the program What they can lose on the one hand with on the other by restricting the use of the decompiler So what these amendments should also do is to restrict those decompiler uses in opposition amendments. The trouble we have with this whole area is in mystique terms. We have this enormous technology and terminology into everyday language It comes back to the computer literacy of lawyers The real complication is that a country developers, such a capacity to do important being held back by our market size and the something minor. These companies play it very in Australia can tell you. I will give you one very simple example. in Australia for consumers via Harvey Norman it. However, a software developer, using that version until November 1995, three months developers, particularly the Americans, had access to the final version of it in about June of that months earlier. Therefore, if you were an Australian developer you had a six-month handicap put on you by the that was quite deliberate and quite focused. behave yourself or else you just get excluded these people is enormous. If you are a small rock the boat. That is one of the reasons prepared to try to use it because of the fear are many other weapons available in their repertoire. MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 11 August 1999 should allow the buyer or the purchaser of some just part of it. That is another issue that really a product, what do you buy? It is a bit like when but not the software, and it took us 30 years bit similar here. You buy the object code as an the way, fellas, we don't give you the source ours, even though you've paid for the program.' program definition into object and source. They they actually sell you is the object code. a computer program you buy the whole lot. The object should not be allowed. These legislation that margin as to what a computer program suppliers to differentiate, then it will be easier have that artificial barrier. But the fact is that, here will also be the supplier of the decompiler. these amendments they may well be able to gain to certain products or in certain ways. to nullify the power of the decompiler suppliers or in contradiction to the objectives in these the fact that we are talking in jargon. We talk confusion and difficulty in absorbing computer and into the legal system of the country. and so on, but that eventually will pass. that has such innovative computer software and worthwhile things in a field, is constantly oppressiveness of the suppliers. This is not tough and very nasty, as any small developer Windows 95 became available in August 1995 and the various other chains that were selling particular software, could not buy an Australian after consumers could buy it. The overseas to Beta versions of it the previous year and year. In other words, they had access to it six trying to use that as part of your product supplier. That was not accidental, in my view; It was also a bit of a lesson. You play ball and from the system. The power that is wielded by company trying to use their products, you do not why this stuff may not work; people may not be that they will be punished in other ways. There NA Wednesday, 11 August 1999 My concern is that if we find one thing, years big and critical. We see it as all-engulfing bigger picture. Unless we target the much amendments and our second reading speeches spectrum to signal the intent and the spirit of people at all. They will simply move the we simply force the suppliers to move those parameters. Part of the difficulty is that we display ignorance as an example a second reading speech on piracy. an expert on computers, but I expect the people piracy is not relevant to this issue is software development point of view is not use laws against-the more difficult form is that you can claim it to be different. The simplest way of doing that is to decompile, Effectively, that has exactly the same result Therefore, it is simply a coincidence. Why the it does in fact give a capacity for piracy For ministers to say in second reading speeches not at one with reality. The software industry do not know what they are talking about. Therefore, that we display which is much more dangerous This whole field is one that will give all a moving feast. It is difficult, but in the interest our game and get much more with it, much more much more significant. The compounding effects of delays in this years of impact downstream because the compounding government is moving on it. It is important that in concert on this, but I would much rather behind. Our software developers are innovators. we as legislators are so far behind. If we could currency that our software people are displaying, is important we do not hinder them but the fact At the moment, we are seen to be so far in so many ways. That simple little bit about clause. Do you remember the old offset conditions to source X per cent in Australia, subject to what! They could never find a competitive price, that were supposed to be because the suppliers legislation has been referred to earlier. It might to the government officials, but the fact establish just what they are. Eventually by the world has shifted and it is no longer relevant. MAIN COMMITTEE 8489 later we will focus on that and it will become when in reality it is just a small part of a much wider range and unless our language and our and the rest of it spread across the whole the legislation, then in fact we will not help our goalposts somewhere else. We do not move them, as well, and that is even worse. I will give I do not expect the Attorney-General to be who work for him to be expert. To say that wrong. The most common form of piracy from the simply copying stuff-that is easy to detect and the form of re-coding with slight variations so modify the source code, re-compile and sell. but you can point to a different set of source code. suppliers do not want this to happen is because but in a much more sophisticated form. that this will not affect piracy is basically will understand that and say that these people they will keep pushing. It is the ignorance for us than the fact that we are behind. of us in both Houses great difficulty because it is of our country it is vital that we actually lift in tune with it, because the implications are field are enormous. Delays by months will mean effects are just so great. It is good the we support it and that we are seen to be acting that we were leading, not simply following years They are way out in front in so many areas; display the same level of innovation and of we would actually help them a lot more. It is the opportunity is there for us to help them. behind-slightly off cue and slightly not with it reasonable price and so on smacks of the let-out where an overseas supplier was required competitive pricing and suitable quality? Guess so billions of dollars were never spent here had a let-out clause. The let-out clause in this seem like a minor point to the legislators and is those points can be argued over for years to the time you do that, the product has moved on, NA 8490 I think by not understanding that well signal to the people we are trying to give trying to say to the suppliers overseas, differently from America or Europe. We have We have let in these little clauses that make sesame to keep on pushing and shoving and small to fight them. They need us to be really but to have the understanding and the spirit going to find those companies Mr Chairman, this legislation is important, I do not know if many people will actually honest, but the fact is that the potential is there of the software industry because often we talking about the direct product; we are talking years time. If we can change the way that people source code to Australian developers, we may We may get our companies much more up-front are much more in tune with international picture because, I suspect, that is where this actually helping somebody to decompile a particular happen, but will not be as important, I suspect, of new material and evolving material. I think to be part of the main game, not having to wait in America and Europe have had for a long time.

Quingping, Ms Zhu: Deportation (Question No. 731) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 10 June 1999: Has his attention been drawn to recent allegations in Senate Estimates hearings concerning the deportation of Ms Zhu Quingping to China; if so, is he able to say (a) what aircraft was used to transport Ms Quingping to China (b) if the aircraft was civilian, which airline operated it and (c) was there a medical team on board the aircraft. Mr Ruddock-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: It would not be appropriate for me to respond to these matters. The terms of reference for the independent inquiry being undertaken by Mr Tony Ayers AC, include the requirement that Mr Ayers "" . .. examine, assess, and make findings and recommendations as appropriate, on all processes and procedures of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA) relating to (the woman's) case;"". In addition, in May the Senate passed a motion requiring the Legal and Constitutional References Committee to inquire and report into Australia's refugee and humanitarian program by 18 October 1999. The terms of reference for that inquiry also include an examination of the woman's circumstances. I do not wish to pre-empt the findings of either inquiry. However, I should like now to respond further to the honourable member's question on notice No. 718 of 8 June 1999 (Hansard, 30 June 1999, page 6219) that, among other things, queried whether the woman had been sedated at or about the time she was removed from Australia. On 24 June 1999 I released Mr Ayers's preliminary report on the sedation issue, from which I will now quote: ""I have come to the conclusion that there is no substance to the allegation that a woman in an advanced state of pregnancy was sedated before she embarked on the aircraft at Port Hedland to return to China. If any further information should come to light on this aspect of my inquiry, I will include it in my final report."" Positive Discrimination Programs (Question No. 733) Mr Latham asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 21 June 1999: Further to the answer to question No. 21 (Hansard, 8 February 1999, page 2125) in which he referred to positive discrimination measures within the internal management practices of his Department, for those measures which are available to and impact on the general public; (a) what measures has the Department implemented which could be categorised as positive discrimination, that is, providing preference to certain citizens on the basis of their gender, sexuality, age, race, place of birth or some other personal characteristic, and (b) what are the details and funding commitments in each case. Mr Anderson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Schedule 1 of the Deed of Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Northern Territory for the Indigenous Health Infrastructure Program sets out the Program Responsibilities for the Northern Territory. Schedule 1 (t) states: ''Where ever possible, that contracts for health-related infrastructure projects including road upgrading projects will be undertaken by Aboriginal community organisations"". This clause may be construed as positive discrimination and is consistent with the objectives of the Program which are as follows: To achieve enhanced access for Aboriginal people through the provision of health-related infrastructure including the upgrading of strategic roads on Aboriginal land to an agreed standard; To develop modes of service delivery which provide for appropriate involvement and participation of Aboriginal people and coordination with other funding programs for strategic roads and health infrastructure on Aboriginal land; and To enhance living standards and good health outcomes for indigenous Australians. (b) The funding commitment was for $10 million for the 1998/99 financial year.
