2,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",11
3,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Do you claim to have been misrepresented?,11
4,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,11
5,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,11
6,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"On 29 November Senator Crichton-Browne stated in the Senate in relation to me: Perhaps he should have applied for New South Wales police where he would have fitted in well. Whatever Senator Crichton-Browne meant by this is unclear. However, if in any way he was attempting to impugn my reputation as a former police officer, he ought to be mindful two things? that one of my referees during the recent preselection to the seat of Moore was the current Deputy Commissioner of the WA Police. He actually did agree to be a referee in my case, which is in stark contrast to declaration Senator Crichton-Browne where his so-called referees made public statements that they not been asked to be his referees and if asked would have refused. I might point out that Deputy Commissioner was appointed by Court government cabinet. Senator Crichton-Browne went on to say relation to me 'he scrutineered the results one of his own branches' as if there were something wrong with that. The election for branch officers and delegates for the didJoondalup branch. I was appointed by the meeting along with Paul Stevenage, a preselWestern ection rival. The chairman of the meeting was none other than David Honey, the state president and former ally of Senator Crichtonshow Browne. Senator Crichton-Browne's accusation that somehow being a scrutineer",11
7,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I do take the nod and the wink I am getting from some in this place this morning that perhaps we are getting into debate on an issue. If you show where you have been misrepresented, that is fine. There is an adjournment this afternoon. Would you like to kick on then?",11
8,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Can I have a guarantee, again? In the second part of the paragraph he stated: He was provided with the results by the retuming officer and asked to pass them on to the divisional secretary. But in the process, he had them typed up in his own office and changed the result to one which materially benefited him and benefited his prospects of preselection. That is untrue, as he well knows, and has been established by his former party's own state executive. Ironically, the matter revolved around a complaint that three people who stood for office and participated in an annual general meeting in another branch on 16 August 1994 suddenly appeared as particivery pants in the other branch on 22 August.",11
9,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,The honourable member for Moore has had a reasonable go I think.,11
10,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Could I just finish the last,11
11,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"If you believe you have been misrepresented twice more, keep it brief.",11
12,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In the last part of the speech he claims that Ian Viner presented a statutory in 1989 to the effect that I had attempted to bribe a delegate to the 1989 preselhad ection when I beat former mayor Wayne Bradshaw. The person who made the statutory the declaration was Julie Debnam, a close friend the of Wayde Smith and Wayne Bradshaw, who was most recently seen on television tearfully in hugging Senator Crichton-Browne outside the of state executive meeting when they decided to expel him from the party. Ian Viner did not was present this declaration. Wayne Bradshaw",11
13,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"This is fascinating in Australia, as I am sure it is in other parts of Australia, but I think the honourable member has been given a fair enough go to where he has been misrepresented. NA Unemployment",11
14,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The rising level of unemployment and yesterday's national accounts.

Explanatory memorandum presented by Sciacca; leave granted for second reading to be moved forthwith. Second Reading",13
19,Mr SCIACCA,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"Bowman-Minister for international Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting Treasurer for Superannuation) (10.31 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Telecommunications interception is an intrueffective sive act. It is not as intrusive as other surveilbeing lance methods, such as personal and questioning of members of the public, but it is nevertheless a major infringement of person's privacy. This government is very concerned to ensure that the balance between privacy and law enforcement and national security needs is an appropriate one. The government is also concerned that interception be a cost-effective investigative tool. Because of the complexity of and chanmaintaining ges in telecommunications technology, capacity to intercept has become more and more expensive. The government wanted to find a balance between the needs of law enforcement and security agencies, individual rights and the cost to the public purse. NOES To this end, in July 1993 the government  Punch, G. F. the Department of Finance, to conduct a review of the long-term cost effectiveness of telecommunications interception. His terms of reference required him to evaluate the long term cost effectiveness of maintaining Australia's current telecommunications interception capability in the light of rapid changes in complex telecommunications technology, the PAIRS introduction of new telecommunications services and the continuing need to safeguard individual privacy. Mr Barrett reported in March 1994. The evidence suggests that telecommunications interception is very effective as part of an integrated framework of surveillance by law enforcement and security agencies. Up to now it has been a highly cost-effective investigative technique, particularly in a complementary role to other methodologies. Mr Barrett concluded that, in the short to medium term, the effectiveness of our law Mr enforcement and security agencies and Australia's international credibility in these areas will continue to be dependent on telecommunications interception. In the longer term, the situation will depend very much on developments. The government the accepts that Australia should continue to support efforts to develop international user requirements. Mr Barrett made recommendations aimed at achieving a continuing costinterception capability, which are implemented by this bill or administrasurveillance tively, as appropriate. In relation to the long-term cost effectivea ness of telecommunications, Mr Barrett has recommended a further review in 1997, after full deregulation of the telecommunications market. The government has accepted that recommendation. A review in 1997 will be able to evaluate the outcomes of Mr Barrett's review as well as assessing the prospects for interception capabilities against the the background of further deregulation. Mr Barrett concluded that 'the significant and demonstrable justification' required for such a major intrusion on an individual's privacy as interception of telecommunications is well demonstrated by the extensive range of successful prosecutions and convIctIOns based largely on evidence obtained by interception. He was satisfied that the administrative processes of both the law enforcement and security agencies and the carriers meet the requirements of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. He also concluded that the current system is reasonably effective in recognising and protecting the rights of all parties. He did, however, make recommendations which would contribute to greater transparency and discipline through fuller reporting and enhanced inspection processes. The government is implementing the majority of those recommendations in the current bill. There will be a new special register with details of warrants which do not lead, directly or indirectly, to a prosecution. The amendments also create a new civil right of action against a person who unlawfully intercepts or publishes a telephone communication. These, together with the new prohibition on the disclosure of designated warrant information, represent major new privacy protections, adding to the already stringent controls in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. In addition, agencies will be required to provide more detailed information, to be included in the annual reports to the parliament under the act, about the usefulness and the effectiveness of warrants, including use of information obtained under a warrant in criminal proceedings and cost-effectiveness. The offences which may found an interception warrant under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act will be extended to include those more serious offences involving corruption, including police corruption, or organised crime which are not at present covered. Mr Barrett also made other recommendations which are to be implemented administratively, such as monitoring of international developments in encryption, more frequent inspection of agency records in secure premises and an increased role for Austel in the coordination of interception matters. A recommendation concerning warrants for the supply of 'call data' , that is, electronically generated information about telephone traffic falling outside the current scope of the act, is the subject of discussions with the states. The government did not accept two of Mr Barrett's recommendations. The inspection and reporting function of the ombudsman under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act will not be transferred to the Privacy Commissioner. The present arrangements work well, are well understood by agencies and are in line with those applicable in the states. The inspection function is one which is directed towards compliance rather than adjudication of privacy issues. It is therefore better suited to the ombudsman's functional responsibilities. The government also did not accept the necessity to notify any innocent person whose telephone service has been intercepted of the fact of the interception. The new special register will provide a similar level of protection against misuse without the adverse consequences of possible disclosure of sensitive operations. The bill also amends the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to tighten up the exception to the prohibition on interception by a carrier employee in the course of his or her duties. In January this year the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) asked the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to review the act to determine whether amendments were necessary to limit the breadth of the exemption given to carrier employees to intercept telecommunications in the course of their duties in maintaining the telecommunications network. This was in response to certain allegations by a group of persons known as the 'Casualties of Telecom' about monitoring and recording of customer telephone services. The review of the exemption, conducted by the Attorney - General's Department, concluded that the exception is very broad and that there are good grounds for narrowing it. The proposed amendment is only one element of a combination of measures which will address the problems that have arisen in the area of customer privacy in telecommunications. The development of more effective policies and procedures by the carriers, in consultation with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, will support the proposed changes. These policies and procedures will serve to protect consumer privacy and will provide employees with guidance as to the circumstances where monitoring of services can take place, and the procedures that are to govern those activities. In determining whether an interception was reasonably necessary, a court is to have regard to matters which are specified in regulations. Such matters may include matters contained in guidelines or similar directions issued internally by a carrier or by an independent body such as Austel or the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. The amendments have no direct financial impact. In the past the Commonwealth has borne the cost of providing an interception capability. The Telecommunications Act amendments will require telecommunications carriers to pay the initial cost of developing interception capabilities in new telecommunications services and recover those costs from Commonwealth and state user agencies. This cost recovery will be as negotiated between intercepting agencies and the carriers but will be on a fair commercial basis. Actual spending proposals will be subject to the approval of the Attorney-General, the Minister for Communications and the Arts and the Minister for Finance. I commend the bill to the House.",15
20,Mr RUDDOCK,TELECOMMUNICA TIONS,"I thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca) for the second reading speech. I was particularly interested in the second speech and its terms because the minister has delivered the speech for another minister of this chamber. The comments that I intend to make are not critical of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs but are critical of those who are not present. The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that this bill is prepared under the authority of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), both of whom are ministers of this chamber. The bill was first debated in the Senate and the second reading speech that was given by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs today on behalf of his colleagues was exactly the same speech as was delivered in the Senate-the speech delivered almost 12 months ago. A great deal has happened in the meantime and I must say that I find it quite extraordinary that on a bill about which there has been considerable deliberation and discussion of the content, and a report from a Senate committee, those matters have not been adverted to. Nor has the government given any indication as to the way in which the bill has progressed. I think it shows the way in which this government sees this chamber very much as a rubber stamp in the legislative process. It diminishes the parliament when this chamber is treated in this way. If the minister has advisers present, they may take on board those comments. It reflects on the way in which advisers prepare these matters and on the government's approach that they are prepared to address a bill of this type in this way. Telecommunications interception has been a matter of concern to this parliament. The Speaker chaired a committee of this parliament on which I, the Minister for Communications and the Arts and a number of other members of this parliament served. It is not a matter on which it ought to be taken for granted that this chamber is without interest. I am particularly disappointed at the way in which this legislation has been dealt with. It is not because the opposition has any particular objections to the bill in the form that it has now been presented that I make those comments, because were it not for the opposition pressing the government to give priority to this bill it probably would not have even been dealt with today. I have given leave for this debate to proceed even though the bill has only just been introduced to this chamber. This bill is to give effect to a number of recommendations in a report to the government by Mr Barrett, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Finance. He was asked to conduct a review of the long-term cost-effectiveness of telecommunications interception. He reported in March 1994 with the report entitled Review of the long term cost effectiveness of telecommunications interception. This bill deals with seven subject areas. The first is to extend the categories of offences for which interception warrants may be sought. This has been done to include offences involving corruption, including police corruption and organised crime. Secondly, it requires the establishment of a new special register with details of warrants that do not lead directly or indirectly to a prosecution. Thirdly, it creates new civil remedies for unlawful interceptions or unlawful communication of information derived from an interception. Fourthly, it prohibits the disclosure of information about the existence of or details of a warrant. Fifthly, it provides for improvement in the quality of reports by requiring the following additional information: information about the number of arrests made or likely to be made on the basis of intercepted information and an assessment of the usefulness of intercepted information; details on the proportion of warrants in force which yielded interception information leading to a prosecution or used in support of a prosecution; and information about the average cost of warrants issued. Sixthly, it further restricts by adding a requirement of reasonable necessity to the authority of employees of carriers to monitor or record telephone conversations for the purposes of installing and maintaining the telecommunications network or for tracing nuisance callers. Seventhly, it makes compublic munications carriers responsible for the cost of developing interception capabilities existing or new telecommunications services with the licence holders being able to recover these costs from user agencies over time terms and conditions agreed between them. As I said earlier, pursuant to the Selection of Bills Committee report, this bill was as sufficiently important to be referred for examination to the Senate Legal and ConstituSouth tional Committee, and the majority of that committee recommended that the bill as introduced be enacted. I simply note that there was a good deal of interest in this matter. The Senate committee was chaired by Senator Cooney, with Senator Spindler as the deputy chair and comprised Senators Ellison, Chris Evans, MCKiernan and O'Chee. But a large number of members came as participatory members: Senators cerns Abetz, Boswell, Chamarette, Kemp, Margetts, Tambling, Knowles, Baume, Brownhill, Harradine, MCGauran, Short and Vanstone. One can see that it was not a matter that was addressed without a considerable degree of participation. The committee received a large number of submissions from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Attorney-General's Department, the Criminal Justice Commission, the Telecommunications Authority, the South Australian Police, the Department of Finance, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, the Law Society of New South Wales, the Northern Territory Police, Telecom Australia, the Minister for Police and Emergency Services and the Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman. They had a number of reports that were not released. They also heard from the South Australian Police; the Independent Commission Against Corruption; the South Australian police again in the form of Detective Superintendent Barry England; the Communications, Electrical, Electronic, Energy, Information, Postal, Plumbing and Allied Services Union of Australia; a supplementary submission from the Attorney-General's Department when Mr Barrett appeared; and the Privacy Committee. Looking at the evidence that was taken in hearings, we see that there was quite a representative group: the Attorney-General's on Department, the Department of Communications and the Arts, the Department of Finance with Mr Barrett, the Australian Federal Police, on Telecom and Telstra, the CEPU, Optus, the Commonwealth Ombudsman, the Casualties of Telecom, the National Crime Authority, the seen New South Wales Crime Commission, the Victorian Police Department, Austel, the New Wales Council for Civil Liberties, the Human Rights and'Equal Opportunity Commission and particularly its Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor, and the Australian Federal Police. The committee later had a number of additional meetings with the Attorney-General's Department and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. The report details a number of those conbut, given that the balancing in this area is often with issues relating to privacy and how you balance those issues up with the public interest of proceeding to intercept telephone calls-it is a very intrusive process, one which is often without notice-=--it was important that the parliament, in this case in the Senate, gave all those who were interested in this matter-particularly the report, its conclusions and this related legislation-the opportunity to put their views. The Senate committee concluded, and I think they quoted from the evidence of Mr Kevin O'Connor, the Privacy Commissioner, when he had this to say: The bill is, I think, a careful attempt to bring an increased level of discipline into various aspects the process that surrounds the obtaining of telecommunications interception warrants and, obviously, I welcome the elements of the bill that seek to incorporate greater scrutiny into the process of the effectiveness of warrants, in particular, and the cost of warrants. The reference in the bill to a civil remedy is not unimportant and is a significant new acknowledgment of the importance of the parliament protecting individual privacy interests through more accessible mechanisms than had previously existed. The committee further stated that itagrees with these sentiments and is satisfied that the measures contained in the Bill are necessary and should be enacted into law. Thus the committee recommended the bill as introduced be enacted. As I said, there was a dissenting report from the Deputy Chairman, Senator Spindler. He noted that the bill had attracted criticisms, and I point them out: Telecom, Optus and the CEPU voiced concerns that carriers and their employees would be exposed to unreasonable legal risk. Telecom claimed that acts done in good faith for maintenance or operational purposes, in accordance with guidelines referred to in the regulations, could nevertheless be found by a court not to be reasonably necessary. The uncertainties created by the legislation were made worse by the fact that the regulations have not been made pUblic, making it difficult to assess the impact of the legislation. The Casualties of Telecom called for the involvement of AUSTEL in giving approval for voice monitoring and recording, to bring independent expertise to bear in deciding whether such monitoring and recording was necessary. The Privacy Commissioner called for examination of a requirement of customer consent for all voice recording. Senator Spindler therefore was of the view that the bill should not be proceeded with until proposed regulations were available, and I think he also sought certain amendments. He was dissenting from a majority report which involved members of the government and members of the opposition agreeing that the bill should proceed as introduced. Senator Spindler's amendments dealing with authority of employees of carriers to intercept communications were based on a concern that they were not satisfactory as regulations were of not known at the time. The Democrats would not deal with the bill until they had seen those regulations. They therefore caused quite a degree of delay to the proceeding of this matter. It was not the coalition that in any way delayed the process of this bill. However, the government knew it had our support. It could have, if it had wished, proceeded to deal with this matter earlier. The reason we are concerned that there has been a delay in dealing with this matter is that the earlier passage of this bill could have been of advantage to the New South Wales royal commission into the New South Wales Police Force, particularly in revealing evidence in police corruption. Members may have observed that a great deal of the surveillance activity that has adduced evidence of police corruption in New South Wales arose through conversations that were not by means of telecommunications interception but rather by the use of tape recordings of conversations of individuals. In that sense, it may well have been a significant advantage to that commission and its work if this legislation had been proceeded with more promptly and if the government had been prepared to respond more quickly. It is a matter in which, even in relation to the regulations that Senator Spindler was seeking, the government could have been in a position to process those matters expeditiously and proceed with this legislation. The opposition is not opposed to the legislation. We have facilitated its passage. I simply note that with both ministers responsible for this legislation being in this chamber-given the amount of time that the Senate took to undertake its inquiry and the impact that may have had on other legislation being dealt with by the Senate-it is certainly disappointing to me that, given the long standing interest of members of the House of Representatives from the Speaker down on the issue of telecommunications interception, the inquiries that could have been undertaken in this case were not undertaken by a committee of this chamber. Again it is a matter of process. But it is the government's way of dealing with these matters which indicates that it takes this chamber for granted. It reflection of the way the parliament is diminished by the way in which the executive deals with these important questions. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Sciacca) read a third time. NA Public Works Committee",17
21,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 29th report of the committee for 1995, incorporating a dissenting report, relating to the York Park North office construction, Barton, ACT; redevelopment of Hinkler site, Barton, ACT; and redevelopment of Wool shed site, Barton, ACT. Ordered that the report be printed.",20
22,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The report that I have just tabled concerns the proposed construction by Australian Estate Management of three office blocks in the Canberra suburb of Barton at a cost of $118.109 million. The committee has recommended that the redevelopment of the Hinkler Building site to provide a new headquarters for the Australian Federal Police should proceed at a cost of $39.158 million. The committee has also recommended that alternative options for the location of the Department of Industrial Relations, including Civic, be examined. Details of this examination should be provided to the committee for further consideration. In relation to the proposed development of the York Park North site, the committee has recommended that an office complex for the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories be developed at either the Tuggeranong or Gungahlin town centres. Details of the preferred site and proposed design should be provided to the committee for further consideration. For the committee this was one of the most is a difficult inquiries of the year, made even more difficult by the amount of interest it generated in the ACT and the amount of lobbying that all members of the committee were subjected to. The original proposal was for three office blocks to be located within the Barton area of the ACT. The committee has rejected two of these proposals for a number of reasons-the appropriateness of office buildings in this area and the difficulties concerning the National Capital Plan. One strong argument put to the committee was that moving a large number of public servants from Civic would result in Civic being devastated. The committee does not accept this view, especially considering that Report 10 years ago the fear was that Civic would be overpopulated, and under pressure the government decided that, once public servants moved out, their place would not be taken by other public servants. This is now regarded as the 'conventional wisdom' in Canberra. But in response to a question from the committee, we were advised by the National Capital Planning Authority that backfilling of vacated offices is permitted. The committee emphasises that there is no ban on public servants backfilling vacated office accommodation in Civic. However, the committee is concerned at the combined impact that these three projects would have on Civic, while not sharing the rather alarmist views expressed by some witnesses--especially developers, seven of whom appeared before the committee. I must say it was for me a delight to learn of the concern that major entrepreneurs have for youth unemployment. Most of the seven developers who appeared before the committee made much of this and indicated that the committee should take this into consideration in our deliberations. I have never seen developers having such a social conscience before but, then again, perhaps developers in Canberra are different. The proposal of the Department of Industrial Relations on what is known as the Wool shed site has been rejected by the committee. The committee believes that better use could be made of this land and that the proposed car park structure would be inappropriate and not in keeping with the national significance of the Barton area. The committee is of the view that the proposal should not proceed on the Woolshed site and that Australian Estate Management should seek another site, preferably in Civic, to house the Department of Industrial Relations. A Civic location would partially meet the objections to the loss of personnel from Civic outlined by many groups, including the ACT government. The committee expects to be fully briefed on the new proposal for the Department of Industrial Relations. The committee considers that the Australian Federal Police has put the most persuasive case for a Barton location. The committee therefore believes that the AFP proposal should proceed as planned on the HinkIer site. The committee members have been bombarded with claims and counterclaims regarding rent. The Australian Federal Police are currently located in four different premises. The building in Civic is unsuitable and does not meet occupational health and safety requirements. It is not suitable for the Federal Police requirements and, regardless of what rent is charged, the simple fact is that the building is too small to accommodate current Federal Police needs. For operational reasons, the majority of the committee believes it is better to have the Federal Police located in their own building in Barton. However, in coming to this conclusion the committee regards it as regrettable that it will be necesevidence sary to demolish the George Knowles building which was refurbished in 1992 at a cost of some $2 million. The third proposal concerns a new office building for the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. The committee does not see the need for this building to be in Barton and recommends that this building be placed in either Tuggeranong or Gungahlin with an emphasis on Tuggeranong. The committee is conscious of the need for dispersed work opportunities in Canberra and is also concerned at parking limitations and traffic pressure in Barton. The committee was surprised at the evident lack of coordination between the National Capital Planning Authority and the ACT Planning Authority which was displayed in these projects. This was particularly so in the delay in obtaining approval for the amendment to the National Capital Plan to allow the Department of Industrial Relations proposal to proceed. I was disappointed that in this the final report of the year, the 29th report, opposition members have decided to put in a dissenting report. While respecting their right to do so, I must say that the last time there was a dissenting report was in the lead-up to the last election. So in this what some regard as a lead-up to the next election I was not greatly surprised that, although for three years the committee had acted in a bipartisan way, party politics should intrude in this last report. I reject the proposition that these proposals should be deferred. We are a committee of the 37th Parliament and will report to the 37th Parliament. There has been a claim that these proposals were presented with undue haste, but let me assure the House that, regardless of the time span between referral and hearing, these proposals received more detailed examination than perhaps any other during the past three years. I had meetings with the Master Builders Association of the ACT, Lend Lease and various lobbyists. The initial hearing with Australian Estate Management was on 10 November 1995. Everyone-and I stress this point-then had a week in which to study the presented by the Australian Estate Management and the question and answer session before the next hearing, which was on Friday, 17 November, when a series of witnesses appeared before the committee. In fact, that day the committee sat from 8.30 in the morning to 7.30 in the evening. I personally attended all briefings, hearings, inspections and, as indicated, many people beat a path to my door to lobby me. I also had discussions, both formal and informal, with all the local federal members and discussed the matter with members of the ACT government at the Public Works Committee conference in Adelaide. It was not the undue haste but the consistent lobbying that we were all subjected to that raised doubts about the project. Some the government had a duty to let entrepreneurs make money. I reject that as the sole role of governments. The truth was not always told in these extensive lobbying sessions and there were some fairly wild claims made. The lobbying continued right up until yesterday. Even then, I received yet another three-page fax offering various rents for the Federal Police in Civic. What those pushing the cheap rent in Civic option are not saying is that, when Australian Estate Management commenced renegotiating rents for various properties in Civic two or three years ago, the entrepreneurs now making much of why cheap rents are so important in Civic at that time were asking for rents as high as the rent being charged for the Bond building in Sydney, the most expensive building in Sydney. That is the rent they were asking two or three years ago in Civic. Frankly, the entrepreneurs want a competitive closed market in Civic. Had they not been so greedy on the rents proposed a couple of years back, maybe these proposals would not have come to my committee. But why should departments put themselves at the whim of entrepreneurs who, when they again have a captive market, would again push up the rents? The bottom line must surely be that not only is it government policy to have their own buildings but also, from a long-term point of view, it is much cheaper. Seven different development companies came before the committee all basically arguing that departments should be located in Civic in buildings either owned or proposed to be built by them. I do not believe that the role of the federal government is to fill buildings built on speCUlation by entrepreneurs with Canberra public servants, and it surprises me that the opposition members of the committee should support this view which, in the long-term, is much more expensive than having their own purpose-built building. I thought, obviously wrongly, in this report which involved considerable compromise on all sides that the committee had reached the most suitable alternative. We have basically recommended one building for Civic, thus felt dealing with the entrepreneurs and the ACT government concerns about Civic. We have recommended one building for Barton and we have recommended one building for Tuggeranong or Gungahlin, again meeting the request of the ACT government and many local groups. I regret that this report has now become subject to a political argument. But it does show the influence of the Canberra entrepreneurs on the Liberal Party. Senator Reid in the other place yesterday, when the Senate took note of the paper, talked about the enormous numbers being put into Barton. One would think the committee had recommended the whole three projects go there instead of one building housing 628 personnel. I must stress that this building replaces a building already on that site. What the committee did was, I believe, act in a responsible manner, especially for the long-term planning of Canberra. I must stress that we took note of all the submissions, not just those of the developers. We came up with what I believe, given the inherent difficulties, was a workable compromise that should have satisfied everyone and addressed the concerns raised by many to the committee. I absolutely reject the suggestion made by Senator Reid that the committee has not adequately considered this proposal. I personally-and I know other members did-spent hours in meetings and discussions on this proposal. In the weeks when the House was not sitting I drove to Canberra on several occasions for meetings. I have always been available for any discussions. I absolutely reject Senator Reid's suggestion about how this report could come before the House so quickly. 'It is an absolute mystery,' she claimed. Let me solve this absolute mystery for her. When you spend, as a committee member, hour after hour after hour on a project discussing all aspects and have your committee staff work until midnight on at least two occasions writing the report, the mystery is solved: it is called dedication and it is no mystery. The strength of the opposition's position on this project is testament, I believe, to the power of the lobby group in Canberra and I suppose their links with the Liberal Party. I also absolutely reject the suggestion by Senator Reid that I, or committee members, have been put under pressure by ministers. I neither was approached by nor spoke with any minister about this proposal. It is true that on Wednesday last week one minister telephoned my office several times but I refused to speak to him. I had made up my mind as to what I was going to recommend to the committee. Quite frankly, I was sick and tired of being lobbied. The only people putting pressure on me, and I suspect on the other committee members, were the lobbyists in Canberra. The ALP members of the committee rejected their efforts. Naturally, I was aware of the amount of interest these projects were generating in the ACT-one could hardly be unaware of it. I did discuss the project with several bureaucrats and asked them various questions about what would happen if various proposals were made. I stress again that no minister actually spoke to me about these projects. I was very conscious of the strong feelings on all sides regarding this proposal, and of the amount of lobbying that was going on, so I personally gave a lot of time to this proposal. I wanted to be convinced in my own mind that I had carefully considered all the options before bringing it before the parliament. The bottom line is this: whatever happens to this proposal, whatever happens to the Barton site, in two years time the Federal Police will still move out of their current accommodation. It is not large enough for them. It does not meet occupational health and safety requirements. In short, able. The landlords could drop the rent to a quarter of what it is today but the building would still be unsuitable and the Federal Police, in one way or another, in two years time will be moving out of there. Members have to ask themselves why the opposition members are so determined that the three proposals go to Civic. The answer is that there is one hell of a lot of money involved in this project. A lot of developers stand to make a lot of money, and that is why my committee was subjected to an unbelievable amount of pressure. If the committee's proposal is rejected-and I believe this is why a motion was moved in the Senate in relation to the work of the Public Works Committee-I hope that when every member of the Australian Federal Police who now occupies unsatisfactory and unhealthy office space in Civic, a building that Senator Reid seems to regard as some sort of architectural gem or workers' paradise, comes to cast their vote in the forthcoming federal election they will know which party insisted they stay in that unsuitable building. Yesterday in the Senate, Senator Reid said that if the AFP building were left vacant it 'would be a matter of concern for the landlords'. I suppose it would be a matter of concern for the landlords, but I thought that was what happened in a free enterprise competitive system. We are always being told how we are going to have more free enterprise and be more competitive. Some people get burnt in these systems. If that particular building, which is unsuitable for its current use, is vacant, the landlords will have to spend some money to make it suitable. Then, in a competitive market, they might be able to let it to someone else, but they will not be letting it to the Australian Federal Police. Senator Reid was very selective in her quotes from our report. There can be disagreement, and I accept this, with our proposal, but I find it deeply offensive that after chairing this committee for eight years and investigating and reporting on hundreds of projects worth billions of dollars my integrity should be questioned regarding a couple of it is unsuit- office blocks in the ACT. The projects that we have recommended this morning, totalling $118 million, brings the amount the committee has recommended this year to $1.5 billion. This is the 29th report, but in fact as it covers three projects it should really be the 31 st report that the Public Works Committee has tabled this year. This has been a record year for us in the number of reports we have covered, the expenditure involved and the amount of work that has been imposed on the committee members and secretarial staff. It has been a phenomenal workload. As other members of parliament relax over the Christmas break, we still have four more hearings and inspections scheduled. So there is no rest for the Public Works Committee over Christmas. Despite the dissenting report-and I do stress there was only one-I want to thank all the committee members for the support they have given me throughout the year. I pay particular tribute to the staff, especially the three senior members: Peter Roberts, who is the Secretary, Mike Fetter and Denise Denehy. The demands that have been put upon them, especially in the last month-and two nights this week they worked past midnight so we could hand down the reporthave been phenomenal. But, as always, they have responded magnificently. Were it not for their dedication to the work of the committee, we would not have been able to give approval to projects worth in excess of $1.5 billion year. I commend the reports to the House.",20
23,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As one of the members of the committee who put in a dissenting report, and having listened to the chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), could I say that all the members are aware of the work the chairman does. The reflection that might be within the dissenting report is not directed at the chairman. What he has just said indicates that on this particular issue there was considerable pressure, more so on him than on the rest of us. I believe the unnecessary pressure was because of the rushed judgment by three departments who knew what they were doing two years ago but put the final proposition before us in the last three months of this parliament. The analogy the chairman drew with another report on which there was dissent was symbolic of what must have happened then. I was not on the committee then, but the DFAT building down there now stands as testimony to the rush and bustle that accompanied that report-the same rush an- bust-e that accompanied this report. I do belIeve, In spite of what the chairman has said, that there was a rush, which was borne out by the fact that the staff has been working flat out for the last fortnight and more particularly over this week to get it finished in time. I do not know what pressures the chairman might have been under from his own side of parliament-that is, the government; I would imagine they were considerable-but I do believe we are in this position because, as he said, these should be the 29th, 30th and 31 st reports. None of these matters should have been referred together; they should have been referred separately. The committee should have been given the advantage of being able to sit and consider each proposition on its merits. I am not saying that the decision itself is not of merit. We are spending $118 million at the close of this the 37th parliament. It was the duty of the committee to determine whether that was a proper expenditure in the circumstances. I this am aware of the negotiations on rental that have been going on for the last two years. I am also aware that Kippax Development Pty Ltd sent us a letter yesterday suggesting there were more rental considerations to be had. At this moment I am not convinced that a rental proposition alternative that might be available is a better proposition than the $118 million. Those three departments are making a rush on this so that they will be in Barton and near the parliament. This could well be the last time bureaucratic pressure is used so a department can get into a select area. The planning advice that was given to us in the course of this project suggests those departments should not be there. This is a dissident report. The fourth recommendation made by the government members relates to two of the departments. There has to be a reference back to the committee in any case. These matters cannot be referred back to us in the life of this parliament. So we are asking for the deferral of two of these submissions, and the government members suggest that there should be a deferral. The third matter that comes into play concerns the Australian Federal Police. Again, my complaint is not only about whether a rental situation can now be accommodated but also about the lack of planning whereby the Federal Police were put into the present building five or six years ago and are now asking for a separate building. Perhaps the department might ask why five or six years ago this proposition was not put to the government. That is a fair argument. There has been an abysmal lack of planning in that respect. They are now knocking down the George Knowles building, where only two or three years ago we spent $2 million in Commonwealth funds providing for its refurbishment. The chairman has already indicated that there has been a tremendous rush of work. I associated myself with one limb of it. I was not able to get to the first hearing. I came the second hearing because I understood that there would be a lack of members on that committee to hear that evidence through. As a member of the committee, I believe that there are some questions yet to be asked and answered in this connection. The documents should have been submitted earlier and separately. There would then have been a better opportunity to flush out the matter. The chairman will not agree with me, but every time. I look and see that DFAT building I think of a building that is not compatible with the surrounds of this place. I think of how we might have been incorporating three other buildings. By the chairman's own admission, the car park there is badly constructed. It is the worse architecturally designed building that has ever been put before the committee. Again, the committee rushed judgment on these matters. We could do quite well by looking to see what the planning authority does. The National Capital Planning Authority disappointed me. They told us that they cannot directly tell a client what they can do but they can say what the client cannot do. They playa passive role. We have 74 people within that department planning in a passive role what you cannot do, not what you can do. If that is what the planning authority does, yet what is going to go into Barton and the Parliamentary Triangle has not been properly planned, somebody is doing a job for nothing. I am not suggesting that we wait for a report for the next three or four years while these parties come together to create a plan. We must have a plan for that area. DFAT stands as an example of why we should have that plan. I was impressed with the evidence of the Master Builders Association. They told us about the means by which AEM and other instrumentalities in this area go about putting out lump sum contracts and things like that. There are a lot of barbs in this area. I was grateful to be able to hear that evidence. Security guarantees and payment guarantees keep small contractors out of the action involving this $118 million. Small subcontractors can inhibit them from participating to because they do not have the funds to put up for the security guarantee. We were also warned about the lump sum concept. I did not really appreciate the difficulties with it. Neither does AEM. When it comes to the best value, one has to wonder whether project management or a lump sum is the best for the Commonwealth. Certainly down the line we have to accommodate those people who will put up these structures. I believe that we are assenting to many of the chairman's propositions. The only one that we dissent from is why, in this rush to judgment on the death of this 37th parliament, the 38th parliament does not have an opportunity to consider these matters in more leisure and detail. Finally, I appreciate the work that the chairman has put into this. Obviously, he has been subject to more lobbying. I inform him that I am not part of the Liberal Party establishment of Canberra or anywhere else in Australia. I believe that I bring to this an independent view about what might have transpired in other areas. The committee has to look at the manner in which the work is programmed and how those propositions are put to us. The departments have to understand that, if they are going to get a proper review and a proper and unanimous report, they have to be prepared to come earlier and give more details than they have. This will be my last opportunity to speak a member of the committee. I want to say again what a great delight it has been working with it. It is the most productive and rewardcosts ing committee we have in this place. I cannot speak enough of the dedication of the staff and what they have to put up with not from me but from other members of the committee who will remain unnamed. They are a dedination. cated staff. I believe that the strength of committee is not only in its chairmanship and members but more in the dedication of its in May 1986. staff. I support the dissident report. These propoBurley sals were presented to the committee by AEM with undue haste. There is the absence of any long-term planning in the Parliamentary Triangle and Barton. I believe that that is obvious and that mistakes have already been made. The pending election may alter the for priorities of the government of the 38th parliament. I am not predicting which party will be in government. Two of these proposals will be referred back to the committee in the 38th parliament. That is why we have made the suggestion that we have.",24
24,Mr LANGMORE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I will begin by congratulating the chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Works, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), for his capacity to find a way through this extremely intense controversy. He has done so in a way which sets aside sectional interit ests and reaffirms principles. The committee was under strong pressure, as have been the local members. They have come up with a very reasonable and well thought through compromise. As the honourstrong able member said, this has resulted in a more detailed examination than any other inquiry that the committee has done in this parliament. I congratulate him for his leadership coming to a conclusion that seems so emiclearly nently reasonable. It is reasonable because it reaffirms the National Capital Plan. The National Capital Plan is built around the principle of the dispersal of employment opportunities around the town whereby there should be employment opportunities in each of the town centres. This compromise allows as that to happen; it maintains that. That principle is built on an absolutely sound and pragmatic evaluation of the best ways to reduce in the construction and planning of Canberra. In 1984, the Metropolitan and Canberra Policy Plan concluded that this dispersed pattern of employment would confer a number of benefits on the town and the They were reiterated by the National the Capital Development Commission in a submission to the joint parliamentary committee In summary, those benefits are that the building of a third crossing across Lake Griffin could be avoided and that there would be lower concentrations of air pollutants, lower incidences of noise pollution and lower traffic volumes because traffic would be flowing in both directions, not just into one central location. In other words, it is the basis a more efficient use of the road system. It would reduce fuel costs, and the costs of road construction and parking construction. In other words, it would disperse traffic around the town and reduce time wasted in travelling. People would be able to work closer to where they live. This committee has reiterated that principle in its decision. I am particularly glad that it proposes that one of the office blocks be either at Tuggeranong or Gungahlin, because those are the areas where employment opportunities are now most needed. I am glad that responded, at least in part, to the petition from hundreds of residents of Gungahlin urging that the committee recommend construction of an office block there. It is very important that it has done this despite the pressure that it has experienced from sectional interests. I repeat my congratulations and strong support for the committee's report.",26
25,Mr SMYTH,COMMITTEES,"by leave-As the in member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has so said, planning confusion in the ACT is what has cast doubt upon the need for haste in this matter. I congratulate the chairman and members of the Joint Committee on Public Works for the way that they have considered this matter. Having sat through some of the hearings and been on the briefing tour with them, I am well aware of the pressures that have been brought to bear. The importance of planning the future of the ACT is borne out by the fact that the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) has confirmed the government's recognition of this planning confusion by forming the metropolitan Canberra growth strategy review to look at Canberra's planning future. This has been done in cooperation with the ACT government. I personally want public servants to have the best accommodation that we as a government can provide. They deserve it. I have worked in some of these substandard buildings myself. I also want Canberra as a city to be able to grow in the orderly fashion that the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has just spoken about. Canberra has been planned as a city with a series of satellite cities to reduce the burden on one central spot. Any shift to Barton is a shift away from this concept. Currently, the heart of Canberra is Civic, which has suffered several ups and downs through the movements of workers in and out of office blocks in the city. Many of the smaller business people have spoken to me about their concerns in this matter. They see the loss of any jobs in Civic as having a direct impact on their small businesses. Given the importance of Canberra to the nation as a capital, and as a home to the 300,000 people who live here, we should take a little more time to consider these matters more fuIly. The member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) has confirmed the large volume of high quality work done by the Public Works Committee and has indicated that as this report covers three projects they should be reports 29, 30 and 31. It would seem that, in putting reports together, we are hurrying things and that perhaps they should be given a bit more time. The NCPA gave evidence to the Public Works Committee that it was conducting its own reviews. I think the chairman then asked why the reviews had not been done before these works started. The ACT is currently conducting a couple of reviews into the planning influence on our smaIl shopping centres and the factors affecting their viability. We are currently conducting a joint metropolitan urban growth strategy review. We should spend a little more time on it and wait for all of the details and facts to come together. I was pleased to give evidence to the committee. I am pleased to see that it has taken on board my suggestion that perhaps Tuggeranong and Gungahlin should also be considered, as a reaffirmation of the planning principles that underlie Canberra's future. I am grateful for the suggestion that at least one of the departments could be moved to these outer areas. Again, we should spend a bit more time discussing the full impact of the plan. In the next six or 12 months a lot of public servants will be moving into the new DFAT building. We need to see what the real influence of that will be on the infrastructure and the future of Barton. A bit more time spent at this stage would save the government, the people of Canberra and the public servants a lot of time, and possibly a lot of money, in the future. I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to give evidence. I support the member for Dawson and thank the committee members and the chairman for their work. All the public meetings were fuIl of individuals who were very concerned and wiIling to give suggestions. I thank the committee for taking into account the Masterbuilders proposal that the smaller and medium sized building firms should not be excluded from the tendering process by conditions that were imposed on them. If we spend more time on these reports, wait for the outcome of some of the other reviews and look at the full picture for Canberra's planning future we will come up with a better and more cost-effective solution to the planning dilemmas that will face Canberra and this country in the future.",26
26,Mr HUMPHREYS,COMMITTEES,"by leaveAs a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works, I take this opportunity to congratulate the chairman, the members and local members of the committee for their contribution to the 29th report. This will probably be the last time. I will have the opportunity to talk on a Public Works Committee report in this House.  Denahy-all the people who work in the Public Works Committee office-have done a great job while I have been serving on the committee. When I was in opposition in the Old Parliament House chamber, I was on the Public Works Committee and Peter Roberts was the assistant secretary. He has done a marvellous job over many years. It has been a privilege to work with him and all the members of the committee, especially the chairman. It is sad that, on the last report of this parliament, I have to talk about some of my very good colleagues in the opposition who had to put in a dissenting report. I understand their concerns. I agree that we had to get through this proposition with haste. It is not the first time we have had to do that. We also had to do it with the hearing we conducted on the control tower in Darwin. It was put through before we knew where we were. We had to have the hearings on the Defence Housing Authority in the Northern Territory before the rainy season. You can only work up there in the dry season. A lot of hard work was done there. We have had to put a lot of rushed propositions through, but we did give them a fair hearing. The chairman has done a marvellous job in getting the hearing over. I did not have an opportunity to go to the public hearings, but I did go to the briefing the day before the public hearings and had full knowledge of what was being proposed. On the day we had the inspection I had no hesitation in thoroughly agreeing with the committee's recommendation that the Australian Federal Police should go over to Barton. That was the first thing I approved. I totally objected to the proposition of an above-ground car park in this day and age. I can remember many years ago the controversy surrounding a proposal to the Public Works Committee of an aboveground car park at Garden Island. Here we are in 1995 having a proposition like that put to us again. It has not been an easy task for the chairman or the members of the committee. I think we have come up with the best solution. We have a proposition where one of the departments goes to Tuggeranong and the Australian Federal Police to Barton, which I have always agreed with. I hope that Industrial Relations will stay in Civic. I thought that that was a fair proposition. Everyone was concerned. People came to me and said that we should put this off. I also received phone calls from consultants and other people. I have no problem in agreeing with what has finally been decided by the committee. I thoroughly endorse the committee's recommendations. I am sad that our opposition colleagues could not be with us on this occasion to agree to this proposal. In their wisdom in the next parliament they will be able to look at the propositions that will be coming back before the Public Works Committee-hopefully under the chairmanship of the current chair, the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). You never know, he might be a minister and we might have a new chairman. It has been a pleasure working with them all-the chairman and the staff. I wish them well, a very happy Christmas and a very healthy new year. MEMBERS' INTERESTS",27
27,Mr GRACE,COMMITTEES,As required by resolutions of the House I table copies of notifications of alterations of interests received during the period 29 June 1995 to 29 November 1995. NA Publications Committee Reports,28
28,Mr HORNE,COMMITTEES,"I present the 28th and 29th reports from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Copies of the report are being circulated to honourable members in the chamber. Report-by leave-adopted. Industry, Science and Technology Committee",28
29,Mr GRIFFITHS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, I present the reports of the committee entitled Innovation: A concept to market and Goodbye bad buys: Australian government purchasing policies and Commonwealth authorities and companies: Interim second report, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the reports be printed.",29
30,Mr GRIFFITHS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-It is my pleasure to table on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology the report of the committee's inquiry into innovation issues entitled Innovation: A concept to market. Innovation is recognised as a key determinant of economic growth. To prosper in today's rapidly changing world, it is vital that Australia maximise its innovation potential. This report illustrates the breadth of the concept of innovation. Recommendations cover such diverse areas as education; management skills; linkages and networking; research, development and commercialisation; the need for technology 'foresighting'; access to finance; and the particular needs of small and medium sized firms. Promoting innovation is about cultural change-fostering creativity and the entrepreneurial spirit. It is not an exercise we can expect to undertake simply in the short term. We must be in it for the long haul. Cultural characteristics are deeply embedded and often resistant to change, but the benefits from a more innovative society will be profound and long lasting. Ultimately there is little choice. While it a cliche to say that we live in a world of rapid change, this cliche contains a fundamental truth. As a society we must adapt to change and learn to use it to our advantage. The committee noted during the course of its inquiry that there are many programs in place that are designed to promote innovation. Some of these programs have been in place for some time-for example, the 150 per cent Reports taxation concession for research and development-and others, such as the enterprise education strategy, are fairly recent initiatives that appear well designed though further time is required before their effectiveness can be properly measured. The committee did not consider that there is a need for a suite of new programs. There is a need for a commitment to the continued application of programs already in place. The committee's report does contain, however, a number of recommendations for government action that we believe would make a very positive contribution to the development of Australia as an innovative nation. I commend the report to the House.",29
31,Mr REID,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I wish to place on record the outstanding work that was done by the staff of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology on this  Justin Winton and all of the staff for their assistance in what has been a very good job under rather difficult circumstances. The difficult circumstances are contained in some reservations which I have attached to the report. Regrettably, there were a number of processes which were implemented by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) which probably affected the proper outcome of the inquiry process. I - efer to the inquiry being referred to the commIttee by the minister on 16 November 1994. Before the referral of the inquiry, the minister had set in train a parallel national consultation process under an innovation task force resourced from within the minister's department. I wish to place on record my dissatisfaction with the course followed by the minister in commissioning parallel inquiry processes. There are three major undesirable conseis quences from this kind of duplication. Firstly, a degree of public confusion, and perhaps irritation, is inevitably generated. It would not be clear to individuals or organisations why they should be requested to prepare submissions to two separate bodies concerning virtually the same subject. It is certainly not clear to me why such a course was followed. Secondly, the extensive public consultation process set in train by the task force before the committee was able to launch its own inquiry inevitably hindered the gathering of evidence by the committee. For example, the CSIRO indicated to the committee secretariat that, since it was making an input through the innovation task force process, it would not be making a submission to the committee. The minister's department, which is the major relevant policy department-Industry, Science and Technology-similarly did not make a submission to the committee because of the task force exercise. There were doubtless many other organisations and individuals who did not convey their views to the committee because they had already contributed or were about to contribute to the task force inquiry. Thirdly, the standing committee of the House of Representatives, which comprises members of all political parties, could have issued a report and recommendations which had wider community support had it not been undermined by the minister's actions. It is my view that, as a result, the report the committee has been able to produce has suffered to some extent from a lack of direct evidence and opinion given to it. This has resulted in delay in producing a report and a lack of precision in the report's recommendations. I strongly urge ministers in future not to set in train parallel inquiry processes as this is both wasteful of resources and counterproductive. I wish to place on record my continued support of the committee staff and my thanks on behalf of all members of the committee for their assistance in putting together a report which has a number of initiatives in it but was compiled under very difficult circumstances.",29
32,Mr GRIFFITHS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I now wish to make a statement in relation to the second of the reports that have been tabled, Goodbye bad buys: Australian government purchasing policies and Commonwealth authorities and companies: Interim second report. I desisted from thanking the secretariat in my earlier contribution because I intended to do it at this point. As Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, I do want to place on record my great appreciation of the work of the committee  Egan and Mr Justin Winton. Today is Justin Winton's birthday. As a committee member, I say to you, Justin, that I could not imagine how you could possibly have a happier birthday than to have two of your committee reports tabled in the parliament. Frances Wilson, supporting the secretariat, has also done a sterling job throughout the year. I also want to thank my colleague the member for Bendigo, Bruce Reid, the deputy chairman of the committee, for his hard work during the year. This committee has been able to put a number of reports before the parliament this year, and that is in no small measure due to his contribution and the contribution of all of our other colleagues on the committee. In relation to the comments of the member for Bendigo about dual processes, there is some merit, I think, in his observations. There is no doubt that in the future ministers would be well advised to not encourage the dual process to which he referred and with which the committee had to contend. Nevertheless, that is no criticism of the minister. He was seeking as wide a contribution to this area of policy as possible. I think he remitted the inquiry to the committee in good faith. The further report, Goodbye bad buys, is the report into the Australian government purchasing policies and Commonwealth authorities and companies, interim second report. It is my pleasure to table this interim second report on behalf of the committee. In March 1994 the committee presented the Buying our future report, which looked at purchasing practices of government departments. That report proposed major changes to the structure by which purchasing policy was developed and by which its implementation was monitored. The government accepted most of the committee's recommendations in the Working Nation statement. I was involved in that process in a previous incarnation. Its formal response to the report was received in December 1994. This interim second report has been prepared to promote public consideration and comment before the committee finalises its recommendations. It concentrates on the purchasing policies of Commonwealth authorities and companies, including most statutory authorities and government business enterprises. The first stage of the committee's inquiry did not encompass these bodies, concentrating instead on government departments. There are a number of arguments in favour of extending the government's recent purchasing reforms to public authorities and companies. Extending the reforms would help break down the impediments to local suppliers in obtaining government business. This would benefit not only the companies which gain contracts but also those further down the supply chain. The benefits extend not only to those many industries which supply the needs of government bodies but also of course to the economy as a whole. The broad economic benefits of increased local procurement are self-evident. When Australian companies are able to demonstrate that they have won government contracts in Australia, this helps to provide them with credibility in export markets. I point that is often underestimated but increasingly understood. Governments certainly have a role in that context. The committee has received arguments in favour of and against the extension of purchasing reforms beyond government departments. On balance, the committee favours a wider application of government purchasing policies to Commonwealth authorities and government business enterprises. The report includes a proposed method to achieve this. However, before making a final judgment the committee seeks comment from interested parties on the report's contents and interim recommendations. I commend the report to the House. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to it. Leave granted.",30
33,Mr GRIFFITHS,COMMITTEES,I move: That the House take note of the reports. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Delegation to European Institutions and Spain,31
34,Mr LLOYD,DELEGATION REPORT,"I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to European Institutions and Spain, September to October 1995, and seek leave to make a statement in relation to it. Leave granted.",31
35,Mr LLOYD,DELEGATION REPORT,"I have much pleasure in presenting this report. I was the deputy leader of the delegation and I am very pleased to say that it was a most harmonious and united delegation. It was a credit to all of the members who made up the team, led so capably by Senator Michael Beahan, the President of the Senate. Other members of the delegation were Senator Sandy Macdonald, David Connolly from Bradfield, Mary Easson from Lowe, Lindsay Tanner from Melbourne, and Mark Latham from Werriwa. I particularly want to commend Senator Beahan as the leader because he was most capable and most considerate. He was always calm and stable and he created a very good sense of purpose think that is a for the delegation. I also want to thank the secretary of the delegation, Neil Bessell. He was hard working and always pleasant. I am sure that pleasantry was tried on a few occasions. Particularly, he was called in at the last minute to replace Brenton Holmes, who would have been the secretary. I also want to thank Australia's representatives overseas who helped with the agendas and provided hospitality to us. I refer to our ambassadors: in Paris, Ambassador Hillman to the OECD and Ambassador Brown to France; to the Netherlands, Ambassador Michael Tate; and to Spain, Ambassador Warwick Pearson and Mrs Pearson. Particularly, I refer to our ambassador to Belgium and the European Communities, Ambassador Ted Pocock, and his wife, Meg. I think they have established quite a reputation over a number of years now for the special and personal attention they extend to this annual delegation to the European institutions, which makes it so much more memorable. I think in particular of the arrangements so that we could visit the war cemeteries from the First World War battlefields in Flanders, ending in Ypres, and the laying of a wreath at the Menin Gate. One of the recommendations, because of the significance of this annual delegation to the Flanders area, is that, if possible, future delegations include in their itineraries visits to World War I battlefields and Australian war graves in both France - nd Belgium .. That would give a comprehensIve understandmg of those great battles and Austr-lia' s p-rti-i­ pation and of the genuine affectIOn that IS stIll there for Australians. I also want to recognise on behalf of the delegation the Spanish Ambassador to Australia and Dr Antonio Nunez, and the then charge d'affaires of the European Community's commission in Australia, Peter van den Heuvel, for the information, advice and support they have given to our delegation. I believe this is a valuable annual delegation to the European institutions, plus this year the bilateral visit to Spain. It is. an opportunity for the members of the delegatIon to learn more about these institutions and to discuss and debate issues, whether it be at the OECD, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, the European Commission in Brussels, NATO, the International Court of Justice the International War Crimes Tribunal on the' former Yugoslavia, the Organisation Prohibiting Chemical Weapons and, finally, the European Parliament in Strasbourg. As I said earlier on this occasion, there was also a bilateral visit to Spain. On behalf of the delegation, I again wish to tha-k our hos.ts, the Spanish parliament, for theIr generoSIty and the very interesting program they arranged for us, highlighted by an audience with Their Majesties King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, the King and Queen of Spain. It was fortunate that we were there when Spain occupied the presidency of the. European Union. I think the value of the bIlateral visit was increased because we were able to have more relevant discussions in relation to what is happening in Europe. One of .o-r recommendations is that in future, where It IS possible, the bilateral visit accompanying the annual visit to the European institutions be to the country that has the rotating presidency. I want to refer briefly to other recommendations, but particularly to the OECD discussions we had in Paris and then the debate on that OECD report in the parliamentary assembly in the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. That is one of the real opportunities delegations from Australia have to actually make a contribution and an impact. If the Australian delegation is to maximise this opportunity, then that delegation in the future needs to have a better understanding of the system, of the tactics needed. I believe that is only possible, as we recommend, by having some combination of conti-uity, at least for the leadership of the delegatIOn, and also attendance by at least the leadership at the preliminary meeting which occurs in July. I believe we are not the first to be making· such a recommendation. Australia shares this opportunity of participating in the OECD debate with the other non-European OECD countries: that is, Japan, Mexico, Canada, New Zealand and the United States. The United States does not take advantage of the opportunity and New Zealand is not always there but the other countries were. Canada show-d all of us what its better understanding of the procedures and the tactics could achieve in having a greater and more comprehensive series of amendments and input into that OECD report; hence the recommendation that we need to be doing at least the same as the Canadians. In terms of agricultural, employment and economic issues, I believe all of the members of our delegation made valuable contributions. Senator Beahan was asked to chair part of the proceedings. He and I were also able to - peak in the parliamentary assembly. I would lIke to conclude by referring to some of the recommendations. Recommendation No. 1 of the report states: ... the Delegation considers that the visit to the European Institutions is so signi-cant, the Leader of the Delegation should be a semor member of the Government or a Presiding Officer. The degree of access enjoyed by Delegations is directly related to the status of the Delegation Leader. That is something that I very firmly and personally support. Recommendation No.2 states: in an effort to achieve greater continuity, the Parliament should elect at least two delegates, one from the Government and one from the major opposition party, to remain as permanent delegates for the life of the Parliament; these permanent delegates should attend the July Round Table meetings at which the draft resolution on the DECD report is formulated as well as participating in the annual visit to the pean Institutions ... Recommendation No. 3 states: ... notwithstanding the useful briefings given by officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra, the Australian Ambassador to the European Communities should provide an extensive briefing when the Delegation arrives in Europe. I believe there is quite a number of very relevant and valuable recommendations that will lead to an important annual opportunity for members of this parliament to gain a better understanding and dialogue of what is happening in Europe. I recommend that those recommendations be treated seriously. I have much pleasure in presenting the report.",31
36,Mr TANNER,DELEGATION REPORT,"by leave-On behalf of myself and the delegation's two other government members from this House, the member for Lowe (Mrs Easson) and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), I wish to endorse the comments made by the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). I particularly endorse his comments with respect to thanking the delegation's secretary, Mr Neil Bessell, and the leader of the delegation, the President of the Senate. I certainly concur that the President was an excellent leader of the delegation. He managed to achieve a perfect balance between the obligations of formality, which are ever present in Europe, and the tendency to informality which is so prominent in the Australian character. I want to add my personal thanks to the staff of our OECD mission and, in particular, to Mr Rod Muir and Mr Leo Cruise. Unfortunately, my wife and baby daughter fell ill early in the trip and had to return home. This caused a certain amount of chaos and confusion with respect to arrangements. The staff of the OECD mission were superb in the way that they dealt with the problems. We were able to get them home with a minimum amount of difficulty and disruption. So I particularly thank Mr Cruise and Mr Muir as well as the other staff members of the OECD mission who helped. There were many highlights on the trip, and the member for Murray has referred to most of them. Being able to see Helmut Kohl Euro- address the Council of Europe, meeting with the Spanish foreign minister, witnessing the debate in the European Parliament about French nuclear testing, visiting the war graves and the house of Anne Frank in Amsterdam, visiting the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague-all these were some of the very worthwhile and educative visits that we were able to undertake as a delegation. One thing that became very obvious to me as a delegate there was that, irrespective of domestic debate on the issue, the rest of the world-or certainly Europe-regards Australia as leading the world on the issue of French nuclear testing. It is abundantly clear that we are seen throughout the world as the leading nation in opposing French nuclear testing. Perhaps many of us do not quite recognise that, but that point was made very strongly to us by many people we spoke with. Finally, I thank the deputy leader of the delegation, the member for Murray, and commend him for the role he played as deputy leader of the delegation. NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1995 Consideration of Senate Message Message received from the Senate returning the bill and acquainting the House that the Senate insists upon the amendments disagreed to by the House.

In an effort to clear the impasse and to minimise effect on universities across Australia, the government is prepared to accept the amendments. Question resolved in the affirmative.",34
38,Mr JOHNS,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (12.08 p.m.)-I move: That amendment No.3 insisted on by the Senate be disagreed to. We reject the opposition's amendment No.3 because this would deny funding of approximately $38 million required to provide additional places for the higher education sector, this funding being a key part of the government's higher education budget package. The package was worked out in close consultation with the higher education sector. It recognised the priorities of the sector, additional student places and research infrastructure. The government is committed to providing additional places in the universities. Since 1983 the total number of students has increased by 73 per cent from 349,000 to 604,000 in 1995. In the budget we made a commitment to provide an additional 11,000 places, including pipeline numbers, and these places are for those Australians who have not had the opportunity to go to university. These places will now be deli vered. As long as the bill is passed by the parliament in its amendwho is ed form, the government will be able to fully honour its commitment to students-that is, that we not increase the HECS debt, that we maintain the first repayment threshold of average weekly earnings, that we do not reallocate existing places from other states who is and that we do not introduce up-front fees for undergraduate students.",34
39,Dr KEMP,HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING,"The attitude that the government is now taking to the Senate amendments exposes the scandalous scare campaign that the government has indulged in on university places. What has now occurred is that, by agreeing to amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4 in the Senate, the government has been exposed as having been entirely politically motivated in this scare campaign. The coalition throughout has stood firm in opposing the changes to the HECS system. The government has been telling people that there was no way it could avoid cutting these places unless it gained all these amendments. Once again, this has been exposed as completely false. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) has been telling this House, the universities and students around Australia that the whole schema would unravel unless the government obtained these measures. The coalition has made it clear that it did not believe this and that it was all a matter of the government's priorities. This has now been clearly demonstrated to be correct by the action that is now being taken by the government in backing down in the face of the Senate's insistence on these changes. The $12 million that was involved in these amendments would have been enough to pay for the additional places which Mr Crean was threatening to cut from Queensland next year. It is quite clear that the money for these places was there all along. The government now appears to be targeting university research funding as the next victim of its political blackmail campaign. The government has been prepared to attack the students and the universities and threaten them with blackmail in an effort to get its way. When the Senate continued to insist on its amendments, the government backed down and has said that the places will come through anyway. As we move towards possibly an election campaign early in the new year, I think we can now see just how much credence can be placed on the government's word. This has been a classic case study in misrepresenting the situation, and the misrepresentation is now fully exposed. I note that the National Union of Students has given the government the go-ahead for the increased HECS thresholds. I want to say on behalf of the coalition that, in our view, the National Union of Students has given too much ground too easily in accepting the government's claim that the increased HECS take was needed to fund the additional university places. It has indicated its clear support for the government. The government's scare campaign is now on the public record. The NUS must be very embarrassed and humiliated by the fact that the government has now left it high and dry in backing down to the Senate's insistence on these amendments. Students in universities around Australia will note the willingness of the NUS to go along with the government's scare campaign on this matter. The fact that the government has now backed down and said that places will now come through has not only humiliated the government and exposed the falsity of its statements but also humiliated the National Union of Students. I am sure that students on campuses around Australia will take note of this. A strong student vote for the coalition in the coming election will certainly bring to an end the political thuggery and political misrepresentation that it has indulged in on this piece of legislation. In view of the government's backdown in the Senate on amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4, the coalition will not disagree with the government's motion to amendment No.3. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA NA The following bills were returned from the Senate without amendment or requests: Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1995-96 Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1995-96 APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1995-96 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that the amendment be taken into consideration forthwith. Senate's amendmentAfter clause 3, page 2, insert the following clause: Payment to Dr Lawrence not to exceed a certain amount ""3A.(1) Payments out of such money appropriated by this Act as is specified in subsection (2) must not exceed the amount of the legal costs of Dr C. Lawrence in relation to the Marks Royal Commission remaining after deduction from those costs of any amount paid or payable to or for Dr Lawrence by the Government of Western Australia for legal costs in relation to the Marks Royal Commission. ""(2) The money referred to in subsection (1) is as specified in Division 807, OTHER SERVICES, item 02, Dr C. Lawrence-legal costs in relation to the Marks Royal Commission, being $556 463. ""(3) In this Act, any reference, however expressed, to legal costs of Dr C. Lawrence in relation to the Marks Royal Commission does not include legal costs (however constituted) of Dr C. Lawrence for or in relation to proceedings in a court in relation to the Marks Royal Commission."". Motion (by Mr Johns) proposed: That the amendment be agreed to.",34
40,Mr ANDREWS,SENATE,"Menzies) (12.16 p.m.)This amendment, which has been moved in the Senate and to which I understand the government is now acceding, relates to payments which were proposed to be made out of revenue for the legal fees of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in relation to her appearance before the Marks royal commission and the challenges which she made in the Supreme Court of Western Australia and in the High Court of Australia about the conduct of that commission. The effect of the amendment is to change the legislation in terms which the coalition in this place sought to do when the bill was in the House of Representatives, namely, to allow the legal costs of Dr Lawrence in relation to her appearance and the appearance of her legal counsel before the Marks royal commission but to exclude from payment, in effect by the taxpayers of Australia, her legal costs where she sought to stop, to cease, to challenge, the conduct of the royal commission itself. The effect of this amendment will be that the taxpayers of Australia will still be paying for the legal costs of Dr LAWRENCE - those legal costs for her appearance before the royal commission over and above what is paid by the government of Western Australia-but a line will be drawn at paying for legal costs where she simply tried to close down the commission. The government's sense of appropriateness about this matter-its sense of balance, its sense of judgment, its concern for integrity in government these days-is perhaps best summed up in that memorable remark made recently by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who reminded Australians that if you say what you believe you will get drummed out of the ALP but if you are found to have deceived courts and the nation then your legal costs, running to perhaps hundreds of thousands of dollars, will be paid not by the ALP but by the ordinary taxpayers of Australia. Dr Kemp-It's a disgrace.",36
41,Mr ANDREWS,SENATE,"It is a disgrace, as my honourable colleague says. One has to remind people who is behind this. Who is the person who came in here and stood at this dispatch box day after day over the last few weeks and months and defended the minister and said, 'Yes, she should still have a place on this front bench'? Who is the person who set out and attempted day after day in this place to smear the reputation of the royal commissioner, a man who had served faithfully and honourably as a Supreme Court judge in Victoria-a man who had been called upon even by a government instrumentality to act as an arbitrator or a mediator in one of its matters but who, nonetheless, was smeared here? Who is the man who came in here and said that somehow the Marks royal commission was just a Liberal Party conspiracy, when all those who gave evidence and spoke out against Dr Lawrence were former members of the Labor Party cabinet in Western Australia or advisers to Dr Lawrence herself? Who is the person who came in here and said, 'Well, this was just the revenge of the Burkites'those who supported the former Premier of Western Australia, Mr Brian Burke? Of course, included in their number is none other than the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) himself. That person is the Prime Minister of this country, Mr Keating. Surely this will go down as one of the more scandalous events so far as this parliament is concerned. Integrity in politics and political life is such that a person who has been found to have deceived the people of Australia-and found conclusively, without any ifs or buts by a royal commissioner--continues to sit on the front bench of this government and continues to be defended by the Prime Minister of this country. How can the people of Australia have any confidence in any member of the government from the Prime Minister down and in any member of the cabinet from the Prime Minister down when one of their numbers has clearly been shown to have deceived the people yet continues to sit on the front bench? That is a question that Australians ought to ask themselves, and they ought to ask why the Prime Minister of this country has let that situation occur. On the other hand, we found out last night what happens when the Prime Minister does not like the views of one of his Labor Party members. In this the Year of Tolerance a member of the Labor Party cannot speak out-and whether or not you agree with what he said is not the point. The member for Kalgoorlie undoubtedly represents the views that are expressed by a range of Australians. Whether I agree with them, my colleagues agree with them or the minister at the table, the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), agrees with them is hardly the point. What happens to a member of the Labor Party who expresses views which are uncomfortable to the Prime Minister or which may not be politically correct at the time? In the words of a former Minister for Finance, Peter Walsh, he is put before a kangaroo court and drummed out of the ALP. I ask people to contrast these two events. As the member for Kalgoorlie said himself: you get drummed out of the ALP these days for expressing views which you honestly believe in, but if you are found conclusively to have deceived the Australian people this Prime Minister proposes that the taxpayers of Australia should fork out up to $700,000 or $800,000 in order to pay for the incurred legal fees. It is a scandal. It is one of the low points the history of this government. We on this side of the House originally said that we would demand that the taxpayers' money only be used to a limited extent. We said we would pay what had been paid in the past in royal commissions-that is, the fees for a person to appear before a royal commissionbut that we were not prepared to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees for challenges. That money being used is not our money, not the government's money nor the ALP's money; it is the money of the taxpayers of Australia. We were not prepared to have that money allocated and used for numerous challenges to try to cut off this royal commission and its inquiry into those events which happened in Western Australia. We were not prepared to do so then, and the Senate is not prepared to do so now. All we can say is that the government has caved in on this matter and said that it will accept this amendment-not because that is its mind in this matter but simply because it wants the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) to pass through this parliament before it rises, which will probably be later today. As I said before, this is a scandalous incident in the history of this nation. It is something which ought to mark this government today and in the future. People think about integrity in politics. At this stage, opinion polls generally say that, in terms of their standing and credibility in the general community, politicians are somewhere, to use that old cliche, below car salesmen-but that is probably being unfair to car salesmen.",36
42,Mr KERR,SENATE,Don't put this profession down.,37
43,Mr ANDREWS,SENATE,"The minister interjects and says, 'Don't put this profession down.' The minister can read opinion polls. They are taken and published on regular occasions in the media. They say that the general perception of the standing of members of parliament is bad, but what are you and your government doing to try to raise that perception? When we have this situation of a scandalous incident and you, Minister, voting in favour of continuing that situation-as you did when this matter was in the House of Representatives not so long ago on the first in occasion-I say, 'Look at your action and not your words by way of interjection today.' This is a scandal and it is one that people ought to remember: that a government was prepared to take any step and a Prime Minister was prepared to say anything to defend one person here on the front bench rather than do what prime ministers in the past have been prepared to do-say that a certain line of integrity has been offended and the minister ought to resign· from cabinet. This Prime Minister has not been prepared to do that and that will be a mark against his name for evermore. We are delighted, even if the motives are not entirely pure on the part of the government, that at last they have accepted an amendment to the effect that we had moved for in this place on a previous occasion and are acceding to the Senate's amendment. But people should always remember the history of this matter.",37
44,Mr LANGMORE,SENATE,"Fraser) (12.26 p.m.)The central issue in this amendment is really whether the royal commission in Western Australia was a reasonable one. It is quite clear that the issue was so minute and so impossible to determine that it was clearly improper to establish a royal commission to evaluate it. Given that it was entirely inappropriate to establish that royal commission, it was entirely appropriate that the government support the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in funding her case. The people of Australia will recognise that, because there is at the heart of the electorate a strong sense common sense and a recognition of what is reasonable. And that royal commission was not reasonable. I also want to use this opportunity to draw attention to what appears to be another unreasonable example of misjudged public administration that has occurred in the ACT and which it is important to report to this parlia- sivement on because it was raised last week. It relates to a proposal to locate the Department of Environment, Land and Planning in Dickson-a service centre in the ACT, not an employment centre. The Chief Minister of the ACT recommended against this location, yet public servants went ahead and decided to advertise, not with that particular location mentioned but they called for expressions of interest. Within a couple of months of the Chief Minister having said that it should not be at the place which was finally decided on, it went ahead there. This was clearly bad public administration. Since I made these comments in the House about a week ago, I have been making further inquiries about the incident to try to establish as accurately as possible the full facts. I am now told that the placing of the advertisement for a new building for DELP was undertaken by the Department of Urban Services with the approval of its minister at the time, Mr Lamont. That could well be true, though I have been unable to verify it. But in any case it was clearly contrary to the express written instructions of the Chief Minister. The advertisement was placed during an election period without anyone checking with the Chief Minister. At the very least, this is unprofessional public administration. It is quite possible that the head of the department at that time, Mr Townsend, had no direct role in the process of calling for expressions of interest for the construction of the Department of Environment, Land and Planning office building. But there are other issues that the event raises. I have discovered, in the limited time available, other aspects of this particular project which intensify my concern. I have been attempting to obtain access to an internal report on this project, but this has been of refused because it is claimed to contain commercial-in-confidence information. However, I have been shown a minute on the issue and that minute shows that an alternative tenderer, Mr Hindmarsh, as well as the successful tenderer, Mr Shaw, were to be shown copies of the report. So the justification for refusing me access seems quite unpersuaDr Kemp-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. What the member is now discussing has nothing whatever to do with the amendment before the House and I ask you to rule it out of order.",38
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SENATE,I am sure the member for Fraser is bringing his remarks to the amendment to the Appropriation Bill and I am sure he will continue in order.,38
46,Mr LANGMORE,SENATE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will be swift in concluding these comments. If the chief competitor of the successful tenderer can be shown the report, it seems strange that a parliamentarian cannot be shown the report, at least on a confidential basis. One wonders what the report contains that it is so important to hide. I have also been making other inquiries and have learned that the lease for the site of the DELP building in Dickson was awarded to Dickson Developments in March, only two months after the first advertisement calling for expressions of interest. I have found out that the lease is for five years and issued for an annual rental of $245,000, 10 per cent of the site value. The lease entitles the developer to deduct from the annual rental the costs of off site public works estimated at $517,000, and I have now been told that these off site public works are Chinese gates for Dickson, infrastructure for a Chinese market, and some pedestrian and parking changes. It is quite clear that at least some of these off site works have nothing to do with the government office block for which the lease has been issued. The lease entitles the developer to a further consequential lease for 99 years at the completion of the development, at a premium determined according to a specified dollar amount. The amounts are not indexed to inflation of commercial lease values over the period of the lease. This raises a number of questions. Given the major planning decision involved, why were the expressions of interest called during the caretaker period and the lease finalised less than a month after the election? Did the expression of interest process become a sort of beauty contest used to select the successful developer, or were open tenders called? I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA",38
47,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I move: That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 13 February 1996, at 12.30 p.m., unless otherwise called together by the Speaker or, event of the Speaker being unavailable, by the Deputy Speaker. Once a year I and others enjoy the chance to take a break from our regular business in the House to formally express our gratitude to those in the chamber and throughout this building for their hard work-to those whom we depend upon here and those without whom we would not be able to do our work. As ever, it is a genuine pleasure to acknowledge the high professional standards of the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Lyn BarIin, the Deputy Clerk, Ian Harris, and their colleagues. Lyn was here when I came here 26 years ago. We were both immeasurably younger then, but we are stilI here. We certainly thank him for his patience and attention to detail and for the air of calm competence he brings to our deliberations, and we thank his deputy and his office. Equally important to the running of this place is the Serjeant-at-Arms, David Elder, and those who work in the serjeant's office. I acknowledge their work and thank them for it. Complementing the work of the officers of this place are the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, Jeannie Hall, and her staff, AnnMarie Hodgson, Lindsay Youman and Del Ford. They do a great job in programming the government's business, making sure legislation is passed in the correct form, letting us all know what is going on in the chamber and generally ensuring that ministers and others are in the chamber when required. With an even more onerous task in ensuring that government members are all present and accounted for is the Chief Government Whip, Leo MCLeay, and his ever reliable deputies, Ted Grace and Rod Sawford. I thank them. I also thank the staff in the whips office, Joan Conner and Karen Wilson, who also assist in the mustering. When it comes to organising the chamber we have come to depend on the Leader of the House and my deputy, Kim Beazley, who combines a considerable portfolio load as Minister for Finance, the responsibilities of the deputy prime ministers hip and the leadership of the House, which he rolls into one mighty package. We thank him for that. I in the could not ask for a better Leader of the House. I think I can say that everyone in the chamber appreciates his work. He works well with the member for Flinders (Mr Reith). They work well together. The member for Flinders and he, I think, have got a nice consistent drum beat going through the place. I thank the member f-r Flinders for assisting the Leader of the House in the management of this place. They get through their business with a lot of efficiency and a deal of good humour for which we thank them. Controlling all of us of course is you, Mr Speaker, the deputy speaker and the second deputy speaker, Harry Jenkins and Allan Rocher. I would like to thank you for your forbearance over the course of the year. The Speaker is always in the hot seat in a parliamentary chamber which is this combative. You are often put on the spot in the thankless task of adjudicating debates. We appreciate your work and that of the deputy and second deputy and the Speaker's panel. Parliament, like this country and society, is changing. It is never easy being at the front of the changes. Nevertheless, you have done it with, I believe, impartiality and decency, and we thank you for it. The new procedures adopted last year continued to work effectively this year. I am more than happy to acknowledge the work of the Procedure Committee, chaired by the member for Charlton, Bob Brown, for continuing to improve the practices of the House. There are others who should be recognised for making this place work, but I think this has been a very useful innovation and we thank him for it. I would also like to thank the Hansard staff who faithfully record our words of wisdom and are sometimes even required to make sense of them. The sound and vision people who deliver our words and images throughout the building and across the broadcasting stations, we thank them. No doubt they are very important people to the producers of evening news for whom they package the shots.",39
48,Mr KERR,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,From the front.,40
49,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"From the front, yes. I am sure they thank them, too. The staff of the Parliamentary Library who often supply the information contained in our speeches-all these people have developed and maintained considerable expertise-I thank them all. I would like to particularly thank the switchboard staff-Marlene and her co-workers Margaret, Pam and Gaylene and the four extra staff who assist them when the parliament is in session. You always get courtesy from the telephonists. I think all of us know that number. You can ring and get any office and you always get it quickly and nicely. To keep a building like this running requires a lot of people doing essential work here to maintain the surroundings, which they again do very nicely-the gardeners, the cleaners, the painters and the maintenance staff. We tend to see less of them during business hours but they are there at other times. Their work goes on. I think their efforts are delivered at an exceptional standard. No doubt there are many others who should be mentioned, not least of which are those who guard us, feed us and keep us travelling. Let me say thank you to all of you. The transport officers who have to move members around continually-I know every member has always appreciated their courtesy and their interest. I would like to thank all the people I have mentioned, Mr Speaker, you included, for the effort over the course of the last year and to take the opportunity of wishing everyone a happy Christmas. This is the last Christmas in parliament for many in the chamber. For those who are retiring at the end of this parliament it will mean that this is the last appearance at the, if you like, pre-Christmas valedictories we have in talking about people's lives here. Many members are retiring. I will mention them. Members of the government are: Brian Howe, the member for Batman; Michael Duffy, the member for Holt; Jeannette MCHugh, the member for Grayndler; Peter Staples, the member for Jagajaga; Wendy Fatin, the member for Brand; Ben Humphreys, the member for Griffith; David Simmons, the member for Calare; Alan Griffiths, the member for Maribyrnong; Eric Fitzgibbon, the member for Hunter; Russ Gorman, the member for Greenway; and Chris Haviland, the member for Macarthur. Members of the Liberal Party are: Don Dobie, the member for Cook; David Connolly, the member for Bradfield; Steele Hall, the member for Boothby; and Ken Aldred, the member for Deakin. Members of the National Party are: Bruce Lloyd, the member for Murray; Ray Braithwaite, the member for Dawson; and our Independent member, Ted Mack, who was elected in 1990. It means a very great turnover in the parliament. People make a very big contribution to public life. All the people mentioned have all made a long contribution to public life over a very long period of time. I would like to say a couple of things about them. While we capture the mood before Christmas to reflect upon the parliament and those who work in it and serve it, I would like to mention a few of the people who have been long standing ministers. Brian Howe, who was elected in 1977, became a minister in 1983, as did Michael Duffy who was elected in 1980. Jeannette MCHugh was elected in 1983. Peter Staples and Wendy Fatin were elected the same year. All three have been ministers. Ben Humphreys came earlier in 1977 and became Minister for Veterans' Affairs. David Simmons came in 1983 and Alan Griffiths came in 1983. For the bulk of that group it is 12 years and for Brian Howe and Ben Humphreys it is 18 years, which is a long part of your life. I think we all feel honoured to serve in this place. All sorts of things draw us to public life. There is no particular way you are introduced to public life, no ing, no particular vocational education for public life. You tend to grow into it along the way. I would like to take this opportunity just to mention Brian Howe, my former Deputy Prime Minister. I would like to record how much I have appreciated the time. I have had with him here in the parliament during the period when we were members of the Expenditure Review Committee in the 1980s, when he was Minister for Social Security and Minister for Health. A lot of the matrix of the social programs of the Commonwealth came from those years. Brian always worked indefatigably-I underline the word 'indefatigably'and creatively to look at the priorities of the government, even the former government, and to re-sort them and to do it in a way which gave working Australians a fairer share of the national cake. Many great changes were made, some very radical ones-things like the family allowance supplement and the Child Support Agency, which is innovative in world terms. Of course he has gone on more latterly to be involved in the Commonwealth's involvement in cities with better cities, which has improved the way in which the country has functioned-the Commonwealth's relationship with the states and doing some things in the major cities and provincial cities that might not otherwise have been done. I said at the caucus meeting the other day that Brian enjoyed more substantial power than probably anybody in the Left of the Labor Party, or in the Left in Australia, since the war. While we have seen other luminaries on the stage, few have been as effective. I know all of my colleagues think this is so. We wish him well in private life, and we will miss him here. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",40
50,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Michael Duffy-the irrepressible Michael Duffy . We miss his entertainment at question time. The droll, pat lines no doubt are part and parcel of his personality. He distinguished himself here as a minister over a very long period of time in the cabinet, in the outer ministry and in significant portfolios, including Minister for particular schoolCommunications. In those key years in the trade debate in the Uruguay Round it could all have gone to nothing. Keeping the Uruguay commitment alive; Australia's support for and with the Cairns group; all those hard discussions with all the hard heads of the international trade debate, the Clayton Yuetters and the Carla Hillses and all the others of this world; the interminable night-time meetings, dawn breaks and the rest-all these things were done in the name of Australian trade and often, mostly, in the name of Australian agriculture. Whilst he was succeeded by Neal Blewett and then by Peter Cook and we brought the round to a close, it was, of course, done over seven years and his was a mighty contribution. Then, of course, Michael Duffy became Attorney-General and distinguished himself in that portfolio. But, like his colleague I mentioned earlier, Brian Howe, the thing I will remember them both for is their work in the corporate layer of the cabinet as cabinet colleagues. A cabinet minister is not like any other portfolio minister; a cabinet minister is somebody who has to take the responsibilities on in a corporate sense, who has an interest in every issue that comes along, not just their own. For that, we could always rely on Michael to understand the broad range of what the government was doingthrough the sense of earthiness and compassion he has always had and with his sure touch with advice. Upon leaving office and going to the back bench, having been at centre stage and on the front foot for so long, a reasonably deft change of personality was required too, and he did that well. He has represented the people of Holt with great distinction and it has been a great parliamentary and ministerial career. We will miss him. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",41
51,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"As for my colleague Jeannette MCHugh, I never thought Jeannette and I would have all that much in common after our years in the Left in New South Wales, but she likes me and I like her. She is such a sweetie you cannot help but like her. She always has a cheerful view of the world, and I was pleased to see her have the opportunity-as I have always been pleased in this place to see women break through into the parliamentary parties, into the caucus and into the cabinet-to make contributions, as we have also seen from Wendy Fatin, who was elected in Brand in 1983 and who is also retiring on this occasion. One may say that parliamentary politics is, by the sheer evidence of it, a difficult ring break through for women, but they have done so and they have been the trailblazers for many others, I hope, into the future. I always take the view that, when a greater proportion of that half of the population that has never been as well represented here as it might takes a greater and more leading role in the conduct and affairs of the government and in the business of the parliament, we will all be the better and the stronger for it. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",42
52,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"We thank them both for their contribution to Labor politics, to the cabinet, to the ministry and for holding up their end for Australian women. I have got other colleagues who have been members of the ministry-Peter Staples, Ben Humphreys, David Simmons and Alan Griffiths. Ben came in 1977, again, almost uniquely qualified for politics. He has done just about everything, from running a garage in Queensland to doing a bit of hawking and canvassing on occasions, which he turned to hawking and canvassing for votes and policy. He has been effecti ve in everything he has touched. I know that Ben has a special place out there with the veterans community who warmed to him when he was Minister for Veterans' Affairs. We have had a succession of veterans' affairs ministers in Ben's time, but I think Ben, in a sense, made a new mould in that relationship. I know that all of us in the government have appreciated it, but more than that we have always appreciated his common sense, decency and sense of fun. We will miss him from the place. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",42
53,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"When Peter Staples was minister for community services he broke a lot of important new ground and was most highly appreciated by the community in aged care, child care and other areas of the community support area. He really did add something to the stock of our work here. He will go knowing that that is so, and we understand that it is so as well. David Simmons, who came here as the member for Calare in 1983, has had a distinto guished time in a number of portfolios. It has always been important for us as a party to have the views of someone from a rural constituency to understand the problems of provincial cities and their communities, particularly agricultural communities, and to represent them here creatively in a number of important portfolio responsibilities. He was, for a time, minister for the arts and the arts community warmed to him. I think many appreciated the work that he did at that time, as well as in other portfolios. We wish David well in private life. Alan Griffiths came here in 1983 and rose to be Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development in the cabinet, which is one of the senior portfolios of the government. He was also Minister for Resources, where he distinguished himself with a lot of innovative policy which made a great difference to the way the country functions. This included removing the excise system and putting the resource rent tax into Bass Strait and seeing that we were efficiently able to continue the prolongation of that development. In a number of other areas in the resources field, including in water and forestry, he made very important contributions. He then became Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. When he stood down from the ministry and the cabinet on a private matter, I made it clear at the time that we in the caucus would welcome him back to the government. I would like to take this occasion to reiterate that. Of course, were he to have chosen to remain in parliament, I am sure that he would be re-elected to the ministry and the cabinet by the caucus. So, Alan, we wish you well. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",42
54,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"There are many members of the caucus who are retiring who have meant a lot to us but who have not held cabinet-Eric Fitzgibbon, Russ Gorman and Chris Haviland. Chris was elected in 1993. He has not been here as long as the others. Russ came in 1983 and Eric Fitzgibbon in 1984. Eric and Russ are both characters and we will miss them. They are part of the earthiness that the Labor Party is always able to attract and enables it to keep its feet on the ground. They are people who can cut through the nonsense of an argument. We have warned them against cutting through it too many times. I think we have appreciated them as members of the caucus, as we have Chris. We wish Chris well in the future. Don Dobie was here when I came here. He came here in 1966; I came here in 1969. He has been returned I think on every occasion bar one since. It is 29 years ago. His career has always been marked out by his personal decency, general kindness towards people and by the fact that he always made substantial contributions to the parliamentary process in and out of office. He served with a number of coalition governments over the period where he had portfolio responsibilities. I have always thought that Don was one of the people that kept the link between the parliament as it is in a more contemporary guise and how it used to be when he and I first came here. At that time the executive government played less of a role in the management of Australia, and the cabinet and the ministry also had less of a role in the management of the Commonwealth. It was in the days when the bureaucracy played a greater role than it does today in policy development and when the parliament had a more discursive role than perhaps it does in this contemporary setting. In those days, second reading speeches were reported in the press often and widely. If a member made the effort to give a quality second reading contribution, it would be reported. Much of that has changed with radio and television, and with the focus on question time a lot of the more thoughtful contributions of members are basically ignored by the media-I think more is the pity. The second reading debate is a time when people on the back bench can actually say something in the parliament of note and have it noticed. At the same time they can mark their own career path as their fellow members of the caucus and parliamentary parties can make judgments about them. At any rate, there are not many people who have been here longer-I think only Ian Sinclair has been here longer-than Don. I think I am the last one from the 1969 group, which was a very large group of members. So it is with some sadness and nostalgia that we will see him go. We wish him well, as I am sure his own party will. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",43
55,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"David Connolly came in 1974 as the member for Bradfield from a distinguished career in the Public Service in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He has been on the front bench in substantial positions and remains with the shadow responsibility for retirement incomes and superannuation. He has made a substantial contribution around here and will now leave to go to private life. I hope that the years he has spent here are years that qualify him for this change of his own life to another interesting phase of his life and that he will take from here happy memories. Steele Hall was elected as a senator in 1974 and then in 1981 was elected as the member for Boothby in the House of Representatives. He came from a controversial background in the conservative parties of South Australia where, for a number of reasons, he was a figure of controversy surrounding the redistribution policies of that state. We on this side of the House-and probably most people everywhere-now think that made South Australia a fairer place to work and a better political system. The integrity that Steele showed at the time is not forgotten by members on this side of the House. He was the Premier in South Australia but never rose to become a minister here-but well might have-and we wish him well. Ken Aldred came in 1975 and he leaves 20 years later. It is a relatively long innings, not too long at his age to make another life and another career, and we wish him well. Bruce Lloyd came as the member for Murray in 1971. Bruce was in that group of people who came a bit late to get his position standing for the Fraser ministry in 1976. He missed a period as a minister during that time. The coalition went into opposition in 1983. From that time his ministerial opportunities were more than severely curtailed. We on this side of the House have always admired the work he did. He has been more than a little unlucky in not seeing ministerial office, which within the National Party he was entitled to see. While he does not leave here having been a minister, but for time and circumstance he would have very well become a minister in the National Party and the coalition government. He has always been cheerful and an absolute workaholic, and the people of Murray could never have elected a more energetic member than him. We thank him for his conscientiousness and his decency and we wish him well. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",43
56,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Ray Braithwaite was elected to the seat of Dawson in 1975. Again, I do not think he has held ministerial office, but he has been on the front bench of the opposition in a number of important shadow portfolio responsibilities. Twenty years is a long time in here and he has obviously taken the choice to call it a day and say he has done his bit here, and we wish him well. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",44
57,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Ted Mack came in 1990, quite remarkably, to win a House of Representatives seat in North Sydney against the established parties, which is no mean feat. It is testimony to the public standing which he had in the community of North Sydney and for his enduring work in the municipality of North Sydney where he served as mayor and, of course, with distinction in the state parliament of New South Wales. It was on the basis of that public esteem that I am sure his election in North Sydney became possible. We wish our colleagues well. Public life is a passing parade. Anyone who thinks otherwise is deluding themselves. We can only be but on the stage for a while, hopefully usefully to be able to do some things. The good thing about the parliamentary system is that we are all first amongst equals. If you rise to cabinet or prime ministerial rank or if you do not, the caucus is where the weight and the responsibility ultimately is-the sense, the touch with the community and picking up the plasma of Australian democracy. That is why, in outlining a sketching of the government's model for a republic, we have always believed that we should keep the representative chamber of the House of Representatives and the power that it gives a prime minister and a cabinet paramount in the representative democracy we have. All the people who have served that I have mentioned have been part of that representative democracy. They have constituencies where they have related to people and institutions in their regional areas and localities. This is the essence of representative government where you can join a party that has views and philosophies but where you can make a difference, at the same time keeping touch with the community and making a wider contribution, and then leave. That is the way it should be. I wish our colleagues well. I would like to conclude by again thanking you, Mr Speaker, the clerk and his deputies, the other officers of the chamber, the people in the building, those on our staffs who support us consisbeen tently, particularly ministerial staff, where work is hard and laborious, and parliamentary staffs, where often the load is high and the numbers are few, where the work is no less difficult and where the contribution is just great. We thank them because they are often the unsung heroes who keep the system running. We wish them all a happy Christmas and a good new year. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",44
58,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to join the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this traditional opportunity of expressing thanks to quite a lot of people who assist in making the parliament work and assist us in the job that we do behalf of the Australian people. I would to start with you, Mr Speaker. I wish you your family a very happy, peaceful and and enjoyable Christmas. The job of Speaker of the House is always difficult and I am sure occasions people try your patience. That is understandable. Sometimes they have good responsibilities reason to. At other times they do not, but will not go into that today. I wish you and Christmas. your deputy, who is just about to take the chair after I have finished these remarks, well and thank you for your assistance during year. I would like to very warmly endorse what the Prime Minister had to say about Lyn Barlin. He really is an ornament of impartialifor ty and decency in this place. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",45
59,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"He does represent the very effectively. finest traditions of professional dispassionate advice that does make the system work well. He deserves very much the compliments from both the Prime Minister and myself for the work he has done. I wish to thank Ian Harris, the other members of the staff, David Elder, the attendants and the parliamentary liaison officers. I know from my previous experience as Manager of Opposition Business what a hectic life that is and how important the PLO is to keeping the opposition afloat, so it must be very important keeping the government afloat. I compliment her on the work that has done. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, this has a year of important change for the the opposition side of the House. I would like to take the opportunity of thanking a few of my colleagues. I would like to particularly thank Tim Fischer, the Leader of the National Party, as for the unstinting loyalty, support and help that he has given to me. To Peter Costello, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, nobody could have a more effective, hard working and loyal party deputy than I have in Peter, and I warmly appreciate what he has done. To Peter Reith, who has been the Manager of Opposition Business, I think he has done it with quiet professional skill and good humour, and I thank him for that. I would also in an broader context like to on thank Alexander Downer for the contribution like that he has made and the way in which he and conducted himself in a personally difficult challenging situation earlier this year. I think what he did reflected great credit on his on intrinsic decency, his concern for our side of politics and his appreciation of the broader of public life. I wish Alexanwe der and Nicki and their family a very happy I would like to thank Bob Halverson and the David Hawker, the opposition whip and deputy whip. Bob has been a very good friend of mine over many years and I warmly thank him for the job that he has done, and David his tremendous support. We cannot talk about the whip's office on our side without mentioning Betty-Ann Daly, the opposition whip's clerk, who has kept things going so I would like to join the Prime Minister in thanking Kim Beazley for the work he has done as Leader of the House. Kim and I have had quite a bit to do with each other over the years. Vigorous exchanges aside, he loves the place as I do. I thank him for that and wish him well for Christmas and, in a personal sense, for the future. As the Prime Minister has said, there are a lot of people who, today, will be attending their last Christmas valedictory. I would like to mention several, if I she may, on the government side. I want to wish all who are departing well. 4348 In relation to Michael Duffy, it is an opportunity for me to say across the political divide that he is a person on the other side of politics that I have always rather warmed to. He does combine some of those distinctive IrishAustralian labour qualities. He has a very droll sense of humour. He is an intrinsically likeable person and he enjoys a bet. Mr Costello--Barracks for Essendon.",45
60,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"Yes, he barracks for the Essendon Football Club. He and my former colleague Andrew Peacock have a number of things in common. I thought he was an effective minister. You often wish you were the fly on the wall at a cabinet meeting. I have to say I wish I had been a fly on the wall when they were having those discussions about media ownership in the middle 1980s.",46
61,Mr KEATING,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to be a fly on your wall, mate!",46
62,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I bet you would, mate. I do wish Michael well. Brian Howe, who comes from a different kidney of Australian politics from me, has some very strong and well developed views on social justice. He put them with a very great passion and he showed a determined commitment to them. I respect him for that. I wish him well in the future and, whatever life may bring to him, I hope he derives great satisfaction and pleasure from it. I have always found Jeannette MCHugh in a personal sense to be a very pleasant person to talk to. I wish her every happiness in the future and acknowledge the contribution that she has made to the parliament in a very spontaneous sense. She has some very well developed views-and I respect her for that, too. I have always had affection for Ben Humphreys. Being the son of a garage proprietor, I always had an instinctive regard for garage proprietors; I thought they were a pretty decent breed. I wish Ben well. To David Simmons, Wendy Fatin, Eric Fitzgibbon, Peter Staples and all the other members",46
63,Mr GRIFFITHS,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,How quickly you have forgotten me.,46
64,Mr HOWARD,SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT,"I am very sorry, Alanand I am sorry if I have missed anybody. I NA wish all of them the very best and happiness in the future. If I could tum to my own side, I would like to start with Don Dobie. He first entered parliament as the member for Hughes in 1966. He entered at the Harold Holt landslide-at least, we thought it was a landslide until we came to 1975. The Harold Holt victory of 1966, until then, was the greatest victory that our side of politics had had. Don Dobie held the seat after the redistribution. He held the seat of Cook when Hughes was basically cut in half. The more Labor part of it remained as Hughes and the Liberal part of it was Cook. To Don, I want to record the thanks of a very grateful party for a very long stint in parliament. You have always acted out your respect for the parliamentary institution and you have been a reminder to all of us of the traditions of that. You have made a very effective contribution in the chamber and in our parliamentary party room. I can well remember some of the political warnings you delivered to the then government in 1982, particularly about some things that at that time were working against our interests. I have remembered those to this day. The same applies for our years in opposition in the 1980s. Janette and I extend to you, Don, our very best wishes and thanks for what you have done for our party and for the way in which you have represented your constituents. I know many of Don's constituents. There are few people on either side of politics who have cared for their flock quite as effectively and as attentively as Don has. He really has been a quintessentially superb local member. Steele Hall, by any definition, has had a remarkable political career. To be Premier of a state and to be active in implementing a piece of legislation which almost certainly guaranteed, if not his demise, that he would be politically challenged in a very strong sense was quite a remarkable feat. Steele Hall, over the years, would have been seen within my party and amongst those who follow politics very closely as coming from a different philosophical section of liberalism from the one I would perhaps be seen as coming from. There have been occasions when we have had radically different views on people, issues and party management. But I have grown over those years to have a deepening respect for his political acumen. Some of the things that he said in our party meetings before the last election turned out to be remarkably perspicacious and accurate. To Steele and his wife Joan and their family, I extend very warm thanks for the contribution he has made over the 20-odd years he has been in federal parliament and, before that, the years as a member of the South Australian parliament, as Premier of South Australia and as a member of the Liberal Party in South Australia. David Connolly and I entered parliament on the same day. I remember the rainy day of 18 May 1974 extremely well when for the first time we used those huge ballot papers. We had something like 74 people trying to hand out those damned things in the pouring rain and there were 74 candidates for the Senate. I say very warmly and very genuinely that I am sorry that David is leaving us. One of the more brutal parts of politics is the preselection system. It is part of the political process and we all face the possibility of it affecting us. That is no criticism of people who replace sitting members in preselection ballots but, to me, it represents a tinge of sadness that a person who has been in this place for the length of time David has is leaving. There is a lot of luck in politics. When people come in at the same time, a Prime Minister or a caucus has to make a decision as to which one to give the job to. The other person just misses out, and just missing out can mean the difference between being on the front bench for most of the time you are in parliament and not being on the front bench or not being a minister. David has had less than his reasonable share of luck. I think he has enormous ability. In the times I have been Leader of the Opposition he has been an extremely effective policy maker. An example is the work he did on retirement incomes in the late 1980s. He was the first person on the front bench of any party to debate the idea of reversing the trend towards early retirement. David began very early in the piece to argue that we should allow people to stay in the work force longer. That was quite pioneering. So, David, I wish you and Monique well in your future life. I am sure we will continue to see a great deal of you around Sydney. Ken Aldred came into parliament in 1975 and was out of parliament for something like 2Y2 or three years between 1980 and 1983. To Ken, Margie and their children I also extend very good wishes for the future. Ted Mack has been mentioned by the Prime Minister. He, of course, did achieve a remarkable thing. Being a ratepayer of the North Sydney council, as I am, I am aware of the esteem in which he is held in that area. It was, by any measure, a remarkable achievement for him to come in when he did. I want to wish him well in these valedictories. Bruce Lloyd and Ray Braithwaite are two members of the National Party that I have had a great deal to do with through good times and not so good times. Bruce and I served together as members of the coalition leadership team between 1987 and May of 1989after the 1987 election until May 1989. I found him in every way a decent, straightforward, uncomplicated believer in those things that were important to regional Australia and to the bush. He filled the shoes of the legendary Black Jack MCEwen when he took over the seat of Murray in 1971-and I think he had some of the traditions of his famous predecessor in that seat. He has a great sense of humour.",46
65,Mr LLOYD,REPRESENTATIVES,"Not everyone agrees with you, John.",47
66,Mr HOWARD,REPRESENTATIVES,"I am about to find out he has still got it, I am sure. He still has the reputation of producing the best one-liners at shadow cabinet meetings of anybody I have known over the last 10 or 12 years. Bruce and I, along with Ray Braithwaite, were at the centre of some of the more difficult years that the coalition had in the late 1980s--certainly surrounding the early months of 1987. Ray Braithwaite was a senior member of the Queensland national section of the National Party in that time, when the party experienced the difficulties that any political party experi4350 ences when there are internal tensions of a protracted kind. We all have to be up-front enough to acknowledge that, whether the tensions occur in our party or in another party. Ray resigned from the front bench of the coalition over the sugar issue before the 1993 election. He did so because he believed that the decision the coalition took on that issue was not in the interests of his constituents. He did it at a time when it was expected that the coalition would win that election, and in making that decision Ray was clearly putting at risk the possibility of becoming a minister in a future coalition government. I respected him for doing it at that time, and his electors did too. The seat of Dawson is by no means a lay-down misere for our side of politics, but he has held it continuously since 1975. I wish to thank both him and Bruce for the contribution they have made not only to the National Party but to the broader coalition cause. There is one other person I omitted to mention, and I apologise to her. That is Kathy Sullivan, the other deputy whip. She is the first female whip in the House of Representatives. She has also played a very major role in the work of the Main Committee, and I want to thank her, along with David Hawker and Bob Halverson, for the work that they have done. I conclude by wishing all members of parliament a very happy Christmas. It is a time of reflection, hope and renewal, whatever people's personal spiritual or non-spiritual views may be. For me it is a time to take a bit of a break with my family, as I guess most members will do. Mr Tim Fischer-And go to the cricket.",47
67,Mr HOWARD,REPRESENTATIVES,"I certainly will be going to a bit of cricket. Pakistan were all out for 299, I am informed, and Warne took four wickets. They had a promising start and then they crumbled. To all members of parliament, the very, very best of good luck. I hope to see some of you back next year-but certainly a diminished number on the other side!",48
68,Mr TIM FISCHER,REPRESENTATIVES,"The House this NA day salutes over 200 years of parliamentary service from those members who have indicated they are stepping down at the next election. I am happy to join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in acknowledging that and, at the outset, acknowledging the heavy workload of those who sit in the chair-the Speaker; you, Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins; and other deputy speakers-and the contribution they make to the running of this House of Representatives. Our focus is on former members. Let me begin with Bruce Lloyd-former deputy leader of the National Party; member for Murray for all these years; a person who, particularly in 1990 but also at other times, gave me great help, assistance and guidance; a person whose determination and dedication knows no bounds. In his knowledge of primary industries, he is without peer. He has served on a range of committees and performed a range of other roles for the National Party, for the coalition and for the community. This reflects the diligence with which he always approached his task as the federal member for Murray over the years. I wish Bruce and his family well, and salute that dedicated and determined service. At the same time, Bruce, I still have an argument with you in regard to who should have paid for that dinner at the Hotel Eaton in London in 197475. Eventually we will settle that. In respect of Ray Braithwaite, the member for Dawson, I too reiterate the comments made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. He was very courageous in representing his electorate and in representing not only the sugar industry but also other industries for which he was the catalyst. That continues right through to these moments, when once again he is in there pushing for the protection of building industry subcontractors involved with government projects. He is doing that in a way which is about fairness. I guess that is what Ray Braithwaite has been about-fairness, with a dignity attaching to his work as the member for Dawson, as the representative of that very challenging electorate in Queensland. We knew that, if Ray-in his front-bench, middle bench or back bench role-gave his word, that counted, as it did with Bruce Lloyd. Ray, I wish you and Mavis well in the future. I know that you will continue to think first, as you always have, of the nation, of what is in the best interests of people and of what is fair in the circumstances. You deserve the accolades of everybody in this House, and we thank you for your service. I can say of the retiring Liberal membersand I know a lot of members want to speak about them this afternoon-the member for Cook, Don Dobie; the member for Bradfield, David Connolly; the member for Deakin, Ken Aldred; and the member for Boothby, Steele Hall, that I have enjoyed very good working relations with them all. I have not always agreed with some of the comments that they have made from time to time, but each of them has covered the ground in their electorates against the odds. I have personally enjoyed and learnt from many of the comments and contributions that you have made. I wish all of you well and congratulate you for the years of service you have given to the parliament and the nation. Steele Hall has served not only this parliament but also the South Australian state parliament as well. On the Labor side there is a long list of retiring members. They are the members for Batman (Mr Howe), Griffith (Mr Humphreys), Holt (Mr Duffy), Brand (Ms Fatin), Greenway (Mr Gorman), Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), Grayndler (Ms MCHugh), Calare (Mr Simmons), Jagajaga (Mr Staples), Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and Macarthur (Mr Haviland). I genuinely wish all those retiring members well. I enjoyed working with and the courtesies extended by the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, Brian Howe, particularly with regard to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation which is part of his portfolio. When I was the new shadow minister for veterans' affairs the member for Griffith, Ben Humphreys, was a fair and courteous opponent and one who genuinely had the well-being of the veterans first and foremost in his mind as he went about administering that challenging portfolio. I say with respect to the member for Holt, Michael Duffy, that he knows more than I do about Albury because he was brought up in Albury. He is always welcome at the Albury and Wagga racecourses. I hope you bring some good tips in your retirement. I am disappointed that yesterday it was confirmed publicly for the first time that the World Trade Organisation rejected the Australian nominee on the short list for the disputes panel. Michael Duffy was in the final list. He was deserving of that support as a former Attorney-General and as a former minister for trade. One or two of the Europeans apparently blocked that nomination. I wish him well with his consultancies. We hope that further breakthroughs may occur. I commend the service of the other retiring members on the government side. I say in respect of the retiring members, and this includes the member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), that we are saluting over 200 years of combined service in this parliament. That should not be other than properly saluted on this occasion. I must say that 1995 has been a robust year. I guess 1996 will be an even more exciting and robust year. For all that happened in 1995 I thank my deputy, John Anderson. I thank him for his great help and support. I thank my parliamentary colleagues in the National Party for their help, support and assistance. I thank my friend the Leader of the Opposition, the member for the Bennelong, the cricket fan, John Howard. I appreciate very much the good working relationship we have along with his deputy, Peter Costello, and the Manager of Opposition Business, Peter Reith. It is a busy place. The fact that the place works at all is indeed due to the contributions made by the leaders of government and opposition business, Kim Beazley and Peter MCGauran. I thank them for the roles that they have played. I salute the whips because they also add to the workings of this place. I thank the National Party whips Noel Hicks, Garry Nehl and Mark Vaile, and also the whips from the Liberal and Labor parties. They have a time honoured and challenging role which they complete well. I will digress to salute my senatorial colleagues for their contributions and help to the National Party. It is often interesting to stroll over and see what happens in the Senate. We are allowed to sit on the floor of the Senate. I really think it is about time we allowed senators to sit just inside the door on the floor of this House. I realise that there are differing views on this matter. Lyn Barlin, the Clerk of the House of Representatives, does not just perform the eminent role of Clerk of the House and leader of his team of clerks-and we thank them all; he is also the registrar of pecuniary interests. He produced yet another document yesterday. He tells me that there are now more than 10 requests a week, particularly from the media, to inspect members' pecuniary interests. I wish them well. Lyn plays a great role. I extend Christmas greetings to those in that department of the parliament and all the departments of the parliament and the outgoing caterers. I regret the closure tonight of the special and small bar facility next to the staff cafeteria-I think it is called the Strangers Barwhich houses the Furphy shield which was donated by the Furphy family of Shepparton. I hope that proper action will be taken, as Bruce Lloyd has suggested, with regard to that very historic shield that hangs in the bar so that it is not lost to the parliament. To our spouses I say thanks too. They are the unsung heroes. I thank our staff both here in Canberra and in our electorates for the huge contributions they make. There are many around the world who go about their work at Christmas time on behalf of Australia. We have troops in the Sinai and elsewhere. I will not be visiting them this Christmas because I find my Christmas days now reallocated by my good wife. I wish them well. I wish the officers of Foreign Affairs and Trade who are around the world at this time well. To the Australian personnel in Antarctica, I wish them well as they go about their duties. I extend a happy Christmas to everybody.",48
69,Mr BEAZLEY,REPRESENTATIVES,"I am conscious of the fact that there are many who want to speak, but I can also assure the House that the last report I had from the Senate was that we will have plenty of time. Whether that continues to be the case in another hour or so I will keep you posted on. At least this occasion serves the useful purpose of ensuring that the very many who should speak in these valedictories get the opportunity to do so. Firstly, in these Christmas greetings I would wish you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to pass on to the Speaker our thanks for the way he has conducted the House over the course of the year. He has a trying position and he handles it with great dignity and aplomb, as do you yourself. I hope you can take those good wishes and pass them on to your deputies and also the Speaker. I want to single out Lyn Barlin for a special mention. I am sorry he is not here. Lyn-and I feel terribly guilty about this because I would have liked to have attended the ceremony-was awarded, most deservedly, a high honour in the Australian awards. He was invested a few weeks ago. That not only reflects extremely well on him but also reflects very well on Ian Harris and all the other staff-David Elder, who is the Serjeantat-Arms. They are the people who put an enormous effort in ensuring that this House is run with great professionalism. I know there are one or two points of disappointment that they feel during the year. I know that there is a sentiment among the clerks that the Senate has exceeded its powers in a number of areas, that we have not fully tested them in the way in which perhaps we ought to, and that expediency rules in order to simply get the business of government done. But when they remind us in a timely manner of the dignities and responsibilities of this House, they nevertheless perform that element of their function that goes beyond efficiency to being very much, even more than we are, the keepers of the traditions of the House. I want to thank too my leader, the Prime Minister, who has been one of the great reforming politicians of this nation, one of the toughest parliamentary performers, and almost, but not quite, father of the Housethere is Don Dobie and Ian Sinclair. Nevertheless, he is a very long-serving parliamentarian. He has graced this place in a very controversial manner. Nevertheless, when the history books are written centuries on, whilst many of us will have, if we are lucky, footnotes, he will have chapters. We wish him, Annita and the family a very happy, peaceful, calm Christmas and hope that he comes back thoroughly refreshed. There is no doubt about it at all: he is our chief warhorse and, as the new year rolls in, he will have to roll out and do the task yet again. I wish his opponent a personally satisfying life, if not politically satisfying life, and that he also enjoys Christmas with his family. He is a man devoted to his family, as is our leader. That is obviously a source of joy for him. They are loyal children-as we have occasion to know from a couple of television broadcasts during this year-and, as a father, having loyal children is always one of the blessings you hope for and do not necessarily always get. I think that the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard-also a great parliamentary performer and parliamentarian-deserves a peaceful and joyous Christmas. The same goes for Tim, and I wish him well too. My counterpart, Peter, is in a working relationship every bit as that described by previous speakers. I must thank too the Parliamentary Liaison Office. Jeannie Hall, Del and Lindsay do a terrific job. They run the parliament really, almost in a completely bipartisan way. They are under instructions to deal with great honesty with the opposition, and they do, and they are worthy of trust. I rely, as Leader of the House, enormously on our whips. I think that the whipping position has changed in this parliament. There have been some big changes in this parliament that have not really been fully recognised because parliamentary studies are not properly acknowledged and because we have a media which, while fascinated with politics, is completely indifferent to parliament. That is not understood. The changing to a more British whipping system, as we have done in the course of the last three years or so, necessitated by the creation of the Main Committee, has added a massive burden to the whips of both sides. Leo, Ted and Rod do a terrific job for us. I am sure they would want me to pass on their thanks too to their opposition counterparts, led by Bob Halverson, with whom they deal and with whom they run the Main Committee. The Main Committee is not run by ministers; it is run by the whips on both sides. It has been a terrific success in ensuring that there is much more accountability, much more of a sounding-board role in parliament, and they have done a very effective job with that. I thank too the Hansard staff, the broadcasthope ing officers, the transport office, the dining room staff and the attendants-all of whom make this building hum and keep us in a situation in which we are able to do our jobs effectively and efficiently. There are some who are an added joy, of course, and I think of Aussie. More heads roll, more plots are set, more stories are leaked and more mischief is done around that very small coffee shop than in any other part of the parliament. We used to, in fact, in Old Parliament House be able to plot at any point. You need a map to get around this place. Therefore, you go to the easiest places to find. If you want to know your fate during the day, see who is having breakfast together down at Aussie's. Some of the even completely indiscreet will have their journalist friends with them. Parliament House is now Australia's No.1 tourist attraction. With that there has been an enormous amount of additional commercial activity around the place-some of which has made our life easier and the banking activities. But this parliament is a very big enterprise now. I thank too my personal staff here in Canberra. I thank particularly, in parliamentary terms, Johnno, who does a terrific job around the place with my colleagues in caucus and with the running of the parliament. He is not here, and I will boot him up the bracket for that when I see him next.",50
70,Mr GEAR,REPRESENTATIVES,He is out working.,51
71,Mr BEAZLEY,REPRESENTATIVES,"He is out working, is he? This is the only place to be at the moment. He does a terrific job, as do my staff in Perth. I particularly mention Allan, who has driven for me for a while and has come over here to Canberra. It is good to see him here. I think even though there is a possibility that the parliament will reconvene, this set of valedictories belongs to the departing members. We cannot take the risk that parliament will reconvene. Those of us who want to wish them well must take advantage of the opportunity here today. I am going to miss them all. Many of them have had an intimate working relationship with me. Wendy Fatin has an intimate working relationship of very great personal importance to me at the moment, as I hope to be her successor in the seat of Brand. I have become more and more conscious as the campaign has gone by of what a huge proportion of that 53.7 per cent of the ALP vote was not transferable. There is going to have to be a great effort on her part to transfer as much of it as she possibly can. She has been a terrific parliamentarian-a very intelligent one. I think there are few people I have met in politics who apply more grey cells to the process than Wendy does. She has been engaged in the political process for a very long time. Whilst she has been in parliament since the mid-eighties, she worked on the staff of Senator John Wheeldon for a period and came into parliamentary politics with enormous experience. I am going to miss Mike Duffy terribly. I used to sit next to Mike when we were in opposition. We would sit there looking along the front bench of the then government, wondering whether or not we would ever beat them. We had John Armitage, as I remember, sitting in front of us, who always had advice for new members on how badly the other side was doing. Whenever Malcolm Fraser dropped his shoulder, John Armitage would turn around and say, 'You know, he is completely mad. You can tell when he drops his shoulder he is lying. Notice that?' This was a real education for Duffy and me at the time, and we were enormously grateful for it. We were even more grateful-when we would be sitting the unholy hours we used to sit in those days, watching the cricket from England at about 3 o'clock in the morning in the caucus room-to have a couple of the more energetic colleagues come in and explain to us the rights of life then, too. I know that he will come to the attention of all of us in retirement because he is an enormously active man. Those who enjoy life on the racecourse will see a lot of him. He is an important contact, 1 believe, with the natural roots of the Labor Party, and we will continue to see plenty of him. Ben Humphreys we will not be seeing, because 1I have been assured that Ben is going to get back on that huge trailer he used to have and head for the back blocks of Queensland as the bushman's friend. The parliamentary pension is not going to be enough to keep him. He will be off around those back blocks selling the floral dresses and the R.M. Williams gear to the Queenslanders, subverting the solid National Party territory, which has been his lot, as he goes through with that. Of course over the years he has made a tremendous contribution to the state of affairs of politics. For a very long time he was the only Queensland minister. His state has great reason to be grateful to him. 1 want to single out Dave Simmons for a bit of a word. Dave was a junior minister to me at one point in time and did a very fine job. He kept that factory going in a way that no other minister could have. The Steyr rifle will miss him; there is no question about that. The production of it, the distribution of it, needs Mr Simmons around the place to ensure its survival. Brian Howe is, as the Prime Minister said, a man of great achievement now in politicson the Left of the Labor Party, Deputy Prime Minister, very long serving minister. There is a great incentive for me to get re-elected and to help get the government re-elected on this occasion because at the moment Brian shares something with me, Gareth Evans and Ralph Willis. The four of us are the longest serving Labor federal ministers. The Prime Minister, you will recollect, had a brief break, which interrupted the record creating capacities on his part despite service in a previous government. That is an extraordinary achievement for Brian. He has been in many waysthough he has not flaunted it, and that is why he has been effective at it-a conscience of the Labor Party. He has not wandered around with a badge saying 'I am the conscience of the Labor Party'; he has simply done the job. In the tough times that we have been through over the last 13 years, he has been there with the advice on when to go In and when not to go in too hard in the process of change, and he has been one of those who have built up what is a very well thought out and effective social safety net. Alan Griffiths should not be leaving this place. His departure is much lamented. He has for a long time been regarded by many people as an alternative leader of the Labor Party, and I think he was, without any doubt at all. When you see the delights of family life that Alan is now confronted with, the opportunities that are there for him in business, you can understand that for him to stay here would be an act of pure madness. But on those acts of pure madness the political system relies, and I am sorry that he is not going to be continuing an act of pure madness and staying here but is departing. He is a man who has made in a very short space of time a very great contribution. Peter Staples is also departing the place. Again, Peter's contribution has been noteworthy. I think it was six years that he was a minister, and it is a very significant proportion of our recent history. He has defended nobly in the ERC the portfolios he has held and he will be missed very much in parliament. Eric Fitzgibbon is going to be missed too. Where is Eric? Mr Leo MCLeay-He is missing.",51
72,Mr BEAZLEY,REPRESENTATIVES,"Eric is missing. Russ, I think, shares this as well, so we could put two of them in the same pod. The Prime Minister described them as people who kept us in touch with our Labor Party roots, and so they do. In case we ever forgot that, we will get reminded of it frequently at caucus meetings. There will be in caucus gatherings a more peaceful 10 minutes than you can currently guarantee, as you could rely on one or both of them to get up and say what everybody was thinking but nobody wanted to say because they wanted to keep the peace of the place and keep it moving along nicely and in a harmonious fashion. They are great contributors and we are indeed very sorry to see them going. Jeanette MCHugh is another one of those in the category of conscience of the Labor Party. She has made a notable contribution to this place in her time. It is one of the odd facts that about three-quarters of the women who have been ministers are still alive and the substantial proportion of them are still in parliament. On the second of those categories, Jeanette will take it down on the other side of the ledger when she leaves this place. But those who have got here are an obvious example of why, as we move to better gender equity, it will be done with ease and great benefit to the nation because that bow wave that she, Wendy and others have built up is absolutely unstoppable. That is absolutely altogether appropriate. I probably knew Chris Haviland before anyone else in this place knew him. He used to play for Claremont-Cottesloe Cricket Club at the time. I did. The trouble was he was good and I was not. He has been here for only a very short time, but we wish him well in retirement too. Don Dobie of course was here when I got here. He was on the foreign affairs and defence committee when I was on it. He could be relied upon to entertain us as we went around the country. But he is a much more substantial figure than that, and I am sure the Liberal Party is going to miss him, as they will indeed miss Steele Hall and David Connolly, who has to be regarded as a pretty unlucky person in political life not to have had one more shot at an opportunity to serve the in office, even though we would still do our level best to beat him. To fall a victim to a Labor Party member who has never voted Liberal in his life must indeed be extraordinarily galling for him because in the seat that he represents he would never have expected to be taken out by a Labor Party candidate. By saying that I do not mean to belittle him in any way. I remember him too when I first came into parliament. I was on the foreign affairs and defence committee. I was also on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. He was a most innovative chairman of that committee at the time he held that position. He deserved an opportunity to make an even more substantial contribution to political life, though his contribution as chairman of one of the few parliamentary committees at that stage of the game was very substantial indeed. Steele Hall, another unlucky person in this place, a very substantial political figure in his own right, deserved very much better luck here too. I notice too that Ken Aldred, Ray Braithwaite and Bruce Lloyd are leaving. Bruce has always been a fellow with whom we on our side of the parliament, when we worked on committees, could do business. I remember Joe Dawkins pointing him out to me once and saying, 'See that bloke over there? He is one of the funniest men in this place. He won't show it in parliament but he genuinely is one of the funniest men in this place.' From reports of people who served on committees with him, he is a most effective member of parliament. We wish him well in retirement, as we do also Mr Braithwaite and Mr Aldred. Finally, I again want to pay tribute to our families and wish all of us well in this Christthe mas season. This is going to be a time of rest and recreation for us as we gird our loins for whatever next year brings us. I hope that members will be back, if they are back, or on the hustings, knowing that there is an element which we must collectively reserve for ourselves. Politically, cordially, we dislike each other, debate each other and handle the great issues of the nation not in a bipartisan fashion at all. But there must be in all our hearts a reserve of affection for the professional politician, for the person of public office, the member of parliament. We have to keep that smidgen of connection between ourselves, no matter how massively we disagree, so that we do not take our opposition to a point where we damage our institutions or belittle our institutions or the real achievements which all of us make in the time we are here and which we make on behalf of the people who elect us.",53
73,Mr REITH,REPRESENTATIVES,"This is one of the few opportunities we get to be personal about each other without moving a substantive motion. I pick up the remarks of the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that there is a common thread between us as professional politicians. It is something with which I strongly agree. I pick up those remarks and say, in respect of those who have not been ministers and who are leaving, it is true that they have also made a contribution. I have not enjoyed ministerial office. To those who served in Labor's long dark days of the 1950s and 1960s in opposition, no-one would deny the contribution they made to the political life of this country and our democratic institutions. Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask you to convey to the Speaker my thanks for his work during the past 12 months. He has one of the tough jobs in politics. I suppose it is true to say that sometimes it is my job to make it as tough as possible. We appreciate the important work that he does and that you personally, Mr Deputy Speaker, do, together with the other deputy speakers, in providing leadership on the forms and procedures of the House. I also thank the Second Deputy Speaker for work that he does in the Main Committee. He threatens to return in the new year. May well he. He and I worked very closely when I was deputy leader. I particularly want to note the very good and close working relationship I have enjoyed with him over a long period. I thank the Clerk and the Deputy Clerk for the assistance and the work done by them, their colleagues and their support staff. We appreciate their professional integrity and the for good advice that we obtain from them. There could be no higher mark of respect in this place than to have the respect of both sides of politics for the work they do. I formally thank them for their assistance during the last 12 months. I also thank the Serjeant-at-Arms, David Elder, and his staff for their assistance. I particularly thank Jeannie Hall, the PLO, for her work. If you are in politics and you are the messenger, watch out sometimes. She is often a go-between between us. She does it in a very courteous and efficient style. We appreciate the work that she does. I thank her very much and also those who support her. I thank the range of people who assist us in the management of the House and assist us, the politicians, in our work. I think of those in the transport office. We particularly like them when we are heading home. We thank them for all their work. We thank the attendants for opening the door as we come into the chamber, as they do so often. We thank them for their courtesy and assistance. We thank the Hansard people and the library people. The library people are of great importance, especially to the opposition. Governments have the mass of bureaucracy to assist them. In opposition we do not have those same resources. We rely very much on the Library, the parliamentary research people, the statistics group and others. I thank them for the very professional work they do. I want to thank people like Aussie in the shop. He looks after our day to day needs. He is a very happy-go-lucky character, good to talk to and always has a nice word to say. We thank him. I thank Lizzie. In my case, a haircut is not a major effort. These people are our touches to reality when we are here for a long time. We thank them for their work. We thank people like the receptionists, the telephonists and the sound and vision people. Although I am not as sporty as I should be, I would like to thank the people who assist with the gym and the sports activities in the leisure and recreation facilities. We appreciate the work they do. I thank the gardeners. They have had to put up with the currawongs in the gardens this year. They do a tremendous job in providing us with superb surroundings for our ongoing work. I also thank the Leader of the House for his contribution and for the professional way in which we have been able to conduct our relations in the last 12 months. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) implied, the Leader of the House enjoys his politics. We appreciate that and see the value of that. It could not be said that we live in each other's pockets, but whenever we have had matters to deal with they have been dealt with on a satisfactory basis, certainly from our point of view and, I am sure, from his. We look forward to that ongoing and continuing good relationship. In respect of those departing, I will not need to provide detailed comments on some. I want to salute the public service of all those who have contributed to this place. For those on the government side, whilst not in any way detracting from the service of all those who are leaving, I want to touch base with two or three with whom I have had some connection in a particular way. Alan Griffiths is leaving. He is a Monash graduate. We should stick together because Monash is the new university in Melbourne, in one sense. I wish Alan well. Russ Gorman and his mate, Lloyd, and a friend of mine, who shall remain nameless, and I would often meet for a special committee meeting in the billiard room. We did this for a few years. Russ, I wish you well. We always got on well, on a personal basis. David Simmons is leaving. His contribution as a minister has already been remarked upon. I did serve with him on the banking committee. David, I wanted to highlight your contribution as chairman of that committee, particularly in regard to the relationship between the parliament and the Reserve Bank. The conduct of monetary policy is a very significant aspect of economic policy. The committee has taken the opportunities provided by the general reference to it of the Reserve Bank's annual report to forge a new relationship of accountability with the Reserve Bank. It is in its early days. The work you have done is very important because it has given that policy of requiring accountability by that important institution a bipartisanship which it might not otherwise have had. If Hughie had still been here, it would not have. I remark on that significant development under your chairmanship. I also want to remark on the departure of the member for North Sydney, Ted Mack. I have been interested in our political processes inasmuch as I have been concerned at the sense of disillusionment in the Australian community about politics and the rising cynicism which has characterised our democracy, as it has many other Western democracies. Ted Mack's entry into this place as an independent was an extraordinary achievement in itself. I understand that in his electorate he had street committees. He has been able to forge a grassroots support base that actually won him the seat off John Spender. His interest in encouraging public participation in the democratic process is one which I have shared. We actually teamed up with the Democrats, when I was in the sin-bin a year or so ago, to promote a particular proposal which would achieve a greater public participation. I pay tribute to Ted's work, particularly in that area. It is very important, and we will hear a lot more about it in future. I pay tribute to all of those on our side who are departing. Steele Hall was described by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as from a conservative party. No-one could ever say Steele Hall was conservative in his politics. To Ken Aldred, who has shown such a keen interest in defence issues, to pick out one aspect of his parliamentary contribution which has been important, I say thanks. To David Connolly, with whom I have been closely associated on the front bench for a long time, I thank him for his contribution and for the good personal, close working relationship which we have enjoyed. He certainly will be missed. To Ray Braithwaite, likewise I endorse the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition. Ray, we had a good personal relationship. I thank you for that and wish you well for the future. Don Dobie was, I think, whip when I first arrived. Don had the advice handed down from whip to whip to new members-that is, never underestimate your parliamentary colleagues on the grounds that each and every one of them had some special quality which ensured their election to the federal parliament. That is very good advic-. I remember you giving me that advice, Don. That advice is still with me. I wish you well in your retirement. Thank you again. Bruce Lloyd is also departing. Bruce, we shared a time together as deputies for three years. It was a very busy time in coalition politics with the Fightback policy. You also had one of the biggest portfolio responsibilities in the agricultural area which, together with being deputy, kept you on the move. It did not, however, as others have said, detract in any way from the very good relationship you have with people. You and I worked very closely during that time and I thank you for that. I thank the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) for the good working relationship that I have enjoyed with them in the last 12 months. It is obviously the case on our side of politics that we must work very closely and they are excellent to deal with. Likewise Tim Fischer and John Anderson as Leader and Deputy Leader of the National Party. I particularly want to single out Peter MCGauran, David Kemp and Alexander Downer with whom I work on a daily basis in thinking about tactics, questions and all the other things that go to making up the strategic considerations on our side as we try to keep the government on its toes. Peter MCGauran is a very busy and effective operator in that regard. I also thank the chief opposition whip, Bob Halverson, and also David Hawker and the deputy whip, Kathy Sullivan, for their work and for their support staff-B.A. of course and Pauline. Things have been running very smoothly in that office as a result. I also thank my own staff: Michael Hughes in my office, who handles the parliamentary side of things-I thank him for his work-and· Nick Hordern who does the policy side for me in my office but is obviously very much involved in the day-today workings of the parliament. With those few words, I wish everybody a merry Christmas and a good new year.",54
74,Mr HOWE,REPRESENTATIVES," Mr Deputy Speaker, I begin by asking you to convey my congratulations to the Speaker on his survival in another tough year. As this is a time of reflecting on the past, I also ask you to convey seasons greetings to a former speaker, Harry Jenkins, who I think continues to have a great deal of affection here in the parliamentary party. I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) for their remarks about the contribution that I might have made over my time in parliament. I want to say a word or two about that experience, but first perhaps I can say how much I have appreciated being with those that are now departing, as well as other members of the Labor caucus, over a very long period. One develops very close relationships with many people within the parliament. There is always a note of regret when the parliament turns over, in a sense, as it must do-particularly for the longer serving members of parliament and some of the people that were ministers over quite extended periods. One has to move on, as they are moving on. Many of them have made significant contributions. I begin by saying a word about my family, particularly Renate, together with John, Abbey and Sarah. As is clear to everyone who is a member of parliament, you owe an enormous amount to your spouse, to your partner, and generally to your family. In my case, Renate was involved in politics before I was. She was a member of the Labor Party some years before I was. She has an enormous understanding of and an interest in politics. Without that very keen interest she would not have been able to stand the absences that have occurred over 18 years. It is incredible, I think, that we have been able to sustain a relationship over that time, given enormous pressures that politics place upon us. John, Abbey and Sarah have all been part of a team that has kept talking about politics from when they were young kids to people now in their 20s. Each are making their own contribution. Renate has had enormous support from her parents, Frank and Thelma, who were always very strong members of the Labor Party. My own parents, Jack and Lill, did not live to see me in parliament, but they were very strong Labor supporters and would have been very proud to see me a minister in a Labor government. I go back to my introduction to parliament in 1977, in opposition, through the standing committee on the environment, which was a very good and exciting committee. It was the time of the Franklin Dam issue and there were very big environmental concerns. I have always remembered the staff of that committee-Allan Kelly, John Cummins and Lyn Symons, who later became serjeant-for the professionalism with which they served that committee. It was a very creative committee. One of the interesting things about that committee was the way it operated across party lines with people like Barry Simon and Marshal Baillieu, in many ways, being as strong environmentalists as Barry Cohen or any other member of the committee. The Parliamentary Library was referred to earlier by Peter Reith. I thought, in the early days in opposition, the library was fantastic. I got enormous help from the library when making any contribution I made to the parliament. The library is very important in opposition in balancing the power of the executive. Knowledge is power and the staff of the library were always extremely professional and very informed. People like Jim Dunn were very passionate about East Timor. In the Left of the Labor Party, that was an issue that we felt strongly about. Jim Dunn certainly made a huge contribution. But there were many people in the Parliamentary Library who, I thought, made a tremendous contribution. I of course belong to the Left, and lowe the very much to the Left faction. I remember when I first came up to parliament that I made the mistake of travelling on the same plane as Barry Jones-in fact I sat next to him. By the time. I had reached Canberra, I was convinced that I had absolutely nothing to contribute. I think he mentioned 20 books, not one of which I had read, all of which he had read.",56
75,Mr BEAZLEY,REPRESENTATIVES,And memorised.,57
76,Mr HOWE,REPRESENTATIVES,"Memorised, and had very clear views about. He convinced me that I certainly had a lot of work to do. Perhaps that is why I was so keen on the Parliamentary Library. I came up for a function and the first thing I went to was actually a function at Ken Fry's home in Canberra, the sort of function which precedes the caucus ballots which determine positions. As it turned out, the function resulted in a dreadful blue because Moss Cass thought we might not support Tom Uren as the deputy leader. He thought Ralph Willis might get up over Lionel Bowen. Tom of course got the support of the group and was always very sceptical about any further contribution that Moss Cass might make to the parliament. The Left in those days was not exactly a collective. It tended to follow Tom or Arthur, and it was never quite clear who was in and who was out. It always seemed to me that the Right had curiously few meetings but the Left met more often. As I argued for more participatory decisions, it met more and more frequently. The Left gave one a home, friendships, and very much a sense of direction. Over time we got to have a greater degree of formality but I think we also had a group which had strong bonds based on the various movements with which we were involved whether it was the peace movement, antipoverty groups or the trade union movement. To be in the Left was not to be in politics as a professional; it was to be in politics because you believed that you could achieve certain outcomes. It was a continuation of what you had been doing outside of politics but it presented for you enormous opportunities. I also remember when parliament was a rather different place. Meeting late down in the old House and the Milo club would give you the opportunity to meet other members and soak up Labor and parliamentary tradition. Lionel Bowen often presided with Michael Duffy and the stories went over the days of the split, in which I thought Clyde Holding was the specialist-I had to worry about Clyde sometimes; he knew so much about it-or why Whitlam did not speak to Wriedt and how the bastardry of 1975 was ever allowed to occur. You learnt a great deal from all that. With the modem parliamentthe new House, the new hours, et ceterasometimes I think there is a lot to be said for the Milo club. Going home in Canberra, as people outside perhaps do not realise, meant going home to a group house as though you were still a student. I started off living at what we came to call 'Ho Chi Minh Place', which was a house in Torrens presided over by Senator George Georges together with Ruth Coleman and Moss Casso I must say, George never slept. George always had problems. Mr Leo MCLeay-He always had jet lag.",57
77,Mr HOWE,REPRESENTATIVES,"That is right-jet lag, or whatever. George and I, and occasionally Ruth-Moss usually went to bed-spent all night talking about the events of the day and the crises of the Left. Swinger Hill was another house. We had very interesting places. There I lived with Jeannette MCHugh, Gerry Hand and various others who came to spend time there. Gerry was a bit like Senator Georges: I cannot remember Gerry ever going to bed. The late night news from America was just coming in at that time and Gerry thought it was fantastic to be able to get up with the world news. He was always up in the morning, no matter how early you got up, having seen all the early television news as well. Gerry and I were great smokers-we would go through, I guess, a packet or two. Those occasions with Gerry and Jeannette, or earlier with Moss and George, were times in which you sorted out positions. Bill Hayden, as leader of the Labor Party at that time, had to work for a most extraordinarily difficult position. He had to create the potential for government while we were in opposition and tum what was very much a rump into the strong opposition it had become by 1980 and lead us to the threshold of government in 1983. I never quite understood Bill Hayden's distrust of our group, or his desperate need to change or rein in our policy. But I think a combination of the two was to cost him the leadership when he was so close to government. Bob Hawke had shown a great deal of leadership in the ACTU and he was a strong leader who recognised that we had to have disciplined government and we needed to bring the community along with us to achieve change. The summits were inspired and created the preconditions for fundamental changes in the management of the economy and taxation policy. Hawke instilled in the government the sense that it was worthwhile to give everyone a hearing in cabinet-an exhaustive discussion produced decisions that would be supported against those with reservations. Paul Keating as Treasurer and then as Prime Minister gave the government a sense of daring, which, regrettably, often took us off in directions of which the Left was often deeply sceptical. After we floated the dollaron which I had circulated a mildly critical paper-I remember receiving a phone call in Jensen House which I swear lasted half an hour while I held the phone as far from my ear as possible and tried to avoid any response. He speaks of our fiscal discipline with pride, but spending ministers quaked when Paul announced in a statement the planned spending cuts. Paul and I used to have sharp debates about who were the true conservatives. However, as Prime Minister he has shown a capacity to think long. I have always found this his most endearing quality. In this ment Paul Keating will be long remembered for Mabo, the republic and his achievements in APEC. People like me who had admired Whitlam for his vision did not expect to see another such robust moulder of ideas as Prime Minister Keating has become so soon again in the political cycle. It is important that I mention the Public Service, who I think are underrated and who serve this country so well. I was very saddened by the death of Peter Wilenski, whom I admired so much. He was so much an ideas person, not the conventional view of the public servant. At one stage early on when I was in Social Security I had lunch with Peter Wilenski at The Lobby. I was quite nervous about this meeting with someone of great stature. As did most members of the Labor Party, I had enormous respect for him. I just could not believe that I was in this cabinet with people for whom I had incredible respect. To be having lunch with Peter Wilen ski I thought was just an incredible adventure. I talked to Peter about what I might do in Social Security and how I might go about it. He told me about what he thought was Bill Hayden's greatest contribution in Social Security-that is, he created what was then called the development division. That was a policy division within the Department of Social Security that had been established, had grown and had become quite a formidable policy division by the time we returned to government in 1983. Before Bill Hayden, social security policy had been made in Treasury. Wilenski said, 'If you want to take my advice, you will get everything out of that division that you possibly can.' Later in Social Security, Derek Volker was a superb implementer of policy and was absolutely unswerving in his view that, if the minister made a decision, that is what happened in the Public Service. One thing that the Prime Minister and I agree on is that ministers who do not drive government departments get absolutely lost. They really become, in a sense, quite dangerous. They really need the leadership of ministers and the ministers' offices. Derek Volker was a superb administrator where clear policy decisions parlia- were being made. Andrew Podger is my current permanent head and is my choice. I have great respect for him. Charlie Holton is my first permanent head. Michael Duffy and I have conversations from time to time about Charlie's value. For me, he has been tremendous because he gave me the confidence that I needed to be a minister. There may be some other views about that. I have sought to develop a methodology in being a minister. That methodology has really involved a series of policy reviews. That has given continuity in the process of change and has enabled change to be driven quite successfully in social policy. That methodology really arose out of an experience I had with the royal commission into poverty in the 1970s, which I felt did not produce much by way of administrative change. I felt that a series of reviews was a way to achieve change. I owe a great deal to Professor Bettina Cass of Sydney University in relation to the social security review. She had a marvellous sense of equity and a sense of the linkages involved in policy. Very often in the past we thought incrementally. When you put up a cabinet submission, the submission was always in isolation. It did not recognise the interrelationship within one portfolio and the linkages across portfolios. Some of the reforms that came out of Bettina Cass's review are virtualgiven ly unprecedented. An example is the child support scheme. Three departments cooperated to produce that outcome, all of which in their own way were opposed to having responsibility. I was talking to Carmen Zanetti from the department the other day about JET, the jobs, education and training scheme, which is going extremely well. It is almost unique in its approach to sole parents. If you went to Britain and looked at the British policy on sole parents, you would hardly believe that the end of the 20th century it could be possible that policy so reactionary should continue to be in place. Bettina Cass was extraordinarily creative and played a very important role in that area. Meredith Edwards, who is now a deputy secretary in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, is John Burton's daughter. John Burton was a distinguished public servant in the Chifley government. Meredith Edwards was the first woman to achieve that status in the Prime Minister's department. Hopefully, she will achieve an even higher status in that department in the future. The national housing strategy was important because not in the whole 50 years of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement had we thought about the fundamentals of housing policy in the way that Meredith did in that review. Jenny Macklin worked on the health strategy. She was involved in a series of reforms which produced the national mental health strategy. It was the first time that the Commonwealth had worked like this with the states. It was not the result of Burdekin but the result of Jenny Macklin's work in the review, which also picked up Burdekin's helpful suggestions. There are many other reforms in health that I will not go on about. Jenny Macklin played a key role there and will be a very important member of this parliament when she is elected early next year. I have been associated with many social reforms. I feel that social policy is now regarded with much greater respect than it was 13 years ago. Social policy has been a standing alongside economic policy. That means that we are able to, in a sense, get the balance of policy right in Australia. That is one of the strengths of our contribution in politics. The social justice strategy is one of the great achievements of the Left of the Labor Party. I know that it is widely supported, but I think social justice was very much pushed at the 1986 conference by people from my area of the Labor Party. I say that not to crow about the Left but to say that sometimes the at Left is not recognised for the contributions that it has made. It has made an enormous contribution there. We are starting to contemplate a republic. As I listened to Andrew Theophanous and the Prime Minister at the launch of a book on multiculturalism this morning, I thought of the potential for the development of our ideas in social justice and links with citizenship. The debate in Europe about the nature of human rights within the European Community very much centres around citizenship. The seeds are there for very radical changes in thinking to be developed. I would like to think that our group was very important in all that. I certainly believe in working very closely with caucus committees. I want to thank the various caucus committees that I have been associated with from the day I came into parliament. I have been associated with social type committees. Those committees play a very important role. I want to mention two people who were never ministers but who played an enormously important role in the committee process. Senator Pat Giles and Senator John Coates were never given recognition in terms of ministerial rank. They were amazing contributors to the process of social reform. We would never have had a child support scheme if it had not been for Pat Giles. The rewriting and reform of the Social Security Act in plain English was a massive achievement of this government. John Coates played a huge role, on behalf of caucus, in spending time going through much of that draft legislation. If there is a single person to whom lowe most in my time in parliament, it is Gerry Hand. Gerry and I are very complementary people. Gerry is everything that I am not. is very social and gregarious. He has an enormous negotiating capacity and a capacity to lift people to see that there is something more important than a narrow interest. We would be ready to take an opposition position. Gerry would come into the group and say, 'No. There is a way through here. If we are tough enough to negotiate it, we can come with a good result.' We owe an enormous amount to Gerry in that sense. As a reform, the creation of ATSIC was huge achievement. At a time when we needed an approach which really transferred power Aboriginal people and opened up the possiis bility of a genuine recognition of the rights Aboriginal people as citizens, ATSIC was huge building block or step along the way. No-one without Gerry's negotiating skills could have achieved that. Robert Tickner else, would readily acknowledge that it was an amazing negotiating achievement. One of the great things about being in this government has been the way that the would ministry has operated. I cannot go through all ministers, but I think the really nice thing about it has been that-apart from me; I tend to get very emotional and go over the topeconomic on the whole we have had very little conflict in cabinet over 13 years. We have had our disputes, but on the whole they have remained in cabinet. We had a bit of a rocky period ways. there with the leadership change. But, on the whole, this government has been extraordiwanted narily disciplined and extremely professional. There are people with whom my relationwe ships have not been the best. But I knew that it would not affect their approach in cabineta either their or my submissions. To have part of a government that has been so united for so long is just an incredible achievement when you think of the alternatives for everyin one who has been involved in it; it is testimony to those people. I just want to mention my staff. A minister owes everything to his staff. Tom Uren gave us all a fair bit of advice. But one of the pieces of advice he gave me-apart from his great aphorisms like 'Everything is connected to everything else,' and 'The best you can ever hope for are the crumbs that blow off the He table'-was when he said, 'Well, make sure you get yourself very good staff.' I have had very, very committed and loyal staff. Netta Burns, who is in the gallery, who worked for every Social Security Labor minister, I think, until me, from the 1970s right through, and who worked with the British Labour Party in the immediate postwar period, is just a fantasout tic chief of staff to have in your office. I just mention Roy Forward, Lynne Chester, Lynne Gallagher, Tom Brennan and Rob a Hudson-all very, very formidable people. Everyone in my office has always worked, I to think, with a sense of it being the team that important to get the overall outcome. Ray of O'Halloran lowe a particular debt to. Ray a came to work with me at a time which was a difficult period. Personally, he has been of enormous support and, apart from anything he is just a fantastic bloke, a great guy. I just conclude by saying that I know this is a long set of remarks, but I do feel that it is important to go out, as the Prime Minister say, 'decently', and that one ought to refer to some of these things. I certainly think that, as a government, we have much to be proud of and, particularly in such difficult times, to have made sure that the systems of social protection and social solidarity, as they say, I think, correctly in Europe, have been enhanced in often really good There is a lot more to be done, and I just to mention in conclusion some of the things which I think need to be done. I think do need to define citizenship, down the track, in terms of the new republic, not just in narrow sense but in the philosophical sense been that I referred to and that Andrew Theophanous has referred to in his book today. We clearly need to put a lot more women parliament. I think some of the people who a have worked for me would be superb parliamentarians. The old arguments really do not now apply. We now have women who should be promoted in the Public Service, but we best still have a long way to go in the Public Service. We also have women on both sides of politics who should be in parliament in much larger numbers. If we do not achieve that, talking about social justice seems academic. I certainly support some kind of special representation of Aboriginal people in the parliament itself. We cannot go on debating in this chamber, without indigenous Australians being here, physically. I think we need to put enormous effort into young people and into education. I think Anne Harding's work on terms of life cycle distribution of income suggests that we are spending relatively too high a proportion of income at the wrong end of the spectrum. I think we need to be thinking about education in terms of quality and in terms of investment in the future, even more substantially than we have done so far. I would hope that cities remain on the national agenda, and that we build on the regional development initiatives. Finally, the UN Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen was, I thought, an extremely important conference. The Australian government has actually made some decisions on follow-up. And I hope that Australia will see its responsibilities, particuwhat larly given the emphasis in APEC on economic relationships, to make a much stronger commitment to the region in terms of social policy. I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your patience and tolerance, and I think the very large number of members who are present. I am very honoured that so many people have stayed for what, I am sorry, has been such a long speech, but I thank you very much.",58
78,Mr HUMPHREYS,REPRESENTATIVES,"I must admit, Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought this day for me would come many, many years earlier. When I came to the parliament I had never been to Canberra before, never been to Parliament House, and I thought everything was rosy in the rose garden down there with all these great members of the Labor Party being as one-and my baptism of fire was my first caucus meeting. I was very proud to be elected to the House of Representatives. We talk about the problems we have as backbenchers. I can remember being lobbied from day one, because I had made the announ cement that I was voting for Lionel Bowen instead of Bill Hayden. You can imagine how that went down in Queensland at the time. So we had phone calls from everywhere. I thought, well, I can just ride this out, because I had made my decision. In 1975, when I was a candidate, nobody wanted to know us, as you all know. There was no money forthcoming for donations. It was just lucky that I had been a small businessman for many, many years and that I had a few dollars in the pocket so that I could afford to run a campaign. But Lionel Bowen was the man. I think it was Don Dunstan who had promised to come and do this function, but we did not have too many who turned up at the function, I can assure you. However, Don pulled out at the last minute and Lionel Bowen stepped into the chamber and came up, and we had a very good meeting. I have always had a great respect for Lionel Bowen. I must say that, after I made known whom I was voting for, Lionel said to me, 'Have you still got your business?' I said, 'Yes, I've kept that going.' And he said, 'Well, don't sell it yet.' That is I mean; I did not think I would be here for that long. When I came to the parliament, there was Bill Hayden, Doug Everingham and me. Of course, Bill and I had not seen eye to eye on many occasions, and it was no secret that he did not support me in the preselection. But that did not worry me; I battled on. I was only going to be a oncer. You can imagine, with Doug Everingham being in the Left and Bill being against me-who do you think came and knocked on the door? It was the New South Wales Right. Mr Leo MCLeay-We are always recruiting.",62
79,Mr HUMPHREYS,REPRESENTATIVES,"I have to say, it was Doug MCClelland and the Godfather of the New South Wales Right, Johnno Johnson. Of course, Johnno had been a great mate before that. And I must pay a little tribute to his mate Brian Kilmartin, who had been the president of my FTE for many, many years before I became the candidate, and he is still the president. He was a great mate of Johnno Johnson. They did a lot of hard work behind the scenes to get me into the New South Wales Right also. But it was not hard to stay there, because I found them to be a very decent group of people-even though we hear some stories from time to time. But you do not want to believe all the stories you hear around Parliament House. I will just let you form your own judgment about that. Once I had made up my mind, I was always a loyal person. I never ratted. I always in there. It was not easy to do at times, I can either. assure you. Brian made a few remarks about how he was into the Left more than I was into the Right, and the next minute there was a knock on the door again. When Hawkey arrived, he said, 'We are going to challenge Bill Hayden again.' I thought, 'Here is another chance for me to have another vote.' I have a great respect for Bill Hayden, but Bill and I knew where we stood at that time. Hawkey was going to challenge Bill Hayden again. We were involved in another vote and were running around the place. All of this lobbying about trying to knock off leaders and all the rest of it were some of worse times in my life. It was not all that easy. Anyway, Bob could not do the count, could not do the numbers, as certain people had told him. When I walked into the room, I think that Bob had George Georges and somebody else with him, and someone came up to me and said, 'They can't count either,' so we knew that Bob was gone from day one. But when he did become leader and then Prime Minister, he was a great Prime Minister. Even though we all make mistakes from time to time, I enjoyed serving with Bob Hawke in the ministry. Then we had another vote. There was a phone call from Paul, wanting me to vote against Bob Hawke. I said to Paul, 'I love ya, but I can't help you this time. I am not going to vote a Prime Minister out.' The next time was tougher again. Paul phoned again and I said, 'Yes, you have got my vote.' I can remember Bob coming down and having a talk to me. There was a division on at the time. He put his arm around me and said, 'Mate, I'm the only one who can lead you and win the next election. I'll never forget you if you vote for me. Really, I need youafter all the things that I have done for you.' I said, 'No, mate, I'm sorry. It's too late.' Senator Dominic Foreman was a good mate. He had decided to vote for Paul. Bob came and put his arm around him and told the same old story, and Dominic changed his mind and voted for Bob. He said that he would never forget us. Then one day Mick Young said to Dominic, 'Have you heard from Bob yet?' stuck There were no Christmas cards forthcoming It has been a great pleasure for me to work with so many great Australians and members of the Labor Party. I can remember in 1975, when Gough lost, all my colleagues saying, 'We are gone forever. It will be 10 years at least before we can see a ray of sunshine and win government again.' I won in 1977, and they were still saying, 'It is a long way off yet.' And we all thought it was a long way off. It was the hard work and dedication of the members of the opposition in those days that won victory. Unfortunately, a lot of my colleagues on this side have never been in opposition, and unfortunately a lot of my the colleagues on the other side have not been in government. Mr Bevis-Long may it be so.",62
80,Mr HUMPHREYS,REPRESENTATIVES,"I hope so for your sake. It really was a great privilege for me to be a member of the party and deputy whip, to work to get the Labor government in, and then to be the government whip-you all know how we love to hate government whips; especially Leo, we all love you-and then to get into the ministry and serve for such fine Australians as Paul, Brian, Kim, Duffy and all of my other colleagues who are here. It was really wonderful. Paul was exactly right when he said, 'It is tough when you are in the cabinet, with all the paperwork and all the work you have to do. It is not easy.' I have the greatest respect for the junior ministers, the cabinet ministers and all of the backbenchers for all the hard work that they are doing. I know that it will come to fruition and give them the treasury bench once again at the next election. It is good to see you here, Mr Speaker. You can imagine how it was for me-never having been here, being green and thinking how wonderful it was-getting into that caucus meeting, seeing the old antics of everybody and the voting that was going on. I can remember that Doug MCClelland was going to be the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. After the votes, we walked out into King's Hall and he got stuck into Diamond Jim MCClelland, with a few expletives. Of course, Jim had promised to vote for him. I stood back and thought, 'God, I thought all these blokes were mates down here.' It just goes to show how green I was when I came down to this great establishment. I went minister down there in Old Parliament House to minister up here in the new Parliament House. Politicians and members of the Labor Party of my generation would never have believed that all these changes would happen. I am so proud to have been here with you all to see the changes and the great things that have been done. It is not very often that we make mates and friends-really good mates-in parliament. Two of my best mates were Mick Young, J.J. Brown, and also Les Johnson and Doug MCClelland. I can remember that one night JJ and I had had a very busy night here. We went home to the motel. JJ had not booked in; he did not have a key. I said, 'There is a spare bed in my room. You can sleep there.' In the morning, I opened the door, let JJ out and Ronnie MCAuliffe, Mr Rugby League himself, happened to be there. He said, 'Oh, Benny, JJ-isn't this wonderful! I won't tell anyone, only the caucus.' Mick Young is a great Australian and we missed him tremendously when he left. It was a shame that he did leave, but we had to get on without him. I am still a great mate of I remember all the little throwaway lines that he had when he was here. I will never forget the time when he was Leader of the House and I was Whip. I had to learn rhyming slang to keep up with Mick. I have confused some of my colleagues from time to time with a lot of the rhyming slang, as you know, Mr Speaker. You can thank Mick Young for teaching me all of the rhyming slang that I had learned over the years. I still try to practise it a bit from time to time. When we are trying to not let other colleagues know what we are talking about, we speak in rhyming slang. I would like to pay tribute to my staff. As Brian was saying, you are only as good as your staff. When I was in business for 20 years I kept saying, 'You are only as good as your staff. If you haven't got good staff and they are not working with you, you are not going to be any good yourself.' The same applies when you are a member of parliament. I have had great staff at the local officefrom . Esma Reed, Vicki and Marlene. They are tremendous workers. You would not make it without them and all the work they do behind the scenes on behalf of the constituents and on behalf of the Labor Party. It is tremendous. Tom Uren was absolutely right when he said that when you are a minister you have to pick good staff. John Engledow, who stayed with me as my senior private secretary for all those years, has just been promoted in the department of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). That is great to see, because he is a great public servant. It was a pleasure for me to work with him. He has all the professionalism of the Public Service, as Brian was mentioning. I would like to pay special tribute to Noel Tanzer, my secretary when I became minister. I will never forget the time when Noel Tanzer was going to go over to Administrative Services with Stewie West. The Whip has just pointed out what a very close-knit family man I was. I am going to mention my family shortly. Talking about Noel Tanzer, it was whispered that he was going to go to Administrative Services. I was expecting a call from his. Stewie West. He phoned up and said, 'Ben, I have got to talk to you.' I said, 'Oh, yes. What is this about?' He said, 'It is about your secretary, Noel Tanzer. I think he is going to become my secretary.' I said, 'Thank God for that. Really, you are doing me a favour by taking him.' He said, 'Just a minute!' I was trying to keep Noel Tanzer, and poor old Stewie had a heart attack. He was not awake up to what I was up to. He was always very serious. Nevertheless, I got Lionel Woodward after that. It is very important to have professional people working in the bureaucracy. Mr Speaker, you know also that the people in the bureaucracy do a marvellous job. They get accused wrongly from time to time, and they have to do what we, as members of parliament and ministers, require them to do. They do a marvellous job and I pay a special tribute to them, as Brian did. Also, I would like to thank the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer, for their kind remarks about me and all my other colleagues. I also thank my family-my wife Beryl, and my three daughters and two sons. Beryl has put up with me for 41 years. When I was Minister for Veterans' Affairs, someone said, 'You should strike a medal for her'and so we should for our wives and what they have to put up with when we are away from home and they are raising the family. My three daughters, Sharon, Judy and Brenda, and sons, young Ben and Jason, had to put up with a lot also. I remember one time when one of the National Party members was leaving. Bruce or someone was making a statement about how you can be cruel to your kids when you are a member of parliament. Because I was a businessman, I could afford to send my children to private schools. There was a ratbag teacher at the Anglican grammar school in Brisbane who told my son in front of the whole class, 'Your father is a communist.' The kids had to put up with those sorts of things, and they should not have had to do that.",63
81,Mr DUFFY,REPRESENTATIVES,We can't get away with it.,65
82,Mr HUMPHREYS,REPRESENTATIVES,"We cannot get away with it. I know National Party people and Liberal Party people are dealt with in harsh ways too. It is sad when those personal things happen to your family, and that makes it tougher for you.  them.",65
83,Mr HUMPHREYS,REPRESENTATIVES,"It is tough, but you have to get over that-and they have. My eldest daughter is a councillor now. As Brian Howe says, there are going to be more women in federal parliament, and I am sure she will get here one day. Once again, thanks to all of my colleagues for the great support you gave me when I was whip and when I was minister. It was great working with you all. Paul said he will miss us. Well, we'll miss you also. I have no doubt you are going to be the government again. With respect to the opposition, I have got some nice friends there: I do not have any doubt that you will be re-elected, but you have to get out there and really work hard. When I came here I was a young bloke and I looked at all the old blokes in the caucus. Now I am an old bloke and I am looking at all you young people here today. The talent on the back bench is tremendous in the Labor Party. As someone said the other day, you can pick the first 11, the second 11 and the third 11 from my colleagues here in the Labor Party. Finally, Mr Speaker, thank you very much for all your support over the years. You have done a marvellous job as Speaker and you are to be commended. Lyn Barlin, thanks very much for all the good work you have done and all the advice you have given me over the years. It has been really worthwhile. I would like to endorse the Prime Minister's remarks about all the staff that we have worked with here in parliament. It is great to see Berniethe leader of the Hansard grou-here. You do a marvellous job, Bernie. Please pass on my best wishes to all of them. A merry Christmas and a happy and healthy 1996 to you. These speeches are just a ploy, because I am sure we will all be back here on 13 February!",65
84,Mr DOBIE,REPRESENTATIVES,"I have written my speech out, but, having listened to my good friend Ben, I have to say a few things first. The parliament may not be aware that Ben and I were whips together. We became very good friends during that time, and we have stayed friends ever since. I think one of the things members here do not fully understand-perhaps it is the new building-is the friendships you can make with the opposite side. I can speak with great sincerity on that point. I want to get back to my notes, because after 30 years you have to write things you are going to say. I am not going to comment on who I voted for and who I did not vote for, but merely point out that in the time. I have been here we have had eight different leaders of my party, one of them twice. I will argue with Ben later about the problems of electing leaders. I am not disclosing to one soul who I voted for, though I think they may know. First of all, I want to thank you, Mr Speakof er, for the parliament's indulgence in permitting me to make a valedictory address on what may be the last sitting day of the 37th parliament-particularly as there are 18 of us retiring from this House, not including the number who are going to lose their seats on both sides in this coming election. For my own part, I support what Ben just said. I believe we are going to be back here on 13 February, and I have arranged to come back from an overseas trip on that very morning so I shall be here. If I seem to have difficulty reading this speech, I have to apologise. In recent weeks I have punctured my eyeball and I am having difficulty in reading, let alone talking. All us in this place can talk under water, but I am not expecting a flood at the moment! One thing that pleases me is that, after nearly three decades in this place, I am retiring of my own volition. It is a great source of satisfaction to me that there was no sense of pressure to stand down from anybody-in the Liberal Party or beyond, and certainly not from this place. Having lost my seat during the Whitlam years, 20 years ago, one of my ambitions was to retire at a time of my own choosing. That has been the case. That is what is happening now. As I said when I wrote to each elector in my electorate of Cook after I had made my decision earlier in the year, I believe my constituents are entitled to be represented by a younger person for the second half of the 1990s and beyond. I am pleased to announce that the new Liberal Party candidate for Cook is the Hon. Stephen Mutch MLC, who I am sure will be a worthy successor, a good member of the House and a popular person with the electors of Cook. I wish him every success in the coming months, and he goes forward with my strongest possible support. I am pleased to say that he and his wife are well aware of this. Having been here for such a long and thoroughly satisfying time, I do not intend to now berate the parliament with a long harangue of what I think should be changed or improved, or what statutory rules should be altered. I have enough confidence in our form democracy to think that it will survive and that its traditions will influence new members far more than new members can change those traditions. I think it is vital for all of us on both sides of the House to remember that. That is not to say that we-both executive and non-executive members of this Houseshould not take care to protect all that is good within the traditions. For example, I believe that Deputy Prime Minister Beazley's 90second speech time has been a notable success for all backbenchers. However, as the minister well knows, I have never approved of his decision to ensure that all parliamentary committees should be directed either by the executive or the parliament as to what they of should investigate. The decision to allow these committees to choose their own investigative subjects should be returned, and for all time. It will give more incentive and no greater workload for committee members. It may give a trifle more work to the executive. Getting away from the serious side, I should point out that I think there is something wrong in some of my colleagues referring to me as the 'father of the House'. I think it is slightly obscene. for a bachelor member to have that title! However, it is good to have served for so long and to have enjoyed it all-the bad as well as the good. I enjoyed having earned the title of 'honourable' when I was in Prime Minister Bill MCMahon's ministry. I do not know that I am going to enjoy the state funeral that that entitles me to! I have never had a seat on the front bench on either side of the parliament, but I am still retiring happy. I think more members of this parliament should be happier being members of the parliament and not constantly trying to meet an ambition. That applies to a lot of people in this place-now and in the future. I hope they can understand, as the British Commons teaches us, that being a member of parliament is the real point. That is what we should be proceeding with from now on. I hope my side of the House follows that through. You can get much more personal satisfaction from being a local member than you can get from going through the ambitious situations that people seem to keep on going through. I do want to at this stage pay a tribute to the five electorate secretaries I have had 1966. Each of them has been a caring, concerned person and we have enjoyed each other's company. All have greatly contributed to creating the good reputation of the office I am about to leave. I refer to Lynette Peterson, now Mrs Lalor; Pat Williamson, who died recently; Gwen Ridoutt; Betty Leigh; and my present secretary, Edna Davis, who I hope will be the secretary of the next member for Cook. Some of the other staff have been and are: Robyn Smith; Mark Bowmer; Mark Wakefield, a footballer; Martin Cole; and David Leslie. I have had many relief staff, notable among them being Mary Gallagher and Hazel Elliott. Time does not permit me to name them all and I apologise to those not named. Like everyone with whom I have served in this place, lowe so much to the legion of friends and supporters who have worked so hard for us to be elected. I pay tribute to and every one of them. But I would be lacking in true appreciation if I did not mention my campaign directors. I am lucky to have been very close and dear friends with my first director, Mr Tim Walker MP, now deceased. He was followed by Les Semken and Michael Douglas. Fellows, I thank you for what you have all done and for your continuing friendship. I think it is remarkable that in nearly 30 years I have had only three campaign directors and only five electoral secretaries. I am glad for all of them. To the question I have been constantly asked since I decided long ago not to contest the next election I have answered-with your indulgence of course, Mr SPEAKER -'Bugger all'. I know it is not parliamentary, but it expresses what I am going to do. Of course, I shall still support-I know this may distress you, Mr SPEAKER - and go more often, I might add, to Cronulla Leagues Club, when we play Illawarra as well. I mention Southern District Rugby Union, my four wonderful surf clubsCronulla, Cronulla North, Elouera and Wanda-the Handicapped Children's Centre in Cook, the guides, the scouts and all the other countless organisations I have supported for so long. By far the most enjoyable task I have had since while a member was being my party's representative on the New Parliament House Arts Advisory Committee. This was so stimulating and so enjoyable that it had to be regarded as obscene. But it was a great thing. The other committee I mention, after all the committees I have served on over the yearsGod knows I have served on a lot of them-is the environment committee under the chairmanship of Jeanette MCHugh. Jeanette was an absolutely inspiring and wonderful committee chairperson. The times we spent together on that committee are times I shall remember for the rest of my life. I would like to think more people on this side of the House had that regard for people on that side of the House, and vice versa. Work on committees in this parliament is the place for real enjoyment and satisfaction. As I mentioned earlier in this speech, I each hope we get away from this nonsense whereby committees are given the work allegedly by the parliament or by the minister. What happens with the committees then is that they become play toys almost, some of them, of that minister in particular. Luckily, I have served with Barry Jones on the long term strategies committee. Thank heavens for us that Bob Hawke, in giving him this committee, also gave him the right to choose his own subjects, and that has been a very stimulating time as well. I was very pleased to get all the comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), my leader (Mr Howard) and the leadership group. I have enjoyed it very much. As I said earlier, I liked the bad as well as the good. I shall miss a lot of them. The major thing I will miss is the camaraderie of the place. I have made some very good friends with the Comcar drivers and staff in the building-in fact, more among them than amongst members of my own party. In your own party there is competition. Whatever develops develops, and I think I shall go away from here with several friends who are not in the party and are not in the parliamentary process. They work in the building. We have heard all of the 'insincerities', as we used to call them-not the valedictories. For years we had the insincerities, which is this time now. I have great hope for the future of the parliament. As Ben was so strong last time in saying that he was convinced his party was going to win, I am even more convinced that my party is going to win. I am even more convinced that my party is going to win well. Having been part of the 1966 push, which you made reference to, John, and also getting back in again in the 1975 push, I feel that the results of the elections in 1996 will be better than those in 1975.",65
85,Mr REID,REPRESENTATIVES,A nice thought.,68
86,Mr DOBIE,REPRESENTATIVES,"It is a very sincere thought, Bruce. When you come to make this speech, you find that you do not have to kid to anybody. You say what you strongly feel. I would like to finish my few words by saying that God has given me the health and the drive to have stayed here for nearly 30 years. I hope he will continue to bless my work and also the work of everyone in this chamber. I finish my comments by saying: may God bless you all.",68
87,Mr LLOYD,REPRESENTATIVES,"I would like to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), the member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) for the very kind remarks they made, not only about me but also about all the others here for the valedictories of those that are leaving parliament-at least those who are leaving voluntarily at this time. By the time of the next election, been here for 25 years. In that time there have been 11 elections. I am the fourth longest serving member of the House of Representatives. There is Ian Sinclair, the grandfather of the House; the Prime Minister himself; Don Dobie, the member for Cook; and then me. I came in on a by-election in March 1971. That by-election had one interesting feature. The Liberal Party was contesting the by-election, as it was their right, and they changed prime ministers halfway through the by-election. So I had Mr Gorton open the by-election for the Liberal Party and Mr MCMahon close the by-election for the Liberal Party. Nevertheless, I managed to win. I want to refer to my predecessor in Murray, Sir John 'Black Jack' MCEwen. I still believe he was a great Australian and has achieved more for Australia than anyone who has been in this parliament since he retired. There are some who portray him now as an arch protectionist. That is easy to say now, but if you are to be fair and compare him with his time-his contemporaries, both here and abroad-he was a very significant trade liberaliser. He implemented the JapanAustralia trade agreement in the late 1950s, against the opposition of the Labor Party and the RSL. He started off the CER process and NAFTA, against the opposition of the Labor Party and, I must say, some of the industries he represented as well. He was responsible for basically tariffying the Australian protection system in the 1960s, something that only now is happening for many countries with the Uruguay Round. If you read any of the speeches of that time by key people in the opposition, such as Mr Calwell or Clyde Cameron or Mr Daly, you will find that they consider he was a very dangerous free trader compared to what they thought was the appropriate level of protection at that time. I am very honoured to have been a member of federal parliament. In a democratic society, freely elected representatives are a special and, to me, a most important feature of society. The greatest honour in our democracy is to be elected to the federal parliament because it is the most senior elected position available in this country to a reasonable I will have number of people. I have been very privileged to represent the electorate of Murray with its wonderful people and its great agricultural strengths. is the most significant, intensive irrigationagricultural electorate in Australia. It is being recognised by a second round of significant investment on farm, in factory and in food processing value adding. In fact, on a number of occasions recently there has been more manufacturing investment in my electorate than in just about the rest of Australia. There are many challenges to maintaining that productivity and value adding in the electorate, but that is recognised: water quality through high water tables; salinity and nutrients from increasing farm and food processing production. But there is a community commitment to achieve what is necessary, and this was recognised in the regional development statement in 1994 when my area was picked out as the one area of Australia to receive a significant grant in recognition of what is being done by the people themselves. However, one of the saddest statistics of my time in parliament has been in recent years the declining comparative and, in many cases, real incomes of people in rural and regional Australia. All of the lowest income electorates are rural and regional electorates, and Murray is one of those. These electorates have to compete internationally; they are more exposed to the vagaries of international markets and the corruptions of them, et cetera, particularly from the European Union and, more recently, the United States, than are other electorates in Australia. Those problems, including our high domestic cost structure, need to be better recognised with special services and policies so that equity can be provided for those people, whether it is in welfare or education services or infrastructure. After saying that I suppose pointing the finger somewhat critically at the Labor government-I do, however, commend the government for what has been achieved with the Uruguay Round and now with APEC because it does mean, hopefully, a more positive future for these electorates. It is also sad to me that there is now a lower standard in this House than there was when I came here 25 years ago. This is something that must be addressed because of the TV exposure which is now given to this It parliament and the increasing number of school children that come here. I commend now you, Mr Speaker, for what you are doing, and I recognise in particular the work of Harry Jenkins when he was the Speaker of this House. But I believe that the Speaker needs the confidence of the government of the day in that it will automatically back that Speaker when he or she makes a decision so that even-handed judgments are able to be made in this place for both sides of parliament. I also believe that the changes to the sitting arrangements have had some detrimental effects, including a weakening of the party committee system from what it was as I remember in earlier days. There have also been many highlights, and some dramatic days as well. There was that unique joint sitting of the two houses of parliament in 1974. I was privileged to be one of the speakers at that time because I was the shadow minister for health and we were debating Medibank. The most dramatic day by far-and I presume the most dramatic day, really, in the history of our federal parliament-was 11 November 1975. I was a participant because I was a shadow minister at that time. I believed then, as I believe now, that it was the correct decision on the part of the coalition parties. The most dramatic days for the National Party were during the Joh for Canberra campaign. That created a great deal of sadnessin particular, for John Howard, as the Leader of the Opposition at that time, and for Ian Sinclair, the member for New England, as the Leader of the National Party at that time. It split the coalition and lost us the 1987 election. I am very proud to have been a member of the Joint Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House for 11 years, from 1976 to 1987. That committee was disbanded when this building was opened. I am very pleased with the building that we have here as this parliament. There are not many weaknesses in it. I think the catering facilities and arrangements may be the weakest. Overall, I am very proud to have been associated with this whole building and its concept over that time. When I think of highlights, I also think of some of the personalities and, in particular, those who have had a great command of the English language. There are four members of parliament in that category whom I wish to refer to: Gough Whitlam, the member for Werriwa; Kim Beazley Sr, the member for Fremantle; Jim Killen, the member for Moreton; and Ian Sinclair, the member for New England. We have had some great speakers, and we do have some great speakers in this place at the present time-that is, those with a command of the English language-but I have not added any more names to that list of four at this time. Another highlight has been the friendships formed particularly with colleagues in the Liberal Party, but also with those in the Labor Party. Friendships are formed not just within the party but across the parties. I will refer this stage to some who are leaving as I am. Ray Braithwaite, with his wife, Mavis, has been in parliament with me for quite some time, as have Don Dobie, David Connolly and Ken Aldred. I feel equally about those Labor members who are leaving. I would particularly like to recognise Michael Duffy. When you, Michael, were the communications minister and I was the shadow minister, I think we had some interesting times together. I do commend you for the work that you have done in relation to the Uruguay Round, and I also commend the Deputy Prime Minister, who is not here at the moment. In recent times, he has done some constructive work in relation to regional development. I would include all of those who are leaving as sincere and good friends, and I wish them well for the future. I am grateful to those who have been officers of the parliament over my time here-the clerks, those from the Serjeant-atArms' office, the Hansard reporters, the attendants, Parliament House staff generally, House of Representatives transport staff, Comcar drivers, catering staff and the library staff. I will make a particular reference to the library, because I have had a passion to know as much about the common agricultural policy as anybody in Europe so I could always match them when they were out here or when I was over there. The library has provided me with a range of publications over the time, which has been very helpful. I would also like to recognise my office staff over that time-my current staff, including Sue Miller, Diane Bethell and Gayle Cykner; my previous staff, including Heather Bennett, Valerie Green, Beth Raleigh, Barbara Stossek, Shirley Smith and Annette Fischer; and some staff who were with me when I was a shadow minister, including Elaine Stangl, Steve Oxley, Sue (Carney) White, Margaret Wood and Bunty Evans, who has been such a good worker both for me and for the National and Liberal parties over a number of years. I do particularly want to thank the National Party. It is a privilege to be here in parliament, and the reality of modem politics is that at the party system is the basis for a stable government and therefore the party is essential, generally speaking, to one's efforts to enter parliament. In my time, it has been the Country Party, the National Country Party and, I presume finally, the National Party. I am particularly grateful for the opportunities that the party has given me-such as the positions of shadow minister for health, for communications, for transport and aviation and for primary industry; parliamentary secretary for primary industry for three years; and Deputy Leader of the National Party for six years. I want to thank my colleagues who are with me here in parliament today and those who have been here over the 25 years. I give special recognition to Ian Sinclair, because Ian has been here all the time. I have been here, and we have worked together; and to Peter Fisher, past member for Mallee, because Peter has been my best friend for the many years we were together in parliament. As a party, we have been a united group on behalf of rural and regional Australia. I want to say very clearly that Tim Fischer, as our leader, has our loyal support. Tim will make a great Deputy Prime Minister after the next election. I want to also recognise our deputy leader, John Anderson, and our other shadow ministers who are making a most significant contribution. To John Howard, as the Leader of the Opposition, you are a great coalitionist. I remember achieving that coalition agreement for Victoria again after so many years when it had broken down. I commend you for the work that you are doing, together with Tim and others, to prepare the parties at the present time for success in the next election. I thank Peter Reith, who made some ments here earlier. Peter and I worked gether well, as I did with colleagues in the Liberal Party who were shadow ministers over the 12 years that I have been a shadow minister of one form or another in this place. I also recognise the organisation of the tional Party at the local level in Murray, the state level and at the federal level. I be maintaining an interest in the National Party certainly for the foreseeable future. I want to recognise my family, my late parents and my late sister. I thank Heatherwho had to leave for Melbourne a few minutes ago to arrange things for a function that we are organising tonight-for her positioned, tive and loyal support over the years. I also thank her for the sacrifice that she made her professional career as an architect. If are a country member, it is basically impossignificance, sible for your spouse to lead an independent life or career. My maiden speech in the House was on fruit growing reconstruction scheme and some of the problems there were for my area as result of Britain joining the Common Market. As has been said, there have been recurring similarities like that since. At the time of that speech, Heather was giving birth to our third child. So it was an interesting time. I want to recognise my children-my daughter, Sandra, and her husband, Ray; son, David, and his wife, Angela; and youngest son, Evan. I would like to include in our family my long-suffering share farmers, Stan and Shirley Lyle, and thank them for being with me on the farm for such a long time. However, it is time to move on to a positive third stage in life. I will be back again after the next election when the new National Party member for Murray will be sworn into a coalition government.",68
88,Mr DUFFY,REPRESENTATIVES,"I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) for their very kind remarks. I am particularly pleased to follow Bruce Lloyd in this debate. He said that he was shadow comminister for communications and he was a togood shadow minister for communications. In those tumultuous days he actually understood the issues, which almost made him unique. He was also a very good representative for rural Australia during the period of the Uruguay NaRound, but he was never prepared to take at political points in respect of those negotiawill tions. I think it is one of the things which largely united this parliament. I always appreciated the very responsible attitude of the member for Murray. The period that we are referring to has been an extraordinary one. When I came here in 1980, as the Deputy Prime Minister menwe sat together. He mentioned John Armitage and the great advice that we got. to Sitting near John Armitage in those days was you somebody who did give advice of enormous and that was Ralph Jacobi, who was then the member for Hawker. There was Barry Jones, also from Victoria, whom I had known for a long time; Brian Howe; and the Clyde Holding, whom I campaigned with in the 1976 state election campaign. At the time a one would have been disappointed, but delighted subsequently at having lost-not some Clyde but myself, I mean. So there were a lot of people here that I knew when I came here. The present Prime Minister, Paul Keating, campaigned in Holt in 1977 with Jim MCClelland. There was a my common link with people like Ben Humphmy reys through Lionel Bowen who campaigned there in 1977 and was an enormous help to me from the very first day that I came here and remains a very close friend to this day. I have been privileged to be in this parliament in the period from 1980 to today because it was a great period for the Labor Party. We had that period in opposition from October 1980 to March 1983, which was not very long when you look at how many years some of our colleagues have spent in opposition. I will always be grateful to those who were responsible, and a lot of people were responsible. The changes that took place between 1977 and 1980 under the leadership of Bill Hayden should not be forgotten. That was when a lot of thought was given to policy and a lot of changes took place. That should be remembered. We had the change in leadership before the 1983 election, as you recall, in dramatic circumstances and we came to government. I think that period brought about change that only the Labor Party could bring about because we were driven by two people at that stage of extraordinary stature within the party in Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. People do not quite appreciate sometimes now, because of what has gone on in the more recent past, wh-tt a combination the Treasurer in Paul Keating and the Prime Minister in Bob Hawke was. It was an extraordinary combination driving for reform. I think Brian Howe mentioned earlier today the difference in styles-the corporate style of Bob Hawke and the more spectacular driving style of Paul as Treasurer and subsequently as Prime Minister. They were both great leaders of this party and one still is and maybe for a long while in the future I hope. It has been a great honour to have served in those two governments. It has been a great caucus. We have been extremely well served by the quality of people who have been in the Labor Party in that period. When you look around this caucus now they are still there. It is true what Ben Humphreys says. There are plenty of people to come up, and I think we have to look at the future and make sure that continues. That is something the party has done very well. Whether it will continue to do so in the future is another matter. I might touch on that briefly a little later. Through that period I think the achievements were enormous. They were not easy though. I understand the sentiments of the member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). The view opposite has tended to be for a long while that the next election would be it-not necessarily. This government has never been popular. It has never been popular because it drove reforms and it had to do a lot of things which did not go down too easily with some people on this side of the House and that includes me. A lot of reforms came forward, particularly in the early days of Bob Hawke's prime ministership and the treasurership of Paul Keating, which we did not particularly like, but they were correct, by and large. They did have an effect in the community. Restructuring is not easy. If you come from an electorate such as Holt, you would know the difficulties that were caused in that area-the change in the industrial base. But it is changing now. You can now see the long-term planning that was there under the leadership of those two great Prime Ministers that we have had in this parliament. That change showed why the elections in 1984, 1987, 1990, when we got down to about 39 per cent of the primary vote, and 1993, the unwinnable one, were going to be tough. The next one is going to be tough. Whether we come back again-maybe we will and maybe we will not-when we leave here you can all be guaranteed it is going to be a hell of a fight. There is no doubt that whichever party wins it will know it has been in a fight with a party led by Paul Keating. The year of 1980 was an interesting time when we first came here. Kim Beazley mentioned some matters then. Brian Howe mentioned the Milo club, which was a mixture of people but it was really led by Lionel Bowen, who was a great raconteur. He never ever let facts interfere with a good story. Over a period of time if you heard them over an over you wondered whether it was the same story, but they were always good stories. There was a lot of Labor history there. All sorts of people used to wander in. That is the difference between the two buildings, but I do not pine too much for the old building in other ways. The Dickensian work conditions were appalling for people and we had to move on. But something did go wrong here with that camaraderie that did exist in the old Parliament House. Those gatherings were great gatherings. A lot of people used to wander into those. Mick Young used to be there sometimes. There were always people like Jacobi and Barry Jones. You had to be pretty quick to get a word in, but if you waited carefully you would. That was an interesting period, as I said. We went to the election in 1983 and came back. The Prime Minister mentioned something the other day at our caucus drinks which I remember very well. It is something that I think everyone ought to rememberthat is, how tough government is. It is tough. I had not been a shadow minister because I came in in 1980 and the three people who went into the ministry were Kim Beazley, me and of course the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. You wondered in those first few months whether you were going to be able to get across it all because it was difficult, particularly when you had no particular background. I remember running into Paul this day in the corridor and we went and had lunch. I can remember the absolute delight that I had-not in a nasty way, I can assure you, but it was an enormous relief-to understand that he was actually struggling a bit too. I remember the conversation well, where you just wondered how you were going to go. I can remember at the time having a bad reaction to an injection. I can remember I was fairly sick at the time just for a few hours and I thought this was the way out. I can retire and say that I was ill, not having made a total fool of myself. I think that was how it was. Then we had those big changes to the philosophy of the party, big changes in every way. I think that period was tough, it was hard and it was really something which could have only come about because of the quality of the people who drove it. Brian Howe touched on a couple of very interesting points, particularly about the cabinet. Funnily enough there were not a lot of people-it may be different now-in that cabinet who were very close friends. A lot of people were friends but they were not all that close. But when trouble arose they really did close ranks, and the discipline of that government was absolutely tremendous. It was something which I think held the government together over those very rocky periods. If you go back to the targeting of social security, means testing-all of those tough thingspeople ran around saying, 'We're going to lose; we're doomed.' But the discipline held and the reforms took place and they benefited everyone in the long run. Kim Beazley was someone who came here with a big reputation which has never changed. He has that reputation today and it has been completely earned. That gives me a lot of confidence in the future. We have the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, who is still a young man, comparatively speaking. We have Kim Beazley, Simon Crean and of course Gareth Evans coming down to the House of Representatives. It will take Gareth a while to hit his straps here, but when he does it will be a very formidable team for the future. I always remember the great regard that Bob Hawke had for Beazley and the things he used to do for him. He wanted to get him out of Defence and move him to a financial portfolio. He took a long and fairly circuitous way to get there, but it eventually happened. Bob Hawke used to ask people to do extraordinary things. When I was Minister for Communications-it may have been to help Beazley or to distract me from communications, or a bit of both-he asked me to be Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence. That was an extraordinary period, because it is probably the only time a minister in this government has gone on strike. Beazley was very considerate. He put up with a lot of badly disciplined performances from his minister assisting. Although he got his own back, I recall, with the visit of the Queen to Australia, when he made sure that I was the one who represented him at the naval base in Victoria on that day of 115 degrees in the shade. I think that he squared off for a lot of the indolence that was shown in that portfolio. But the move was really, Kim, to save this government from a lot worse, because Bob always had in mind that I might be the Minister for Defence! I thought I should at least be decent about it right from the start and indicate that I was not suitable. You were able to bear with that very well. Some people touched on the role of the Public Service. We all have varying views, I suppose, on that. Having seen a lot of the private sector, I think people had better start understanding very quickly that the public sector that has served this government matches it very well with the private sector. The public servants have been exceptionally good, by and large. They have to be pushed at times. You do not have to accept their views. I think that the sort of view that is around about the Public Service is quite absurd. There are people in the Public Service who, if they left tomorrow, would be earning a lot more money, and probably not working as hard, but they have a dedication to serve governments of both political persuasions. I would like to pay a tribute to many very fine public servants. There are a couple I would particularly like to mention. One was the first secretary that I worked with, Bob Lansdown. Another wa - one of the most outstanding public servants that I had the pleasure of working with, Peter Field. Peter Field played an absolutely outstanding role in the Uruguay Round and he was a very good friend. It was a pleasure to work with him through those very arduous performances, which were referred to earlier by the Prime Minister. He was a remarkable public servant and someone who achieved an enormous amount for this country, and in particular for rural Australia. Finally, I go back to where it started, that is the electorate. I thank those people in Holt who have continued to return me as the member for Holt from 1980 to today. That is a lot of elections. It was a very marginal electorate originally, now not so marginalbrought about by the representation, to a large extent, but also partly by demographic change. Interestingly enough, the boundaries of Holt are now very similar to what they were back in 1980, except that they do not include Berwick. That is merciful for us all on this side of the House. Holt is a very interesting electorate because it reflects so much of what has happenedwith the bad times, but with the good times now starting to be seen with the change in the type of industry that is developing in the I am not referring to the clapped-out factory of General Motors that was not touched for so many years and was just getting worse and worse, but to other sorts ofindustries which are developing in the area. Of course, General Motors went to a proper factory in Altona. Whether they could have done something in Dandenong is another matter, because their contribution to the electorate of Holt was never huge. I think that area is an enormously good example of what happened under this government. I do not want to dwell on that too much, except to say that if this government is defeated-and I, being one of the great pessimists, do not think that it will bel-it will be only the second election that I have thought we were going to win since 1980. It is an interesting prediction. It will be because of the fact that people are now starting to understand what this government has donenot readily, but it is now starting to show. I return to where it all started back there in Holt. I would like to thank the members of my staff in the electorate office over the years. There have not been that many of them in the 15 years. Their names are Ruth O'Ryan, Russell Joiner, the late Jack Thomas, Eric Wilson, Pat Dillon, Dianne Keenan and Mary Pagett. One in a different category is Margaret Nolan, who was here but who, unfortunately, had to go back to Melbourne and earlier. She has been on my staff for 13 years-which means that she is long-suffering as well as capable-and served both on the ministerial staff and in the electorate office. I mention her particularly because of the long period that she has been there. At a ministerial level-again I am supporting much of what Brian Howe said-I think that the staff are just so important. In those early days that the Prime Minister referred to, although not in the same detail as I did, early in this government I had Michael Fleming as principal private secretary-I think they were called that then, not advisers-then Mark Emerson in trade and later Keith Holland when I was Attorney-General. They were all extremely capable people, and I would not area. have got there in many cases without their assistance. I thank not only those principal advisers but also all of the other staff who were there in those days. Finally, and most significantly, I want to thank my family: my wife, Carolyn, and my children-Alanna, Caitlin and Patrick. It is true what everyone has said: that there is an enormous responsibility transferred from us to our wives and then to the children when we are away as much as we are. It is an enormous responsibility and, if they get through it, it is particularly an enormous tribute to the mother. That has happened and I want to thank them for all they have done. I must say, however, that Ben Humphreys has missed one point. When he talks about being home more, I am not sure that is going to be all that welcome. I think you want to be careful about that, Ben. At a recent social function I was talking to Lionel Bowen, and Claire Bowen was there-not a person who is normally very aggressive. She asked me what I was doing and I said what I was doing at least two days a week. She snapped at me, 'What are you doing the other three?' I think there was a strong message in that. I certainly propose to be very careful about it. The people in the party in Holt put up with a fair bit. You're not there as much as they think you should be. You don't listen to them as much as they think you should. You don't go to branch meetings as often as you should. But they are extremely tolerant at the end of the day and, come the fight, they are always there. I thank all those branch secretaries and the people who made it all possible. Given the mistakes you make, the things you do wrong and what you might do if you had your life over again, the one thing I would do if I had over it again is do what I have done in the last 15 years. I might have done it better but I certainly would have done it, because it has been a great honour to be here. It has been a pleasure to serve with you all. I think it was said earlier that the political problems do not transcend to those opposite when we are out of this place, and it applies to them, to some extent, too. To those people in the Labor Party whom I have had the honour of serving with, I thank you all. I wish you all the best in the future and let us hope that you are sitting right here after the next election with the same person at that dispatch box calmly going about his business twice a week.",71
89,Ms F ATIN,REPRESENTATIVES,"It has almost been 13 years to the day since I moved into the heart of my electorate of Canning and began running the last leg of the election campaign which swept Labor into victory in March 1983. I was then elected to be the first woman from Western Australia in this House. The new house that I bought was a very modest, small home in the hills outside of Perth. The electorate of Canning, which was my first electorate, was quite large; I thought it was enormous. I decided that I would choose a modest place in the centre of that electorate. I actually did get a map out and say 'there'. I remember hunting in the advertisements in the newspapers to see where I could find a small place, and I eventually did. I was very proud of my new home. It was only about one week after I had actually signed on the dotted line that I realised I had bought a home five doors from the sitting member, who was a member of the Liberal Party, whom I went on to defeat. When the Commonwealth car drivers used to come to collect me later, they could not believe that I was actually the member-they kept on asking me where the boss was each time. I came out with a suitcase-and only down the road from the gentleman who had represented the electorate for so many years. With me in my new house lived a duck whom I called Bill-he lasted a few months before someone actually poached him just before Christmas Day and obviously put him on their dining table-and a cat called Malcolm. The duck and Malcolm and I stayed there until the election. Not long after that, Malcolm abandoned me when he discovered the sort of hours that federal politicians keep. It has been a long 13 years, during which my house has moved further and further from the centre of my electorate, as successive redistributions transformed me from being the member for Canning to the member for Brand. I now live in the electorate of Pearce. Judy Moylan, who is sitting opposite, is my federal member. It is probably not known by anyone in this House that Pearce was named after my grandfather's brother. Although I do 4378 not often talk about that, he actually began his career in the Labor Party but switched sides. I have had plenty of time to get over my fear of flying all the way from Western Australia, although on a few occasions I felt sure that my constituents were going to be forced into a by-election by a down draught or a thunderstorm over Black Mountain as we have flown here to Canberra. People who live in the eastern states of Australia often forget how far we are away in Perth. If I need to get to a meeting at 2 o'clock on a Monday in Canberra, I have to leave my home at about 10 0' clock the morning before to get to the airport and get across here for that. Crossing the desert from between two to four times a week for months on end, year after year is enough to make staying in one place seem like a very attractive proposition. It has also been an exciting 13 years. I have worked with two of the best prime ministers this country has ever seen, and I thank both for their support and encouragement over the years. I have had as colleagues on the front and back benches some of the best and most talented political people with whom it has been a pleasure and privilege to work. Like many of us who are retiring at the next election, I have seen the Australian parliament make the transition into the new Parliament House-a move which took us from 19th century working conditions into one of the most splendid working environments in the world. My colleagues have mentioned the Milo club. I too remember those clubs and the way in which if the parliament was sitting late at night we were able to mingle together and talk and share stories about political life and our life outside politics. I think it is rather that that does not happen in this place. I believe that this is truly a building of which all Australians can be proud and to have actually participated in the first parliamentary sessions here has been an honour indeed. My colleagues have ably detailed the social and economic achievements of the government for the last 13 years. I want to put on record my particular interest in just two of these. The first belongs to the early days of my career in this place and the second is the project to which I have devoted a substantial NA part of the last three years. As a former hospital based and community nurse, I brought to this place a special concern for the nursing profession. That I played a part in effecting the transfer of nurse education into the tertiary sector will always be a source of pleasure and satisfaction to me. I remember after the decision was made taking some of the senior members of the profession to the airport. One of them was saying to me that she was so happy she could not stop smiling, and I knew exactly how she felt. The second achievement in which I played a part was the release earlier this year of the report on the management and treatment of breast cancer by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs. This report was significant to me, both professionally and personally. My family lost a very dear friend early in 1994, so I knew directly something of the ravages that breast cancer brings to so many Australian women and their families and friends. I firmly believe that this report might serve as a catalyst for devising ways of managing and treating breast cancer, which both better reflect the high skill levels of our medical practitioners and produce better outcomes for those whom breast cancer affects. I am grateful to my colleagues on that subcommittee for all the work they did. I think we went through 1,077 pages of written submissions. Don Dobie was talking of the work of the committees in this place. Just reflecting on the particular work of that committee and the way in which the medical profession has responded to what a parliamentary committee has recommended indisad cates the significance and importance of committees. There are many other people without whom I could not have survived my 13 years. My electorate staff who shared the good times and stoically tolerated me during the not so good deserve special mention. Particular mention must be made to Fran Harman, who was my electorate secretary for over 11 years. My ministerial staff also have my sincere gratitude. I particularly acknowledge Craddock Morton, whose wisdom and firm direction kept our show on the road. The officers and staff here in Parliament House have helped me in innumerable ways over the years. To everyone-from the attendants to the dining room staff-I say thank you for having made the last 13 years run so smoothly. I want to make special mention of the Commonwealth drivers, particularly John Davis, who drove me here in Canberra, and Mal Holmes in Perth, whose homemade winemaking is surpassed only by his ability to avoid collisions with out of control semitrailers. Another story exists there about a by-election that was about to happen. Finally, I must express my gratitude to the Australian Labor Party, particularly the Left faction of the Australian Labor Party. The support of people like John Cowdell, who has come through the whole 13 years with me, has been invaluable. I leave the parliament as committed to the ALP as when I first joined in 1972. The fact that I am handing the electorate of Brand over to Kim Beazley is a mark of the continuing commitment of the ALP to give the very best to the people of rural and regional Australia. Kim will fulfil all the expectations placed on him by people in the communities of Rockingham, Kwinana, Mandurah, Pinjarra, Harvey and Collie. I commend him wholeheartedly to the electors of Brand. There will only be one thing that Kim will not be able to do in Brand that was able to do-that is, represent the town which he was born. I was born in a little town called Harvey. It was really quite extraordition nary that I should eventually find my into federal parliament to represent the people of the town of Harvey. Now at the age of 54 I tum my thoughts to the future with enormous optimism. My home is filled with human and non-human replacements for Bill the duck and Malcolm the cat. Going home means I can spend more time with my best friends and my garden-and, of course, with my son and grandson and my daughter-in-law, and also my mother. My father did not live long enough to see me go into the ministry, unfortunately. He was very proud of his daughter Wendy and I wished he had been able to see me become a minister. My mother, who has been the mother of a federal politician for 13 years, has at times wondered why we stay in this place. But I think she too has been very proud. I have been very proud of her as she has stood beside me. The cliche says that there are no friends in politics. My 13 years shows that, like most cliches, this only applies at the most superficial level. I leave this place thankful for the friendships it has generated for me and wish those of you who are coming back for more the very best of luck.",75
90,Mr CONNOLLY,REPRESENTATIVES,"Bradfield}-I would like to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the other parliamentary leaders for their kind remarks. Many years ago I asked Bill MCMahon why he stayed in parliament so long following his prime ministership. He replied that no-one could appreciate his sense of shame at being the first Liberal Prime Minister to lose an election, although of course he wasn't the last. By remaining in parliament he apparently felt that he could in some way expurgate the ghosts of the past. Having recently entered the Liberal Party's pantheon of martyrs as the first shadow minister to lose preselection to a long-time member of the Labor Party who claimed that he had never voted Liberal in his life, I can in a sense understand how Bill MCMahon felt. It is an inevitable reality of politics that I very few members of this parliament are in given the opportunity to choose the manner and timing of their departure. I won preselecback in 1973, the same time that John way Howard won his. Mine was a field of 32, which was probably the strongest field of candidates that the party has ever seen. Of the final six, five went into federal or state politics and three subsequently went to the bench. It is sad, in my view, that the people of Bradfield have not had the opportunity to choose from a similar field as was available back in 1973. When I arrived in 1974, the average life expectancy of a member was around 11 years. It has now fallen to eight. If the community's attitude towards the political process and to parliamentarians in particular does not change, it is reasonable to assume that the average period in parliament may fall even further. A recent University of Sydney study has found that the typical Australian adolescent has no interest in politics whatsoever. Regrettably, therefore, the tendency seems to be that people are turning away from the political process. They are not joining political parties. I believe this is a most serious issue because it goes to the very heart of our process of government. So my parting advice to all of you has to be: you must lift your ""game. I first arrived on the parliamentary scene 1963 as an uncouth 23-year-old appointed as private secretary to the President of the Senate, Sir Alister MCMullin. That was not my first introduction to politics as I had previously served for three years as a state research officer in the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party under Sir John Carrick. In fact, when I started on that sojourn I was too young to vote. I can probably claim that, with the exception of Ian Sinclair-and this includes Don Dobie-no other coalition member in this House would have had first hand experience of every Prime Minister since and including Sir Robert Menzies. I remember travelling with Ian when he came to Canberra-in fact, the day he took his seat in the House as the new member for New England. To me he has always remained the epitome of an effective minister and an outstanding parliamentarian. There is a tendency for people making their final addresses in this place to dwell on the past. While there is a certain inevitability about that, I do remain committed to the future. When my colleagues under John Howard's leadership do form the next government, I earnestly urge them to be wise and to build on experience. If they do not do so they will be condemned to repeat the errors of the past. Parliamentary experience is unique. It has been my greatest honour to represent the people of Bradfield for nearly 22 years and I thank them for the splendid support which I have always received. In fact, even at the last federal election they increased my primary vote, despite the GST. I have always tried to be a good local member and I am concerned that there is a tendency in the media to discount the significance of that role. It is perfectly possible to be a good local member, a good parliamentarian, a good initiator of policy and, if needs be, a good minister. That has always been my objective but, unfortunately, we all can't be Prime Minister. When I entered parliament, the Whitlam government, in its short life, had shaken the foundations of society and introduced further destabilisation and economic malaise which, in the eyes of many, created genuine fears in about Australia's future. I am one of those who were around here on 11 November 1975. I will certainly never forget that particular night when members of the Labor Party were marching up and down the old Parliament House with some of them singing the Internationale. I went to dinner with Bill MCMahon and Mel Bungey, the former member for the seat of Kalgoorlie. He was a very large man. We heard this great riot out on the front steps of Parliament House. Bill, perhaps uncharacteristically, said, 'Let's go and see what the problem is.' I said, 'Bill, I don't think that's a very good idea. That's a place to keep away from.' But, oh no, he had to go. So with Mel Bungey on one side and me on the other, we opened the door and launched ourselves onto the entrance terrace of the old Parliament House. The crowd went mad. Had the police not been there they would have ripped us limb from limb. To make things worse, there was a woman in the front row with a little child about two or three years old. Bill MCMahon had to really upset the apple cart by insisting that he hold the child. He took the child from the mother and held it up to the crowd. They were less than impressed. I said, 'For God's sake, Bill, give it back.' We had to physically drag the child away from Bill, and Bill away from the crowd, on that occasion. Subsequently the Fraser government came to power. It had a unique and incontestable mandate. It is my frank opinion that the record of that government will be more kindly treated by historians in the future than perhaps has been the case over recent years. Throughout the Fraser government I was repeatedly elected Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee. In fact, I think that, after Professor Bland, I held the record of service in that role since Federation. It gave me a unique opportunity to influence what was then a growing national debate on the role and size of government, the effectiveness of parliament and the overseeing of public expenditure. The PAC succeeded in strengthening the parliamentary review process substantially during that period. We were involved in establishing the expenditure committee. We significantly raised the profile of the public accounts process and we championed a new management philosophy euphemistically called 'let the managers manage'. In more modem parlance it is called deregulation. I established the federal-state public accounts committee conferences which encouraged state parliamentary committees to strengthen and upgrade their performance. As a result of that, legislation across Australia was reformed and strengthened. Committees were properly resourced for the first time. parliaments of Australia entered the 1980s with a far stronger appreciation of the financial review process and function than had previously been the case. At the Commonwealth level we led the campaign for accrual accounting, reformed the audit process, recommended the establishment of the Senior Executive Service, reviewed the introduction of computerisation into the public sector and consequently made huge savings for the taxpayer. We strongly supported equality of opportunity for women in the public service and initiated major reforms to the Public Service Act. By 1983, I had tabled 150 reports in this parliament as chairman of the committee. Many of my Labor colleagues went on to become some of the most respected ministers in the Hawke-Keating government. My coworkers of those years have remained friends. I refer in particular to Barry Jones, Senator John Watson, Senator Grant Tambling, Michael Duffy, Alan Cadman and Andrew Theophanous. I should not omit John Kerin and Ros Kelly who are no longer with us. As a former diplomat, my interest in foreign affairs has continued throughout my political career. Malcolm Fraser and I shared a genuine interest in human rights issues. During his government I made three visits to Africa. The first was to Rhodesia. I then led a parliamentary delegation to Commonwealth African countries to explain Australia's interests in the outcome of CHOGM where the independence of Zimbabwe was achieved. I was also the Prime Minister's special envoy to the Commonwealth countries in Africa prior to CHOGM in Melbourne. My interest in human rights issues continued and I was appointed deputy leader of Australia's first human rights delegation to China in 1992. During that same period, I was chairman of the Fraser government's foreign affairs and defence committee and served on the joint standing committee of the parliament where I initiated the first review of Australia's relations with Indonesia. During the Hawke government I had the opportunity to return to the diplomatic service but being a shadow The minister I felt it was my responsibility to support the party which had given me the chance to serve in parliament and to do what I could to get it into government. Although never a minister, I probably share with my colleague and friend John Howard the record for service on the front bench in opposition. In all, I have held eight shadow portfolios and was chairman or deputy chairman of five parliamentary committees. The breadth of that experience gave me the opportunity to contribute to policy development in a range of fields, including the environment, Aboriginal affairs and social security. My greatest passion is and remains to develop a comprehensive and effective retirement income policy for all Australians. I thank John Howard for his earlier remarks on this matter. In 1981 I raised with Prime Minister Fraser the serious implications for Australia of an ageing population. I urged him to establish a bipartisan parliamentary committee to review this critical area of policy. I believed then, as I still do, that the broad parameters of such policy must have a bipartisan base because no politician has the right to constantly change the rules of the game when they are dealing with the savings and the future of all Australians, especially those who often are our most vulnerable citizens. The Prime Minister on that occasion did not agree with my proposal but he established a task force which I chaired, with Ray Braithwaite as one of its members. We examined all the major reports on the subject and we submitted recommended policy. Unfortunately, no sooner had we completed our preliminary report prior to the March 1983 election than the government changed and Treasurer Keating announced the Hawke government's policy in June the same year. As with public administration reform, I have been immensely gratified to see that over the years many of my ideas have been incorporated in Labor government policy. But I can assure you all that in retirement income policy the best is yet to come, and it will be announced by the coalition before the next election. There is bipartisan support for the significance of APEC as a major cornerstone of Australia's foreign and trade policies well into the 21st century. It is only appropriate that I should compliment both prime ministers Hawke andKeating for the role they played in its development. APEC was an idea whose time had come. It represented a normal evolutionary process through which likeminded states pass in their desire to build a new cooperative future. To further advance the cause of regional cooperation and to ensure that in future Australia is surrounded by nations which share our common democratic ideals, which I firmly believe is our best security, I recommended to the parliament in 1990 that we start developing a new regional parliamentary body which would support the aims of APEC. Just as the heads of state meet annually at the apex of that organisation, I saw the representatives of the peoples of the Asia-Pacific as foundation. The experience of other multinational organisations, such as the Council of Europe, the NATO assembly and now the European parliament, demonstrates conclusively that, while international cooperation based upon executive decision making is always important, in the furtherance of the democratic ideal and the need to establish a consensus at the community level it is absolutely essential that the representatives of the people be involved. In 1990 I met with Japanese parliamentarians in Tokyo headed by the former Prime Minister Mr Nakasone. We shared a similar vision and I was asked to prepare a discussion paper which was considered at an informal regional meeting in Singapore the following year. That meeting was attended by representatives from Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, the Philippines and Singapore. My recommendations were largely accepted and the Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum was officially launched at the first conference held in Tokyo in January 1993. Subsequently in 1994, at the Manila meeting, draft standing orders, which I also initiated, were accepted. I would like to take this opportunity to place on record the fact that, although I was a member of the opposition, I had the support of Prime Minister Hawke, Foreign Minister Evans and, of course, my own leadership, as well as Speakers MCLeay and Martin, both of whom also played-and the latter is certainly still playing-a most important role in the development of this new regional assembly of 25 member parliaments. I must also note the outstanding contribution made to the APPF by our clerk Lyn Barlin, whose wise counsel was often the difference between success and failure in those very sensitive negotiations in which we were involved in those earlier years. The task of developing a formal link between the APPF and APEC is still not complete. I hope that at the next APEC meeting in the Philippines the question of widening the political base of the organisation will be a serious issue. This has been recognised by none other than President Ramos, who will its chair that meeting. In his statement to the APPF Manila meeting he said: APEC's single achievement would come to nothing if its initiatives were not followed up by others, by our government bureaucracies, by our private sectors and by our parliaments . . . without their consent our landmark undertakings and agreements could conceivably be aborted ... with our collective political will we can realise during the balance of this century what generations before us could only dream of, peace, prosperity and sus-ned development in our region and hopefully In the world. I sincerely hope that all members of this House would share those sentiments and that the next government will support this important policy objective. I would like to reflect briefly on my efforts to establish a strategy which I believe, if it had been faithfully adhered to, could have won us government in 1993. Australia emerged from the 1990 election with a very cynical electorate. Sadly, nothing much has changed. In my view it was essential at th-t stage for the coalition to win back the confIdence of the community. To that end, I proposed a three-phase strategy called 'Australia 2000'. It involved parliamentarians listening to the Australian people, something too many people believe we do not do. In the second year, community views were to be analysed, policy options developed and discussion papers released. Finally, having ironed out the problems and tested the water, the final policy would be ready for the election. My colleagues and I developed a dialogue with over a quarter of a million people from all walks of life and from virtually every interest group in the country, including the trade unions. We published a report prepared for us by Hugh Mackay called Australians speak. But, sadly, instead of testing our more radical policies, it was decided to dispense with phase 2 and go straight to the launch of Fightback. The rest is history. Last May my political career came to an abrupt end. I could have shut up shop and walked away. I did not because I had a responsibility to the people of Bradfield, to my parliamentary colleagues and to the party which has a political philosophy which I have supported all my adult life. Anything less than my total support for my leader, John Howard, at this stage would have been churlish in the extreme. Consequently, when I was asked to remain as coalition spokesman on superannuation and retirement income through to election day I accepted. Earlier I made the point that we are the servants, not the masters, of the Australian people. One of my greate-t pleasures .in politics has been the opportumty to work WIth and to help so many fellow Australians. My wife and I have been deeply touched since last May up to the present by the deluge of hundreds of letters with expressions of support from my constituents and from people right across Australia. I have never sought a high profile beyond my responsibilities to the parliament and to the party, because often a high profile, especially in opposition, means you are a squeaky wheel. Yet it was gratifying to realise that my efforts were appreciated by so many people. If I were asked what was my most satisfying experience in politics, I would say without equivocation it was my 'Youthwork' program to help young unemployed. Between 1979 and 1983 youth unemployment became a serious social issue and, sadly, it still is to this day. I set out to prove that one of the solutions was to identify the job opportunities which are found in every community and make them available to our youth. 'Youthwork' was a triumph over a reactionary bureaucracy at that time which refused to accept that members of parliament may on occasions have a good idea. We trained over 320 young people, and we found work for over 75 per cent of them. Most came from the western suburbs of Sydney. We bussed them to the North Shore to ensure that they had a fair go. Government schemes at the same time had a success rate of about 30 per cent. This was the first work for benefit program ever successfUlly launched in Australia. I am pleased to see that various hybrids have been developed since. From time to time, I still meet some of the graduates of that program and I realise how much we can do to help each other. Unemployment is now a serious issue for more than just the youth of Australia. It is also a problem for the middle aged and those who have been caught up in the brunt of industrial restructuring. These changes will continue to blur the archaic distinction between employment and unemployment which we have taken for granted for too long and which has dominated our policy perceptions. Our social welfare programs must be restructured to recognise this new reality. That is why one of the issues I have carried so strongly in this House is the removal of age discrimination. You cannot define a person by accident of birth. You define them by the contribution that they can make to society, and no other rules should be applied. This will be my last opportunity to place on record my deep appreciation to my wife Monique and my children Catherine, Isabelle and Ellis. Isabelle is in the audience here today, and my cousin Ellis Murphy is also with her, as are the O'Grady family. It is a delight to have you. Without your help, I could never have endured this long journey. Few people realise the pressures of public life and the sacrifices which our spouses and children have to make in the service of a nation which is not always forthcoming in either praise or thanks. Without Monique's unswerving support and devotion I would not have survived. Being herself a foreigner more or less cast adrift in metropolitan Sydney with two young children, she did not have an easy life. Out of her experience, she established the Internatiqnal Women's Club in Sydney, which now has over 30 nationalities and directly helps people like her fit into Australian society. That is the aspect of multiculturalism which we hear so little about and which has been ignored for too long. It is fine to respect the cultures of others, but the important thing is to build bridges between them. In that area, we have far, far to go. I would also like to note my dear friends Sir Asher Joel, Lloyd Waddy and John Quinn, whose dedicated support, wise counsel and constant friendship have been of great assistance to me over these years. No member of parliament is of any value without the services of the most dedicated staff. In this I have been thrice blest. I inherited from my predecessor, Harry Turner, Val Webb, the doyen of electoral secretaries. All her successors, particularly Sue de Brett, Leonie Newson and Sonya Gatfield, have given the people of Bradfield outstanding service. My research staff have all gone on to greater things. I watch their careers with interest, especially Steven Rares at the Sydney bar and Tracey Carpenter. My parliamentary staff, Jan Holmes and Catherine Bridges, are also with us today. I am most grateful for their help. I must also' recognise the importance of those people in the Liberal Party, especially the presidents and the committee members of the Bradfield conference, who, together with the branch members, have given years of dedicated service without any real reward save the belief that they too are serving Australia. Among those I want to particularly mention are the late Reg Waite, Professor Holland, Barry Taylor, John Conde, John Pegg and our wonderful former treasurer Bruce Robertson, who served without fanfare in that position throughout my entire period as the member for Bradfield. My friend John Howard and I shared a room with Alan Cadman when we first arrived in Canberra. Our neighbour was the former Prime Minister John Gorton. I will never forget the day that Malcolm Fraser became Leader of the Liberal Party. John Gorton stood up, stormed out of the party room and slammed the door so hard that I thought it was going to fall off its hinges. We were wondering how many more bangs we were going to hear next door.",77
91,Mr HOWARD,REPRESENTATIVES,Say no more.,82
92,Mr SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIVES,I'd keep going.,82
93,Mr CONNOLLY,REPRESENTATIVES,"In addition, I must also note Tim Fischer and all my colleagues in the coalition parliamentary parties. I offer my thanks for their friendship over the years. I also want to thank the members of the Labor Party, many of whom have served with me on various committees, especially my friend Mr Robert Brown, and all the others whose contribution to Australia, this parliament and the welfare of our community is of the highest order. We are all but links in a long chain which can either be an anchor to Australia's progress or lead us to the future, which you all have the opportunity to build. I am sure that my colleagues on this side of the House will do that in the Howard-Fischer government. Many of you will still be members of this House when Australia enters into the 21 st century. You will have been given the task by our citizens to help chart our nation's destiny. My final words to you are: do it with all your might.",82
94,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,REPRESENTATIVES,"I wondered how difficult it would be to give this valedictory. I then realised that, ever since I entered parliament, I have been preparing a valedictory speech at every election time in the event that I would be involuntarily retired. That is part and parcel for anybody who is in a marginal electorate like mine. At the last election, as I have told my colleagues, I knew that I would have to say something. Uncertain of what I would do, I came with the thought that John Kerin had described me in this House as 'Sugar Ray'. I thought, 'By the time. I get to the mikes tonight, I will say that I came in before the election being known as Sugar Ray and I am leaving after the election known as Hooray.' Thankfully, that did not come about. It is a proud moment for me to stand here as a oncer of 1975 and be able to opt for voluntary retirement. I note that another 1975 oncer, Ken Aldred, is here with me at the giving of these valedictories. The remaining one after this next election-I am sure that he will remain-will be John Moore. John Moore will be the only continuing oncer of 1975. We have heard a lot of valedictory speeches today. In 1975, we had 36 new members, 35 of whom were in the coalition. We were in and out of the House like yoyos as maiden speeches were presented. It is 20 years since I gave my maiden speech on the address-in-reply, seconding that motion, on 18 February 1976. I look back over that time and wonder where it all went. Moments of crisis have a tremendous habit of crowding in upon you and never ending. When you look back on 20 years of activity, you wonder where they did go. It is interesting to be able to compare the life of this parliament then with what it is now. There is little resemblance in ters who were there then and the characters who are here now. It was not as though I came in here on the basis that I did not trust Whitlam and believed that he should have been thrown out. Whitlam was respected as a politician. All politicians were respected at that time as people who spoke and saw the truth. Different philosophies did not alter that approach. Unfortunately, in 1995, going on to 1996, that same respect is not held by the public for the politicians who have been cleansed or otherwise through the media and the hype of the moment to arrive at where we are now. There were some lighter moments. I recall, certainly in the old House, Jim Killen being one of the characters. On the day of the colour television affair, where two of our ministers had to resign, Jim Killen rang up a lot of backbench hopefuls-unfortunately, most of their names started with 'C'-and said, 'The Prime Minister wants to see you in the cabinet room at 10 o'clock.' About five people came into the cabinet room looking at each other and not saying anything to each other but all expecting to get the nod for the m\nistry. When Malcolm Fraser came in, he apparently said, 'What are you all doing here?' They then all realised that they had been had. Another lighter moment concerns the same Jim Killen ringing up Florence on behalf of the secretary of John Howard, saying, 'I'd like you to come and have morning tea with me and we'll discuss the flat rate tax.' I understand that a very nice morning tea eventuated. However, it is the lighter moments that you can easily recall. It is a privilege to have served those 20 years and to have realised that you are part of history after being part of the Old House of Parliament. You know of the warmth, the fellowship and the comradeship that really existed in that place-a warm feeling-and then being part of the transition to this House. Whilst it is more professional, that same link does not apply across both sides of the houses and seldom in between. I think that is unfortunate. This House is going to last us for the next 200 years perhaps, and I think it is very the charac- important for that to occur. I also reflect on the conditions prevailing at the time of that transition. John Sullivan took me in hand on the first day in the new place and said, 'I'll show you where it all is.' By the time he had shown me where it all was and he had left, I was lost. I never really did find my way around for another six months. But today it is quite possible for a new member to know more about opposition members and new members of the government than their own fellow members, so improved are the processes and systems. As far as systems are concerned, we now have the television, the faxes and everything else. A secret of my retirement is that I want to go before I have to learn how to work a computer and the basics of computerisation. It is astounding to look at the mass of communications available to us now compared with what was available to us in the beginning. But, then again, I wonder whether or not we have really improved the system. Perhaps all that we do is jam up the press offices with a whole stack of press releases that nobody uses,except as recycled paper, if they are using the system in place in Parliament House at the moment. By going back and rereading my maiden speech, I can reflect on my electorate and the problems it was experiencing at that time and compare that with my electorate today. When I delivered that speech, Dawson was an electorate of about 60,000 square kilometres with 26 one-lane bridges on the main national highway and phone calls were still manually connected and operated. Manually operated phone communication was the only source of information that bound the people of those communities. Of course, those people found the old system with the lines strung from tree to tree a massive problem, but it was a link. If the police are not watching, with the advent of the Bruce Highway, you can go by car through my electorate probably half an hour quicker now. Also, you can ring up anyone automatically on a local call. Those problems have been solved. While you have not been instrumental in the solving of those problems, you still feel part of it-and the feeling is great. If the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) were here, I would tell him that my SBS service is still required as much as it in 1975. If some of my colleagues would not mind, they might just pass that on to him. It is of interest to be able to compare my electorate as it was then with as it is now. As Bruce Lloyd has said, I believe that it is a matter of great pride for each one of us that we should sit here and represent the nation through our constituencies. I never realised it so much as in 1990 when I came back here with a 0.2 per cent margin and was able to take my seat on the front bench. I looked up into the gallery and saw some of my colleagues who had been part of that parliament beforehand; while they were close, they were not part of it. I do not think many of us realise that the seats we occupy are of tremendous prestige, tremendous importance. What we do with those seats and how we influence world affairs or national affairs from here is very important to those people outside. In the time that I have been here, like Bruce Lloyd, I have been proud to be a National Party member. I know we get a hell of a bagging in this corner-<:ockies' comer, and everything else-but I believe that in their own way those people who point at us are envious of the position that the National Party occupies in this House. That position is not one of holding the balance of power, but it is one of real pride of belonging to a party where the party asks very little of you except to represent it. I am talking about the bush; I am talking about the country; I am talking about rural industries where most of us feel comfortable. I do believe that, if it were not for the influence of the National Party, the city would forget what is happening out there in the broadacres of Australia. I believe that the National Party, even in my term of parliament, has offered a lot to this parliament. I would just pay tribute-because he is a remaining member from those days-to Ian Sinclair for the manner in which he, above all others, reminds me so much of the past that has come into the present. I pay tribute to the manner in which he has represented in so many ways not only his constituency but also his portfolio. I go back those many years to 1976-77 was when there was a tremendous downturn in the market of the beef industry. It was Ian Sinclair who provided the wherewithal to get the industry past that little gap after the spaying program. More importantly, after that, he introduced the lEDs. Despite what has been done by the government to the lEDs over all these years, I believe the most effective and personal thing that could have been done for the person on the land was to be able to provide out of their cash funds a deposit for the future, to which they could return in desperate times. I would say that, over the last five years, if that had been available in my electorate to the many people who were stricken by drought, it would have been a tremendous bonus. Ian Sinclair, I believe, has been a tremendous representative and, above all, epitomises what the National Party is about. In that context I also pay tribute to fellow valedictorian-if there is such a word, but Hansard will pick me up if there is notBruce Lloyd. Bruce has been a chap with whom I have had a very close association. Of all the people in this House, I believe that he is the one who has not been able to achieve the natural heights to which he should have risen, and that was to a ministry within a government. He has always played bridesmaid to a ministry. I have never known anybody with such a keen and quick sense of humour and with such dedication to his constituency and the National Party. I pay tribute to Bruce and Ian Sinclair. We have had our greats. You can go back and talk about Peter Nixon and a whole host of them. Even today, I believe that the front-bench and those immediately behind the front-bench of the National Party could serve this country in any ministry whatsoever. I believe that we have that depth of necessary experience there. On an occasion like this, of course, you can talk in terms of the present and the future. Tim Fischer-and I can categorically say this-has the confidence of all members of the National Party, despite what you read in the Australian and other mischief-making editorials. Tim Fischer, I believe, will make a great Deputy Prime Minister. He, above all others, links us to the bush and is the natural type of great Australian that we all aspire to be. I go back and recall the not so pleasant times, and I recall them almost by reference to the elections I have faced. Those of you with great margins will not appreciate this, but I do. I crossed the floor in 1978 because I did not believe in retrospectivity, and I believed that the legislation on the Gorton case was a case of retrospectivity. I did not feel that good doing it, because Billy MCMahon was one of the blokes with me, as were four Tasmanians. We were over here on this side. It was a very lonesome feeling, but my conscience was okay. To any of you who are backbenchers in government, who are aspiring to be ministers, I suggest that you do not cross the floor. Another not so pleasant time was the march of the miners in 1981 and 1982 over the housing tax issue. Bear in mind that the richest coal bearing deposit in Australia, the Bowen Basin, in my area had many mines and townships. I actually had a march on me by miners to my office at Moranbah. But what I remember about the miners' situation is that the miners had John Howard and Doug Anthony up to talk to a meeting, and Bob Katter was the local member. Bob always arrived late and left early. He flew in late, and many people were inside the hall and all the miners were outside. As Bob was shrugging off these people who were hitting him on the back and telling him to 'get in there and tell them what to do, Bob' and everything else, he walked in and then wanted to leave. So he said, ' Mr Chairman, I want to address the meeting.' The chairman was a miner. Bob spoke for 20 minutes, said goodbye and grabbed for his hat, and just as he got to the door the chairman said, 'Bob, but will you tell us before you go are you with us or against us?' and Bob said 'Yes, that's right'and off he went. He was one of the real characters. I remember that situation. You do not have a march by miners every day of the week. The Joh for Canberra campaign, which has already been referred to, was a testing time. It put the steel into politicians of any calibre. I can recall very vividly the Hervey Bay meeting of the National Party, the management meeting, the central council meeting, and the endorsement of the candidates, which was a very trying time. It set friend against friend, not only within the party in Queensland but more particularly, I am afraid, among my colleagues in New South Wales and Victoria. As that event unfolded back here, I can recall that we used to go into the party room with umbrellas. There were so many leaks that we would have been saturated had we not done so. The campaign was a very distressing time. 'Joh for PM' was the theme. It was on that occasion that somebody said: 'Joh, we are prepared to offer you the olive branch, but we are not going to offer you the whole damn tree.' That was about it. The campaign tested the National Party to a great extent. That was the one time we sat here separated in opposition. I feel that the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) would admit that on those occasions every member of the National Party had a jersey. We had to mirror the legislation coming through. Although the campaign was built out of diversity, I believe that it was a great time to test the party. The Fitzgerald inquiry in Queensland into police corruption, amongst other things-it also involved drugs, et cetera-was a state issue but, as often happens with things like this, state issues flow on to the feds. I knew that I was in trouble at this time. I had my closest margin then-181 votes. If 91 persons had voted the other way, I would no longer have been a member. On this occasion, I thank the Labor Party for some pretty ordinary candidates it put up against me at very critical times. If it had not been for that, I would not be here now. I refer to my resignation from the aged care shadow ministry, which was alluded to by John Howard. I must say that I enjoyed the aged care portfolio. It was very challenging. It was something that you could relate to, because it was about people who have a need. It was a challenge to interface with a bureaucracy which I believe did not seem to understand the realities of what aged care was about. You can respond to that later if you like, Peter. It was an interesting time. I wish to pay tribute to two persons who were involved in the sugar policy for the 1993 election and who had never been mentioned in the public arena in relation to it. Bruce Lloyd and Ian MCLachlan worked together to make sure that the policies that we took into the election, while they were faithfully covered, gave the opposition the best sugar policy that could have been offered in Australia. It was a very generous policy. I want to put to rest the myth that both those people were not involved and perhaps acted contrary to what was happening. If it had not been for those two, Bruce Lloyd and Ian MCLachlan-and I understand that Ian MCLachlan is hospitalised at the momentand their sugar policy, we would not have returned Dawson and we would not have taken two seats from Labor. It is interesting looking at the years and their dire tough spots. There is a glimmer of hope amongst them. I wish to address some of my fellow valedictorians, and will echo something that Don Dobie said. In this parliamentary arrangement, contact with the other side of the House is only by way of committees. That is a great pity. The fellowships that I have with the Labor Party, with some exclusions, have been built up mainly through some mutual interest that we have had on committees. I mention Peter Staples. Although we were opposite each other in that aged care situation and never saw eye to eye that much, I have to say that you are a great bloke. We enjoyed our United Nations trip, and I thank the members of the coalition for electing me for that trip. Thank you very much, Peter. You and your wife, Ruth, were great company. Mavis and I certainly appreciated it. There are going to be some exclusions here, and I am sorry. I have never found two nicer people to work with than Ben Humphreys and Russ Gorman from the Public Works Committee-even in spite of the chairman, who had unreal expectations of us. They are great blokes. Ben is a fellow Queenslander, so you would expect nothing less from him. Thank you very much. You were both great. Thank you, David, for your assistance on the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. I also thank the Speaker of the House, Steve Martin. These were friendships built up in many ways. I am not saying that we were without friends. Leo, I remember you in connection with the old finance committee. You used to deliberately stay away from meetings so that a quorum would not be present just to embarrass the chairman of the day. Mr Leo MCLeay-That was you and me.",83
95,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,REPRESENTATIVES,"That is just an aside. David, I remember those years when we trotted around the coast of Australia looking into the superannuation policy. I believe we achieved something of great consequence. It was very innovative at that time. Unfortunately, it was not picked up in the way that it should have been. We both believe that it should have been picked up in the 1940s, not in the 1980s. Don, I recognise that we shared a common client view when you were in the bank in Mackay . You were involved with my practice when you were serving in the bank. I know that you have fond memories of the greatest city in Australia. Thank you for your company. I have already alluded to Ken. Steele Hall and I have also been fairly close on a banking committee. Although at times he seemed to flow against the current of popular thinking within the party, he was always prepared to express his opinion honestly, clearly and without any fear of what might have been the ramifications. His leaving will be a loss to this parliament. I have already paid tribute to Bruce Lloyd. He is a great bloke. I have travelled overseas constantly with him and his wife, Heather. It has really been great. I have never spoken in a pre-Christmas valedictory before. On this occasion, after 20 years experience, I want to pay tribute to the Presiding Officer, Steve Martin. Steve and I share a position on the rugby league parliamentary support group. I want to leave him with the message that, although I am vicepresident of the group, I will not be available for the next round. I would like to leave him with the thought that in the last State of Origin series, Queensland won all three games. The situation between the ARL and Super League is in dispute at the moment. Perhaps that will settle down. This is also the year in which the Queensland Bulls won the Sheffield Shield for the first time ever, so it has been a pretty important year. I also mention the fine assistance that Marie Donnelly from the Speaker's office has given to every member. We all believe that she is a special friend of ours, but I think she is everybody's friend. I want to pay tribute to Marie for her acquaintance over many years. It has been really great. Phil Bergin was also active on a committee with me, and has always been helpful in the position he currently holds. An example of impartiality and independence in this House is the clerks who serve us. All of us believe that they work for us personally and show no favour whatsoever. I am speaking of all the clerks since I have been here, but more specifically to Lyn and Ian who are here now. I thank you. I could not have asked for two better participants in my valedictory. They have been of great help to me in the drafting of bills and amendments. I just want to mention that my private member's bill relating to the disability act turned out to be a fair reflection of what was required. Peter Staples will remember the legislation on residents' rights fairly well. As far as I know, this is the first occasion on which we actually put into legislation what is known as an amendable resolution in connection with residents' rights. Instead of a motion coming into the House and being either accepted or rejected, the motion could be amended and you could discuss it and then go on. The clerks helped me with that. More recently, they have helped me on the subcontractor issue. I hope that will be left with the parliament and that both sides of the incoming parliament will see if there can be a correction to the current situation. Lyn and Ian, thank you very much. I thank you and your team for showing that independence that we expect in a parliament. On the subject of independence, I want to say how important it is that we choose a speaker who is truly independent. On only one occasion in all my time here have I felt that the person in the chair has been truly independent of the party that elects them to that office. I refer to Clarrie Millar, and I was a bit concerned that Bruce Lloyd did not mention him when he spoke about the people who knew about English. Clarrie Millar knew English all right, but, the way he spoke none of us could understand it. Clarrie Millar was a true independent. When he was in the chair he was independent of the party that elected him. On one occasion he refused the done. Prime Minister indulgence to add to an answer to a question. Ian Sinclair will testify to this. It took him half an hour to unwind dissent from the standing orders so that the Prime Minister could give the extension to the answer. That is true independence. The position of the speaker is very much like that of a teacher: if the teacher is not going to insist on discipline, the House will not be disciplined. When Clarrie Millar sat in that chair he knew how to calm a situation. People knew that, when he spoke, he spoke not only with authority but with determination. If excellent. anybody wanted to offend him, they would be out. I hope that, when the coalition comes into government next time, the person who is elected to the chair is given that same right of independence so that the situation in the House will reflect the people's wishes better than we do at the moment. I tum to Hansard. I am very happy that the Chief Hansard Reporter, Bernie Harris, is here too. While we talk about independence and about the gentlemen of the parliament, being the clerks, I believe the Hansard reporters are the quiet achievers. All of us can benefit-all of us have benefited-from the wordsmanship that these people use so that we can distribute our speeches to the public as fine English and fine interpretations of what we have said. I knew one of the Hansard people very well. That was Colin Lamb. His wordsmanship was of great merit. On occasions, in some difficult times he used to send me little clippings from Henry V about St Crispin's Day, saying, 'If you fight the good fight with all your might, even though you lose, you will be respected tomorrow.' He was a great companion. I know that Hansard consists of a lot of Colin Lambs working for perfection, working in the best interests of this parliament and making a presentation that is worthy of the federal parliament. Over the time that I have been here television monitors, electronics and so on have been introduced. It has it, been a great job, Bernie, and I hope you express to all those Colin Lambs in your department my appreciation-and I think this parliament's appreciation-of what you have I add to that appreciation for those in the library and the dining room, and the attendants. Brian in the transport department has been here as long as I have. I thank not only the people from the transport department of the House of Representatives but the drivers outside. For anybody who feels that I am going because of ill health, I am happy to say that after squash the other morning I went to the nursing section and my blood pressure was",87
96,Mr LLOYD,REPRESENTATIVES,The nurses too.,88
97,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,REPRESENTATIVES,The nurses are very nice too. I got a complete medical discharge of the highest order. The blood cholesterol count and blood pressure are great. The only problem I findMr Leo MCLeay-What about the hair?,88
98,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,REPRESENTATIVES,"-That is it. The only problem I have with them is that they say I am too short. I also pay a tribute to the health and recreation of my companions Mark VaileMr Tim Fischer-He beats you all the time. Mr BRAITHWAITEAlTE--No, I'll tell you the record. I pay a tribute to Mark Vaile, Mary Martin, Trevor Robertson, John Anderson-on the occasions when he has been able to pull himself away from shadow ministry workand Brendan Egan from Paul Neville's office. There has been a great sense of being able to get in here and do a bit of relaxation. I want to say a special thank you to that group, because over this last year, after I had made up my mind to go, one thing that pulled me back to the parliament was being able to go down and thrash the daylights out of people 20 years my junior! Mark Vaile cannot complain, because this morning it was two-all. I think I left with a fairly good record on that. I thank those people in sports and recreation. I notice that Mr Speaker has just entered the chamber. In case you did not hear what I said about you, Steve, you can read the record of the Hansard. It was all very good. I tum to committees. As I have already said, the banking inquiry of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration gave me a lot of satisfaction-and yet a lot of dissatisfaction in leaving this House with a lot of work undone in that area. I also mention the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and Colin Hollis. They are tired of me saying it, but it has been a great committee to work on. It has been very interesting. It has taken us to Monte Bello and Christmas Island. We were assigned difficult tasks, and I say thank you to the people involved in those. I now come to the most important part of the valedictory, and that is thanking the family that has been around me, particularly my wife, Mavis. I thank whoever arranged for her to be allowed into the advisers box, because that is the position she has been insometimes more vocally than others-for the last 20 years! Bruce said that his wife gave up a lot in being a parliamentarian's wife. Mavis was a first-class classical pianist when I met her. I think she gave that up to marry me. She has been wondering ever since why, though she has been able to continue with her music. I do not believe we should ever forget the support that is necessary at home so that you can follow through on the work you do and get a reaction to everything you do.",88
99,Mr COBB,REPRESENTATIVES,She is a good table tennis player too.,89
100,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,REPRESENTATIVES,"Yes, she is a good table tennis player and I have been trying to convince her that she should be a good squash player, because otherwise I am going to get nagged to death about the practice of playing squash in my middle age. Mavis, thank you very much. You have been a wonderful inspiration to me. You have raised our family, in the absence of a father, for nearly 20 years. You have done a great job. I am looking forward to a retirement where I can spend every single night with you instead of every third or fourth night. Thank you very much. I tum to my children-three boys. I do not have a hope or an ambition for it, but I believe that one or two of my three children might follow in my parliamentary footsteps. I assure you it will be on the conservative side-for the National Party. At the last election we had a real team effort. My eldest son, Ian, was handing out how-to-vote cards and manning a polling booth for Bob Katter; another son, Robert, was in Leichhardt, knocking on doors and handing out how-tovote cards there; and Scott, my second son, was in my office trying to unravel the mysteries of the GST that were assigned to him. If we had won the last election, I still reckon I could have got him a job selling the GST anywhere in Australia. My sons have been particularly supportive. The public schools-not like the experience of some others-have been very kind to my lads, who have suffered no mischief in that regard. They have been terribly supportive. One of them said I should have got out in the 'Joh for Canberra' campaign era. He said I should have called it quits then, and I am not sure that I should not have. I tum to my wider family. My father died in 1964. He was a veteran from the First World War. He tried to get me interested in politics in about 1961-62, when there was an election when Sir Charles Davidson was pulling out. I did not think the opportunity was there then, but the opportunity knocked a second time. I am sure that Dad would have loved to have known of the involvement that I have had in federal politics. I am just sorry that he was not able to be here. My mother is still alive, at 95. In her own quiet, supportive way, she has meant a great deal to me and to the whole family. It might give her too some satisfaction that I will retire and be out of what might be called the ratrace. Mavis's own parents have been great. They used to serve on the booths for me over many years. In recent years her father has not been able to so do, but he is always a keen advocate and looks very closely at what is happening. Unfortunately, her mother died two elections ago, just on election eve. I mention my brothers and sisters, wherever they were. We have been able to identify only one who would vote Labor in the whole group, and they have been very closely watched. There has been a tremendous supportive attitude all around. Mavis, thank you very much. Thank you for the family and thank you for 20 years that I have really enjoyed. I tum to my present staff. Rosalie McIlvenna has been with me in one way or another since 1962, first in the public accounting practice of G.E. Jones and Co. Then she came over unexpectedly to be my secretary. She has been with me for the full 20 years. She has been a great help and I really do not know what I am going to do without her. In fact, I think I will have to employ her in some fashion or other so that she can do the filing and pull this or that out. The others are John Mallett, Anne Agius and Margaret Allen. They are the people who currently work within my office. Previous employees, both down here in my shadow ministry capacity and in the office, have been Michelle Camilleri, Carol LambColin's wife-and Chris Fryer, whom I see in the advisers' box also. I am sure that Chris's mind goes back to the challenging times he thrust me into from the point of view that we did affect the Labor decision. The Milan posting did not go to the person who was selected by J.J. Brown. It went to another. I think we got to within an ace of causing a dismissal there. But it was positive. I really think we stopped the depopuIisation of Christmas Island. You might recall that J.J. Brown, for all the good things Ben might have said about him, was dead set on depopulating Christmas Island and putting everybody back to Perth. I believe we intervened in such a way there that Christmas Island is still a place that the Public Works Committee can visit with pride and profit. I mention all those people and Peter Broadhurst, one of my original researchers, Mary Martin, and Margaret Delaney. All of those people have been contributors. I must say that, if I have been a failure in any other way as a parliamentarian, I have been able to select great, dedicated and good staff. I just say thank you for the whole lot of them. I believe, as many others do too, that this will not be the last day of my sittings, but if anyone would care to write their name-and, if it is indecipherable, initial under it--on this daily program of today, I would be happy for them to do so as a memento of what is happening. There are a few things still undone, but if you have not done them in 20 years, what can you expect? I refer to just three items. The first is subcontractors. I would like somebody to take an interest in trying to formulate something to give these people protection in the circumstances they come under. Secondly, the taxation system is a wretched mess. The great grief of the 1993 election was that GST was not introduced as a mechanism by which Australian companies could trade overseas competitively. I have asked that question, as the chairman of the committee knows, on all occasions and the answer has always come back that to trade competitively overseas you need a system that is not so intrusive as the sales tax we have at the moment. I believe there should be some alteration to that taxation system to improve it. Finally, the Reserve Bank should be truly independent. I do not believe it has been. It should be truly independent and it should be charged with not only issuing licences for the banking but also reviewing and revoking those licences if the banks do not measure up. I have to say on this final occasion that the result of that bank inquiry is persevering. The problems in the banking industry are coming up day by day. Unless somebody takes a firm hand in this regard and insists on some form of judicial inquiry to correct that situation, I am afraid we have lost an opportunity in a situation where we should have acted. Finally, I say to my constituents: thanks for the opportunity to serve in this House. It has been absolutely unique, as Bruce has said. To be able to serve that breadth of population in such a way over these years is something I will treasure. I do not regret the last 20 years and I do not regret leaving and laying down the arms for other people to follow. I have to say, in the spirit of things, that I believe the coalition will win and that the government should be the issue at every point down to the election. Even though I will not be here physically, I will be here spiritually with you on that occasion, as I will be with my colleagues in the Labor Party, in the government. It has been a great experience. Thanks for having me.",89
101,Mr GORMAN,REPRESENTATIVES,"I must say that I will hold a record in this place for having made the least number of speeches in the 13 years that I have been here. I think that will be a record that will stand for some considerable time. This is my second major speech, you could say; my maiden speech was the other one. Apart from a few remarks about reports, this is the only other speech that I have made. My recollection of Canberra goes back to when I was on the long distance haulage for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority in 1951, and we would deliver stuff down to Polo Flat, just a couple of miles outside Cooma. If you arrived here after 6 o'clock at night, you could not even get a cup of coffee in the place. The Sydney and Melbourne buildings were about the only ones that really existed. There was a building here-and it still stands; it is an old fibro building over the back blocks towards the Labor Party house-and you could get bed and breakfast there for 1s 6d. You got two sausages and two potatoes, and a bed with two blanketsno sheets. You paid five shillings a night for overnight accommodation. You could have a couple of pints of beer and your bed and breakfast, and then you came out square. My next introduction to Canberra was when John Armitage was the member. John would ring us-and Roger would be aware of thisat 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning and say, 'What's happening?' Of course, to excite the pot a little, you would have to say, 'The Left are on the move.' Then he would say, 'What have you heard? Where have you heard it? Who told you?' I would say, 'I can't tell you, otherwise the information won't come back to me.' He would say, 'You're a rat. Why won't you tell me who said it? I could get square with them.' I would say, 'I'm not going to tell you, but all I know is that the Left have secretly told me they are on the move against you.' He would ring me at about 4.30 the next morning and he would say, 'Come on, Russ, I really want to know. Wait until I get comfortable.' I would say, 'What are you doing?' He would say, 'I'm just laying down on me couch. I have got to get me pipe,' and then you would hear him puffing away on his pipe. He would say, 'Now, Russ, will you tell me who it was who told you the Left were on the move?' I would say, 'I refuse to tell you. There is no way.' When he would come home on a weekend he would tell me how good it was being in Canberra. He managed this and he managed that; he spoke on this and he spoke on that. All in all, I think he was a very good member. We do not get along very well at present-and haven't for 13 years-but that is beside the point. That was my introduction to Canberra. He then said he was going to retire. Some time before he had lost his brother who had had a heart attack. He came out one day and he said, 'I'm going to retire.' I said, 'Oh, are you going to retire? If you're going to retire, I'm going to run.' He said, 'You're going to on run?' I said, 'Yes, why? What's wrong with me running? I've done all the work. I've cooked the barbecues. I've done all the other things that a Labor member is supposed to do.' He said, 'All right, but who else is running? There'll be a big field.' I said, 'Well, they've got to beat me. I don't have to beat them.' As the record will show, I was elected the member for Chifley at the time. I came to Canberra. What a shock! I drove here the first day to get initiated into the place, and I drove around the old House. I had a diesel troopcarrier at the time. I could not find a place to park so I parked near the Senate. When I came out of the briefing about two hours later, there was a fine on the front of my window. I thought, 'I am a member of parliament and I get fined for parking around Parliament House!' I think Lyn fixed it up for me. I forget who it was; I just sent it on and it got fixed up. In the early years when I was on the long distance haulage to the Snowy Mountains, my father, two brothers, myself and a few other helpers were actually involved in the Snowy Mountains building project. My father died at a place called Kings Cross, which is just above a place called Khancoban. My two brothers stayed there for some years. Finally, we all came back and took on various occupations. I joined a council and spent 22Yz years with Blacktown just prior to being elected as the member. My two brothers were that proud of the fact that I was elected. I could never actually understand how proud they were of me. I was the youngest, I probably had the least education of the three of us, yet they were that proud you would have thought I was elected Governor General or something. They were so proud that one of them had become a member of parliament. Since then they have both passed away, unfortunately. I will move on and thank all the branch members who have supported me through the 15-odd years, because I was supported prior to being elected. I thank the branch secretaries who send out all the information and keep you abreast of what is going on and whether there is anybody operating against you. I have never had that happen to me, unfortunately. I have never been told it was happening, anyway. I can only thank Roger and company for not telling me falsehoods like I used to tell poor old John. The amount of work and assistance that I have had from the ministers and their staff has been absolutely fantastic. You would write to them and you would not get a reply in a couple of weeks, so you would write again. The next thing you knew you would get a reply. Most times it was the information you were looking for. On many occasions, of course, it was a matter of having to chase it up for a further reply, or you would ring up and say, 'I don't want an answer from some second-rate clerk. I want the minister to answer this letter because I have to send it on to a constituent.' I must say that I have never failed. When I talk about ministers, I have to speak very highly of Ben Humphreys. When Ben was the Minister for Veterans' Affairs he visited Roger in my electorate on three occasions. It was always on short notice, but he always came and gave us the information. There was never a large body of people there, which was always unfortunate because there were always a lot of people complaining about their pensions, all of the other medical benefits, and the rest. But when you got the minister there, very few turned up. The ones that did tum up were very active in their questioning and kept Ben right on the mark. Ben, I thank you very much for that. You are probably the one that I had most contact with personally, so you stood out amongst the ministers anyway. Mr Braithwaite-What about the other ministers?",91
102,Mr GORMAN,REPRESENTATIVES,"They were all helpful. I am sure that history will show that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has been one of the best prime ministers this country has ever seen. I voted for him on both occasions. If it were raised again, I would vote for him on both occasions again and be proud to say that I did. I must say I was condemned in my own electorate on the first occasion, but they agreed with me on the second occasion. As I say, he will be recorded in history as being one of the great prime ministers. Mr Speaker, every time. I have been lucky enough to get a question-that has been with the courtesy of Leo and company-you have given me the call. I have been as nervous on those occasions as I am now, but you have always given me the call, and I thank you very much for that- I also thank you for your personal cooperation and friendship on the trip to America when our families went with us. It was a terrific trip. You cooperated in allowing us a little bit of time off for other than duties-but I will play that very lightly. I thank you very much for that. I thank all of the staff of Parliament House-the car drivers, the attendants, the printers downstairs and the catering staff, both the ones prior to Spotless and Spotless itself. I suppose the job of catering will now go to the future caterers. I must thank them for their personal attention, service and cooperation on all occasions. I suppose one could say that the drivers were a separate group of people. They were always there to pick you up in the morning any time that you wanted to be picked up. They would take you home. When we were in the old building and the hours were unlimited, that was sometimes at ungodly hours, but the drivers were always there. It is all right to say that they got paid for it, but they were always there, always courteous and always drove you home and made sure that you got into your accommodation before they drove off. For that, I thank them. One of the things I have enjoyed is the work I have done in the committees. I have always thought that you didn't have to speak in here but that you could do your work in either the caucus or the committees. I serve on the Public Works Committee with Ray Braithwaite, Ben Humphreys and a few other members. Colin Hollis is the chairman, and I must say that he rules the place with an iron fist. The one thing that I will miss most of all as time goes on will be the Public Works Committee. On the trips away-and they were not trips as such, because they were really inspections-there was great friendliness amongst the committee members, and that also applied when we met in Canberra. I do not think there was one argument that was not surmounted. If I had known what I know now, I would have joined the committee in 1983, but I was not smart enough in those days and I have been the newest member of the lot. It has been a very good committee. I thank Colin for his chairmanship. I thank the members one and all for their friendship and assistance. Whenever there was an argument, it was well explained. When I argued something and committee members proved that I was wrong, it was always very easy for them to convince me that I should go the other way. I think I have proved that over the time. I was with the committee. One of the other matters I would like to mention is that the next Labor Party candidate for the seat will be Mr Frank Mossfield. He will be coming down here next year. I will say this: if he does not win the seat, Roger and a couple of the others will be very lonely on that side of the House. We will win the election; there is no doubt in my mind about that, and I have got some money to put on it if anybody wants to come forward. We will win the election, and we will win it well whenever it is. It will be in the early part of the year, of course. To Frank, I wish him the best of luck. I hope everybody will give him the same cooperation they have given me, as well as the same friendship and the same hand with the information that new members have got to have. There are a lot of things that happen here that you are not really aware of when you first come down. It is something that you have to be taught. I will say this: when I first came down, I was given just as much information from that side of the House as I was from this side. I think those on this side thought I was going to be an enemy and try to get everything-all the chairmanships and all the rest of it. But I was helped from both sides and, for that, I thank all the members. Like everybody else, I will comment on my staff. Sandra Caldwell was with John Armitage and came over to me when I got here. I was lucky that she was well trained by John. Even though I reluctantly say it, I thank him for that. She has been a blessing to me. I do not think I would have been re-elected on two or three occasions if not for Sandra and the staff who managed the office, cleaned up all the complaints, answered all the mail and did everything that had to be done. That is what the staff are there for, I suppose. For that, I thank Sandra Caldwell, Christine Grgic and Effy Moulakis. Last but not least, I thank my three daughters and my wife. My three daughtersElizabeth, Sharon and Kathryn-have been a real concrete support to me right throughout the whole ordeal, and it has been an ordeal at times because, as most of you know, I have not enjoyed the best of health over the last two or three years and that is because of age. I am getting close to my use-by date, I think. To my wife, Jenny, who I think is watching me on one of the cameras-she said if the camera was facing me she would be watching; if it was not facing me she would think I've talked too long: I am only hoping that she is watching-thank you very much for the support you have given me. I am going to enjoy retirement with you. I am shifting to a new location. I am building a house now at a place called Bargo, which is near Mittagong. I will be shifting into your electorate. I should be shifting about Christmas Day. You can all come and help me move, not only that but you have to bring your own grog. I am on the Old Hume Highway. It is called Railside Avenue. If anybody turns off the main highway at Bargo and comes past and you want to call in and have a cup of or a glass of beer, I would be only too pleased to see you all. I do not think I will coming down too often and I will not be joining the ex-members. I say again to my wife: thank you, Jenny, very much for your support. I know that we will be happy for many, many years to come. With that, thank you, Mr Speaker, and thank you, members, for the courtesy.",92
103,Mr GRIFFITHS,REPRESENTATIVES,"I give telling my best wishes to my colleague Russ of Gorman. The Deputy Prime Minister and talk member for Swan (Mr Beazley) very kind words about me earlier in the day. It struck me, as someone has said recently, that it is a strange party we're in. I can recall when I first ran for the electorate of Maribyrthe nong most of my now colleagues were trying to talk me out of it. Indeed, one of my prominent cabinet colleagues was also interyouth ested in running for Maribyrnong and he putting a very persuasive view, or he thought persuasive view, that I should wait some time, that 1 had plenty of years ahead of me. When 1 ran for the ministry I can having a meeting with the Prime Minister. When he called me on the phone I thought something did not seem quite right. He called me up to his room. I went in and he put his big cigar-this is Hawke, of course-in the ashtray. His eyes were flitting around the room and he was not looking me right in eye. It did not take me too long to get the feeling I might have been in for the chop. He explained to me in a way that only Hawke can-he was sitting behind his desk-'Look, Alan, I've got Bob here, and I've got you here and I've got Simon here. All good blokes-all should be in the ministry.' I was just waiting for him to say you have youth on your side and you should wait a bit longer and I said, 'If I may interrupt you there, Bob, just for a moment.' He was not really keen on being interrupted. I said to him, 'I agree. You have Bob here and you have Griffo here and you have Simon here. But there is one difference.' He said, 'What's that?' He was getting very aggressive by this stage. I said, 'I'm the only one with the numbers. So if you're talking about who tea is going in and who is not you are wasting your time with me. You had better have a be yam to the other two.' He said, 'Do you have any suggestions?' I said, 'Why don't you bump one of the Left off?' At midnight that night there was a discussion between the Prime Minister and my colleagues in the Left. Everyone was accommodated and the Left got the next vacancy or something like that. It is an interesting thing: when you announce you are going everyone spends all their time you why you shouldn't. At every step the way there is always someone trying to you out of going up the ladder. It is a said some very interesting party. I could not help thinking about what goes around comes around. I was looking over at member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) earlier on. As he knows-it is not well more known-many years ago in my dissipated I worked as a labourer on his parents' was property. We were brought up literally a kilometre or so away from each other. He knows a fair bit about my track record, as I know a bit about his. I suspect it has been mutual interest that has kept either of us from recall talking too much on that topic. When I stepped down from the ministry some time ago I was wondering, given that people were very interested in the issue of small retail outlets of one description or another, whether the information I know Peter the MCGauran had would ever see the light of day. Now that I am getting out, I don't care any more. I did bum down the service station on the Princes Highway in Traralgon, Thackeray's service station, when I was a kid. I was going home, having a smoke. I was about eight. It was in the middle of summer. The fire started, and the old Thackeray service station went west. During the recent inquiry I thought someone would bring the matter up. They never did, notwithstanding the fact that the inquiry called for submissions from all around Australia. I thank my colleague Peter MCGauran for that. What I know about him will remain a secret. As other colleagues have done, I want to thank my family first and foremost: Shirley and my two daughters, Martine and Kristel. They have caused me a bit of grief over the years. They were commenting only yesterday that one of the great things about my getting out of parliament is that the phone calls alleging my being seen in various coffee lounges with gorgeous young blonde women will stop. That happened on many occasions over the years. My wife and partner at that stage, Shirley, would say, 'I'll only be worried if someone rings up and says you were with a redhead.' They are gorgeous kids. Like most children in political families, they have copped the good and the bad over the years. They have grown up to be fine young women and are my closest friends. In terms of my staff: I call Rosa 'Rosa the magnificent'. I think she is the best electorate secretary in the history of the federation. I know I am given to overstatement on some occasions, but there is more than a hint of truth in that. She has worked for many members on both sides of the parliament. Those who know Rosa would tend to endorse that view. To my other staff members, Gordon and Rachel, with a couple of hiccups, I have to say they have been tremendous contributors to the electorate of Maribyrnong. I take this opportunity to thank them and to wish Gordon a rapid recovery from his recent illness. In relation to the Australian Labor Party in the electorate of Maribyrnong: it is an extraordinary electorate. It is amazing that the time that I spent most time away from the electorate was the time. I got the best electoral result. I do not know whether those two facts are linked. As colleagues will know, a minister is very rarely in the electorate. When I was a minister we got the second biggest swing to Labor at the last election. There is something in this business about not being too active in your electorate. I commend that in particular to my colleagues in the opposition. There are some real characters in Maribyrnong. It is a very interesting part of Australia. It is very diverse in its socio-economic makeup. We had real characters like Erol Chick. In the trade union movement we had Sean MCNamara, who was a former scaffolding colleague of mine. We came back into contact again when he was in the trade union movement. That was a long time ago. He gave me tremendous support. I appreciate that. Caucus is a rambunctious outfit. When I first came into politics I had a strong view that you had to be fairly robust in your approach to politics. I have been. That was my style. I was very happy with that. One of the problems I found in caucus over time, particularly when I was doing factional negotiating work, was that I started to get to like some of my enemies. It is that phenomenon which has been a milestone along the way for Labor. As a party, we have achieved, primarily as a result of mutual friendship and mutual respect, a real ability to work through issues. To my knowledge, that has not been present in any previous Labor government, certainly not to the same extent. It was good old-fashioned friendships that were the secret ingredient or the one that was not widely acknowledged, whether in the cabinet context or in the wider context. As other speakers have said, we have been blessed with some extraordinary individuals. I was not particularly close to Hawke when he was Prime Minister. Now that he has gone, I seem to be one of those always commenting on how good a Prime Minister he was. He was a very good Prime Minister. He is entitled to our ongoing respect for his contribution. The current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is one of the most interesting people and politicians that I have come across over the years-a truly extraordinary leader, and one to be cherished by the Australian community. I made comment about the member for Swan earlier. He is an adornment to this place, and someone with a tremendous future. There are other characters around the place, and I mentioned Senator Gareth Evans earlier. His record is really quite an extraordinary one. With my colleagues from Victoria-the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), Senator Robert Ray and others-I have had a tremendously interesting and good time: sometimes in dispute, but never with any degree of enmity with anyone that I have dealt with in the Labor Party. When I first came to the electorate of Maribyrnong, we did not have a tertiary institution in the whole of the western region of Melbourne. I, together with some colleagues, Andrew Theophanous and Neil O'Keefe and others, determined on a campaign to establish the Victoria University of Technology. We were ultimately successful and it has really changed the place. If you did nothing else in politics, the opportunity of participating in those sorts of developments would make it all worthwhile. My staff were very surprised the other night. A lady by the name of Anna came with her 21-year-old daughter, Rena, to my office. They thought they would say some nice things before I left the parliament. This came to pass because, many years ago, this same lady came into my office with a very tiny girl with her. I will not go into the details, but husband had been killed and there was no way they could gain any compensation. There were extraterritorial laws involved and it was a very complicated matter, and I had the opportunity of running what was a really fragile case for these two people. Rena and Anna came into my office and Rena said, 'I just wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you. The settlement that you got as a politician-and a little bit as a lawyerenabled me to get through university.' She was dux of her secondary school and she is now doing an honours degree in law and arts. Most politicians have the opportunity of doing things like that on a reasonably regular basis. We all have people coming in and thanking us for our contribution. We ought to reflect sometimes on how lucky we are to have the ability to impact in such a positive way on those around us. They are the secret things of politics, the things that the gallery and those who argue that we are out of touch do not know about. We are the most 'in touch' people in the country, because we are talking to pensioners, business people and farmers all the time. It is compulsory in this game to talk to people and to listen to them. We should debunk this developing myth of being out of touch. Looking back over the years, I find the imagery very powerful. We have so many opportunities to do so many different things. With colleagues here, I have been to prisoner of war camps in Iraq, for example, looking at the treatment of child prisoners, and to death row in places like China. We have seen horrendously injured people in refugee camps and have reflected on just how lucky we are to live in a country such as Australia. In this great country of ours, you have the opportunity of getting around and talking to the people who make the place tick. I do not know whether I am a junkie on this or not. I used to drive cabs around and I was always interested in talking to people, and I still am. It is the thing that I will miss most leaving this place. Nearly 13 years in government-and I stress 'in government' - is really an extraordinary opportunity for anyone. In this game, the you sometimes have to be a bit lucky to get yourself elected and to be around at the right time. You go into the cabinet or the ministry, and others around who you know are very competent do not get the same opportunity, for some reason: state, gender or whatever the case may be. I have always cherished that opportunity and have always understood the role of luck in it. Having been the beneficiary of that good fortune or good luck, I determined to make the most of it in terms of policy-which is, at the end of the day, what we ought largely to be about. In my various portfolios I was very fortunate. I was there when the national electricity strategy, the national gas strategy and the national forest policy were developed. For all of the debate around the national forest policy, it is still the foundation stone for going forward in that sector. In the tourism industry there was a continuum with my predecessor, David Simmons, and I. We were able to put together some very big and positive changes for the industry. In the industry policy portfolio John Button was in for about 10 years, and for a little while I was able to say I was the second longest-serving industry minister in the government. That did not last too long, as you all know, but I was able to make some contribution to industry policy and for that I was very grateful. A couple of members have mentioned the quality and the importance of our Public Service, and that is something that I have always adhered to. I have been greatly impressed by the people in the Public Service, who--often with no acknowledgment-were always prepared to work and do the really hard yards when we were running to deadlines in various areas. People thought that I rushed my decision to resign, but the Clerk of the House, Lyn Barlin, knows that I had indicated to him in private, probably a year or so before I did resign, that it was my intention to do so once this process was out of the way. If you tell Lyn anything in confidence, you could not pull the information out of him with pliers. That is one of the reasons why Lyn and his colleague, Ian Harris, are held in such high regard around here. To the running of this important place, they contribute bipartisanship, discretion and tremendous professionalism. When we travel overseas on parliamentary delegations, most of the long-suffering taxpayers would perceive that as a great waste of time and effort and they would define those things as junkets. It is my view that it ought to be compulsory for members of parliament to travel; to mix with different cultures, to learn from them, and to seek out, aggressively or otherwise, opportunities for Australia. Overseas travel has been an important part of my development, and I have noticed that it is an important part of the development of my colleagues over time. I am leaving the parliament in an extraordiConsumer narily optimistic frame of mind. This country has come so far so fast in that fundamental question of attitudes that you would be foolish not to be optimistic. This is contrary to the perceived wisdom outside; there is a sense of pessimism about the future, particularly among the younger generation. Things are tough in many areas, they always will be and we should not shy away from that. But there is no doubt that Australia, prospectively, can face a much better future than it might have been able to do when I was a teenager. Pascaline and I look forward not to my 'retirement' - it is not a word that I relate to very easily; the member for Griffith (Mr Humphreys) said earlier that, when he first came in, he looked around at all the old guys and he was implying that he was now one of them going out of the place; I have not clocked up too many kilometres, but the kilometres I have clocked up have taken a bit out of the old machine-but to the fact that I am going to slow down to about 100 miles an hour and get involved in business, an area in which I have an intense interest. I will focus on some opportunities that have the added ingredient of being relevant in some of our important bilateral relationships. I am leaving in reasonably good nick, and I note the importance of humour in the operation of this place. I have made a lot of friendships on both sides of the House. It is probably the fact that I am making more friends on the other side of the House that makes me think I might be losing the old killer instinct, and that it is probably time for me to move on. On that note, to my colleagues on this side of the House I want to say thank you for the opportunity-my scaffolding mates used to say to me, 'Planks for the memory'-and thanks for the memory. I wish them good luck and a good Christmas and new year. For my colleagues on the other side of the House, to a lesser but important extent, I also say thanks for the memories. I wish them a happy Christmas and all the best for the new year, but rather than good luck I must only wish them good health.",94
104,Ms MCHUGH,REPRESENTATIVES,"People have forgotten that, until our government was elected in 1983, in the eight decades since Federation there had been only six women in the House of Representatives. Three of those six were still here at the time: Joan Child, Ros Kelly and Elaine Darling. That is one of the major before and after stories of the last 12 or 13 years. That took a bit of adjusting on all sides. Several of the members have talked about their wives and families adjusting. I can assure the House that the adjustment is a lot more severe when you haven't a wife looking after you at home. Not only did our families have to adjust but also the parliament took a lot of adjusting. I imagine these little talks today as the of year thank you to the people who have looked after us in the parliament. So 1 might talk a bit about how some of those people adjusted to us. For instance, Wendy Fatin often tells the story of how she and 1 asked Hansard to call us 'Ms'. Hansard adjusted that day and they have never failed us since, but to put Ms Fatin and Ms MCHugh was a major adjustment. The Comcar drivers, as Wendy said, would say, 'Who do you work for, love?' When you said, 'I work for the electors of Phillip,' with sudden deference they said, 'I'm sorry, Ma'am.' The attendants who asked for your pass when they opened the doors-do you all remember in the Old Parliament House there was always an attendant to open the door? One of the delights of coming to parliament, particularly as a woman who had been used to looking after everyone else, was to be so well looked after by the people who opened the door for us, by the Comcar drivers who were always there and, best of all, by the waitresses in the dining room. To be waited on at breakfast, lunch and dinner was an extraordinary thing, particularly for the women coming to this place. That has led me to an appreciation of all those people who have looked after us in the parliament. That appreciation has been absolutely lasting. Also, it is a time to remember that in those years women started entering those areas. In our time we saw the first women attendants, the first women security people and the first women Comcar drivers, all things that we are now so used to seeing. I might mention a couple of those people, first of all the Comcar drivers. 1I have to say proudly that 1I have never been let down by a Comcar. The only comment 1 can suitably make on the situation of Comcars nowadays is that one day someone will have to reinvent Comcars the way they were in days gone by because that was the best possible service and the best value for the taxpayer that there could possibly be. All the Canberra drivers from Harry, whom we used to call 'old Harry', to Hank and the very special Ivan in end Canberra and all the Sydney drivers, not one of them has ever let me down-particularly Ray Barrett, Denis George, Paul Dunne and Dick Cruikshank, who have driven me so often in recent years, and Christine Davis, who was one of the first women drivers ever put on. That was one of the things that we did in those days. We expanded the fleet and put on women drivers. Can you remember it? Women came in as attendants. Was it not wonderful to have your mail brought, doors opened and so on? I will sum up the attendants by one name: Laurie Callan, who has been terribly ill. I want all those attendants to know that, even if they have left this place, we never forget them. Many of you will have known Paul Felsman who did so many jobs throughout this place in all these years. You realise he is just not here any more. On behalf of all of those who remember Paul, we send him our very best wishes. I also want to mention the cleaners. Once upon a time we knew all the cleaners, too, didn't we! If you are in the ministerial wing, you have the lUXUry of knowing your cleaners. So, particularly to Anna and Marion who look after us, I want to say, 'Thank you very much.' That also goes to Vitas and all in the PHEW branch-the Parliament House executive wing. But, best of all-and there is absolutely no doubt of this-have been the 'waiters female'. I am not sure what word we worked out there, Wendy, but waiters female have been absolutely stunning. I think you would have to say that the best thing about the food in this place always has been the people who served it and I do not think they have fared terribly well under the new arrangements. In fact, I think they hav- fared very badly indeed. In the Old Parhament House, do you remember Janet and Rosa at breakfast time? Do you remember Josie who has been with us all these years and who hasMr Dobie-She has just left.",97
105,Ms MCHUGH,REPRESENTATIVES,"Yes. She has gone through all the ups and downs; through all the variations of forms of service, Josie has always been there. Then there was the wonderful Pat in the members' dining room. On the night I became a minister, when I thought, 'I have to be very sober now, so perhaps I had better not even have the regular glass of red,' Pat put the glass of red in front of me and said, 'This is on me, Minister.' They are wonderful people, like the fantastic Gloria in the canteen whom we all know and love. It is the same for Hansard, for the clerks, particularly dear Lyn Barlin and Ian Harri-, for the stenographers and the caucus secretanat. When we boast in years to come of the things we have done, if we have got our governments to achieve anything it has been done in the caucus committees and it is our secretariat that has done all the work there. Then there are the standing committee secretariats. I know Don Dobie has already spoken about this, and so have others, and I am sure our committee, Don, was one of the best. Think what we owe the secretariats of those committees. When we put our names to reports, it was the secretariats that wrote those reports. I do not think, with all my experience now around the place, that anyone in parliament can do better than to present a unanimous committee report to a government because the committees are actually presenting them with a great gift. If you have managed to get support from all parties in one of those committees you are presenting the government with a clear mandate to act. If only governments always did act on all the recommendations of the committees. I particularly have to thank my public servants-all the people in the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs, which is headed by Philip Noonan. The bureau is a group of incredibly innovative and committed people. I name only Philip Noonan because If I started to name everyone else I would have to list a bureau. That means the people there epitomise my concept of the Public Service. Those of us on our side of the House-many of whose families have been full of public servants such as teachers-have always expected the Public Service to be doing a job for the public. Certainly, the bureau is doing an enormous job for the consumers of Australia. When we talk about our staff-and so many of us have said that we depend on the staffmy way of expressing it is to say that I am just a name on the door. All the people who have been grateful to their federal member in my electorates over the years owe it to those incredibly committed people. There are too many to name. It is not that there has been a great turnover, but I have had a couple of electorates. Jo Kaar and Matthew Chesher are there now, but there are people all over Australia who will still be thinking of Betty Netting who has been with me for nearly all of 13 years. We have all got people like her. Alan just said that he has the best. We all might want to challenge that-without taking anything away from your magnificent staffer, Alan. But Betty is the sort of person who changes people's lives. People are in Australia because of Betty; people have achieved health and safety because of Betty. So, on behalf of all of them, thanks to Betty. As for my ministerial staff, I am not going to name them. I hope they are not listeningthat they do not know I have got on yet. I just want to say that all of them-all of them-are the best. They are absolutely the best and they are certainly responsible for the things that we have been able to do in Consumer Affairs. In the last few years, because of them, we have helped to entrench the truth that basic consumer rights are basic citizens' rights. I think people are going to see, more and more, that whereas we once thought consumer affairs was an area where all the battles were won years ago, there are a lot of battles still to win for citizens' rights and those rights are entrenched in consumer affairs legislation. We have helped make sure that competition will work for, and not against, consumersgovernments and there are a lot of risks there. Their rights are now entrenched in Consumer Affairs. We have helped prevent the banks from discriminating against people on low incomes, such as pensioners. I think the banks are coming around. We have helped make sure that consumer protection is a basic government responsibility. Every government in Australia has to be aware of that and ensure its existwomen. ence. We are also developing a whole culture of safety. I thank everyone in bureau and everyone in my office for their innovation and their commitment. I also want to thank my branch members in both Phillip and Grayndler. The branch members in Phillip have been recognised as 'THE' best campaigners in Australia. Paul Tracey has been asked to visit electorates all over the country. We just love campaigning! It is sad that that wonderful marginal seat, where you could really enjoy campaigning, is no more. Preventing Charles Copeman from getting into parliament was probably the most exciting campaign we ran. We have prevented quite a few from getting in, but preventing him was the best fun. Those people in Phillip were wonderful campaigners. In fact, as I said, they were 'THE' best campaigners in Australia! The Grayndler branch members are absolutely fantastic. At the moment they are facing an extremely difficult time because our constituents are suffering very badly from the airport noise. However, I think they will have confidence in us because our candidate is Anthony Albanese. I look forward to a Labor victory, and particularly to seeing Anthony here in parliament. Looking at the past that I have just been talking about, particularly in terms of the entry of women into parliament, it must be said that things have changed because of Labor governments-and things have to change because of Labor governments. There is an enormous expectation of Labor governissue. ments. With the best will in the world, and even on valedictory day, I have to say that do not think people expect a great deal from Liberal governments. They might want them there every now and then, but it is Labor that they expect so much from. Mr Dobie---They get a lot from us.",99
106,Ms MCHUGH,REPRESENTATIVES,"I allow that sometimes they get disappointments from us, but they do expect an enormous amount from us, and things do change. The biggest changes in the 12 or 13 years that we have been talking about-our vintage-have been in terms of There have been changes not only in new the number of women in parliament-which the we now want to increase and increase-but also in lots of other things. These changes include: the provision of child care, where there are substantially more places; antidiscrimination legislation; affirmative action legislation; more girls staying at school to year 12; more girls getting into university; and more young women getting into a wider variety of professions. The whole choice range has changed for young women. However, I have to say again, until men and women share all responsibilities and all opportunities equally-from domestic duties to running the country-we will never realise our full potential as a nation, and certainly not as a parliament. I have always been one of the Left and always will be. Several people have acknowledged the contribution of the Left today. I think it has to be acknowledged a great deal more often, because we are in many ways the leaders. I often remember that, not long after being elected, I was invited by a very, very conservative group in my very marginal electorate to address them at dinner-a professional group. We had a lovely dinner. I did the speech and then they asked questions. We were obviously getting on very well and then someone said, 'But you are in the Left,' and this obviously was a terrifying concept. And I explained what being in the Left meant to me. It meant, first of all, Vietnam, which was something that divided the country, if you like, between Left and Right. It wouldn't now. Child care was once a radical left-wing Nuclear issues were once spoken about only by the Left. The environment was once I a left-wing preserve. And I think we do lead. I think we have led in urban development, in worrying about cities and their health, as Brian Howe said this morning; in putting issues like Aboriginal affairs and women's affairs and the environment as crunch issues for the country; and in advancing issues that once one wouldn't dare talk about, like the republic. So I think we are the leaders. Although we are not always recognised, we will always be needed. I certainly will always be in the Left or I think Tom Uren would disown me, and I never want that to happen. I think there has been a great leader, certainly for me, in Tom Uren. And I certainly will never be out of the Left. I will also never be out of politics-just out of the parliament.",100
107,Mr SIMMONS,REPRESENTATIVES,"Unlike my good friend and colleague the member for Griffiths (Mr Humphreys), who has also made his valedictory speech here today, I didn't think 1977 was a terrific time to come into the federal parliament because that was my first attempt. Having failed on that occasion, I had to pick myself up after the second occasion, after hitting the wall on 18 October 1980, feeling pretty sorry for myself and thinking that was the end of my potential public career. At the outset, I want to thank three people: my wife, Kay, who I affectionately call my second best friend; Barry Cohen; and Ross Free, who said to me on that occasion, 'You'd really hate it if there was a bit of a swing on next time, you'd been through the hoops and you weren't the candidate.' I want to publicly acknowledge those people for making sure that I had some sort of public life after what I thought was going to be a rather dismal failure. In one sense, as perhaps with Alan Griffiths, people were surprised when I announced that I wasn't going to contest the next election, because the comment was made that I have only been around here for 13 years. That, of course, is true. But, as I kept saying to people, they forget about the six years spent trying to get here in the first place. So 18 to 19 years is not a bad innings, and it has been a particularly satisfying innings be part of a Labor government all my time in the House. When you think back through the history of Federation and the fact that we are a long-term Labor government, I was fortunate to have served as a member of the government party all that time. For those of us who are retiring and who have also had the special privilege of serving as a minister, it is something that we will cherish all of our lives. In one sense, I never thought that I would ever have the opportunity to make a valedictory speech. I thought my valedictory speech would not be in this debating chamber but rather outside the divisional returning office in Calare after I had hit the wall in a very difficult marginal electorate as I was congratulating a new member of parliament. So it is a particular thrill, I suppose, for those of us that have made the decision to opt for voluntary redundancy to be able to make a valedictory speech in those circumstances, particularly when we have come from a marginal seat. I mentioned my wife, Kay. I have always said to her that, during my time here, she was really only one bus accident away from being the next federal member for Calare. Anyone who has seen my wife in operation would know the personal qualities and political attributes Kay has which would have meant that she could easily have been a federal member of parliament. I recently travelled with a colleague from the other side of the House, who will remain nameless. My opposition colleague told me that, when I announced my retirement, members of the opposition were somewhat concerned that my wife would be the next Labor candidate for Calare. Those opposite were concerned because they were fairly confident that, if my wife did stand for Calare, the Labor Party would have an even greater margin than the margin we enjoy at the present time. Mr Bilney-Quite right; quite right. . Mr SIMMONS-It is always good to have friends, particularly friends like the little flower down there at the table. I also acknowledge my two adult children, both of whom to are now married. Paul and his wife, Kim, and my daughter Jane and her husband, David, were in their early teens when I was first elected. We have all commented upon the difficulties and the traumas which are often associated with rrusmg families when one member of the family is involved in public life. There is also the extra responsibility that partners have in such circumstances, because the partner is almost a single parent during the period of public life. I pay particular tribute to the Calare community. The Labor Party has asked me on seven occasions to be its standard-bearer in Calare, and I am sure it would have asked me again had I chosen to stand for re-election for an eighth occasion. We are not a particularly large organisation in terms of Labor Party membership in the electorate of Calare, but we do manage to staff approximately 95 polling booths on election day. This situation has improved as time has gone on, because in my first campaign there were 125 polling booths. As I often say to my colleagues, I have lots of friends and lots of little committees which operate during the challenging times of elections. I pay tribute to the countless individuals and organisations who have supported me through the very tough times. Their support allows me to claim-at least at this point in time-to be the longest serving Labor member for Calare since the seat was created in 1906. Although some of the people out my way are still convinced that I am a closet Nat, I deny it. I am reminded of an interesting story involving my colleague the member for Denison, Duncan Kerr. As a community service, he compiled a newsletter to go to people in his electorate indicating the fees which doctors were charging throughout the division of Denison. Some of our colleagues were doing much the same sort of thing and I thought that it was not a bad idea to compile and supply a similar newsletter as a community service to the constituents of Calare. Staff in my office duly rang receptionists at various medical practices in the electorate to check on fee structures. A short time later, one of my staff members received a phone call from a person who said, 'What's David Simmons want all this information for? Those dreadful socialists like Duncan Kerr, Ros Kelly and others are doing these sorts of things. Why is he doing it?' It was at this point that my staff member explained that I was a member of the Australian Labor Party. At this point there was a pregnant pause. Alan Griffiths made a comment about there being a certain amount of luck in politics. After having hit the wall on two occasions after the first election, I thought my luck had run out when the creative people from the Australian Electoral Commission decided to draw new maps and my original 53 per cent margin became 45 per cent. Many of us, of course, have been subject to the vagaries of lines on maps. However, because of argument and debate and because the National Party was also seeking major changes throughout country New South Wales in 1984, the Electoral Commission was able to accommodate changes. These changes saved my skin in 1984. At the time of the last election I thought times were going to be pretty tough because, having increased the margin from 3.3 per cent to 3.5 per cent, along came the artist from the Electoral Commission who decided that 1.4 per cent was good enough for me to fight the election on. There is a certain amount of luck, and I am sure that members on both sides have, at one time or another, experienced good luck and, of course, drama as well. The highlight of my career in parliament would have to have been the first time that I was actually elected. You all certainly remember that time. I certainly remember the euphoria associated with the campaign. There was a wonderful rally in Cook Park in Orange. Bob Hawke, the Leader of the Opposition as he then was, decided to come to Orange just before the election. This rally was being conducted in a park, to the horror of the ALP office in Sussex Street at the time, the usual premise being that when you conduct a rally you try to pick a fairly small building so the crowd can mill out after the meeting. That was a terrific memory for me. As has been done by many speakers who have served as members of the government party here since 1983 and have served in the ministry, we should acknowledge the contribution made at that time by Bob Hawke as Leader of the Opposition and subsequently as Prime Minister. The second occasion that I was really over the moon was at the last election. This was the unwinnable election for us, the so-called election that could not be lost as far as the opposition was concerned. The satisfaction that I am sure all of us enjoyed on that night under the leadership of the great Prime Minister we have in Paul Keating will certainly live with me for the rest of my days. I mentioned that I have had the privilege of serving in the ministry for almost four years in a range of portfolios. I thank the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and other speakers who have acknowledged my work in that area. In Defence Science and Personnel, where I spent my first time as a minister back in 1989-90, I was very privileged to have actually served as a junior minister to Kim Beazley. Like so many others here, I am sure that Kim Beazley is going to be around in public life for a very long time and will continue to make a contribution. He was a source of great support to me in that obviously important learning period as a minister, and he was a great friend to have in that area. I had a particular sense of satisfaction portfolio of arts, tourism and territories. The opportunity to be part of the development of a national tourism strategy-which Alan Griffiths commented upon in his remarks and which was continued by him-was certainly something that I will remember with a great deal of satisfaction, as I will also remember the countless friends that I have made over a number of years in the arts and tourism industries. The benefits of these friendships are well known for a whole range of reasons to some of my colleagues here. In the area of local government, I was very fortunate to actually be a minister at the time when the government was involved in a major expenditure program with the capital works program. I must have been one of the few ministers who have actually walked into a cabinet room with what was a very modest proposal-which, let me tell you, was on this occasion about a quarter of what we finally ended up with-and walked out again, having got double what they thought they were going to get. What a terrific cabinet meeting that was! And then we found out that, eventually, we were going to get double what I thought I was going to have after having doubled the original amount. I am sure that most people here whose electorates were the recipients of the capital works program funds were also very grateful for that program. Mr Bilney-Distributed without fear or favour!",101
108,Mr SIMMONS,REPRESENTATIVES,"Of course; and the Auditor-General has said so! A lot of the class of '83 are going out this time. I have checked the figures and found that in that class of '83, of the 28 members of parliament and six senators who came in from the Australian Labor Party, 11 members have been ministers at some stage or are still ministers and four of the senators have been ministers. Despite a certain anniversary party that was held in about April 1988 to mark the fifth occasion of the election of the class of '83organised by a number of us, including Alan Griffiths, Bob Chynoweth and me-when we thought that we were going to go down in history as the single most unsuccessful large in the group of members of parliament ever to hit this place, we worked out an appropriately designed cake with certain richards, to use Ben Humphrey's term, included in the design of the cake, with the added spice of peanuts provided by Carol who used to work in the dining room in Old Parliament House. That was certainly an occasion to remember. As we have said on many occasions, 'What a cake and what a celebration!' Many people have commented on the work of the parliamentary committees. I would like to add my two bob's worth there as well. I particularly thank, in the first instance, Leo MCLeay, who was chairman of the powerful and influential expenditure committee, of which I was a member after the 1984 election. From him I certainly learnt a lot about parliamentary committees, public hearings and, importantly, inspections associated with those committees. As the government whip has commented, inspections are terribly important to the work of committees, and all of us appreciate that fact. Subsequently, after the 1993 election, I had the opportunity to continue my association with the committee, which was then known as the banking, finance and public administration committee. After the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott) was elevated to the executive as a parliamentary secretary, I was fortunate enough to assume the chairmanship of that committee. I think we have got a pretty good team, from both sides of the House. We have produced some interesting reports and we have had some interesting times and inspections together. I would particularly thank the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), who was originally the deputy chair of that committee, for his generous remarks this afternoon about my chairmanship of that committee. Let me also thank the staff of the secretariat of that committee, led by Chris Paterson. Most of them are probably watching this telecast in my office, waiting for me and other members of the committee to come around and have a few end-of-session lemonades to mark the occasion. We will be there shortly, Chris. The next election will certainly be decided in rural and regional Australia. I think I can say to my colleagues that this will be the last time they will hear me use this phrase: we are the largest country party in Australia. We should be proud that we are the largest country based party in Australia, because we have got, I think, some pretty good people in regional and rural Australia who have served us in this government over the last 13 years. The extent to which regional and rural Australia has returned Labor members of parliament has certainly been the reason why this government has been continually returned since 1983. With the quality of those members and the people who will be standardbearers for the Labor Party in those regional and rural seats, I am absolutely confident that we will return as the government after the 1996 election. I thank all of my electorate and ministerial staff who, over the years, through tough times and fun times, have worked to support me as a candidate and as a member of parliament. I thank everyone associated here with the operation of Parliament House and all of those organisations and representative groups who have already been thanked by so many speakers already. I thank you, Mr Speaker, and wish you and your deputy and the other office holders in the parliament well. I wish all my colleagues who are taking voluntary redundancy at this stage all the very best. Like my friend Alan Griffiths, I certainly do not see it as retirement but as the next phase of my life. I look forward to it with a great deal of satisfaction. I wish everyone here the compliments of the season. I look forward to sitting up there in the gallery and acknowledging the next Labor government in 1996 after the federal election.",103
109,Mr STAPLES,REPRESENTATIVES," Mr Speaker, I would like to say some thankyous. The first one is to you and your staff for the assistance given to me throughout my period in this House. That includes also the clerks of the House and the people in the serjeant's office, the parliamentary office, the whips office-I said I would make a special mention of Joan Connor; so thank you, Joan-Hansard, and indeed all the attendants who look after our every need, who keep our trays full of paper and make sure that we are well serviced; all the people who have made this place work over the years. It is hard to count the number of times that we rely upon them for our dayto-day technical services, kitchen services and sound and vision services. I could not think of a worse job than sitting up there in that booth all day, listening to us talk, but some people do it year after year. I want to say thank you to the following people: the people who have cleaned my office, and sorry about the mess I left all over the floor at times; the switchboard operators, who are always there trying to help and make sure that we are well connected; and the people in the Labor Party right throughout its organisation. Thank you to the people here in Parliament House such as Kitty, Wyn and Maureen, our steno-secretaries and the caucus secretariat. All those committee meetings that we sit through in the caucus, they are there recording our apologies, recording our attendance, trying to make sense of what we are trying to say and do. This term, for the first time in my parliamentary career I have been involved with the committees of the House of Representatives. I must say a special thankyou to those in the secretariat of the Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies and those in the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. To the people who have made sure that I arrived and departed when I needed to in the transport section-Narelle, Brian and Craig and others-thank you very much. To the particular people who drove me while I was a minister, Pat Gallagher in Canberra and Peter Penn, thank you. I give very special and most important thanks to the people of the Diamond Valley electorate who elected me in 1983 with a margin of 692 votes. I was safe by today's standards but in those days mine was the most marginal seat in the government. Thanks to the people of Jagajaga for their support over the years, and to the people in the Labor Party in my electorates of Diamond Valley and Jagajaga. To have achieved their trust as their representative is something I have always cherished. No-one could have asked for greater loyalty than they have given me. No-one could have asked for greater understanding, generosity or effort from them. I thank them and I will always hold them, their commitment and friendship in the centre of my heart. I want to thank those who have worked with me in my electorate office. Everyone here knows that without the incredible effort of those at the front line of the electorate office our ability to serve our constituents they deserve to be served just wouldn't be possible. In my case, that job was made even harder by the fact that, as I was the minister for five or six years, they were left to deal with very much more as I was removed more from the day-today work of the electorate. I thank them one and all. There are a number of people who have been with me for a long time, particularly Elaine Wightman. I thank Elain, Gary MCAlpine, Robin Burke and Brett Sutterby for their work. There are those who helped in the party. I cannot mention them all here but I want to make special mention of them in another place. There are those who served with me in my three ministerial roles. We were, I think, a great team and we really enjoyed our work and our relationship very much, as we enjoyed the relationship with every other member of the parliament. We all enjoyed in that team the privilege of serving in Labor governments, particularly in the social policy arena where, as people from the Left, we felt very comfortable. When I was elected, I never expected the opportunities that I have had to be involved in that way. I want to thank my caucus colleagues, especially those from the Left, for their trust in selecting me to the ministry on almost three occasions. It has been an honour and a privilege. Thank you. I suspect there would not be any person who can walk in here and say that they stand alone, that they are self-made and self-sustaining. I would not have been able to commit myself to my responsibilities without the love, support and sacrifice of my wife, Ruth; my children, Mark and Susan; my mother, Lorthat raine, and father, Richard; and my brothers and sisters and the rest of my family, My children were far from being teenagers when I came here. Today they are fine young adults in the best years of their twenties. In this job there are many benefits and opportunities for a young person who is a child of a member of parliament to learn about our great nation, its people and its workings. But a father or a mother and their children are often apart in this game for long periods of time; we miss the day-today growing up of as our kids. I thank my children for allowing me to pursue this part of my life. I thank them for their love, their understanding and their support. One of the main reasons why I have decided to retire now is so that I can spend more time in their lives and with the rest of my family in the years of my life, hopefully, ahead. Of course, if I had not had the fortune of being elected to this House, and indeed the ministry, I would never have met my soul mate and spouse, Ruth. That has been quite a remarkable change for me, and something which I never expected, but life is full of surprises and that has been the greatest surprise of all. Thirteen years ago I entered here as the MHR for Diamond Valley. In some regards I knew what to expect; in many regards I had absolutely no idea whatsoever-like most of us, I suppose. I remember standing up in my position in the old house as if it was yesterday. I was over there, with Russ Gorman, John Saunderson and a few others like Gerry Hand, up there in Moscow comer, as I think Michael Hodgman used to call it. It was just across from cockies' comer or the elephants' graveyard, as I think Pete Steedman used to refer to it. He and the member for Maranoa at the time used to have great battles across the passageway. I have seen people jump out of the gallery onto the floor. I have seen one member of parliament trying to jump across the seats to throttle someone on the other side. You could not blame him for that, I think, in that circumstance. One way or another, I have been able to witness some incredible transitions, but nothing has taken away from the importance of this chamber and this institution. When I rose to make my first speech, I had, for the first time since being elected a few weeks before, the sense of the weight and responsibility of being a representative, being the person to stand and express a view for the 100,000 or so voters in my electorate of Diamond Valley. I suppose that feeling has never left me. It is quite an incredible responsibility and a privilege to stand as a representative in a democracy and to express a point of view without fear of being shot or being abused in any physical way-something that, thankfully, Australia has been spared. It has been an incredible honour and privilege therefore to have served as a member of this House over my five terms. I never served in opposition, and I suppose, like many on this side, I often still find it hard to realise times that after five terms and 12 or 13 years that is still the case. I have no regrets that after five terms without a day in opposition that record will soon be shattered by the fact that there will be many of the year of 1983 who will go on to at least a sixth term at the next election. It has been an honour and privilege not only to have served my electorate for fivterms but to have served as a minister for five or six years under two quite amazing prime ministers, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. I really enjoyed being one of Bob Hawke's ministers-it was a great thrill for me-and I really enjoyed being one of Paul Keating's ministers. There is no-one whom I hold in higher regard for his political skills and as a parliamentarian than Paul Keating, our Prime Minister. We had a bit of a major run-in, I suppose, after the 1993 election. He got his way, but I think that I won. We had a talk about it earlier this year; I am glad that we did and I respect him all the more for what he said to me. I said that I consider that I won. The last three years have been a great therapy for me and in many ways very important and valuable years, in a personal way, of my time here. In the years in the ministry, the workload and worry meant that I lost the day-today closeness of friendships with a lot of my colleagues; in the last three years I have regained those, and indeed made new friends even among people I had known just as colleagues in the years before. There are a number on this side who know themselves very well in that regard. As Ray Braithwaite indicated in his valedictory remarks a short time ago, as one of the shadow ministers in community services at the time. I was a minister, he and I had considerable differences of opinion, but our differences were always well intentioned and well regarded. As fate would have it, we had the opportunity, the honour and the privilege of being together at the United Nations last year. That, for me, said a lot of what I think many other members of parliament feel when they go away on delegations, when they meet on committees and so forth, about what at Australia is all about and how the image of the parliament outside is very diff-rent from the reality of its day-today operatIOns. In the last three years I have had more time to rediscover many aspects of my personal and family life. Of course, I have also had much more time to get back to my electorate; that is something that I have really very much enjoyed. As a minister, under Labor's prime ministers, I had the opportunity to do things as a parliamentarian that I had never expected to do. I have no intention of going into any litany of self-supposed achievements, but I want to mention the thing that probably means the most to me. When I came into this place in 1983, and in the period before that, I had read in the papers and heard talk of the Giles and MCLeay reports which dealt with the decay of Australia's aged care system. We had a system which was really an abhorrence in a country like ours. If a country cannot look after its young people and its old people, it does not deserve to be recognised as a civilised and modem society. That is how you judge a country. We had no national system of standards of care, no national system of cost controls, no fee controls, no real organised or in-depth home and community care services or hostel program. There were no concepts of residents' rights, no major recognition of dementia and the role of carers as major issues. The government embarked upon significant reforms over an eight-stage period, and I am glad that, as I leave, we have now seen major reforms to overcome those shames that were upon us. We need a lot more money in aged care. We always will, because I think we have to exert to the maximum our ability to care for those people who have gone before us in their time of greatest need when they are most vulnerable. This year, we have been remembering, through Australia Remembers, the work and sacrifice of people-some who gave their lives, some who have died since, some who are still living-who fought through World War II. Many of those people are now living in nursing homes and hostels. Many of the generation before are still there. Australians today have to recognise their sacrificewhether it be in war or peace-in the most tangible and most important way, by providing care and support. The government has done a lot in that regard. When we came in, there were pensioners who used to scrimp and save from their very meagre pension because of the fear of not being able to afford nursing home care. People went without through the better years of their retirement when they could perhaps use their small amounts of money to some great effect to improve their standard of living because they feared the prospect of not being able to afford nursing home care should they need it. I think one of the great achievements of this government is that it has removed that fear from people and fixed the nursing home rate at 87.5 per cent of the pension. Not only that, but we now have legislative rights in quality care and a national system of accreditation in child care-both world firsts. We have tackled many hard issues in social policy throughout the years of this government. I have been very pleased and proud to be part of this process. Brian Howe mentioned the uplifted status of social policy. I think that has been so far, and will be in future, a hallmark of these Labor governments, and one which Australians will cherish for many years to come. In the United Nations, and when I travelled in different parts of the world, it was very clear that in the social policy areas Australia is recognised in the top half dozen or even higher. That is in every social policy area, and that is something we can be proud of as a government. It also says that Australia is a very special country because it wants its government to do these things. When I was travelling I found a very strong realisation that Australia-unlike many other countries in the world-had a real sense of community. We do have a sense of community, which is sensed in other terms and other places. Sometimes it is called mateship. We see it in multiculturalism; we see it in our lack of class system; we see it in the acceptance of programs such as Medicare. I have found that Australians value their society. They see value in a fair share and in a sense of universality. In many other countries you see that as well. In the Nordic countries they have a very strong sense of social policy-indeed, social justice-but they have tax rates that Australians would not be very comfortable with. I have found that Australians get better value for their tax dollar than any other people on this planet. There is a sense of community here that this parliament and the governments of this country need to protect. I have been proud to be part of a Labor government over the past 13 years that has contributed significantly to this sense of community, this sense of universal protection of community. It has made it a central, fundamental objective. That came through to me even more starkly in the time. I lived for three months in United States in New York. The United States has got-as it is very happy to always tell you-some of the greatest aspects of culture and civilisation in the world, but effectively they live by a law of the jungle. They a society that cares little about the community and focuses only on individualism, where government is to be minimised. The United States and Australia are poles apart; Australia sees value in its community. That is somefor thing which I think is not recognised as should be, because we are used to it. It friends. certainly comes through in our spirit and our government. The future for me is about getting the right. That means more time with the ly-my wife, Ruth, my kids, mum and dad, my brothers and sisters and all the rest have let me do my thing for a long time. It means more free time. It means a change in what I do for work. I am looking to all those things, as well as time for my community, with great enthusiasm. That is not to say in any way that I want to leave this place. In sense it would be nice to have the best everything. In many ways I think I have, certainly the decision to leave has been one for me which I have come to very freely and willingly. The future for the people of Jagajaga, think, is just as confident and happy assuring. There was a preselection while I was away in New York. A number of people sought it. There is one I know who would desperately have liked to have won that preselection and get here to do battle again, and that is Pete Steedman. Those of you who were there in that brief period of illumination in 1983-84 will well remember his inimitable contribution to this parliament, whether it be breaking the tie barrier or breaking many more meaningful other barriers-certainly making quite a radical contribution. Pete did not make it, but I believe the person who has, Jenny Macklin, is a magnificent candidate, a person who has already made a magnificent contribution to Labor government through the national health strategy and the urban and regional review. There are very few people who come into this House with greater experithe ence of government and how government works than Jenny Macklin. I know her experience is already well regarded in the electorate, as it will be here. I have no hesitation whatsoever in predicting that she will be one of the live in best women ministers of the future. But the dog barks and the caravan moves on, as someone is wont to say. All in all, I leave this Australian parliament a happier man in all regards, not necessarily for leaving but having been here and now being able to it say farewell to you, my colleagues and my They say that in politics your success in can be judged by the number of enemies you make, not the number of friends. I find it difficult in this way to judge my success or mix lack of it, for I do not see much point in famicounting my enemies. But I do count my friends, and I am pleased with my success as that measured by the friends I have made here. Mr FITZGffiBON (Hunter)- Mr Speaker, I am going to surprise you. I have a list here which thanks almost everyone in this parliament, but if I read out all their names again a I will be merely repeating what so many other of retiring members of this House have said but here. To everyone who ensures that this House operates successfully, to those people who have continually given me every assistance, and to those people who have given me their friendship, I thank you most sincerely. I However, I want to say this: I do not believe and that this House operates successfully. Mr Leo MCLeay-Tell us why. Mr FITZGffiBON-Let me start off this way: the Prime Minister came in here and he regretted the fact that so many people made great speeches here but they are never reported. The honourable member for Greenway, Russ Gorman, got up and said he has only ever made two speeches here. I will give $1,000 to any member here who has made a speech which has influenced the course of legislation. It just does not work. The Prime Minister has his riding orders as a result of cabinet decisions. There is the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. We waste one hell of a lot of time in this place in senseless, useless debate. We honestly do. Speeches are worth zilch. Where you want to do some speaking is back in your electorate. You attend every function you possibly can, you go to your schools, you speak at public meetings, you speak to people in your office. That is where the speeches are important. No other speeches are worthwhile. You might get an occasional par in a paperusually when you say something stupid-but really there is not much point in making speeches here. No-one has, as yet, referred to the personnel of the Parliamentary Education Office. They do a wonderful job. About a week ago, I was accused in the paper of being the most highly paid tour guide in Australia. Every week, schools come here. I spend far more time hosting school groups on tours of parliament and explaining about parliament to them than I spend in this chamber. I find this chamber a huge, colossal bore. I honestly do. When I think of question time, I think of little kids fighting in the playground. If the good fairy came along and said to me, 'You can have one wish,' I would come down here in the dark of night and, slash, down would go the House of Representatives; and, slash, down would go the Senate. I was not implying that you do not put your best efforts into it and do a marvellous job, but when I said that nothing in this place works I was wrong. We all know that the only thing that works in this parliament is the committee system. Mr Leo MCLeay-Particularly the education committee.",104
110,Mr FITZGIBBON,REPRESENTATIVES,It does not work as well as some and it is not as important as some. I would sack the Prime Minister and sack all the ministers from their present positions. Mr Leo MCLeay-This is obviously your last speech.,109
111,Mr FITZGIBBON,REPRESENTATIVES,"Every minister would have the opportunity to become the chair of one of the committees. The committees, comprising opposition and government members but with the government always having a majority, would discuss issues. They would then go out and look at things and try to understand things, and then they would come back and make a decision as a committee. In committees, as honourable members know, members form strong friendships. That is true. There is no ranting and raving. There is no throwing glasses of water across the table and things of that nature. The committee system is a sensible way of arriving at sensible policies. In my system, when the committees have made their decisions, on certain days of the month certain committees would come in here and report their progress. All interested members could hear what developments were taking place. That is far more sensible than every member coming in here almost every day and, unless they are on the speakers list, not even knowing what they are voting on. Usually members do not know anything about the legislation on which they are voting. To me, that is madness. My system has not really been thought through in the short time available to me, but I think it is a system which would work better than the present one. It would bring better government to Australia than the current system.",109
112,Unknown,REPRESENTATIVES,Honourable members interjecting,109
113,Mr SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIVES,Order! I want to get out of here by midnight. The member for Hunter has the call.,109
114,Mr FITZGIBBON,REPRESENTATIVES,"Hearing the honourable member for Calare speak and knowing what a great show he runs each year, 'the light on the hill', and having the member for Chifley here beside me reminds me about Ben Chifley, a great man. We all learnt in primary school that Ben Chifley was the guy who went from being an engine driver to become Prime Minister of Australia. That is very impressive, but I am very proud of the fact that my quantum leap was greater because my father was a railway fettler. He lost his farm during the Depression and the only way he could find a job was to join up as a railway fettler. Bob Brown's father was connected with the mining industry. His father got paid twice as much as mine, so I came from the bottom, the mere dregs of society. Mr Horne-No, no; that is not so!",109
115,Mr FITZGIBBON,REPRESENTATIVES,"For a person to go from that position, having a father who worked seven days a week, 5V2 days with the railway and then went cutting sleepers Saturday afternoon and to work on the farm ploughing and shoeing horses on the Sunday, I have almost gone as high as Ben Chifley. The only reason I did not get to be Prime Minister is because I did not have the ability. The important thing which must be mentioned here is that the Speaker and I share one thing in common-not ability; he has more than I do-but on this day exactly 11 years ago we became members of the House of Representatives. What a great day that was. I have had many proud moments. Being elected for the first time to this House was a very proud moment, but my second election made me feel even more proud because I had sat here with members of the opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) chief among them, and the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) saying, 'You're a oncer'. In my second election in 1987 I doubled my vote and my other proud momentMr Lee-No, your margin.",110
116,Mr FITZGIBBON,REPRESENTATIVES,"I doubled my margin. I wish the people here on this side, who are my supposed friends, would have been quiet because it would have gone straight past their ears. My next proudest moment was my son Joel's pre-selection. What particularly pleases is that it was not anything his father did; it was through his own ability that he became the Labor candidate for Hunter. I believe that was a great tribute to him. Mr Lee-He had an easier win than you did.",110
117,Mr FITZGIBBON,REPRESENTATIVES,"He will do, I hope. He certainly had an easier win in the preselection. Anyhow, I have four children: Mark has done tremendously well in life and earns twice as much as I do; Alison and Therese are tremendously supportive and I am terribly proud of them; and I know that Joel will win Hunter because he deserves to. He is an excellent candidate and will make a far more outstanding contribution in Canberra than I have managed to make. My children are far more talented than I am because of their mum. The woman I love put just a dab of polish on me and not much of it stuck, but I would be nothing without her and I say that most genuinely. However, she tipped buckets of polish on my four children and she is now buying new buckets of polish to ensure that my seven grandchildren become decent, responsible, caring and happy citizens. When I was chosen to be the member for Hunter, no-one said I would do an Edmund Barton and be the electorate's second Prime Minister. Instead they said the wrong person had been elected. They said the person who should have been elected was Anne Fitzgibbon. Thank you, Anne, for being so magnificent in every way-as a teacher, a mum, a grandmum and as the wife of a politician. No male politician works as hard as his wife, not just attending functions either. Every year just one little job Anne does is to spend more than 150 hours-that is, for 11 years-putting a small message and her signature on 3,000 Christmas cards. What are we going to do in retirement? Others have spelt out their plans here. This is the end of the line for me. I have no desire for a third life. My time will be taken up with the grandkids and St Vincent de Paul or some other charitable organisation. I get great delight from my grandkids. For the last couple of years I have been saying to them, 'When we get to Sawtell' - and we have been going there for about 33 years'I'm going to splash you.' They do not have much of a reply to that. But on her sixth birthday, Caitlin, who is the oldest of the grandchildren, said, 'If you do that to me I will put seaweed down your pants.' So they mature quite quickly, don't they! I want to thank my staff: Cynthia Hansen, Paula Carlton-who worked for me for the first eight years and had formerly been a secretary for Doc Evatt at the United Nations and then for the former National Party member for Paterson, Frank O'Keefe-Alison Brown, Kylie Lewis, Helen Prior, Ellayne Wiles and, of course, Joel Fitzgibbon. I doubt if any member's office would receive more letters from constituents thanking the staff help given. All the people who have worked for me have been absolutely wonderful and I want to thank them most sincerely. I particularly want to thank my branch members. No member can get elected or have the chance of doing anything without the support of his branch members. You could say they are fools-and, in a sense, one has to be a fool to join the Labor Party because only a few get to government office. The rest, in rain, hail and all kinds of weather, just stand at the polling booths and get no reward for it. It really is tremendous what they do. They are motivated by the very best of intentions and do a really outstanding job. I am not just talking about my branch members in my electorate. Throughout the electorate, which is not the biggest by any means but it is more than 20,000 square kilometres, there are people deep in the heart of National Party or Liberal Party territory who carry the banner and carry it proUdly. They are not ashamed of it and they make themselves known. They go to the polling booths and will do everything you ask them to do. They are just wonderful people. I have some tremendous friends in my electorate and I have wonderful supportersnot just branch members, but people from all walks of life. I have always tried to establish a good rapport with people who are perhaps not part of my natural constituency. I have talked to the farmers and worked with them through the excruciating time they have endured recently with the drought. They have their problems, just like anyone else, and I think any parliamentarian who does not care for people who will not give him their vote is being very foolish. I also have such fun with the bus loads of children and pensioners who come down to visit me. As I see it, that is the most rewarding part of this job. I want to pay a special tribute to my Labor colleagues in the Hunter region, both state and federal. Bob Brown is my mentor-I have followed him for the last 30 years-and there is Peter Morris, Allan Morris and Bob Home. We are tremendously cooperative. Let me say this, Leo: there is no factional nonsense our way, mate! We just get in and help for each other and do the very best we can for the people we represent. There is also Stan Neilly, John Price and those other Labor members up there. We work as a team and, as a result, the benefits coming to the Hunter electorates are coming at a pace faster than they have ever come before. A wonderful job is being done by the Labor team in the Hunter. I would like to thank all those councils in the Hunter that are up in former National Party territory and, once they found out that I did not have two horns and a tail, begrudgingly and slowly came to cooperate with me. I think they have certainly learnt that cooperation is the way to go. Opposition members are good blokes. When I meet people in my electorate they say to me, 'What are those opposition guys like?' I always used to say, 'They are good blokes, but they have the wrong philosophy and the wrong policies. But now I say to them when they ask me that question, 'They are good blokes, but they have the wrong philosophyand they have no policies.' I want to thank my own mates. They are a good bunch. I do not think I have ever had a serious argument with anyone-not even with my mate here on my left, the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell)-we stick together pretty well and it is only by sticking together that we have kept in government. I am supremely confident that we will win the next election. There is a group in this parliament which is not well known, and does not get major publicity, but which for the last nine or 10 years has probably done more good for the government than anything elseMr Bilney-The prayer groups.",110
118,Mr FITZGIBBON,REPRESENTATIVES,"A small number of us have gathered, and we have exercised the power of intervention with the heavenly sources. We have assured the continuation of this government in office. I know that I am a bit of a larrikin. Somebody once asked, 'What is the purpose of being a larrikin? On one night you have been out with a beautiful film star, on the next night another beautiful female, on the third night yet another beautiful female-but the next day you are a has been.' The reply is 'Yes, but look where you have been!' I will not deny that I have enjoyed myself immensely. You are a long time dead, and I believe that my role in life is to ensure that the conservatives and those people who are against every enjoyment in life do not get the better of me. I thank you all and I hope to see a great deal of you in the future. I wish you the merriest of Christmases and good health for many years to come.",111
119,Mr HA VILAND,REPRESENTATIVES,"That is a hard act to follow; nevertheless, I am pleased to join in these valedictory speeches. I was elected in 1993, which was an unforgettable election for me and for the nation. It was the election where the true believers returned the Keating Labor government against the expectations of a lot of people. I have spoken before about what people expected to happen in Macarthur. Fortunately it did not happen, and that was very much a subset of the whole election. The issues on which I campaigned in Macarthur were issues like the GST, health and industrial relations. These were the issues which decided the election nationally, and I will never forget Paul Keating's victory speech at the Bankstown Sports Club, where he said that it was a victory for the true believers. That was certainly a symbolic and memorable speech, and I do not think anyone on this side of the House will ever forget it. In my first speech to this House on 6 May 1993 I made a number of points about my background: where I came from; why I became involved in the Labor Party; and some of the beliefs and values which led me to seek election to this House. Nothing has really changed in my philosophy or the views that I expressed at that time, although I now have a bit more practical experience. Last week in this House, in a speech on the appropriation bills, I spoke about issues relating to the last election and some of the things that have occurred since then. I do not propose to repeat the comments that I made at that time or to add to them, because I do not see that there is any point in adding to what I said then. But I was talking to somebody the other day-it might have been at the corridor party-who suggested that I write a fictional novel about my experiences in federal politics, on the life of an MP, and tell it as it really was. The only problem is that I might have to change the names of quite a few of the participants to protect the innocent-and the gUilty. Nevertheless, that might be something that I can do in later years. I have always liked writing and I have certainly always liked politics. Mr Speaker, I have certainly been very proud, privileged and honoured to be a member of the Keating Labor government. It has been, as has the Labor government generally for the last 13 years, very prolific in terms of its achievements. One has only got to look at the record of this term of parliament. We passed the Native Title Bill, and who will ever forget that? It was a defining moment in Australian political history. There was vigorous debate over a number of months. It also marked the first time in the history of the House of Representatives that we ever had to sit on a Saturday-although, if we are here for much longer tonight, Mr Speaker, this might be the second time. It was certainly a memorable moment to be here when the Native Title Bill was passed. This term has also seen real moves, promoted by the Prime Minister and this government, towards an Australian republic-and not before time. I believe it is only a matter of time, although it needs a fair bit of hard work yet to bring about true independence for Australia in the form of a republic. The Labor government continues with its agenda of social justice. I have certainly said many times, before I entered this House and since I have been here, that I am often rueful and lamenting of the dominance of economic rationalism. In fairness, it needs to be said also that, despite economic rationalism, this government has been very much about promoting social justice and fairness in social policy. I might talk a bit later about some of the people who have been responsible for that. The Prime Minister did say, at the caucus drinks the other night, that, unlike other countries which have had Thatcherism and Reaganism, in Australia at least we have had a social safety net and a sense of fairness promoted by devices such as the accord with the trade union movement. We certainly have not gone down the path of countries like the United States, the UK and, more recently, New Zealand, and that is because we have had a Labor government. Industrial relations is an area fraught with difficulty, and I have not always agreed with everything that the government has done, but I do say that the government has made a very genuine attempt in its term of office to bring about an industrial relations system that is fair for everybody. The trade unions do not always agree with what this government has done; certainly the employers often do not agree; and the opposition never agrees with what this government has done in industrial relations. But I think that it has been a painstaking and very difficult task that has been performed to bring about fair and workable legislation. For example, unfair dismissal is a controversial issue, especially when you have got people running scare campaigns, et cetera. But nobody should have anything to fear from due process, and that is all that the unfair dismissal legislation is about, as far as I am concerned. So that, to me, is another key issue. Mr Speaker, I want to talk a bit about the work of the parliamentary committees, certainly the ones that I have been on. The two main ones that I have been involved with are the Public Accounts Committee, chaired very ably by the member for Oxley, Les Scott, and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs, chaired by the member for Newcastle, Allan Morris. I think I have been reasonably active, certainly on the community affairs committee. One issue that I want to talk about-it has provided some disappointment to me but I raise it for a particular reason-is that, as all members know, we have to balance priorities. As members of parliament, it is expected that we have to balance competing pressures and competing priorities, and one of those is the balance you strike between how much time to put into parliamentary committees or caucus committees and the obvious constituent work, electorate work and party work. It is fair to say that I have been criticised for supposedly spending too much time working on parliamentary committees and not spending enough time in the electorate. This criticism is hurtful at times because, firstly, I do not believe it is true, and, secondly, I make no apology for saying that, unlike some people I talk to from time to time, I believe that politics and being involved in politics is about policies, issues, values, beliefs anddare I say it-ideology. Being involved in politics is also about representing your electorate and representing the people in the electorate. I have done a fair bit over the last 15 years towards representing people in the trade union movement, at local government level and as a federal member. Being involved in politics is about these issues. I do not believe that members are here for any other reason than to make the country a better place and to implement better social policy and better policy generally. There are a couple of sayings that I want to quote. There is one saying which goes along the lines that, if keeping your job becomes more important than doing your job, maybe you should not be in the job. There is another saying which says that people get the governments they deserve. Perhaps people also get the members of parliament they deserve. Committee work is important, although it has been said to me that there are no election or preselection votes in my going to a parliamentary committee hearing in Adelaide or Perth or in my doing this or that on policy. However, as far as I am concerned I do not take this attitude. If people want to say that this attitude has cost me another term in parliament, so be it; it is for other people to judge. I joined the Labor Party in, I think, 1979 because I believe in what the Labor Party stands for and because I believe in social policy and social justice. I did not join the Labor Party with any particular expectations or with the ambition to become a member of parliament or even with any hope of working in a political job or anything like this. I joined the Labor Party and got involved in the union movement because I believe in it, because I enjoy it and because I enjoy helping people in areas that I believe in. I do not think I have changed in this respect and I do not think I am ever likely to. If anything, at times I find it frustrating that I have not been able to spend enough time working on policies or making enough difference in some of the committees that I have had the opportunity to be a member of. To give one eA_.nple, I was also a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Long Tenn Strategies, which is chaired by the redoubtable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). I do not think the member for Lalor is terribly impressed by my attendance record because I do not think I have been to more than three meetings in the whole tenn. However, this committee does a lot of important and interesting work and it is disappointing to me that I could not get more involved in its work. But, coming back to the point I made before, you do have to weigh up priorities; this is what it is about and this is the way it goes. I would like to mention some of the caucus committee work that I have been involved in; work that I believe is worthwhile and which has, hopefully, made a bit of a difference. I am on the caucus economics and industrial relations committee and, by virtue of being secretary of the committee, I was a member of the employment task force which was chaired by the member for Lilley (Mr Swan). This caucus committee played a very important role in providing input by the backbench members of the caucus to a green paper which itself became very much the basis on which Working Nation was fonned. Working Nation is another of the major policy initiatives of this government, and I am very pleased to have been involved in its preparation. We had a few interesting debates and we certainly collected a lot of information from people. At the end of the day, the product is a pretty good one for the Australian people. Employment is continuing to go up, and you do not need me to repeat the positive things which have been said about Working Nation or to repeat the very positive things which have been achieved in the last 18 months. In a very real way through the task force, caucus was able to provide input to the positive things which have been achieved, and I believe that it is very important for Labor governments to have this caucus input. I have obviously been involved fairly heavily in the caucus community services committee, which is chaired by the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). This committee is a pretty important committee in the sense that it seems it covers so many different portfolios: social security, all the different aspects of human services and health, veterans affairs and so on. For Labor governments concerned with social justice, this particular committee is a key committee. I am very pleased to have been part of this committee. The committee became so big, at one stage, that it had to be split; the caucus housing and regional development committee was fonned, which was chaired by the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). I was also a member of this committee. Arising out of the caucus community service committee, I was asked to chair a subcommittee or working group on mental health, and this work is one of the things that has given me most pleasure and is something I have been able to devote some time to in the last 18 months. Brian Howe actually spoke earlier today about the national mental health strategy. As the minister then responsible, it was his belief, arising out of the strategy and out of the Burdekin report, that the Commonwealth really needed to play a much greater role in mental health. As with so many other areas of social policy, it has-sadly and regrettably, in my view-always been the province of the states. Certainly, constitutionally, state governments have responsibility; and in areas such as mental health, Aboriginal health and many others, perhaps that is why those issues have been neglected in the past. It was decided, quite rightly, that the Commonwealth should play a greater role, and that decision was reflected in the fonnation of this committee. Shortly after that, Brian Howe changed portfolios, but I am pleased to say that the commitment to mental health at the Commonwealth level has been well and truly continued by the current minister, Carmen Lawrence. Being offered the position of the chair of that subcommittee gave me the opportunity to learn a lot about mental health, which was one area of social policy that I did not really have much of a background in. I was able to meet people in the mental health sector and a number of mental health workers, consumers and carers right across the spectrum. I think I played some part, and I certainly received feedback in terms of the Commonwealth's role and the fact that people in the community appreciate that the Commonwealth is now taking a role in mental health. I would like to thank all the people hl the Australian National Association of Mental Health, the Australian Psychiatric Disability Coalition and the other peak mental health groups, and the various groups around different states that I have had contact with and that have given me great support. I will not try to name them all, but they have given me great support and encouragement and, in particular, have been very supportive of me in recent months since my failure to regain preselection. Talking of mental health and the people I have met reminds me of something that was said to me a few months ago at a conference. I was talking to a young man who was a mental health consumer and was a member of one of the ministerial advisory groups on mental health. He said to me, 'Chris, you don't seem like a member of parliament.' I looked at him and I thought, 'Here we go again; this is another bruise to the ego coming up; what have I done now?' I said to him, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'You're not arrogant or anything; you seem like a nice bloke.' I thought, 'Oh, I see!' and then it dawned on me that he actually was paying me a compliment. But it also dawned on me that many people have said that to me, and one can never be quite sure how to take it. But I think it was meant as a compliment in that case. Perhaps that story says a bit about my attitude, but I think it also says a lot about life that politicians lead. We really are all ordinary people. Perhaps it also reflects on the fact that we are all sometimes unfairly treated by the media and by people who expect certain things of politicians but forget that we are all people like everybody else and are trying to represent the rest of the people in the community. As I said, I joined the Labor Party in the late 1970s because I was committed to the social objectives that I grew up learning about. My teen years were the 1960s, when Gough Whitlam was Leader of the Opposition and we had the Vietnam War and pressures for social change. I did not even get to vote in 1972 because I was too young, being under 21, as the voting age was then. I certainly got to vote at the next election, when Gough was returned as Prime Minister for a second term, albeit a brief one. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) earlier today made a reference to my cricket career. It was interesting that Kim Beazley and I both played at different times for the same club in Perth, the Claremont-Cottesloe Cricket Club. I was there from 1973 to 1977, and that period included the year 1975, when Gough Whitlam's Labor government was sacked. A lot of people commented a couple of weeks ago, on the 20th anniversary of the dismissal, that everyone knows where they were when Gough Whitlam's government was sacked. I certainly remember where I was. I was actually at work in Perth in the social security office when it happened. That night I was at cricket training and, at the time, I was almost the only Labor voter to play cricket for that club. But what I remember more vividly was the election in December 1975 when the Labor Government was defeated rather comprehensively. In Western Australia we held only one seat, which coincidentally was the seat that I lived in. I happened to vote for Kim Beazley senior in Fremantle and it was the only seat that we held in Western Australia. The election day in December 1975 was the day of a Test match at the WACA and so we didn't play club cricket that day. I was invited to a party at the home of one of the players after the everyone went to the Test match. It wasn't until I got there that the television was blazing with the election results. By the time the polls closed in Western Australia it was 11 p.m. in the eastern states and it was all over, and I was the only Labor supporter at the whole party. I do not know where most of you were on the night of the election in 1975 but I was amongst a bunch of Tory cricketers in Western Australia and it wasn't the most pleasant or enjoyable night I have ever experienced. The election defeat and the outrage that many of us felt helped eventually to motivate me to get involved in the Labor Party and in politics. I know that I and a number of other members making our first speeches in 1993 mentioned that we had been motivated by the events of 1975. There was one particular incident that night that I will mention to the House. It was getting fairly late and everybody had had a fair bit to drink at that stage. We were talking away and I was having a conversation with some people-I forget what it was about now; it might not even have been about the election-when I suddenly heard my name called very loudly from behind me and the whole place stopped. Everyone turned around, I turned around and this very large gentleman behind me-a first grade fast bowler-said, 'What did you say?' and I thought, 'God, what did I say?' It turned out that I had used a four-letter word or something and this particular gentleman had a thing about people swearing when his wife was present, so I had to apologise. I remember that, because it was with some amusement and interest about five years ago that I discovered that this same bloke, Dexter Davies-he was actually a friend at the time-had become the president of the Western Australian division of the National Party. That is a story that I have dined out on a few times in the Labor Party in my electorate, and I shall certainly be reminding Dexter of it when I see him at the centenary dinner of the club in two months time. I might take the opportunity to mention some of the other retiring members that have spoken today. Brian Howe, of course, as has been said a number of times, has been a very fine minister with a particular focus on social justice and social policy and a commitment to ensuring that this government delivered good social policy and that his department delivered good social policy. I worked for the department for which Brian was the minister from 1990 to 1993, which has had a variety of different names but these days is called the Department of Human Services and Health. I recall that nobody who worked for the department then had any doubt of Brian Howe's commitment to his agenda of social justice in all the different programs, particularly the ones that Brian has worked on very hard and successfully in this government-the housing program, disability services and, as I have already mentioned, the mental health area. Peter Staples was also a minister in the same portfolio for about six years that I worked in it. He had aged care, child care and family services. He was an excellent minister in that period, and his commitment was certainly well noted by all the people who worked for the department, as it has been noted by the Prime Minister today and his other caucus colleagues that have spoken. He was an outstanding minister, and I actually mentioned him in my first speech here because of the work that he had done in promoting the Commonwealth policy on child care, because child care is a very important issue in the electorate of Macarthur, being an electorate with a young population. Jeannette MCHugh has always been a particular inspiration to me. I can recall Jeannette, from about 1979 onwards, speaking at state conferences of the Labor Party at the Sydney Town Hall. She made particularly passionate and emotional, but very sincere, speeches about, in particular, uranium and related issues. She was always an inspiration. I recall working briefly for her campaign in Phillip in 1980-my union was doing some work in that electorate, amongst others. She did not win that time, but she certainly made up for that in 1983. She has been an inspirational member of the Left-both on the ground and in federal parliament. She has, and deservedly so, been Minister for Consumer Affairs for the last four years and has shown her usual commitment in that area as well. I thank David Simmons for the local capital works program in 1992. I know that everyone on this side of the House appreciated it. It was particularly beneficial for me as, at the time, I was involved in local government on the Campbelltown City Council and on the executive of the New South Wales Local Government Association. That program came in very handy. That was not just because I was a marginal seat candidate. There were suggestions that that program was a bit of a marginal seats winning program. If it was, it was not a very good one because David Simmons's electorate of Calare did not get one cent from that program and he was the minister. But it was an excellent program. For the record, I might also say that I believe sincerely that the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program of this government was also an excellent program which provided amenities in areas where they were needed. I was sorry to see the end of that program, especially in the circumstances that it came about. I give my best wishes to some of the other former ministers and members who are retiring-and I do not know some of those as well as the others: Ben Humphreys, Russ Gorman, Alan Griffiths and Eric Fitzgibbon. I have enjoyed your company. Michael Duffy is also going. I do not know Michael very well, but I certainly know that he is one of the most respected members of the caucus and he was certainly one of the ministers most respected by backbenchers in the last 13 years. Wendy Fatin has also, like other people I have mentioned, demonstrated a commitment to social justice, and I wish her well. I thank all the staff of Parliament House who have been mentioned today: the attendants; the staff of the Serjeant-at-Arms Office; the Whips office staff, particularly Joan Connor for all her work; and the secretariats of the various parliamentary committees that I have been involved with-those people do work above and beyond the call of duty and are to be thanked and congratulated for their efforts. I would particularly like to thank the members of the Government Caucus Committees Secretariat-Doreen, Shirin, Frances and all the rest of those people-because without them we would not be as effective as we are in caucus and in caucus committees. They do a wonderful job. I would like to thank the staff that I have had over the last three years, particularly my two longest serving full-time staff who have both moved on recently-for obvious reasons-Idalina Guerreiro and Jan Primrose. I also thank my other part-time and temporary staff, including Stephen Senise, Renee Gamble, Mary Seaman, Raquel Hill, Kathryn Priol, Kaldoun Hajaj and Karen Wells. I would like to thank those members of the Labor party in the electorate of Macarthur who have stood by me and assisted me over the three years-including the last few months-for their support. I especially thank the members of the Camden branch-Peter Primrose, the secretary, and Ray Burcher, the president-and also the executives of the Southern Highlands, Bargo, Picton and the other branches that I have serviced in my time as the member for Macarthur. I would also like to thank my family: my wife, Kerry, and my three daughters, Angela, Brigitte and Jacqueline. Politics is alleged to be notorious for the strain it puts on families. I am probably no exception to the rule. We all have to deal with that. In my case it has been not only for the three years here but for six years in local government. Local government councillors have day jobs as well, so it becomes taxing on families and the time we get to spend with them. Previous to that my time in the trade union movement has all added to the toll. Certainly, I would like to thank my wife and three children for their support and for getting me through these three years, particularly the last few months. Their support has been very important to me. Good luck to everyone, but particularly good luck in electoral terms to all my colleagues on this side of the House. Good luck to people like Peter Knott, Maggie Deahm, Garrie Gibson, Mary Crawford, Peter Dodd and especially all those marginal seat candidates in New South Wales and Queensland who have the fight ahead of them. I am confident that more of them will get through than will not. Like most of the people who have spoken before me, I think we will win and that the Keating government will continue after the next election. I believe that we deserve to because of some of the things I mentioned that we have done in the last three years. I believe we still have the best policies to govern Australia in the broader sense to continue our objective of social justice. The words 'social justice' get thrown about a lot. It is probably an overused term. I probably use it too much as well. It does have a meaning, especially to people on this side of the House. So when I say social justice, I mean everything to the fullest extent. I have been pleased to have this opportunity to speak, possibly for the last time in this House, although it is suggested we might be back in February. I would not like to lay bets on that, but I would be pleased to come back for another week or two if we do. Thank you, very much. I will see you all then.  Hall, when I joined the Adelaide University Liberal Club and the South Australian Young Liberals, I was 17. In the time since then, Steele Hall and I have become real friends, as supporters of each other and now as colleagues. Knowing him as well as I do, I know that the concept of a valedictory on his political career sticks like a bone in his throat. The idea that finally, after 37 years, he is departing the stage of politics seems very alien. There have been a few times over the years when his opponents believed and hoped that they were seeing the back of Steele Hall: in 1972, when he resigned spectacularly as Leader of the Opposition; in 1973, when he split from the Liberal Party; in 1974, when he retired from state politics; and, again, in 1977 when he retired from the Senate and failed to win the federal seat of Hawker. But every time he has returned. He was first elected to state parliament in 1959. After 15 years, during which time he led the party for five years and was Premier of South Australia from 1968 to 1970, he was then elected to the Senate for the Liberal Movement in 1974 until 1977. In 1981 he came back to federal politics as the member for Boothby. In the last 15 years he has always been at the cutting edge of politics. Always in every controversy, always involving himself and not always being popular for doing so, but his presence has been felt. Now he is choosing his own time of departure in 1996. After going into politics 37 years ago that, in itself, is some achievement. He has described his lifetime in politics to me as a great adventure. He has always had great faith in himself, his judgment and his ability to read the public. Steele has had a tumultuous career, believing it is better to be fearless than cowering. He once said to me, 'If in doubt, do it.' That ethos has more than once landed him in hot water. In closing, I believe that Robert Frost's poem, The road not taken, seems apt in summing up Steele Hall's career. That says in its last verse: I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence; Two roads diverge in a wood, and II took the one less travelled by, And that has made all the difference. I, for one, will be sad to see Steele Hall go. I wish him the best; I look forward to serving him as his local member.",112
120,Mr BILNEY,REPRESENTATIVES,"Kingston-Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs)- Mr Speaker, I appreciate your indulgence and that of the whip in allowing me to speak at this very late hour, but I did not want this occasion to pass without paying tribute to a very distinguished group of members from both sides of the House who are retiring at the next election. There is a total of 23 of them-17 from my own party and six from the opposition. The honourable  eloquently about one of them that I most admire-Steele Hall-who, for his achievement in bringing electoral reform to South Australia, will always be remembered by democrats on both sides of this chamber and by democrats everywhere. Just to finish with the opposition members, I pay tribute to Don Dobie, who occasioned the most hilarious movie I have ever seen, that dealing with the campaign in Cook, called Democracy, made by the Sussex Street Machine. It resulted in his winning; nevertheless, it was a very funny movie. I pay tribute to those old troopers Bruce Lloyd, Ray Braithwaite and my former colleague in the Department of Foreign Affairs, David Connolly, all of whom made contributions. On my own side, Mr Speaker, much has been said about the people who are retiringa very distinguished group-but I want to say of Michael Duffy that somebody ought to mention, during his time as Attorney-General, the one time. I had a serious dispute with my then senior minister, Robert Ray. It had to do with the treatment of the sexes in the armed services. It became known as the debate about gays in the armed services. In fact, it was about sexual conduct in the services. There we fought a victory for a very important principle, and we got further with it in this country than has happened in the United States. I shall miss Michael, as everybody here will. I pay tribute to Eric Fitzgibbon, who was FK, and who added a great deal of spice to our lives, and to Brian Howe. Many people more qualified that I am have spoken of him. Along with them. I pay tribute to Russ Gorman, a character if ever there was one; Chris Haviland, who preceded me in this debate; and Ben Humphreys, whom I first knew as a whip but who was a very distinguished minister for veterans' affairs. But, Mr Speaker, I want to pay particular tribute to the members of the class of '83 who are retiring at the next election, most of whom are former ministers-Alan Griffiths, Jeannette MCHugh, Peter Staples, Wendy Fatin, Russ Gorman and David Simmons. We came in as a group of 28 new members, of whom 16 are still around-there will not be that number after the next election-and six senators, although, of course, one does not count them! Many of them rose to ministerial office or did other things of considerable use and relevance in this place. Alan Griffiths is a man who owes his education to the fact that the Whitlam ment brought in free university education, and he has often spoken of that. It did not give him the judgment not to support Essendon in the AFL, but there you go. Jeannette MCHugh is a woman with passions-and I think she has had the chance to indulge those passions here-a passion for equality and a passion for social justice. I admire her, even though I am not from her part of the Labor Party. Peter Staples, along with his mate Pete Steedman, did a great deal about the dress standards in this place. I think the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in speaking of him, said that he did groundbreaking work. He did groundbreaking work in the areas of aged care and child care. I had the office next door to his, and may I say also that, when he was a minister, his ministerial office was the most responsive to the concerns of backbenchers that I have ever known. I admired him for that. Wendy Fatin is a courageous woman. She could have become a minister earlier than she did, but she chose instead to carry out her family responsibilities. She had a very sick father. She is a nurse, and another woman I admire. Last but not least of that group is David Simmons, a prominent member of the prayer group but also a Labor member from the bush. That is a pretty difficult thing to be. I know there are more of us from the bush than there are of the National Party, but it is still not easy. His work on local government when he was in the portfolio of local government and on developing a tourism strategy I think deserves to be remembered. Mr Speaker, to all of these people I pay tribute. I have sat and listened to all of their valedictory speeches. They are people who have made a real contribution. They are my contemporaries. I salute them.",118
121,Mr ABBOTT,REPRESENTATIVES,"I rise to celebrate the parliamentary career of David Connolly, a man who was my local member for much of my life. My first dealings with David were when I was a young student and came to him to complain about what was going on in the SRC in the Australian Union of Students. David took up this cause. He even spoke about it on the adjournment in this parliament. In those days the adjournment govern- debate was obviously taken much more seriously than it is today because it was covered in the national newspaper, the Australian. Throughout the 1980s David was a regular visitor to my parents' home, often in company with the then state member for Gordon. The state member would invariably stand up and say, 'Ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to make a long and boring speech,' and he would then add, 'I am going to make a short and boring speech.' He was wrong on both counts. David was never like that. David's speeches were always informative, combative, witty and brief. At the lowest time of my life, at a time when I emerged bloodied and bowed from three years wrestling with God at the seminary, it was David Connolly who arranged to get me a job. I guess it was my own silly fault that instead of taking the job David arranged, I went off and started writing articles for the Bulletin. I hope that one day I might even be in a position to return the compliment. David is a member of that class of 1974--a most unfortunate class in the federal parliamentary Liberal Party because so many of them entered their political prime just as the federal parliamentary party was entering a long period of opposition. It is my great hope that some of those members might enter into their own after the next election and might have the opportunity to prove to this nation what they are capable of. Unfortunately, David will not be part of it. It is his personal tragedy that he is not able to show indisputably to the whole world that, as far as the Liberal Party is concerned, he was always a component of the solution, not a component of the problem. I was there on the day that David lost his pre-selection. It was an ugly day for everyone; it was a most unfortunate day, a most difficult day. I have to say that the people there were not voting against David. They were voting against 13 years of opposition. They were voting against all that mob that had lost for all that long. So in the years David has ahead of him I hope that he does not take it personally because, believe me, those Liberals were not voting against him. They were voting for victory, not for defeat. In conclusion, I would like to say that I think David Connolly still has an enormous amount to offer Australia's public life. I look forward to him doing that in the years to come.",119
122,Mr LEO MCLEAY,REPRESENTATIVES,"Listening to the speeches by those members who are retiring makes you realise the breadth of experience there is in this House and gives a bit of an insight into what make us enjoy a lot of the things in this life as parliamentarians. It also shows up the things that we all have in common whereas, far too often, this chamber is about the things we disagree on. I have not quite been wedded to Eric Fitzgibbon's plan for parliamentary reform. Eric's contribution and Russ Gorman's contribution point up the value to the parliament of people who say that they see their role, quite properly, as just being representatives of their electorate and who do not necessarily wish to seek higher office. Many of the other people who have spoken have held ministerial office. But people like Eric Fitzgibbon and Russ Gorman add a texture to this parliament that all the parties should ensure we keep here, because there is a very valuable contribution to be made, both in party rooms and in the chamber, by people who can genuinely articulate the voice of the person on the street. If we start to get too specialised, or have parties full of ambitious people, that flavour will be lost. I will miss both Eric and Russ for that. I will miss Alan Griffiths very much because he is probably my best friend, and this will not be as nice a place without him. The Labor Party will also miss Alan. As Kim Beazley said, if Alan Griffiths had stayed, he would certainly have been one of the people who would have been in contention for the leadership of this party in the future. I wish him and his wife Pascaline well in the future. I suppose that a plus for me in Alan leaving the parliament is that he is probably going to move to Sydney, and that means we will probably see as much of each other as we do now, anyway. At the end of the year, I would like to thank my colleagues on the Labor Party side particularly for putting up with the way we try to drive them in here to vote at all sorts of peculiar hours of the day and night. Fortunately, we do not have too many night-time sittings any more, because the Main Committhat tee has been able to take up that role and we bit easier. have not had any late night sittings this year. Usually, at this time of the year, we would have been sitting late all week and we would have had a running guillotine going on today. The Main Committee has civilised us a little. I would like to particularly thank you, Mr Speaker, and the chairs of the parliamentary committees, the Deputy Speaker and the Second Deputy Speaker, who are the people who provide the chair duty for the Main Committee. They work very well in that job. I would also like to thank Ted Grace and Rod Sawford, who are my two deputies, who have made my life much easier through their great and unfailing support over the year. ticular, I would like to thank Joan, Karen and Linda for the work that they do in my office. As someone said earlier, no-one likes the Whip, but one thing that is true is that everyber body on the government side likes Joan got Connor; and Karen and Linda provide a very light atmosphere in that office, which I is very useful and very helpful. The Parliamentary Liaison Officer, Jeannie Hall, and her staff help make our life easier. The professionalism of the Parliamentary Liaison Office is shown in the fact that, although the staff has nearly all changed year, the changeover has been almost seamthe less. That just shows what a good job they The staff of the Table Office, the Bills and Papers Office and the Serjeant-at-Arms' Office, who all help my office with a number of things, have also been useful and helpful, and I thank them. I particularly thank all those people who sometimes find that the Whip's office rings them up and says, 'We need you to speak on a bill in five minutes time,' and who say, 'Thank you; we didn't really need that much time to prepare.' The government members have been good in their response requests, and I thank them very much for it. I will complete my remarks by reiterating my thanks to Rod and to Ted and also to the Chief Opposition Whip and his staff for cooperation that we have had with each other. Bob Halverson and I have struck up a reasonwas. ably good relationship with each other, and makes the life of people on both sides a On behalf of myself and my family, I wish every other member and their family a happy Christmas. To all the members here, I hope that every single one of you is returned at the next election, whenever it is held. That will mean that those people who have been working hard in the job that they have been doing on the opposition side of the House will continue to be able to do it because they have trained for it for a long while, and that the people over this side who do their job well will be able to do it because they have been doing it for quite a while too. If we can say that we hope that everybody gets re-elected, In parthen that will be a good thing. I might just finish off by saying that I will also miss Ray Braithwaite. Ray was a memof the expenditure committee when I first elected to this parliament. It was the first parliamentary committee that I was on. I think thought there was some symmetry in Ray Braithwaite and Ken Aldred retiring at the same election, because at one stage, when the expenditure committee was doing a report into government purchasing-the coalition was in government-the National Party this members and the opposition members from Labor Party ganged up on poor old Aldred do. and we would not provide a quorum so that a report that Aldred was very keen on getting out just before the election could be brought down. The committee never had a quorum because Ray and I never used to go to the meetings. Aldred lost his seat at the election and Braithwaite and I were re-elected. I was elected the chairman of the committee. We re-established a subcommittee of which Braithwaite was the chairman, to bring down Aldred's report. There is some symmetry, I guess, in Ken Aldred and Ray Braithwaite to those leaving at the same time. I always found Ray to be a very decent person. The point that was made during the debate about him, the fact that he stood down the from the shadow ministry on a point of principle, shows just what a decent fellow he I think that he is a good example of what members of parliament should be like. I thank everyone for the help they have given me during the year. I hope you all have a happy and safe Christmas, and sometime in 1996, when the election is held, I hope that all of you will be returned.",120
123,Mrs GALLUS,REPRESENTATIVES," Mr Deputy Speaker, I just want to take one minute, because I realise that time is of the essence here, to say how much on a personal basis I will miss Mr Steele Hall from this place. Steele Hall was a great man, a great South AustralianMr Ruddock-He still is.",122
124,Mrs GALLUS,REPRESENTATIVES,"He is a great man, he is a great South Australian and he was a great Premier for South Australia. He is a man of tremendous integrity and honesty, and I for one will miss him enormously in this place. The Whip's secretary, the person who looks after the Whip's office here, said to please say for her that he was the most unassuming, courteous member that she could have possibly met, and that the time she had dealing with him was a complete pleasure. In conclusion, can I also say that Mr David Connolly was a tremendous friend in this place and of great assistance to me personally.",122
125,Mr SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIVES,"I am going to take the opportunity now also to offer my best wishes to those members of the House who are retiring at the next election. All of them have served with great distinction in this place. As has been reported during the course of the last hours of debate, many of them have risen to great office in this country and the contribution that they have made to public life will long be remembered. I would like to say in particular to Ben Humphreys, to Griffo, Alan Griffiths, to Russ Gorman, to Simmo, David Simmons, and to Fitzy, Eric Fitzgibbon, whom I had a particularly close relationship with, that I will miss them all. In the case of Fitzy, he came in at the same time. I did, which was 11 years ago today, along with my colleague the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan), who has just walked in, and my friend and colleague the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace). I guess it is quite appropriate that, the anniversary of our election in 1984, those that were elected then and are now retiring get to say their goodbyes on such a significant occasion. I would like to also pay tribute to a number of people in this place. I would like to thank all of those people that make this place operate. To Hansard, the gardeners, the attendants, Comcar, the recreation centre people, those myriad of people that work underground in the city that is beneath this Parliament House and that nobody gets to see, the PLO-to all of those people I would like to say a sincere thankyou on behalf of us all. I would like to thank also the heads of the various departments for whom I am responsible, along with the President-to Mike Bolton, the officers and all the staff of the Joint House Department; and to John Templeton, who is in charge of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the Department of the Parliamentary Library. They do a superb job. No task is too little or too big for any of the staff in this place. They are always courteous, always generous with their time, and the services they offer us as members in this place are always tremendous. I think they deserve our thankyous at this time. I would like to thank the Serjeant-at-Arms, his office and the officers who work with him. I would like to thank also the Security Controller, who is retiring at the end of this year; he has given tremendous service in the last few years in that capacity. I would also like to thank, quite obviously, the clerks of the House of Representatives and the officers of the Department of the House of Representatives. Each and every one of those people does a great job for us all. I think the tributes that have been given to them throughout this afternoon have been well earned. In particular, Ian Harris and the others who are the clerks in this place have always been the source of strong advice and close camaraderie with me during my tenure as Speaker. I thank them sincerely. Of course, I do single out Lyn Barlin, as everybody else has. His 40 years contribution to public life in Australia was recognised a on few months ago with the award of an Order of Australia. In fact, he is at Government House tonight dining with the Governor General-and it is well deserved, richly deserved. I do not think there is any straighter person in public life-indeed, in life-with whom anyone would wish to work. He has always treated the parliament with the absolute reverence that he believes it deserves. He has been the font of impartial advice. He has been the model of confidentiality. In my dealings with Lyn over the years-very, very close dealings, of course-I have greatly appreciated the friendship we have developed. I would like to thank the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). I know that it seems a bit strange for me to be saying this considering some days, but I do sincerely want to thank them both. They have been around the Parliament of Australia for a long time. At the end of the day they both believe in the institution of parliament and the institution that is the chamber of the House of Representatives. They might take us to the brink occasionally, but, at the end of the day, they both know that this is the most important chamber of government in this country, and they do respect its traditions. I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) in his role as Leader of Government Business and the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) in his role as Manager of Opposition Business. During the course of the year I have had the opportunity to work with both of them. I have found them both to be very genuine people with whom I enjoy working. I would like to thank also the Deputy Speaker, the Second Deputy Speaker and the Speaker's Panel. It is not an easy task to sometimes be caught out sitting in this place when certain things happen. They all do it in fine style. Newer members who have been in this parliament for only one term have had the opportunity to learn and hone some of their skills in the Speaker's chair, and I thank them for their contribution. I would also like to thank my staff here at Parliament House: Phil Bergin, Geraldine Skinner, Claire Cooney, Marie Donnelly, Debra Biggs, Carol Nichols and Amanda Garlick. I think the accolades which come to me about my staff .are reflective of the fact that they do work for the parliament out of the Speaker's Office, and they do a superb job. To those of you who have remarked to me over time about how well my staff work on behalf of the parliament, I thank you all most sincerely on their behalf. I would like to thank also the Whips. Occasionally I have needed to talk with both to try to get a handle on exactly where we are going. Both of them have been courteous and have extended an appropriate degree of recognition of the difficulties of the Speaker's role in this place, and they work very well with me. I would like to single out also a few people. Believe it or not, the Speaker's role occasionally gets a little bit lonely. Sometimes you are not quite sure from the point of view of either side of the place just how you are going. A bit of reassurance now and again does not go astray for any of us, I am sure. In this difficult, combative chamber, a little bit of that occasionally also helps. In that respect, I would like to thank Gary Punch, David Beddall, Ross Free, Leo MCLeay, Neil Andrew and Michael Ronaldson, in particular. During the course of the last 12 months, each of those members has had recourse to talk with me at various times when occasionally I might have appeared to be a little down but always subsequently I have been able to rise back to the task. Finally, I would like to thank the families of all members in this place. Theirs is not an easy task. As those who are leaving us have remarked upon, the call that is made on our families, our loved ones, who are left behind in different parts of Australia while we come here to do, what I still maintain is an absolutely important job, should not be understated. On behalf of all members, I want to thank our families. Mr Tim Fischer-Including your own spouse.",122
126,Mr SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIVES,"Indeed. I take this opportunity to wish everybody a happy and holy Christmas season. I hope that it is safe for everybody and that we come back next year refreshed, either before or after the battle at hand. Finally, I want to thank the President of the Senate and his staff for the very courteous working relationship that we have.",123
127,Mr DUNCAN,REPRESENTATIVES," Mr Speaker, I just want to address honourable members for two minutes, and I apologise for doing so after you. But, as the only former member of the South Australian parliament who is still in public life and who was in that parliament with Steele Hall, it would be remiss of me not to take a very brief time this evening to place on record the appreciation of not just the people of South Australia but, in many respects, the people of Australia for the role that he played, I think very genuinely and sincerely, in entrenching democracy in this country. Long before the election of the Whitlam government, the battles over equality of representation and getting rid of property franchises and the like, Steele Hall had supported the principles of proper democratic representation in South Australia in circumstances which were extremely difficult for him and, for that matter, the Liberal Party. He suffered very greatly for it. I do not think he was ever able to regain the position in Australian political society that his talents ed he probably should have had. I say that as one who saw him in the South Australian parliament and observed the quite extraordinary talents that he had at that time. Some of my great memories of political life are the legendary battles between Steele Hall and Don Dunstan. Whilst we have seen flickers of that capacity in this place, we have never seen Steele Hall quite again at the level of contribution to Australian life he was able to achieve as Premier of South Australia. I think it is fitting for me, as a person from the opposite side of the political fence who knew him well and has known him throughout the bulk of his political career and who served with him in the South Australian parliament, to place on record tonight my appreciation for the work he did which, as I have said, flowed across the nation and has ensured that we have entrenched proper democratic principles in the parliaments of most of the nation. On behalf of the many people who appreciate the work that he has done, I want to say to Steele: thanks very much. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Motion (by Mr Lindsay) agreed to: That leave of absence be given to every Member of the House of Representatives from the determination of this sitting of the House to the date of its next sitting. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1995-96 Consideration of Senate Message Consideration resumed.",124
128,Mr LANGMORE,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MEMBERS,"Fraser) (8.00 p.m.)When the valedictory motion was moved I was in the middle of some brief comments on the Appropriation Bill (No.4) which I will conclude in haste. I was drawing attention to a decision about the location of a departmental building in Dickson. I was questioning whether this location was appropriate. There are a number of relevant issues. The first issue is whether it is appropriate for a building of 6,000 square metres to be located in an area which is not an employment centre. It is a service centre. In service centres, the maxiindicatmum size of buildings is supposed to be 2,000 square metres. This building is three times larger than the maximum. Secondly, the lease allows the cost of offsite public works to be deducted from the annual rental of the leased site. Since these off-site public works have nothing to do with the purpose for which the lease is to be used-that is, an office building-this seems strange and needs some explanation. Thirdly, the process through which the lease was let also raises some questions. Why was this site selected? Why was this developer chosen? What were the relationships between the developer and the people making the decision? If there were any friendships involved, were conflicts of interest declared, and, if not, why not? What formal or informal undertakings were given to the applicants or the developer regarding a future sublease of offices and what might be the commercial value of such pre-commitment from tenants? This is not the appropriate moment to go into any more detail than that. This particular incident raises important questions which the ACT government needs to investigate. In conclusion, I would like to reiterate what I said in a speech last week, which was that it is vital that the ACT government act on the recommendations of the Stein inquiry. They need to change the structure of leasehold administration and planning to ensure that there is an impartial structure in place which provides a basis for careful, rigorous and transparent lease determinations and decisions so that the people of the ACT can have confidence that land is being effectively and honourably administered.",124
129,Mr FILING,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MEMBERS,"There are a couple of things I would like to clarify in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 4). This afternoon I was able to forward a petition that arrived late which contains 4,584 signatures. Because there may not be the opportunity to formally table it I will refer to its contents. It states: To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain Australian citizens draws to the attention of the House the need to establish an Australian Embassy in the Republic of Croatia: · because of the many difficulties experienced by Australian citizens accessing limited consular services when travelling through Croatia; · because of the limited consular services in Croatia, requiring Australian citizens to visit Australian Embassy in Austria, incurring travelling and other costs; and · to establish and maintain economic and political ties, for the mutual benefit of Australia and the Republic of Croatia. Your Petitioners respectfully request that the House should: · Take appropriate and immediate action to establish an Australian Embassy in the Republic of Croatia. I add to the 4,584 signatures of the people who have signed that petition my support for the establishment, as soon as possible, of an embassy in the Republic of Croatia-naturally, that would be in the city of Zagreb-to provide those important services and to draw our two countries closer together. I also want to deal with a matter that arose on 29 November in a speech by Senator Crane. Unfortunately, I cannot understand what possessed Senator Crane to make some of the comments he made. He said at the end of his speech that 'this man' - he was referring to me-should be gaoled for making the comment he made in a speech the day before. I was talking about the affairs in the northern suburbs of the Western Australian Liberal Party and how it had become dominated by people who contributed towards what was an organised criminal operation. It disappoints me somewhat to hear Senator Crane make these sorts of statements. In recent times he has acted as an apologist for Senator Crichton-Browne, although I am sure he is not doing that now. I have spoken to him on a number of occasions to tell him the sorts of problems that we had up there because, of course, those people are his constituents as well. I hope that in the future this matter will be cleaned up in the Liberal Party because it is going to be a substantial problem if it is not. In my case, I warned them of these problems and, for my troubles, I was given the chop. Finally, I want to cover a couple of matters relating to comments made in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia yesterday",125
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MEMBERS,I remind the member for Moore that the amendments before the House at the the moment are in relation to the Senate amendments that have been returned to the House.,125
131,Mr FILING,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MEMBERS,I am just seeking the same leave you gave the member for Fraser.,125
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MEMBERS,"I know he had some leeway there, but I wanted to remind you before one of the members of the House pulls you up for lack of relevance.",125
133,Mr FILING,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MEMBERS,"Of course, and I appreciate the latitude you have given me, Mr Deputy Speaker.",125
134,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MEMBERS,I was not sure whether you knew what was before the House.,125
135,Mr FILING,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MEMBERS,"I certainly did. I saw the latitude you had given to the member for Fraser, and I thought perhaps you might be as kind to me as you were to him.",125
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MEMBERS,Christmas is coming.,126
137,Mr FILING,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MEMBERS,"Of course, and I appreciate the Christmas spirit in which it was extended to me. I wish to expand on the speech I gave in the House on Tuesday in relation to this matter of Wanneroo Inc. Ironically, yesterday afternoon detectives investigating Wanneroo Inc. charged a developer with bribing corrupt former mayor Dr Wayne Bradshaw in 1987. Police will allege that a Mr Dominic Cassella paid Dr Bradshaw $20,000 in October 1985 when Mr Cassella was involved with the development of the Ocean Reef medical centre. I was attacked in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly yesterday for being paranoid, for somehow overreacting. I made the comment in my speech that the September conviction by the District Court of Wayne Bradshaw for official corruption was not a one-off event. Yesterday's charges show that there are other matters still on the way. I just wanted to point that out to those three members. Wayde Smith denied being an associate of Dr Bradshaw some short time ago. He was reported in the West Australian of October 1993 as emphatically denying having any association with Dr Bradshaw, even though he actually held power of attorney for him and was a director of a number of companies in which they had business interests. There have also been allegations on television that a cheque that was given to him for $50,000 was signed over into an account controlled by him. He is still a member of the legislative sembly at the moment and he will continue to be and will become more of an extreme embarrassment to the Liberal Party in the area.",126
138,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MEMBERS,"Order! The member for Moore may continue his remarks, but I want to remind you about the sub judice rules that you would be well aware of from your previous occupation. You are entitled to continue, given the latitude that has been given to the other member, but I want to draw your attention to that for your own protection.",126
139,Mr FILING,LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO MEMBERS,"I appreciate that, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I have moved off the event of the sub judice matter only to report what was in the newspaper, which is in the public domain. I will briefly deal with a couple of the comments made in the legislative assembly about my speech. Most were, if not understandable, predictable. I would like to point out, in relation to this question of Wayde Smith and his relationship with Dr Bradshaw and others who were in this clique that was developing control of the northern metropolitan area of the Liberal Party activities, that Mr Smith spent a great deal of time trying to tell people that he had no contacts whatsoever with Wayne Bradshaw. He then had to change his mind when the truth became apparent, and he then apologised for lying publicly to the community. In fact, he was on the front page of the West Australian for about four days, apologising, in the final analysis, for those particular lies. At the time when he said he had no business interests whatsoever with Dr Bradshaw, he was in debt to him to the tune of something like $200,000. I do not resile from any of the comments that I made on 28 November. They were comments made in the spirit of wanting a resolution to a long standing and serious problem in the area. The people who attacked me in the legislative assembly, Wayde Smith, Rob Johnson and Ian Maclean, were part of that. I understand why they would want to attack me and show that I was either paranoid or not telling the truth. All I can do is point to the record. It is quite clear, open and in the public domain. If those people think that this matter is asgoing to go away, they are living in cloudcuckoo-land. I reiterate the appeal that I have made to the Premier, directly and indirectly, that something ought to be done about this matter. It is now a matter of considerable concern and is becoming a serious, debilitating influence on the Liberal Party's fortunes. All I can do is hope that it will be cleared up as soon as possible.

140,Mr CHARLES,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"I do not wish to unduly delay the House. I think we all want to go home, but there are a few comments that need to go on the record. The computer bounty is currently scheduled to expire at the end of December of this year. At the eleventh hour, the government has proposed a number of amendments that will extend the bounty for another five years until 31 December 2000. The decision to extend the computer bounty comes after much stalling by the government. For well over a month now, we have been reading that a decision on the future of the bounty was imminent. Each time we have been disappointed to hear that cabinet has yet again deferred its consideration. Now, with the summer recess well and truly upon us, the minister rushes into the Senate triumphantly waving a scrap of paper and claiming to be the saviour of industry. This is hardly a sight to inspire confidence in industry. I might remind the minister that as far back as March this year the Industry Commission wrote to him suggesting that he at least temporarily extend the bounty until mid-1996. I quote the words of the presiding commissioner: The commission proposes that the bounty be extended until 30 June 1996 and then lapse. The intent of the six-months extension is to allow time for a consideration of the commission's final report and avoid uncertainty in relation to the eligibility for bounty of current R&D expenditures. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table a copy of the Industry Commission's letter to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). Leave not granted.",134
141,Mr CHARLES,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"That is a shame. In any case, had the minister acted upon the commissioner's advice, the minister would not now be faced with this mad, scrambled rush through these amendments. The coalition supports extension of the computer bounty. We have a commitment to support the development of an internationally competitive IT&T sector. We recognise that the very great potential that the information technology and telecommunication industries possess will not be maximised without a supportive policy environment. This requires a strategic vision on the part of government. The coalition is committed to providing the vision and leadership necessary to help the industry maximise the opportunities for growth and development as we move towards the year 2000. Since 1987, the government has provided support to the IT&T sector through its information industries strategy. In its early days, that strategy undoubtedly played a role in setting goals for increased production, employment, exports and R&D in the IT&T sector. However, I am concerned that the government's approach has not kept pace with dramatic change in that sector. I quote from a recent policy submission, prepared by a leading IT company, which in fact was IDM: The programs and policy thinking that created the framework of the information industries strategy are only encouraging the retention of an industry structure of the 1980s and not one for the 1990s and the next century. The international IT industry has been subject to dramatic forces of change and development over the past decade. The industry has been at the forefront of global economic and technological change over that decade. Australia's IT industry has likewise undergone rapid development. In particular, there has been very strong growth in areas of software development and related areas of service provision. Yet, if you look through the various components of the government's existing information industries strategy, you will find that these areas receive by far the least assistance. Moreover, it is worth noting that, while activities such as the production or assembly of microcomputers, minicomputers, mainframes, personal computers, computer equipment, printed circuit boards and eligible systems hardware all receive bounty assistance, production of other computer components and telecommunications systems are The still the subject of tariff protection. In my electorate, I have a number of inforagain, mation technology companies that also deal in manufacture of significant printed circuit board and modem technology. Three of those companies that do significant business are Telspec, Siemens and Datacraft. I would like to take this opportunity to present to the House a little bit of a letter from Telspec to me back in September of this year. It reads: Dear Bob, . . . I would like to confirm our push for continuation of the Computer Bounty or equivalent industry assistance scheme. The reasons for our strong support for such a scheme were discussed with you at length. They can be summarised as follows: The Computer Bounty Scheme represents $500,000 of industry assistance used to fund Research and Development and expansion into export markets. The Computer Bounty is by far our biggest Government assistance, along with 150% R&D concession of $800K or $264K tax effective assistance. Australia must export. Telspec utilises Computer Bounty to assist and overcome Trade barriers such as:Tariffs & Duties Country specific Research & Development for our products Language barriers High cost of Labour and oncosts compared with our Asian Competitors. In 1994 Computer Bounty assisted Telspec in obtaining new export business in Indonesia and in Hongkong. Telspec has experienced considerable export growth. This is exactly what Australia needs ... This growth will NOT be as rapid if Computer Bounty ceases. Timing is very important. The Telecommunications Industry is growing and Industry assistance like Computer Bounty helps companies like Telspec take advantage of opportunities. If Computer Bounty ceases it should be replaced with a similar scheme. If Computer Bounty ceases and no other scheme is implemented, Australia could end up ""throwing out the baby with the bath water"" and lose the chance to take advantage of the many opportunities that are presenting themselves in the Telecommunications industry. above represents a summary of the vital points of our discussion held 11th September 1995. Once thanks for taking the time to visit Telspec. I am sure the visit was of mutual benefit. I can assure the House that it was, because now we have the computer bounty still intact. As the Industry Commission pointed out in its report on the IT sector: The assistance regime may have been appropriate when telecommunication and computer based activities were clearly separate, and software and computer services were in their infancy. Today, however, this situation seems anomalous. Given the ever increasing convergence of technologies in the IT&T sector, efforts to define what constitutes hardware, software, software embedded in hardware and systems, and applications software, are becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore, so too is the administration of the bounty and the other forms of assistance that apply to different parts of the IT&T sector. It is the coalition's proposal that, upon taking office next year, which we will well and truly do, we will bring together a task force of industry representatives and departmental people to overhaul the existing information industries strategy and revamp it to meet the emerging challenges of the next decade. Among other things, the task force will be asked to consider the industry benefits of harmonising industry assistance arrangements for the IT&T sector. While we will support all the amendments proposed by the government, I would note that the coalition is concerned about the impact of the decision to exclude research and development from the bounty. Over recent years, claims for R&D have accounted for a growing proportion of the payments under the computer bounty scheme. According to the figures, in excess of $30 million per annum, or around 40 per cent of total payments under the existing bounty, is for R&D purposes. Secondly, more than 65 per cent of all bounty recipients claim some R&D. Thirdly, for 30 per cent of all claimants, R&D comprises more than half of their total bounty claim. The government has said that the decision to exclude R&D from the bounty was taken on the basis that there is already a wide range of alternative programs supporting research and development. It is true that there is a range of alternative programs that support business R&D activity, including the 150 per cent tax concession, the competitive grants for industry R&D, and the concessionalloans for commercialisation of technological innovation. Unfortunately, the sad reality is that Australia's business R&D performance is one of the poorest in the developed world. The Industry Commission's report on R&D highlights the fact that, out of the 24 OECD nations, Australia ranks 18th in terms of the share of national income that is devoted to business research and development. This is absolutely unacceptable. Access to state-of the-art technologies and the ability to innovate and adapt to the rapidly changing demands of an increasingly sophisticated market are crucial to the prosperity of Australian industry. The government's decision to exclude R&D as an eligible factory cost under the computer bounty will undoubtedly affect a large number of those firms currently receiving payments. As the Industry Commission points out: Finns not making taxable profits are generally not in a position to benefit from the sion, but if recommendations in the Commission's report on Research and Development are implemented these finns will benefit from a subsidy of 18% on R&D ... Thus some finns that lose the 8% subsidy to R&D through the bounty, could have access to an 18% subsidy. The opposition will be pursuing this course of action through other avenues. I will certainly be interested to see how the government responds to the Industry Commission's review of R&D arrangements in next week's long awaited innovation statement.",134
142,Mr LINDSAY,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (8.27 p.m.)-The government's legislation has been received with acclaim throughout industry and, indeed, other parts of the community associated with the issues contained in this legislation. The opposition's threat to convene a task force, if it were to gain government after the next election, to examine these issues-in other words, to 'revamp' the government policy in association with this issue-is code for dismantling the current bounty legislation principles that have been in existence for some considerable time. The fact of the matter, in so far as investment by government in research and development as a percentage of gross domestic product is concerned, is that we are No. 1 in the OECD. In so far as business investment in research and development in Australia is concerned, we are growing rapidly as a nation, increasing quite quickly our business investment in research and development. The shadow spokesperson mentioned a number of investment programs; there are also others. Australia does have a reputation for the rapid take-up of advanced technology.

NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.1) 1995 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Duncan; leave granted for second reading to be moved forthwith. Second Reading",136
143,Mr DUNCAN,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 1995 will amend five acts coming within the Attorney-General's portfolio. It will also consequentially amend a number of acts within the responsibility of the Department of BILL 1995 Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Industrial Relations and the Department of the Treasury. The bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature and makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation. They are explained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the bill. The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact. The amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act and the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 will rationalise the arrangements for hearing reviews of adverse or qualified security assessments made under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. Applications for review are currently heard by the Security Appeals Tribunal, which has no other function. Although it is arguable that the Security Appeals Tribunal's separate status and exclusive function were justified when it was established in 1979, its work load has declined since the early 1980s and it is now averaging less than one application a year. In fact, it has received only two applications in the last five years. Abolition of the Security Appeals Tribunal and transfer of its function to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will produce minor reductions in expenditure and administrative burden, in so far as it will no longer be necessary to have a separate annual report or separate retainers for some of its members. Moreover, the separate existence of the Security Appeals Tribunal has become increasingly theoretical as more and more of its members and staff have been drawn from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Applications for review will be heard by a new security appeals division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The legislation establishing the new division will take account of the special nature of its work by incorporating within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act those provisions of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act that relate to the confidentiality of proceedings and the qualifications for appointment. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal already has power to hear appeals against the refusal of requests under the Archives Act for access to ASIO records that are more than 30 years old. This jurisdiction will also be included in the new security appeals division because it calls for skills and knowledge similar to those involved in review of security assessments. The amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 will give effect to the recommendations of the report of the review on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The bill will also amend the act to provide that the tribunal has the power to remit matters to the decision-maker for reconsideration at any stage of the proceedings. Mr Nehl- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the parliamentary secretary is reading at such a Crosio rate that it is difficult understand what he is saying.",139
144,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,Mr Hollis)That is really your problem. I can understand him.,140
145,Mr DUNCAN,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"In January 1990, under the Courts and Tribunals Administration Amendment Act 1989, the president of the tribunal became responsible for managing the administrative affairs of the tribunal. Following this, it was agreed that the operations of the tribunal should be reviewed to assess the delivery of services by the tribunal and the effectiveness and efficiency of the tribunal's existing operation, administrative arrangements and structures. Similar reviews were undertaken in the federal and family courts. The review was conducted by representatives of the tribunal, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance between October 1990 and November 1991. The report of the review made some 200 recommendations for reform. Many of those recommendations related to the internal operation of the tribunal and have been implemented by the president of the tribunal. The review also made a number of recommendations for amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. Some changes to the act recommended by the review were made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Act 1993. This bill includes amendments to implement other recommendations of the report. The proposed amendments are directed at streamlining the procedures of the tribunal and clarifying the power of the tribunal in procedural matters. The amendments will enable the tribunal to operate more flexibly and will assist the tribunal to achieve maximum efficiency. . The bill will amend the act by providing: for two-member hearings; for the office of conference registrar; that, where the parties consent, the tribunal may dispense with a hearing if the issues are suitable for determination in the absence of the parties; that after an application for review of a decision has been lodged, the decision-maker may only vary the decision where the decision-maker is specifically authorised to do so by the relto evant statute or the tribunal and the parties consent; and for review by the tribunal of a taxation of costs; and will make a number of additional minor and consequential amendments. The bill also amends the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. The Federal Court is able to refer proceedings, with the consent of the parties, to arbitration. Currently there is no appeal mechanism for awards made in courtreferred arbitration. The bill will amend the Federal Court of Australia Act to enable a party to an arbitration to seek a review, on a question of law, of an award made in arbitration. Where the arbitration is not yet complete, a party to the arbitration will be able to request the arbitrabill tor to seek leave for a review on a question of law. The bill will repeal section 77F(3) of the Judiciary Act 1903. This section confers a personal power on the chief justice to issue commissions to persons authorising them to administer oaths and affirmations for the purposes of proceedings in the High Court. The exercise of this power ceased in 1972. Section 77G enables the court to issue such commissions so a personal power in the chief justice to do this is not necessary. In addition the High Court Rules and the Evidence Act together allow for affidavit evidence to be taken by a broad class of persons without the need for special commissions. The bill will consequentially amend the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, the Migration Act 1958, the Estate Duty Assessment Act 1914, the Federal Proceedings (Costs) Act 1981, the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1936, the PayRoll Tax Assessment Act 1941, the Pay-Roll Tax (Territories) Assessment Act 1971, and the Safety, Rehabilitation And Compensation Act 1988. The bill will also remove gender-specific language from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. I commend the bill to the House.",140
146,Mr RUDDOCK,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I will endeavour to shorten my remarks but, because the procedures do not allow for incorporation of speeches, as we have just seenMr Duncan-They in fact do. It is an outrage. They do not preclude incorporations.",141
147,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"Mr Hollis)We will not have a debate over the table, and the honourable member for Berowra will continue with his remarks.",141
148,Mr RUDDOCK,LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION,"I certainly was not debating; I was attempting to facilitate the speedy passage of the legislation, but I will eliminate some sections of the prepared notes that I could have incorporated. The coalition does not oppose the bill. The that was considered by the Senate contained a provision inserting a new reading down provision in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. That provision was opposed by the coalition and, pleasingly, the government moved an amendment to withdraw that provision during the committee stage of the bill in the Senate. I must say that was the significant difference between this speech and the second reading speech that was delivered in another place. The bill makes amendments, both of a policy nature and a technical nature, in relation to the matters enumerated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan) in his speech. The coalition had concerns with the bill in a number of specific areas, including amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act. As a result, we referred the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee for consideration. The majority of the committee endorsed the bill, and the dissenting report senators-Senators Ellison, O'Chee and Spindler--objected to the amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act which the government withdrew in the Senate. The bill abolishes the Security Appeals Tribunal and transfers its function to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This will produce minor reductions in expenditure and decrease administration. In the last five years, the function of the SAT has become increasingly redundant, as only two applications for appeal have been heard. By transferring it to the AAT, it will be no longer necessary to have a separate annual report or separate members. Increasingly, members and staff of the SAT have been drawn from the AAT. The legislation will take into account the specialised nature of the work of the SAT by incorporating within the AAT provisions of the ASIO Act which relate to confidentiality of proceedings and the qualifications for appointments. For example, the new subsection 19(3B) will prohibit any non-presidential member of the AAT with past or present ASIO employment from being assigned to the security appeals division. The Law Council of Australia did express concern over the inclusion of proposed section 39A(9)(b) which they say is draconian and unnecessary. This provision purports to exclude disclosure of certain evidence to the applicant, or a person representing the applicant, when evidence is given or submissions are made which are the subject of a minister's certificate given under that section, unless the responsible minister consents. This was one of the issues that was considered by the Senate committee. The committee made no recommendation with respect to the provision. On balance, given the need to protect the source and the method of discovery or protect dissemination of information in areas of government security, we do not oppose the provision. We would expect the need for a certificate to be very rare. Turning to amendments relating to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the bill amends the act to give effect to recommendations in the 1991 report of the review of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. These amendments are directed at streamlining the procedures of the AAT and clarifying the powers of the AAT in procedural matters. The provisions in the bill are: for two-member hearings; for the office of conference registrar; that, where the parties consent, the AAT may dispense with a hearing if the issues are suitable for determination in the absence of the parties; that, after an application for review of a decision has been lodged, the decision maker may only vary the decision where the decision maker is specifically authorised to do so by the relevant statute or the AAT and the parties, and for review by the tribunal of a taxation of costs. Some of the changes to the act recommended by the review were enacted by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Act 1993. The amendments will also provide that the AAT has power to remit matters to the decision maker for reconsideration at any stage in the proceedings. I now turn to amendments consequential on the amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. An amendment has been made to that act which incorporates the term 'district registrar' because it reflects the administrative practice of the tribunal under which much of the work is decentralised or is undertaken by the district registrar. The following acts have had a consequential amendment made to reflect this change: Estate Duty Assessment Act 1914, Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, Payroll Assessment Act 1941, Payroll (Territories) Assessment Act 1971 and Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. There are also consequential amendments to the Federal Proceedings (Costs) Act 1981 which will ensure that, where a matter is reheard by the AAT under a two-member tribunal, an applicant is entitled to a costs certificate. This will enable the Attorney-General to authorise payment in relation to a costs certificate, up to a maximum amount of $2,000. There are amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. Currently, the Federal Court is able to refer proceedings, with the consent of parties, to arbitration. However, there is no appeal mechanism for awards made in court-referred arbitration. The bill will amend the Federal Court of Australia Act to enable a party to an arbitration to seek a review, on a question of law, of an award made in arbitration. Where the arbitration is not complete, a party to the arbitration will be able to request the arbitrator to seek leave of the Federal Court for a review on a question of law. The Law Council's federal litigation section supports the changes for a referral of questions of law to the court. However, the section considers that the provision is unduly restrictive and that litigants should be able to make such an application personally in the way that such applications are contemplated by the provisions of section 39 of the Commercial Arbitration Act 1984. The Attorney-General's Department explained the reasons why the amendments differ from the Commercial Arbitration Act. Ms Bromley, the acting senior government counsel of the courts and tribunals branch, wrote to the committee chairman stating: The difficulty with allowing a party to apply directly to the Court is that parties to an arbitration may not be able to determine whether an issue in the arbitration is a question of law, particularly where parties are unrepresented. This may disrupt the arbitration proceedings, and potentially waste judicial time and resources . . . On the other hand, it is better to settle preliminary questions of law early than have the costs of arbitration wasted by proceeding with the arbitration on a doubtful or incorrect legal basisThe Law Council's second concern relates to the appeal provisions. The additional filtering mechanism applies only in determining preliminary points of law which arise during an arbitration. Proposed section 53AB of the Federal Court Act provides that, where the arbitration is complete and an award has been registered, a party to the award may apply to the court for a review, on a question of law, of the award. Under the uniform commercial arbitration legislation appeal is either with the consent of the parties or by leave of the court. The Law Council's overriding concern is that the lack of uniformity between the provisions for appeal of arbitration awards of questions of law in the uniform commercial arbitration legislation and in the Federal Court Act may lead to 'forum shopping'. On this point, the proposed amendments do not alter the existing choice of forums for contract disputes. If parties to an agreement to which the uniform commercial arbitration legislation applies have a contractual dispute they can go to private arbitration or to the Federal Court if the dispute is also about a matter the court has jurisdiction over, for example trade practices or copyright. The proposed amendments are only another means of dispute resolution within the court for parties already taking court proceedings. The bill creates an appeal mechanism for proceedings that have been referred to arbitration. At present, no such mechanism exists. The bill enables a party to seek a review of an award on a question of law. Where the arbitration is not yet complete, a party can request the arbitrator to seek leave of the Federal Court for a review on a question of law. Some concerns expressed on these provisions by the Law Council were canvassed by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. These concerns relate to the lack of consistency between the provisions and the provisions of state commercial arbitration acts. The committee heard the Attorney General's response to these concerns. No adverse comment was made by the committee with respect to the amendments. The coalition does not oppose these amendments. Amendments to the Judiciary Act: the bill repeals section 77F(3) which confers a personal power on the Chief Justice of the High Court to issue commissions to persons authorising them to administer oaths and affirmations for the purposes of proceedings in the High Court. The exercise of this power ceased in 1972. Additional amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975: the bill removes gender-specific language from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. There is a more controversial matter relating to the proposed amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 which were withdrawn. We observe that, although the government finally withdrew the provision, it does serve to illustrate the way in which the government thinks that there are certain matters with which it can get away. The bill before the Senate inserted a reading down provision which provides that, if a statutory provision could be read as having a particular application which would exceed Commonwealth power, and can be read as having a valid application, the parliament intended that the provision should have only the valid application. Recently, the High Court found the invalid applications of such provisions to be inseverable, and therefore has found such provisions wholly invalid. The proposed new section sought to provide that, if a provision in its application to a particular person, thing or circumstance et cetera would exceed Commonwealth power but would validly apply to another particular person, thing or circumstance, the parliament intended that the provision should not have the invalid application but should have the valid application. This is clearly not the way to solve the problem. The government should draft and pass clear, constitutionally valid legislation. This amendment would have changed legislation which has been interpreted to mean something contrary to that which it says. If the main point of the original legislation is to do one thing, but this is constitutionally invalid, the section may still survive on the statute book if it has another effect which is valid. While the courts would apply only the valid effect of the section, the statute book would tell the community a different story. The result of this proposed section would have been that the government would have been ignoring its own policy of plain English simplification legislation which is supposed to make the law more accessible to the people. This proposed amendment, while intended to cure badly drafted legislation, would have done so only by distorting its meaning in a way which was neither intended nor apparent from the face of the provision. Only after a degree of pressure did the government back down on this matter, probably as a result of the pressure crea-ed by the time frame in which we are operatmg. However, we welcome the amendment and we welcome the passage of this bill in the amended form. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Duncan) read a third time. NA Long Term Strategies Committee Report",141
149,Mr DOBIE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I am making a short speech tonight on behalf of the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Long Term Strategies, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). I should point out that I am the committee's deputy chairman, and that this speech was prepared for the member for Lalor. The committee appreciates the prompt and generally supportive government response to its report, The workforce of the future. However, the committee is concerned at a failure in the response to paragraph 2.31 to grasp the importance of developing an inventory ?f internationally recognised brand names. ThIS is probably because the subject falls into the grey area between the Dep-ment <;>f Emplo-­ ment, Education and Trammg, WhICh coordInated the reply, and the Department of Industry, Science and Technology. Paragraph 2.31 of the report is not about foreign investment except as an explanation for why Australia lacks an inventory of brand name goods other than wine, films, Akubra hats, RM Williams boots and Drizabone coats. Toyota Camry, IBM computers and Canon colour photocopiers are not names that automatically suggest an Australian product or encourage international consumers to show a preference for buying our goods in the way that consumers internationally look for Swedish brand names; for example, Volvo, Saab, SKF, Electrolux and Hasselblad. The committee rejects as a declaration of pessimism the response that it is more impo-­ ant for industry development that AustralIa become the 'home base' of more firms than it is for Australia to develop an inventory of internationally recognised brand names and that Australia can best hope to be the vector of other countries' products locally produced, since we have no hope of doing for ourselves what Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Finland and Denmark have done in establishing a niche in world markets for quality products that are demonstrably their own. Would it seem rational to say to the Netherlands, 'Give up Phillips, and become a home base for Sony', or to say to Sweden, 'Give up Volvo, and invite GM to set up a home base', or to say to Switzerland, 'Abandon the Nestle brand, and give up to Cadbury'? If this is not what the response means, what does it mean? It will be interesting to see whether the committee's recommendation or the government response is closer to the line which will be taken in the Innovation Statement to be announced by our Prime Minister on 6 December. I thank the House. EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING AMENDMENT BILL 1995 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Duncan; leave granted for second reading to be moved forthwith. Second Reading",144
150,Mr DUNCAN,COMMITTEES,I move: That the bill be now read a second time. I refer members to the second reading speech in the Senate Hansard for further elucidation of the content of the bill.,145
151,Mr RONALDSON,COMMITTEES,"Ballarat) (8.54 p.m.}I will not take up much of the House's time tonight and, with your leave, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would also wish bon voyage to those members who spoke here this afternoon. I thought it was a very special time in the House this afternoon. We can all be very proud of our colleagues from both sides of the fence in relation to the manner in which they spoke about themselves personally and also about some of our colleagues. Mr Dobie-Thank you!",145
152,Mr RONALDSON,COMMITTEES,"And you in particular, Sir. Of the four amendments that have come back from the other place tonight, I understand that three were coalition amendments. We were pleased that the government took them up. We were disappointed they did not take up the fourth one, but some common sense has prevailed, certainly, with three out of four. This legislation proposes to upgrade the Australian Language and Literacy Council from a committee to a fully fledged council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training. The council provides advice to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training on priority strategies and targets for the development and implementation of all aspects of Australian language and literacy policy. If ever there was a time when a focus on literacy was needed, it is now. The Schools Council, also part of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, in a recent report found that up to 25 per cent of Australian children are battling literacy problems; that is 25 per cent of young kids are having problems with basic reading and writing skills. This is the result of 13 years of Labor policy on literacy. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I have seen from our consultations that such problems play a key role in truancy and can ultimately lead to unemployment. At a time of record youth unemployment, one wonders how forming a council will ever help Australian children overcome their problems; but it may be a start, and hopefully something will come from it. Because some children are experiencing literacy problems, they feel alienated. Not only do they stop attending school but some also end up in the unemployment queue. Given that we are looking at what the potential consequences of literacy problems can be, it would be beneficial to look at the sorts of levels of youth unemployment that we are talking about. As I stand at this dispatch box, Mr Deputy Speaker, 29 per cent of 15to 19year-olds nationally are unemployed. That is 143,400 young Australians looking for work. In the 20to 24-year-old group, 274,500 young Australians are without a job. That is a total figure of 275,000 young Australians who are out of a job because of Labor's policies. The total official number of unemployed young people is equivalent to four times the population of the city of Launceston in Tasmania, three times the population of my own city, 2% times the population of the city of Townsville in Queensland and more than the population of the city of Newcastle in New South Wales. Mr Deputy Speaker, the hour is extremely late. I appreciate that people want to get home. There are many other comments that I would have liked to make, but I will leave the matter there. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Walker) read a third time.

153,Mr CHARLES,ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM,"La Trobe) (8.59 p.m.)The Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995 comprises the government's response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters entitled The 1993 federal election report of inquiry into the conduct of the federal election and matters related thereto. I well recognise that all members in this place wish to go home, so I will make my remarks very brief. I am disappointed that the schedule of amendments agreed to by the Senate and returned to the House of Representatives tonight does not include the amendment relating to truth in advertising. I spoke at great length on that issue earlier this week. Many of the recommendations in the report of the joint standing committee, a bipartisan report, have been implemented. The amendments in this bill are largely technical and designed to improve the conduct of federal elections. The amendments deal with matters such as prisoner voting, conduct of electoral roll reviews, overseas electors, close of rolls, bulk nominations, interstate voting and procedures relating to the Court of Disputed Returns. The opposition supports the bill, and did have two amendments included within the bill. The government accepted the opposition's proposal that voters on the register of general postal voters be sent ballot papers as soon as they are received by the relevant ORO without the need to complete a postal vote application form. We record our appreciation of the government's acceptance of this sensible reform, which will make it much easier for remote voters in particular to participate in elections. Hopefully it will help get us returned to the business side of this place. Senator Minchin moved an amendment in relation to this issue which the government accepted, and we are pleased about that. Bill No. 2 originally sought to remove any restriction on the right of prisoners to enrol and vote. Following the coalition's opposition to this proposal and general community outrage, the government has withdrawn this unacceptable proposition. The current arrangements relating to prisoners are unworkable, in that the disqualification refers to the maximum possible penalty for the offence and not the actual sentence being served. The opposition welcomes the government's recognition of the need for some restriction on prisoner voting rights and that it should be based on actual sentence. However, the coalition believes the actual sentence which triggers a disqualification should be reduced from five years to 12 months. The coalition believes that if someone commits an offence serious enough to carry a sentence of 12 months or more they should not be entitled to vote while in prison. Punishment for 12 months or more in prison should involve the loss of entitlement to vote for at least a year. The 12 months was in the Electoral Act before Labor came to office in 1983 and it is consistent with the period of imprisonment which disqualifies someone frum being a member of parliament. These bills unfortunately fail to address other electoral issues that the coalition members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters referred to in their dissenting report on the 1993 election. The inquiry into the 1993 election revealed widespread concern about the integrity of our electoral system. Government and the AEC admit that our system of enrolment and voting is wide open to fraud and abuse, although they claim that in fact it is not being abused. However, they are not able to prove that it is not being rorted and they cannot prove that it is not systematic and endemic electoral fraud. Coalition members of the joint standing committee recommended that, in order to increase the integrity of the system, individuals claiming entitlement to enrolment should be required to provide the AEC with proof of their identity together with evidence of their citizenship by production of a birth certificate, current passport or certificate of naturalisation. Coalition members also recommended that sub-divisional voting be reintroduced, that the AEC trial a system of voter cards in a by-election and that section 245 of the Electoral Act, which compels electors to vote, be Fepealed. The government has completely ignored the issue of electoral fraud and continues to preside over a system wide open to abuse. The government is negligent in its determination to ignore increasing community concern about the integrity of our electoral system and the fact that it is open to fraud and abuse. The coalition does not oppose this bill. The bill does not go nearly far enough in dealing with the problems in the electoral system identified in the joint standing committee's inquiry into the last election.

Mr Sciacca-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am not aware of any formal Government consideration having been given to the use of 'VP Day' as opposed to 'VJ Day' to describe the end of the war on 15 August 1945. 'VP Day' had wide usage in Australia in 1945. It was the expression used in the original Cabinet documentation prepared by my Department in July 1994, and it was used during the official launch of the program in August 1994. I responded to a question without notice on this subject on 1 February 1995, citing a number of significant contemporary references to 'VP Day' (Weekly Hansard, p 229) which supported my use of the term. Better Cities Program: Roomba and Carey Park, WA (Question No. 2580)  and Regional Development, upon notice, on 24 August 1995: (1) Further to the reference in his answer to (34) of question No. 2066 (Hansard, 19 June 1995, page 1783) to a commercially confidential environmental impact study, has he or officers of his Department seen or read the confidential document; if not (a) will he provide the details of his Department's assessment of the cost of removing the contamination referred to in the answer to part (35) and (b) how was the assessment made without access to the document; if so (c) will he provide details of the extent and nature of the contamination and (d) has he initiated NA VPDay further investigation on the effect of the contamination on the water table. (2) Who claims that the document is commercially confidential. (3) If he or his Department claims that the document is commercially confidential, (a) on what grounds is it claimed to be confidential and (b) which Commonwealth interests would be commercially affected. (4) If another party claims that the document is commercially confidential, upon what grounds is the claim made. (5) Have the lessees prepared their own report detailing contamination from leakage or spillage of oil fuels; if so, will he obtain a copy of the report and release it for public comment. (6) Has Better Cities funding been used to pay for removal of contamination from the affected area; if so, (a) will he provide details of how the level of funding required was assessed, (b) what was the type and nature of the contamination removed and (c) what follow-up study will be conducted to ensure that all contamination has been removed. (7) Was the leaseholder who caused the contamination required to pay the full cost of restoring the area to its pre-contamination state; if not, why not.",197
182,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Subsequent to my answer to part 34 of Question No. 2066 (Hansard, 19 June 1995, page 1783) the environmental site assessments prepared for Caltex Oil (Aust) P/L and BP Refinery (Kwipart nana) P/L have been made available to the public. (2) Not applicable. (3) Not applicable. (4) Not applicable. (5) As per Question 1 above. (6) Better Cities and State funds have been jointly used to accelerate the relocation of oil companies from Marlston Hill. Funding has not been allocated to particular purposes, but made as a contribution towards the costs of assessment, dismantling of facilities and site remediation. I am advised by the South West Development Commission that: (a) the level of funding is being individually negotiated by the South West Development Commission with each oil company; (b) the level of contamination is clearly detailed in the publicly available environmental review documents, but is mainly minor hydrocarbon contamination; and (c) procedures for remediation meet the requirements of the Department of Environmental Protection and include post remediation site sampling. (7) I am advised by the South West Development Commission that the oil companies are ultimately responsible for remediation of the site as a condition of their lease with the Crown. They would not be required to clear the site until the termination of their leases, some of which are valid for another 10 years, and then only to an industrial standard. The assistance given recognises the early termination of their leases and the remediation to a higher, residential standard. (Some of the contaminated soil being removed would have been able to have been remediated on site for a lesser cost or over time.)

and Air Rifle Association: Malabar Rifle Range (Question No. 2648) Mr Abbott asked the Minister for Administrative Services, upon notice, on 25 September 1995: (1) Were buildings erected by the NSW Small Bore and Air Rifle Association at the Malabar rifle range constructed under the supervision of Commonwealth officials or to Commonwealth specifications. (2) What statutory or regulatory obligations is the Commonwealth under to foster rifle clubs. (3) Did a judge criticise the Commonwealth's action in closing down the Malabar rifle range without compensating the NSW Small Bore and Air Rifle Association. (4) Will there by an Olympic standard rifle range in New South Wales at all times before the Year 2000 Olympic Games. (5) Have officers of his Department made offers to officials of the NSW Small Bore and Air Rifle Association; and if so what offers.",203
186,Mr WALKER,RATIFICATION FORCE,"I have been advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Under the Permissive Occupancy Agreement previously in place between the Department of Defence and the NSW Small Bore and Air Rifle Association, the Association was required to submit building plans for approval to the Department of Defence to ensure that they met State and local Government building specifications, were constructed within the licence area and would not compromise range safety. Any buildings constructed on the range were not required to meet Commonwealth specifications and were not supervised by Commonwealth officials. (2) The Australian Rifle Club Regulations are still in existence. However, these Regulations reflect a period when there was a close association between the Defence Force and the rifle clubs which is no longer the case. Also, as the Department of Defence no longer has a requirement for Malabar/ANZAC Rifle Range, the Commonwealth is under no obligation to support the continued occupation of the range by the shooting clubs. (3) The Commonwealth was not criticised in the judgement handed down by Mr Justice Bryson in the court hearing of 14-16 June 1994. (4) The Australian Sports Commission of the Department of Environment, Sport and Territories advises that there are two licensed Olympic small bore rifle ranges in NSW. These are located at Highland Road, Greystanes and Bringelly Road, Austral, Liverpool. The Olympic shooting venue, which will be located at Holsworthy, is anticipated to commence operations in February 1998. (5) No. Australia Post: Parcel Deliveries (Question No. 2675) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 16 October 1995. (1) Is it a fact that Australia Post offers no service which will enable a parcel to be delivered to the northern suburbs of Perth from my Canberra office overnight regardless of the time of day the item is posted. (2) Is it a fact that numerous private operators are able to provide the service; if so, why cannot Australia Post. (3) Is Australia Post's minimum guaranteed delivery time two days for the service referred to in part (1). (4) To what extent does Australia Post meet the level of service required in Australia in 1995. Mr Lee-The answer to the honourable member's question, based on information provided by Australia Post, is as follows: (1) Yes. However, Australian Air Express (AaE), a company owned jointly by Austr-is Post - d Qantas, does provide a next day dehvery servIce between Canberra and Perth suburbs, and will pickup from customer's premises as late as 5pm each work day. AaE's services are also available from post offices. Australia Post's Express Post Parcel Service has a guaranteed next day capability to Perth, but to the Central Business District (CBD) area only. (2) AaE has a similar capacity to other interstate air express operators. Australia Post's Express Post Parcel Service does not provide a guaranteed next day delivery to other than the CBD area of Perth because of airline timetable and operational constraints associated with providing customers with an Australia-wide reciprocal lodgement and delivery network. Costly, additional arrangements would be needed to extend the interstate Express Post network to include next day delivery to the whole of Perth, and this cost would have to be passed on directly to customers using this service. (3) As indicated in (1), Australia Post's Express Post Parcel Service has a guaranteed next day interstate capability to Perth, but to the CBD --a only. Prompt delivery on a non-guaranteed baSIS IS given to Express Post articles posted to or .from places outside the guaranteed net:-vork. The mterstate delivery standard for such articles posted from Canberra to Perth suburbs is Day 2. However, as also indicated in (1), AaE provides for next day delivery from Canberra to Perth suburbs. (4) Australia Post offers basically three levels of service for parcels-by Road, which can take several days depending on the distance travelled; Express Post, which is a next day guaranteed, money back, service operating within a defined Australia-wide network; and AaE, which is designed specifically to meet urgent and overnight air freight customer needs. Kamppi Constructions Pty Ltd (Question No. 2700) Mr Moore asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 18 October 1995: Did the Minister's Department or its agencies make payments to Kamppi Constructions Pty Ltd (ACN 008 600 628) in any year between 1984-85 and 1994-95; if so, (a) what sum was paid in each year and (b) for what purposes was it paid.",207

Child Crime (Question No. 2730) Mr Slipper asked the Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 25 October 1995: (1) Has his attention been drawn to remarks by Queensland Children's Court President, Judge Fred MCGuire, about the primary causes of child crime and his suggestion that a framework for children within which to learn morality and responsibility be constructed. (2) Will the Government support the construction of a framework within which to teach morality and responsibility to children; if so, how.",208
189,Mr KERR,RATIFICATION FORCE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes, Judge MCGuire's remarks about the primary causes of child crime and his suggestion that a framework for children within which to learn morality and responsibility be constructed have been noted. (2) The Government naturally supports the construction of a framework within which to teach morality and responsibility to children. We recognise that such teaching is one of the basic objectives of the entire education system. Responsibility for such programs lies with the States in the development of appropriate curricula in their education systems. Although there are no federal programs in existence which address the Judge's specific suggestions, the Government is, nevertheless, promoting family values through the Family Skills Training Program, which is part of two Commonwealth initiatives: the youth strategy announced by the Commonwealth as part of the broader social justice strategy during the 1989/90 Budget and the national strategy for the prevention of child abuse, arising from recommendation 21 of the National Committee on Violence Report. There are now seventeen family skills programs in operation throughout Australia. Family skills training offers group programs for parents about a range of subject areas such as child development, conflict resolution, communication skills, consequences of behaviour and self-esteem building. In addition the Safer Australia strategy, which was announced in the Justice Statement in May this year, is designed to promote both situational and social crime prevention initiatives. Young people and crime are one of the three priority areas which are to be addressed in the first year of Safer Australia's operation. The other two being house burglary and violence in Aboriginal communities.

(2) Agreements governing the commercialisation of new discoveries are made with overseas interests when such arrangements offer the maximum available return to Australia on the originating research. This usually occurs where the scale of finance or the technical and commercial expertise required for commercialisation do not reside within Australia. Australia seeks to maximise the returns in such circumstances through equity based partnerships and/or appropriate licensing arrangements-as is common practice for most technologically advanced economies of comparable size to Australia. Australia does not normally forfeit access to those of its technologies commercialised abroad. Patent licensing and collaborative arrangements protect Australia's interests in these technologies, while Australian researchers are entitled to conduct further research on them and protect the resulting improvements. (3) As an example of overseas ownership of emerging technologies, Professor Clarke referred to the importation of chicken germplasm. Industry sources advise that within the last 2 years, fertilised chicken eggs have been brought into Australia under quarantine, mainly from Scandinavia and the UK. This egg importation ensures an adequate supply of suitable material for the poultry industry and royalties in respect of the chickens are paid as part of the commercial agreements. According to industry sources, the royalties are paid on less than half the total flock and are estimated to be less than I cent per bird-substantially less than the 2.5 cents indicated in the newspaper reports. I am advised that these eggs have been bred and produced by standard breeding techniques, are not biotechnological products and have been imported to maintain breeding stocks. I am also advised that many Australian breeders continue to use their own stocks, breeding them in the same standard way and without these royalty payments. (4) The Government's policies are directed, amongst other things, at enhancing the capacity of Australian industries to invest in and exploit core technologies developed in Australia. Relevant programs include the tax concession for R&D, Competitive Grants for R&D, Concessional Loans for Commercialisation of Technological Innovation, the Australian Technology Group, Pooled Development Funds, the Development and Application of Technology in Industry Program, the AusIndustry suite of business advisory service and networking programs, the National Technology Access and Diffusion Network, the Pharmaceutical Industry Development Program, the Computer Bounty, the Information Technology Development Program, the Partnerships for Development and Fixed Term Arrangement Program, the Telecommunications Industry Development Plans, the Marine Science and Technology Program, and the National Space Program. Policy is also directed at bringing public sector research, the major source of core technology development, into closer alignment with Australian industry development opportunities so as to maximise its chances of commercialisation in Australia. Relevant initiatives include the performance indicators negotiated with research agencies under their Triennium Funding Agreements, including external earnings targets, the Cooperative Research Centres Program, the presence of a commercialisation arm in almost every university, and the direction of certain Australian Research Council programs to fostering industry linkages with higher education research and research training. These specific policies operate in the context of phased reductions in industry protection, the deregulation of the financial market, and a comprehensive agenda for microeconomic reform, which together are bringing about a restructuring of Australian industry towards high value added manufacturing and services. Such restructuring is essential to creating an environment in which Australian developed core technologies will be commercialised by Australian industry.
