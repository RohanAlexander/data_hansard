NA ENCOURAGEMENT BILL. SECOND READING. Debate resumed from 21st October (vide page 5969) on motion by Sir WILLIAM tically LYNEThat the Bill be now read a second time.",13
15,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES," I have listened to the debates upon the measure, utterly fail to see the force of the ments which have been used by the able member for Eden-Monaro and who are supporting it. I object to the sure, first, because, being associated the Tariff, it is certain that it will callyfixthe import duties upon iron, and cause it is a declared part of the policy the advocates of the Bill that the protection granted under the Tariff shall be conentirely tinued after the bonus perir/3 has expired. The imposition of these duties will have effect of increasing the price of raw iron very large extent, and will therefore production, because, as has been admitted, Canadian iron enters very largely into the raw of a great number of industries. Once granted, however, the bonus is certain continued. Upon that point I need do more than refer to the fact t'hat at the sent time an agitation is being carried with a view to give permanence to the bonuses. If we can judge from the of the iron industry in America, protection, either direct or indirect, leads to tremendous fluctuations in production. That has the history of the iron industry in the States for the last seventy or eighty years. Over-production is followed by periods collapse, and then the pendulum again swings to the other extreme. That. I hardly say, does not indicate a 'healthy dition of affairs. If the bonuses are granted there is certain to be a demand their increase. Canada started in 1884 with a bonus of $2 per ton upon raw iron. This was increased in 1899 to $3 per ton. What has been the result ? According to a blue book published by order of the House of Commons during the last few months, Mr Llewellyn Smith, a member of the Board of Trade, statesBut, although the bonus is on a higher scale in ORDERS. the case of pig iron made from native ores, the pig iron produced in Canada from Canadian ore is much less than that produced from imported ores, and the greater part of the Canadian ore is exported. That indicates the failure of the bonus system, because the greater part of the iron manufactured in Canada is produced from other than native ores. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, although supporting the Bill, pracindicated the failure of the Canadian bonus system by thefigureshe quoted, which showed that Canada had produced 274,000 tons of pig iron, of which only 46,000 tons had been produced from native ores. A l and I though the iron bonus has been in arguoperation in Canada since, 1 thinlc, honor1884, it was first intended to cover others a period of only seven or eight meayears. In other words, it was considered with that the total demand in the home markets practiwould be met within that period. T'h« beproduction of iron from local ores is, howof ever, so small that no other conclusion can be arrived at than that the bonus system has m failed to accomplish its object. In Canada the local price of iron is actually the higher than the export price. In fact, the to a iron-masters of the United Kingdom, rather hamper than those of Canada, benefit from the bonus, because a great material deal of the surplus not required for it is local purposes is dumped down in the to be United Kingdom at prices lower than those no ruling in the Dominion. I forget the exact prefigures, but I think that close upon 125,000 on tons of Canadian iron was dumped down in sugar the United Kingdom during the year behistory fore last. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro also mentioned that of the completed furnaces in Canada upon the been 31st December, 1902, seven only were in United blast, five of them being idle. ' I need scarcely point out that that did not indiof cate that the industry was as flourishing as the supporters of the bonus expected that need it would have been. According to the arconguments of some honourable members, the once policy of encouragement upon what it is for now proposed to launch us is not required. It has been stated by Mr Sandford that iron can be locally produced from native ores at a cost of about 35s. per ton, which, I think, is about half the import price. That shows that the local manufacturer will have the benefit of substantial natural protection. If we have, all the natural advantages claimed by the supporters of the Bill, in the shape of large ore deposits, ample coal supplies, and other requisites, the industry should not require any special protection such as that now contemplated. It must be remembered that our local markets are particularly limited. I am not quite sure as to the quantity of iron consumed in the Commonwealth, but I understand that it amounts to about 35,000 tons per annum, one-third of which quantity is required by the States Governments. Therefore, if we gave a bonus for the manufacture of iron, we should enable those engaged in the industry to impose a stiff tax upon the States Governments as consumers. Then, again, I contend that our ore bodies are not sufficiently concentrated, and that in America, and, in fact, everywhere else, such conditions have been found to considerably discount the chances of success. It has been shown that the amount of employment that will be afforded by the establishment of the industry will be comparatively small. In America, in connection with the Duquesne blast furnaces, Pittsburg, less than 500 men are^ employed, although the output is about"" 750,000 tons annually. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro referred to the tremendous development which has taken place in the iron production of America, and by inference alleged that this was due to the policy which had been adopted of protecting the industry. His comparative statistics, however, possess very little value, seeing that he starts with the year 1867, because we know that in America production was at a minimum from 1861 to 1865. But the moment that the war ended, industry received a tremendous impetus, in which, of course, the iron industry participated. From about 1865, the world's demand for iron as a raw material has largely increased. This to a great extent accounts for the American development. The production of the world at the present time is about 50,000,000 tons annually.",13
16,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,That fact argues that the demand will increase in Australia.,14
17,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,"It is an argument that we do not require to foster the industry by means of a bonus, because of the natural demand for the raw material. Without any change in the fiscal conditions in America, production has enormously increased within the past thirty or forty years. This fact has been due to the greatly increased demand for iron in various directions-for example, in the ship-building line. The ironclad and the steel-bound vessel have been substituted for the old "" wooden walls."" Then, again, the local demand for iron in America is greater than that in any other country. We all know that in that country iron enters very largely into house construction. It forms the skeleton frame of a great many of the buildings there. Then, again, the bridges in the United States are mostly construcfed of iron. I repeat that the local demand has developed sufficiently during the past thirty or forty years to account for the great increase in iron production in America. At the same time, we must recollect that as far back as 1826 the iron industry there enjoyed a protection of 100 per cent. This duty continued to operate for many years, but, despite its aid, the industry remained in its infancy until about 1865, thus indicating that it is not protection which is responsible for its great development. In the United Kingdom, no protection has been afforded to the iron industry, which, however, has fairly well maintained its petition. In i860, the production in the United States amounted to only 821,000 tons, whereas it is now nearly 18,000,000 tons. The German production in i860, was 519,000 tons, but the production in the United Kingdom in that year wa& 3,800,000 tons. ' So that, comparative increases are no test of the efficacy of pro.tection as against free-trade. But the production in the United Kingdom did not stop at 3,800,000 torts. It also took advantage of the increased demand, due to the causes which I have mentioned , so that we find 1 that whilst the United States produced nearly 18,000,000 tons of iron in 1902-3, the United Kingdom produced 8,680.000 tons, thus indicating no decay of the industry in the mother country.",14
18,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURES,The production of the United States is the greater.,14
19,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,"But we ^cannot compare the enormous deposits of the United States with those of the United Kingdom. The latter annually imports about 60,000 tons of Swedish ore for special purposes. It also imports ductile iron from Canada, much to the benefit of the manufactures of the United Kingdom, because the products of this iron are so much cheaper. The effect of .this dumping has been to enable the ironfounders of the United Kingdom to successfully compete against Germany for contracts in Copenhagen and several other places. The production in Germany is about 8,5:18,000 tons per annum. As a matter of fact, the production per head in the United Kingdom is about equal to that of America, which, after all, is the true basis of comparison. In 1902-3, the production per head in the United States was C23, in the United Kingdom it was""o'2i, in Germany-wher e the industry is stiffly protected-it was only o""i5, and in Russiawhere it is also protected'-it was C02. I do not think that I need elaborate my argument any further. I have shown that under free-trade conditions, the iron industry has flourished. Consequently, if we possess tremendous deposits of iron and' coal, the protection of coal against the imported article is sufficient to permit of the development of those deposits. If the industry has not been established, it is not because of the absence of a bo.nu'3. I claim that it would establish a bad principle to give such a tremendous bonus to private individuals. In the first place, the benefit thus conferred must to a large extent be monopolized by a few, and, in the second, the incidental benefits will be confined practically to one or two States, which possess the greatest deposits of ore, and in which the conditions for successful production are known to exist. I am firmly of opinion that unless .there is competition from outside, the local producers who receive the bonus will be able to mulct the State as an entity by charging increased prices. For these reasons, I shall vote against .the Bill.",14
20,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURES," I intend to support the second reading of this measure, and my only regret is that it cannot be immediately passed through Committee, so that it might become law as soon as possible. I cannot understand the arguments of the honourable and learned member for Angas. He has affirmed that the establishment of the iron industry will not afford a very large amount of employment. I do not propose to auote any statistics in that connection. I merely wish to view the matter from a broad stand-point. I would ask the honourable member if he _ is not aware that the importations of iron into the Commonwealth last year were valued at about j£8,ooo,ooo?",15
21,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,That amount includes the value of manufactured articles.,15
22,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURES,"Of course it does. When we reflect that last year about ,£8,000,000 were expended by the Commonwealth in the purchase of manufactured articles, of which iron and steel form the base, it is clear that the local production of iron would afford a very large measure of employment. The honourable and learned member also affirms that the industry requires no bonus to assist its establishment. Nature has endowed almost every State in Australia with large deposits of iron ore, and yet thousands of men are out of employment. The honourable and learned member for Angas has referred to New South Wales. Does he not know that several attempts to manufacture iron and steel from native ore have been made in that State ? What was the result ? The moment the attempt was made a combination of importers was established for the purpose of crushing the industry. In New South Wales, hundreds of thousands of pounds have been expended in an endeavour to develop the iron industry. The article produced there is acknowledged to be equal to any produced in the world. The honourable and learned member for Angas is opposed to the encouragement of this industry either by bonus, or by way of a fair protective duty. I would point out to him that the natural demand to which he referred has always been present. Yet year after year, we find that no successful attempt has been made to establish the industry, and to provide employment to a large number of artisans and mechanics. To my mind this Bill should not receive opposition even from the free-trade section of this House, seeing that it provides that no bonus shall be payable until a certain article has actually been produced. It will thus be seen that the money which it is proposed.to expend by way of bonus cannot be misapplied, as has been the case in some of the States. Those who embark upon the undertaking will have to incur an expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds before they can produce the necessary pig-iron to enable them to obtain the modest bonus of 12s. per ton. These bonuses are to extend over a period of only five years, and the total amount to be paid in any one year is not! to exceed j£5o,ooo.  started in the same way.",15
23,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURES,We cannot expect to make a start with the manufacture of iron and steel unless we offer some encourageis ment to capitalists to invest their money the industry. The sooner we do so the better.  where it will end.,16
24,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURES,That is a matter with which we have no concern; it will be for future Parliament to say where the system shall end. All we have to consider sent is whether it is desirable to establish the industry.,16
25,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,I thought the orable member was a Chamberlainite. Mr. Chamberlain does not approve of this tem.,16
26,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURES,"What does it matter, so far as this question is concerned, whether ment of a vast number of persons, and I am a ""Chamberlainite or not ?",16
27,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,Are not these bonuses to be paid to secure the establishhas ment of a new industry ?,16
28,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURES,"I may agree with honourable member for Robertson on questions, and disagree with him on others. I do not know what opinion Mr Chamberment lain holds in regard to this matter. is a matter of no concern to me j I am cerned only with the opinions which honorenhanced its prosperity ? able members may entertain with regard it. We have the' power to say whether the production of iron and steel in Australia shall be encouraged, but Mr Chamberlain has not. We have to determine the question for ourselves, and it is from that point of view that I approach its attacks consideration. It is an undeniable fact that nature has richly endowed most, if not all, of the States, with the in raw materials necessary for this indusstrong trv. She has distributed them very bountitold fiill v in New South Wales, and with a still more liberal hand in Tasmania, whilst good supplies are also to be obtained in Vicwith toria and Queensland. All this wealth lying dormant in the earth, and surely we can devise some means to give it a comof mercial value. If honourable members opupon posite object to the imposition of duties encourage the industry, we can adopt some other system. Are not bonuses really given for the' encouragement of other industries We are continually assisting the developacres ment of the agricultural, pastoral, and other industries of. Australia by votes various kinds, which, although known by different names, are really bonuses - The equities of the Bill are so manifest that they should appeal to every free-trader in the Parliament. It cannot be said that it proposed to impose duties before the inin dustry is established. If that course were followed, the price of these articles to the consumer would be increased pending the see competition which would come into play with the establishment of the industry, and which would rapidly level prices. But all that it is proposed to do is to grant bonuses dura ing a period of five years in order that the industry may be given a fair opportunity at preto become thoroughly established. When that has been accomplished we shall have a competition prevailing between the imhonporters and the local manufacturers which will bring down prices to a fair level, and sysbe to the advantage of the consumer. We have to bear in mind that the establishment of the industry would lead to the employ1 to the creation of great wealth. The honourable and learned member for Angas quoted certain statistics with which it is not my intention - to deal. But the is it not a fact that every nation some which has thoroughly developed its industries by direct legislative encouragehas reaped the full benefit of such a That system-that it has opened up new avenues conof employment in this way, and materially The honourable to and learned member for Angas has referred to the teeming millions of the-old world and the system that prevails there, but how could we expect capitalists to invest their money in this industry in Australia unless we offered them some assistance in meeting the of a ring of monopolistic importers who would do their utmost to crush them? We simply propose to assist the industry its infant days, so that it may become a and healthy one. Capitalists have us, in petitions addressed to the House and by other means, that, if they were given an opportunity to invest in the industry a reasonable guarantee that they would is obtain some fair return for their outlay, they would be prepared to avail themselves it , but that they must decline to enter the undertaking without any State aid to against the competition of a strong monopolistic combination. It is well known that during the life of the last Parliament a ? company purchased something like twenty of land near Sydney, in the hope that this Bill would be passed, and of that they intended to expend hundreds of thousands of pounds in the erection of the necessary machinery for the utilization of the native iron ores of New South Wales and Tasmania. In the Blue Mountains, where nature has also distributed the raw material with a lavish hand, a serious attempt was likewise made by a company to embark upon the industry on a very large scale. Capital was to be obtained in England, and nearly one million pounds was to be at once expended in laying down the foundations of the industry. These preliminaries, however, came to a sudden termination, because it was seen that there was a hesitancy on the part of a section of the Parliament to give those interested a guarantee that the money which they proposed to invest in this way would not the entirely lost. That is the position which we have to face today. The honourable and learned member for Angas quoted certain statistics, from which he endeavoured to show that the United Kingdom had held its own with other parts of the world in the manufacture of iron and steel. I am at a loss to know where he obtained' his information. That which I have obtained is quite the reverse. The United Kingdom, instead of holding its own with other countries in the production of iron and steel, has fallen behind.",16
29,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,"I know that it has in the matter of comparative production, but not in the aggregate.",17
30,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURES,"I am speaking of the position of the industry in the United Kingdom, as compared with that of Germany and the United States of America.",17
31,Mr GLYNN,MANUFACTURES,I admitted that the output in those countries had increased. I gave the figures relating to the production in the United Kingdom and the United States of ^^Ift 61*1 Oft,17
32,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURES,"In view of that, admission, I need not pursue this line of argument further than to ask why the industry in Germany and the United States of America has made such wonderf u l progress as compared with that made by it in the United Kingdom? On the one hand, we find England' under free-trade retrogressing, whilst, on the other, the United States of America and Germany, as the result of a protective policy, are rapidly forging ahead. I think it has been held by the greatest writers on the-subject that the prosperity of a nation depends upon the utilization of its own native productions. It has been shown again and again that the iron and steel industry offers the widest field for employment. involves not merely the extraction of the coal and iron from the soil, but numerous branches of manufacture which give employment to thousands of people, and are productive of much wealth. We have all the raw material in the Commonwealth, and it remains for us only to devise some means to give it a commercial value. Would any one have the temerity to say that if we could manufacture only one-half of the imports of iron, and steel into Australia which would represent a value of ""Between ^3,000,000 and ,£4,000.000 per annumit would not be advantageous to the capitalist, the worker, and the people generally ? Would it not result in the building up of kindred industries? The honourable ancl learned member for Angas has referred to the importation of iron for bridge building purposes. We all know that it is used in these and many other directions, and surely we ought to devise some means to encourage its local manufacture, if only for the benefit of our people. I am anxious that this Bill shouicl be passed as soon as possible, and therefore shall not detain the House any further. I believe that the Bill will be attended with the most beneficial results-that it will lead to the establishment of an industry which will provide employment for hundreds of persons now. seeking work in vain, and bear favourable comparison with the pastoral, agricultural, ancl other industries in the community as a producer of wealth and a means of employment. I am satisfied that once established, it would become, if not the leading, at all events one of the leading, - industries of Australia.",17
33,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"Hindmarsh) Although the session has extendejd over many months, I am sorry to say that nothing has been done by us to encourage the utilization of the native products of Australia, and to give direct employment to the many thousands of unemployed in the Commonwealth. In the closing days of the session we have now an opportunity to do something that will lead to the opening up of a wide field of employment. The honourable and learned member for Angas objects to the introduction of a bonus system in this way, ' because he says Ave do not know what it would lead to. He has referred to the fact that Canada, having granted a bonus for the encouragement of the iron and steel industry, was subsequently called upon to It largely increase it. But because Canada, in increasing the bonus, has done something which, in his opinion, is not in the best interests of the country that is no reason why he should say that we should be likely to do the same. I am satisfied that the Parliament of the Dominion of Canada would not have increased the bonus unless it thought it would be to the advantage of the country, and I am equally satisfied that if some future Parliament of Australia decided to continue or increase the bonuses proposed in this Bill, it would have equally good grounds for doing so. I do not think, however, that it would be necessary, in our case, to grant any increase. The honourable and learned member for Angas urged that if iron could be produced so much cheaper in the Commonwealth than in other parts of "" the world, there ought to be sufficient natural protection to encourage its local manufacture. But the capitalists who are prepared, under reasonable'conditions, to put their money into a venture of this kind, require some protection at the outset, because they know that the importers would combine and make a determined effort to crush them at the inception of their operations. They would do their utmost, even at the risk'of sustaining enormous losses, to cripple the industry in its infancy. We have to give those who are ready to take up this work an opportunity to fight against such a combination on something like equal terms. The system which this Bill proposes is frequently resorted to in other lands. The honourable and learned member for Angas asserted that the granting of a bonus - in Canada had led to dumping. It has always been the cry of free-traders that very little dumping .takes place, but now, because it suits the honourable member's purpose to adopt a different view, he asserts that the introduction of this system would have, that result. If the granting of bonuses has proved beneficial in other cases, why should we not adopt the system to secure the establishment of the iron and steel industry in Australia ? We have beer, told by the' honourable member for Riverina that ,£8,000,000 worth of manufactured iron and steel goods is yearly imported into the Commonwealth, and T hold that triers is no reason why we should not manufacture all these goods for ourselves. If we did so it would certainly be to the material advantage of our producers. We know that they do not reap the advantage of the cheaply - produced articles of the old country. Mr Hutchison. Only the other day I was informed that a machine used by our farmers, which has been sold here for ,£37, now, because of a combination, costs ,£45. If we gave manufacturers sufficient encouragement to erect plant in Australia to make such machinery, I am satisfied that our people would be able to get their implements at a cheaper rate than they do now. The honourable arid learned member for Angas told us that the Australian demand is a limited one, and yet he gave figures showing that the output of the world hadi increased from 15,000,000 to 50,000,000 tons. Undoubtedly our requirements are at the present time limited, but when the iron industry is established here they will have become much larger than they are now. No one will deny that that industry is the basis of all manufacturing industries, and would give a vast amount of employment. I shall not enter into a detailed discussion on the subject, however, because I am anxious to see the Bill pushed through. The members of the party to which I belong, and I myself, are strongly in favour of the nationalization of the iron industry, but if we are unable to carry a clause which would provide for that, I shall be prepared to allow the industry to be conducted by private enterprise. It has been objected that if the industry is .conducted by private enterprise, a monopoly will be created, because it will not be possible to establish more than one or two iron works in the Commonwealth. My answer to that is, that if it becomes a monopoly, it will be the easiest thing in the world to provide for the taking over of it by the Government on reasonable terms. In my opinion, the Commonwealth will not suffer, andi our producers will not suffer, by the granting of the proposed bonus. As was pointed out by the honourable member for Riverina, there is an abundant supply of coal in Australia, and iron ore is to be found in all the States. South Australia possesses what has been proved to be the finest ore in the Commonwealth, in unlimited quantities, although she has no coal. In course of time, however, that ore will either be smelted locally or will be sent for smelting to other parts of the Commonwealth where there is coal. It will be a reflection on this House if , after such a wasted session, we allow Parliament to be prorogued without doing something, not only for our workers, but also for our unemployed. The honourable and learned member for Angas has pointed out that during war time an extraordinary impetus has been given to the iron industry of the United States, but that afterwards a reaction has set in which has caused the employees engaged in it to suffer. That must occur in connection with every country affected by war. We, however, need not fear, either that our iron industry will receive an impetus from such a cause, or that there will be a consequent dismissal of employees during a subsequent period of depression.",17
34,Mr SALMON,MANUFACTURES," I desire to add to what has already been said the expression of my earnest hope that we shall be allowed to bring this matter to a conclusion. I feel that the Tariff which was passed by the lastParliament will not be anything like complete until a measure such as this has been enacted. Indeed, it was anticipated when division VIA . was agreed to that a measure of this kind would follow almost immediately. To my mind, the arguments which have been adduced against the granting of bonuses have not been altogether fair, because the worse results of the bonus system have been put before the House as though they were the ordinary and only results. In Victoria we have an object lesson in this matter of which the House might well take notice. There was a time in our history when we were in depths of depression such as we had never previously reached. we were dragged out of them through the operation of a bonus. There is not the slightest doubt that the butter.bonus, which was instituted by the Hon. J. L . Dow, was the main factor in assisting Victoria to successfully combat the terrible financial difficulties which we had then to face. Some honourable' members have referred to that bonus by way of reproach, because of certain revelations which have recently been made concerning the channels into which part of it flowed. But those revelations do not affect either the principle or the result; they only show that had the bonus in all cases been paid to the right persons, the beneficial result would have been far greater. Notwithstanding the improper diversion of money which Parliament intended to benefit a particular class, that class and the community generally have benefited inestimably from the operation of the bonus.",19
35,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,It established the butter industry.,19
36,Mr SALMON,MANUFACTURES,"Undoubtedl y it did, and I would remind those who have said that once a bonus is granted the Government must keep on spoon-feeding the industry, that in the case of the Victorian butter industry no bonus has been paid for many years past, but the industry is able to stand alone, notwithstanding the very improper proceedings of many connected with the butter export trade In discussing a matter of this kind Ave should not pick out particular cases of abuse, but should rely on proper administration for the right conduct of the system Ave adopt. I feel sure that Ave have no need to fear a repetition of unfortunate occurrences such as those which in Victoria have done so much to damage Avhat I regard 'as often a necessary policy for the establishment of a neAv industry. In common Will those who have preceded me, I desire that Ave shall deal Will the measure as rapidly as possible, and, although under other circumstances, I Would speak at greater length, I feel that the interests which Ave have at heart will be best served by brevity. Canada has been cited as a country which has found it necessary to increase her bonuses, notwithstanding the fact that they were accompanied by a substantial import duty. The results of the Canadian bonus system, however, should give us the highest anticipations for the success of the iron industry in Australia. Although at first it Avas found But necessary to increase the bonuses, they have been gradually decreasing, there having been recently a reduction of is. 3d., and, probably at no distant date, the granting of bonuses will entirely cease. The honourable member for Hindmarsh alluded to the fact that, although Ave have been in session for nine months continuously, and have Avorked assiduously and honestly, A\'e have not been able to accomplish any legislation to give the employment which is so much needed by our people, and I Would urge upon.trie House the fact that the passing of this measure will open up aA'enues of employment, which will gi\ e Avork r to a large number of men Avho are at present Avithout it. In addition to the iron industry itself, there will be a number of subsidiary industries which wiN employ thousands of men. It has been anticipated that 3,000 men AA'ill find employment Avithin two years and a half in connection with the iron industry itself, but that is no criterion of the number which will find employment in connection Will other industries if Ave provide for the rapid, and, I think, cheaper, production of iron and steel in Australia. We have magnificent resources, ancl everything necessary for the success of the iron industry. required is to start it , and to give it opportunities for development. We must recognise, however, that, because of our limited population, it is rather much to expect private enterprise to expend the enormous capital required for the inception of the industry, without a guarantee that it will have some prospect of avoiding loss. To my mind, no time should wasted in bringing about a new era of prosperity, in which Australia will be independent of all other parts of the world. By securing an efficient and regular supply of iron,we shall beretaining in their employment, the workers who are now here, and' shall be finding employment for others, while, if a European war should arise, we shall be able to keep our industries going without intermission.",19
37,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES," When the Bill was before the last Parliament, I strenuously opposed it , and although I do not think it necessary to repeat now the arguments which I advanced then, my opinion as to the inadvisability of employing public funds to build up a monopoly in the iron industry has in no way changed. The honourable member for Laanecoorie spoke of ihe Victorian butter bonus as on all fours with the proposed bonus for the production of iron, but there are many points of difference - In the first place, the butter bonuses granted in Victoria and South Australia were given, not for the production, but for the export of butter, the requirements of the home market having been already complied with. Furthermore, the circumstances surrounding the butter industry were such as to preclude any possibility of a monopoly. The conditions of the iron industry, however, are such that the establishment of a monopoly is inevitable. It is not suggested that there could be any competition except from outside. There is not room in the Comtnonwe'alth for) more' than oine smelting works, and therefore those who establish the industry must exercise control over the whole iron production of Australia. I do not desire to aid in bringing about such a condition of affairs. I intend, however, to vote for the second reading of the measure in the hope that honourable members will agree to offer a bonus to any State that may be willing to undertake the establishment of the industry. Failing that, we must impose conditions which will enable a State, or the Commonwealth, at any time, to take over the industry. My attitude toA l l that is wards the Bill at a later stage will be determined by the shape which it assumes in Committee.",20
38,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,Provisio n is now made in the Bill for the State taking over the industry.,20
39,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,"Yes , but that may not be retained in the measure. I do not think there is much chance of passing the be Bil l this session, but it is certainly due to those honourable members who have taken such a keen interest in it that the fullest opportunity should be presented for discussion.",20
40,Mr SKENE,MANUFACTURES," I intend, to vote for the second reading of the Bill , because I think that its principle is consistent with the policy we have adopted for the Commonwealth. The great American humourist, Mark Twain, has said that a hair-splitting nicety of creed is necessary for the salvation of some souls, and I think that we are rather inclined to hair-splitting when we discuss in the abstract such a question as that now before us. Whilst I call myself a free-trader, I believe with John Stuart M ill , that it may be well in a new country to encourage industry by the granting of bonuses or bounties.",20
41,Mr HENRY WILLIS,MANUFACTURES,I suppose the honourable member knows that Cobden said that the expression of that idea had undone all the good that he had ever - been able to accomplish ?,20
42,Mr SKENE,MANUFACTURES,"I have often heard it said that John Stuart M ill recanted to a certain extent, but I have not been able to find any record of his recantation. The honourable member for Coolgardie told me that the proof was to be found in a letter written to Sir Henry Parkes, contained in a volume in our Library.",20
43,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURES,Joh n Stuart Mill wrote a letter to Sir Henry Parkes to the effect that the way in which his doctrine had been applied in Australia had made him regret that he had ever published it.,20
44,Mr SKENE,MANUFACTURES,"But that is not a recan'tation of his doctrine. I should agree with that myself. In private life we adopt the principle that is embodied in this Bill. I have done it myself, and my father before me. I refer to spending certain sums of money under such circumstances that they will yield no direct return, but will probablv confer indirect benefits upon us, which will m,ore than compensate us for the outlay. It appears to me that the conditions surrounding the iron industry are comparalively simple. Those who engage in farming occupations are largely dependent upon climatic and other conditions, which render their occupation very precarious, whereas if we have large iron deposits and the necessary workmen to utilize them, we can calculate, with some degree of certainty, upon the result. Of course, capital must be invested in order to enable the workmen to operate upon the material. I am opposed to the State carrying on the industry. The capitalists who embarked in this enterprise, would have to invest such a large amount of money before they could claim one penny of the bonus that we should have a very substantial guarantee of their bona fides. I think-we may rely upon a very large amount of employment being provided,. The honourable member for Angas took the contrary view; but I would point, out that in Carnegie's works in the United States, no less than 168,000 workmen are employed. That is, of course, a very large undertaking, and we should do well if we could find employment for one-tenth of that number.",20
45,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURES,All those hands are not employed in the production of pig iron' alone.,21
46,Mr SKENE,MANUFACTURES,That is the number of hands employed in wBat are called the principal and subsidiary works.,21
47,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,"Thos e men are engaged in the production of iron and iron goods, such as rails and other manufactured products.",21
48,Mr SKENE,MANUFACTURES,"Yes , but a large number are engaged in the production of the raw material. I obtained my figures direct from the secretary of the company which is now conducting Carnegie's works, and I think that they are sufficient to show that a large number of hands will find employment if the iron industry is established in our midst. The honourable member for Hindmarsh says that we could safeguard ourselves against the creation of an undesirable monopoly by empowering the State to take over the industry. There is a much easier method of protecting the interests of the public. If the competition among the producers of iron within the Commonwealth should prove to be insufficient to keep down prices, we might suspend the operation of, the protective duties, and thus bring the local manufacturers into direct competition with the outside world until they were disposed to act reasonably.",21
49,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURES,"Does the honourable member think that a duty should be imposed upon agricultural implements in the manner proposed by the Bill ? 2 Mr SKENE - I shall consider that matter when the time comes. At present, we are dealing only with the bonuses. I shall be guided to a very large extent by the trend of events in the meantime. If the competition amongst those engaged in the manufacture of iron kept down prices, I should not object to the imposition of reasonable duties.",21
50,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURES,"Does the honourable member think it possible that more than one iron works will be established, when a single blast furnace could produce all the iron necessary to meet the requirements of Australia and India?",21
51,Mr SKENE,MANUFACTURES,"I am told that there is a very large outlet for raw and manufactured iron. I couldi not imagine that any capitalists would be willing to invest, perhaps, ^£1,000,000, as has been stated in connection with one company, in such an undertaking as that contemplated unless they were fully assured that they would find a profitable outlet for their products. Further, our remoteness from the centres of iron production and manufacture would - place us at a great disadvantage in the event of our supplies from abroad being interrupted by the outbreak of war. We might not be able to procure sufficient iron for the manufacture of the munitions of war necessary for our defence. Therefore, I think that it is highly desirable that we should be self-sustaining in that regard. At present, I am in favour of granting bonuses, and I shall be prepared, afterwards, to consider how f ar protection should be extended to the industry by means of import duties. I am. strongly opposed to imposing protective duties for all time. I do not think an industry should be bolstered up when it has reached the stage of senile decay. Bonuses should be given and duties should be imposed purely for the purpose of giving an industry a start. I shall vote for the second reading of the Bill.  1 ment appear to me to present a most humiliating spectacle in connection with this measure. Their life depends upon a single vote, and they have found it necessary to placate certain honourable members by affording facilities for the discussion of a Bill by means of which it is proposed to tax the people of the Commonweath to the extent instituted there in 1883.",21
52,Mr SALMON,MANUFACTURES,"The last Government did the same thing.  to do so. If they had taken any such action, r 1 should have condemned them in terms similar to those I am now employing. One would judge from the debate that all the evidence collected was in favour of the proposal in the Bill. But what are the facts? The advocates of the measure have not dared to refer to .the report of the Bonus Commission. Is there any evidence in that report that there was anything like unanimity on the part of those honorablp members who were deputed tospeciallv investigate this question? Twelve members were appointed to that Commission. They collected a considerable mass of evidence, which they carefully sifted, and they were equally divided upon the question of whether it was wise to offer this bonus. What is called the dissentient report states: We, the undersigned members of the Commission, are against the passage through Parliament of the Bill for the payment of bonuses by the Federal Government for the establishment of the iron industry within the Commonwealth. That report is signed by W. M. Hughes, Samuel Winter Cooke, J. W'.' Kirwan, Geo. W. Fuller, J. Chris. Watson, and Joseph Cook. It proceeds :We recognise that the Commonwealth possesses vast deposits of iron ore of high grade, coal, & c , for iron works. Ample evidence 'has given to satisfy us on that point. Furthermore, we believe it would be a considerable advantage ta have the industry in operation in a flourishing ,£350,000. condition, and on a propeT basis. In our opinion, however, such a desirable result would not best promoted by the B i ll we have been asked consider. The Bill provides for the payment of ^324,000 of the people's money to private individuals engaged in an enterprise for their vate gain. There can be no guarantee that bonuses proposed would permanently establish the industry, though it is probable the inducesard ments offered might be instrumental in forming speculative companies. Among the most important paragraphs in the report are the following: One of the witnesses, Mr Sandford, managsame ing director of the Eskbank Iron Works, New Scuth Wales, stated that he had made an agree to a protective policy. ment with an English syndicate to spend ^250,000 in extending the Lithgow Bill passecl. In answer to another question, Mr. Sandford said that to make pig-iron he wanted a plant involving an expenditure of from ,£100,000 upon salt? tn ^125,000. This estimate is less than half the sum proposed to be paid in bonuses. They addThe Canadian experience is not encouraging. The bonus system for iron production was first Subsequently a Bill was passed, in 1897, further continuing the system. Another Bill was carried in 1899 providing for the diminution of the bounties by a sliding scale expiring in 1907. In July of this year the Dominion Government decided to postpone the operation of this sliding scale for one year, which practically means a further increase in the bounties paid. Nearly all the witnesses examined before the Commission agreed that the payment of bonuses would be useless unless followed by a duty. Experience shows that if the payment of bonuses be commenced the liability of the Commonwealth will not be limited to the sum proposed under the F111 , but that further Government aid will be sought. The evidence failed to show that there was any commercial necessity for the bonuses proposed. Mr Sandford said he could produce pig-iron at Lithgow under 35s. a ton. Allowing for freight (to Sydney, Melbourne, and other parts of the Commonwealth, he could, on this showing, compete favourably with any imported pig-iron . Other witnesses, who, however, had 1 less experience than Mr Sandford, doubted the correctness of his estimate of cost. But, .pn the supposition of his having made an under estimate, he would still, even without a bonus, be in an excellent position as compared with the imported commodity. No effort was made to bring forward witnesses against the' Bill. Notwithstanding that fact, the evidence given failed to establish a case in its favour. Several witnesses thought the establishment of ironworks in the Commonwealth premature, and much of the evidence was strongly against any attempt by the Government to establish the iron industry by the payment of bonuses. Yet in the face of a report of that character the House is asked, at the eleventh hour, to been pass a measure which has been handed over to the control of a private imember involving an initial expenditure of something like Experience of the operation be of the bonus system induces me to say that to when once it has been initiated, we can never foresee where it will end. In Canada, for example, the original intention was pritolimit its operation to a few years. But the it has been almost indefinitely extended. No doubt, if we perused the Canadian Hanof twenty-one years ago, we should find that the arguments which were then adduced in support of the introduction of the bonus system, are identical with those which have been advanced in this House. The reasons are constantly ur""ed in regard Yet Victoria, after thirty-five years' experience of protection, works if the cannot do without it.",22
53,Mr WATKINS,MANUFACTURES,"What about the duty  salt industry did not ask to be assisted by the payment of a bonus. What has been the result of the bonus system in Canada? In 1883, the Parliament of the Dominion passed an Act offering a bounty of $1.50 per ton for the production of pig-iron. In 1889, that bounty was reduced to $1 per ton; but in 1892 another Act was passed increasing the bounty to $2 per ton, and providing that it should terminate in 1897. The parties concerned, however, took good care to secure themselves before that time expired. In 1894 they secured the passing of anAct providing for the payment of bounties of $2 per ton on pig-iron, $2 per! ton on puddled bars, and $2 per ton on steel billets made from Canadian pig. This Act was to remain in operation for five years; but without waiting for that period to elapse, the Dominion Parliament, in 1897, repealed the Act; increased the bounties to $3 per ton on steel ingots made of not less than 50 per cent. Canadian pig, and made other changes. From 1883 until 1897 bounties were given to encourage the manufacture of pig-iron from local ore, but the manufacturers found that it suited their purpose to use ore obtained from parts beyond the Dominion, and they were then successful in securing the passing of an Act providing for the payment of bounties of $3 per ton on steel ingots of not less than 50 per ceint. of Canadian pig, $3 per ton on puddled bars, $3 per ton on pig-iron, and $2 per ton on the proportion made from foreign ore. In 1898 another Act was passed declaring that the provisions of this measure should be retrospective, and come into force as from 1897. Yet, in the face of such evidence, we are asked to believe that the amounts set out in this Bil l represent the whole expenditure which the Commonwealth will be asked to sanction. Do honourable members believe that? If we pass legislation of this character, what be the next step ? We shall be told that we have expended £[324,000 to establish the iron industry, and that upon the strength of our action certain persons have been induced to invest their capital in that enterprise. We shall be assured that they cannot continue operations, and that unless they are granted further assistance the works will have to be closed, as a result of which hundreds 'of men will be thrown out of employment. I venture to predict that that statement will be made in this House before many years have passed. To-dav we are called upon to consider not merelv the expenditure of £[250,000 upon pig-iron made from Australian ore, puddled bar iron made from Australian pig-iron, and steel made from Australian pig-iron. We have to consider whether, having been parties to the establishment of this industry, we shall not be obliged to continue hand-feeding it to the extent that has been found necessary elsewhere. Judging by the indifference displayed by honourable members, one would think that this was a matter of no importance-that we were here not as the custodians of the public purse, but merely to vote large sums of money for the benefit of private individuals. A Commission, was appointed to deal with this question, and although we are told by them that they did not seek any evidence in opposition to the scheme, their inquiries resulted in the report I have quoted. It would be an absolute calamity to pass this Bill , and I think it is a matter for regret, that we should even be asked to deal with such a measure. Let me now refer briefly to some of the other articles, the local manufacture of which it is proposed to encourage by means of the bonus system. The B i ll proposes that a bonus shall be paid for the local manufacture of wire-netting, and at a certain date a duty is also to be imposed to encourage the industry. A similar course is to be followed in regard to the articles mentioned in the other divisions of the Bill . What will this mean to our primary producers? I represent a large number of farmers, who find it necessary to protect their crops by the use of wire-netting. There are vast wheat-growing areas in South Australia, where, in the absence of wire-netting fences, it would be impossible to protect the crops from the ravages of rabbits and other vermin. Yet it is proposed to increase the duty on an article which is so largely used in this way. A similar proposition was made will when the Tariff Bill was under consideration, and I was one of those who strenuously opposed it. Farmers and pastoralists are already put to an additional expenditure of at least ad. per acre-in respect of the great bulk of the wheat areas of South Australia-by having to provide wire-netting for the protection of their crops, and I fail to see how any honourable member could support a proposal that must result in the price of the commodity being increased. Prior to the establishment of the Commonwealth, there was a duty of ,£2 ios. per ton on barbed wire and wire netting imported into Victoria; but it did not result in the establishment of a sound local industry. In New South Wales, where there was no duty imposed on either of these articles, a wire-netting manufactory was satisfactorily established. The Commission, in a summary of the imported materials which would be affected by the passing of this Bill, show that ,£70,000 worth of wire-netting was, on the average, annually imported into the Commonwealth during the five years ending 31st December, 1902, whilst the value of barbed wire annually imported during the same period was ,£60,000. These are two of the articles, the local production of which is to be encouraged at a future date by means'of Customs duties. In the face of open competition, factories for the making of wire netting were successfully established in New South Wales, whilst in Victoria, with a heavy import duty on barbed wire, it was only possible to establish a manufactory employing some twenty-nine who received an average wage of 28s. 3d. per week. In order achieve this magnificent result, those who use barbed wire in Victoria were called upon to bear the burden of a duty of ,£2 ios. per ton. We are now asked to give men a bonus for manufacturing which they have been able to produce in Australia without any protection whatever. It is idle for honourable members who support this measure to say that the imposition of a duty on any article does not increase its price to the consumer. That is a fallacy which I successfully exposed during the Tariff debate. I showed that, the figures for twelve months, the difference between ihe price of barbed wire and wire netting in Victoria, where there was a duty of ,£2 ios. per ton, and in New South Wales, where the articles were on the free list, was within 5s. of the amount of .the duty. I showed also that the public were deceived in regard to the gauge of wire they were using; that a ton of imported wire, gauge 12, went one mile twenty-nine chains further than did a ton of the local article, which was also sold as gauge 12. In the face of all these facts we are asked to crown a profitless session by pledging the Commonwealth to an undertaking that at the outset would involve an expenditure of ,£350,000. fore we see the end of the we shall in all. probability have expended more like £[3,500,000 than the £[350,000 which we are now asked to vote. How many honourable members would have the courage to refuse to vote for the continuation of the bonus, or to oppose a heavy duty to encourage the industry once it had been started? The present proposal is  one of the results of the unsatisfactory state of parties in this House. It would have been a thousand times better if a dissolution had taken place long ago, and had resulted in the return of parties in such a way as to allow the Government of the day to have something like reasonable control over public business. I shall not say that it is a scandal, because it would be out of order to do so, but the fact that a measure involving an expenditure of .£350,000 has been handed over to a private member of this House reflects no credit on the Government. I do not say this with any desire to be discourteous to the honourable member for Hume, who, as the result of a mere accident, happens to be in charge of the Bill today. The Bill was handed over to a hands, Government supporter, as one of those sops which are usually distributed when a Goto vernment depends fpr its existence on one vote. It goes very close to what would be in other places called something that I would be out of order in suggesting in this House. Let me now place before honorthat able members some figures, showing the amount distributed by way of bonuses for the manufacture of iron and steel in Canada. The figures are as follows: - 1884, $44,000; 1885, $38,000; 1886, $39,000; 1887, $59,000; 1888, $33,000; 1889, $37,000; 1890, $25,000; 1891, $20,000; 1892, $30,000; 1893, $93,000-a . big intaking crease; 1894, $125,000; 1895, $63,000; 1898, $165,000; 1899, $187,000; in 1900, $238,000; in 1901, $351,000; in 1902, $693,000; and in 1903,- $670,000, making a total of $3,087,833. I venture to say that we shall have the same experience in Australia if , in a weak moment, in order to pacify a section of the supporters of the Government, we allow this measure to pass Avithout a 'further investigation of its consequences. No Parliament should be asked to deal Will a measure like this under circumstances such as those which noAv surround us. H a l f of our members have gone aAvay to various parts of the Continent, and the rest are preparing to go, and yet, in a thin House, AAe r Be- are asked to agree to a proposal which insystem, vokes not only the expenditure provided for in the schedule, but a policy which, in the years to come, will be fraught Will the most serious consequences to Australia. An attempt is noAv being made to introduce the thin end of the wedge. Once AAe agree to r the proposals contained in the schedule, we shall be practically committed to an additional expenditure of hundreds of thoufrom sands of pounds.",22
54,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,Why ?  the experience of other countries? Does country. nos the honourable member know what has happened in Canada?,25
55,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"If Canada has dbne wrong, that is not a reason why we should follow her example.  to, and the iron industry established on basis of the proposals contained in it, and ,£350,000 are found insufficient, the honorworkmen able member will be one of those who will ask, '' Are we going to close the works, turn men out of employment, for the sake of a few thousands more?"" He will ask for another slice of the public loaf then. He knows that it is throwing dust in the eyes of the public to pretend that £350,000 will be the total expenditure on these bonuses. I may not see the time, but my words, which will stand in Hansard, realized when I say that the day will come when the expenditure will run into millions. The Prime Minister is supposed to hold same views as I do, and has spoken strongly on this subject, and yet, at the eleventh hour, he is giving every facility the bleeding of the country in this way, because the Government are practically dependent for existence on the vote of one man. It is calamitous for Australia be in that position. Under ordinary cirheard cumstances the measure would not have slightest chance of being passed. It is less, however, to make a further protest. Some honourable members may say that I tection am wrong, but time will show that my forecap cast is a correct one. I cannot vote for second reading of the Bill, and I regret that other men who hold the same opinions as do have either been silent in connection with this measure, or are allowing it to go by default.",25
56,Mr WILKS,MANUFACTURES,They have not all been this silent. The honourable member will find good many voting with him.  deavour is being made to have the measure passed without a division. I should like to know where those who hold the same view as I do are.,25

59,Mr FOWLER,MANUFACTURES,"The Labour Party are the not committed to this proposal.  members of the party will vote for it.

However, I have stated my opinions, and I feel sure that every word which I have uttered will be substantiates within the next fifteen or twenty",25
60,Mr BROWN,MANUFACTURES," If there is any man who has taken a greater interest in this question, and done more to advance it, than another, he is the right honourable member for Adelaide, who brought the measure before the last Parliament, and was Chairman of the Select Committee, subsequently made a Royal Commission, which investigated the subject. Whatever may be our opinions upon the proposal, we all regret his inability to be present on this occasion to take an active part in the work which he has initiated, and to which he has devoted so much talent and ability. Next to him, the honourable member for Hume, who brought the Bill before this Parliament, is entitled to praise, because he has shown a considerable amount of interest in the matter, and has endeavoured to obtain a conclusion in regard to it. I wish, however, lo enter my strong protest against the passing of the measure. I believe that it is in contravention of the best traditions of the tish Constitution that a measure of this kind should be in the hands of a private member. It is generally recognised in British communities that measures of large importance, affecting the people generally, and especially those having to do with the Taising, and expenditure of public money, should be brought before Parliament by Ministers, with the concurrence of the Executive of the day. The fact that the Executive is not responsible for this measure is, to my mind, a strong reason why we should reject it. In support of that contention, I would instance what took place in New South Wales in regard to the Payment of Members Bill. When that measure was first introduced into the arena of politics, it was taken in hand by Mr Traill, a private member, who did what may be termed the pioneering work in connection with the movement. The Premier of the clay, however-that great constitutional authority, Hie late Sir Henry Parkes-re fused to allow the subject to be dealt with by a private member. He was personally opposed to payment of members, but to get over the difficulty allowed a member of his Cabinet to introduce the Bill, and the then Postmaster-General brought it forward as a semi-Government measure. passed through the Legislative Assembly by a substantial majoritv. and rejected by the Council. Then Sir Henry Parkes said, "" Although I am opposed to the principles of the Bill, I recognise that it is the desire of the representatives of the people that it shall be passed."" He immediately made the measure a Government Bill, and returned it to the Council, with the full' weight of his sanction, and it was passed into law - He laid down the constitutional principle that no measure imposing taxation or providing for expenditure should be. submitted to honourable members unless it had the authority of the Executive behind it. I protest against the departure that has been made from those sound constitutional lines. The Bill proposes to take out of the pockets of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth £[324,000 for the purpose of providing bonuses for certain iprtivalte individuals. Under our financial conditions, which involve the necessity of handing over to the States Governments three-quarters of the revenue raised through the Customs, we shall be obliged to burden the taxpayers to an enormous extent, in order to enable us to provide the funds necessary to pay these Bri- bonuses. If we introduce a system under which any private individual can come to the House and ask for the expenditure of large sums of money, we shall expose the, community to the risk of great injury, and I therefore wish to enter my strongest protest against the manner in which the Bill has been brought before us. I have no personal feeling against the honourable member who is in charge of the Bill. When the Government refused to take it up he was quite within his rights in endeavouring to do his best to place it upon the Statutebook. On a former occasion I said that I was not averse to granting assistance to the iron industry, and I certainly prefer the more direct method of paying bonuses to that of affording protection by means of Customs duties. Bonuses involve the payment of a definite sum, and the benefits which they confer are readily ascertainable, whereas under a protective system it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which the public are deriving advantage. I admit that the iron industry deserves special consideration at the hands of this Parliament and of the States Parliaments. We use iron products perhaps to a greater extent than any other community in proportion to population. There is another important It was aspect of this question, which to my mind is worthy of consideration. The States Governments are consumers of iron to a very large degree. We have nationalized our railways; all our highways are under Government control, and die States have to enter upon the construction of large and expensive bridges. The telegraph and telephone systems are also in the hands of the Government, and other public works in which large quantities of ironwork are used, have to be undertaken. In most other countries these enterprizes are left to private individuals. The States Governments, as a matter of fact, absorb fully one-third of the iron imported into the Commonwealth, and I therefore contend that the proposed ironworks should be under direct State management. If the States Governments can manage such large under-' takings as our railways, they may safely be trusted to carry on the manufacture of iron. Therefore, I am prepared to pass a measure of this kind, if provision is made for placing the industry under State control. It is necessary to provide the most effective safeguards when grants are made to private individuals in the manner contemplated by the Bill. I am led to this conclusion by the study of the bonus system in Canada. The Dominion has to a greater degree than any other country built up her industries by means of bonuses. The construction of railways and the opening up of means of communication by canals has been carried out by private enterprise, assisted by large subsidies from the Government. The Dominion Government have paid £[40,000,000, the Provincial Governments £[6,600,000, and the Municipal Governments £[360,000 to private companies in order to encourage the development of industries, and to provide means of communication. This money has been spent under direct Government control. The people of Canada, however, have not the same assets that we have to show for the expenditure of money upon public works. ' In addition to these money grants, the Government have handed over 50,000,000 acres of their territory to private companies in consideration of their carrying out large public works. One of the industries which the Canadian Government have endeavoured to encourage and place upon a sound basis is the iron industry. The first bonuses were granted in 1883. They were intended to operate only for a short period, but the system has been in existence for over twenty years, and there does not seem to be the slightest disposition to bring it to an end. In fact the pressure brought to bear upon the Legislature is in the direction of extending and increasing it. In 1884, the first year during which the bonus was in operation, 44,000 dollars were paid by way of bonus for the 'production of iron. In 1891, owing to the depression which was then prevalent in the Dominion, the grant fell to 20,000 dollars, but in 1901 increased activity took place, and greater opposition was shown to the American companies, and bonuses amounting to 351,000 dollars were paid. Last year, when we were considering this question, we were informed by cable that a large syndicate had been formed to further develop the iron industry in Canada. That syndicate had a capital of £[3,600,000 and was to be subsidized by a grant of £[1,000,000 on behalf of the Canadian Government. These facts bear out the contention of the honourable and learned member for Angas, that in committing ourselves to a Bill of this character, we cannot possibly measure our future liabilitie's. I have no desire to offer any factious opposition to this measure. I have already shown the extent to which Canadian industries have been assisted by the payment of bonuses. A writer in the Economist of 3rd May, 1902, deals with this aspect of the question. He says:It is scarcely necessary to say that a good deal of corruption in Dominion, provincial, and municipal affairs is engendered by this system. ' The subsidy is almost always "" m i l k e d "" by the politicians who grant it, whilst the contractor, whose profit comes from construction, and sometimes, too, by handling the bonds, takes care of those in and out of Parliament who may be disposed to question the wisdom of developing the country in this fashion. It is only right to add, however, that the best men on both sides of politics would like to see the whole business abandoned. Unfortunately, the promoters and contractors have made a great many people believe that subsidies are necessary to enable us to keep step in material advancement with the United States, an argument which every ,census shows to be fallacious, and which, at best, is merely saying that it is right to do evil that good may come. I enter my protest against legislation of this character. In Committee, I shall endeavour to secure the allocation of this grant to the States Governments. Failing that, I reserve to myself the right to take a hostile stand towards the Bill at a later stage.' Sir WILLIAM LYNE) - In introducing this measure on the 23rd March, I made rather a lengthy speech, and quoted many statistics. I intended upon this oca casion to reply at length to many speeches which have since been made, and particularly to some which were delivered this morning. But, in view of the short period of time at our disposal, I think that I shall best be consulting the interests of the measure, if I condense my remarks as much as possible. I wish especially to refer to one or two matters which were touched upon by the honourable member for Grey, who denounced the bonus system as it has been applied to the industry in America and Canada, and particularly the latter country. But I should like honourable members to recollect that, even if a considerable sum of money has been expended in developing the production of iron in those countries, the result has been to establish a gigantic industry. The iron industry at Pittsburg is the largest in the world; but it could never have attained its present proportions had it not been for the assistance rendered by the Government by way of bonus, and a protective duty. It is true that in Canada, during the last twelve or eighteen months, it has been found necessary to prevent the gradual reduction of the bonus; but it should be remembered I5ETUKN showing the Ijrroim into the Commonwealth IROX and STEEL in Agricultural Implements and Ma-' nhiuery Appliances, Electrical Anchors Arms, Rifles, &c.

Sir William Lyne. that that country is still only supplying itself with the iron it requires for machinery and other purposes. The iron industry there has become a great industry, which is giving employment to a large number of artisans. In Australia, I venture to say that if the industry could be started, irrespective of whether it costs us little or much-the result would be to the advantage of the community, not only from the point of view of wealth, but from the stand-point of the employment which it would offer. I hold in my hand a return which I obtained from the Customs Department some time ago-and which should therefore be reliable-showin g the value of the imports of iron into Australia since 1899. I am inclined to think that thefigureswhich it contains will startle some honourable members. The return, which is a lengthy one, is complete in every respect.

The necessity for this arises from the States' classifications varying in the amount of details given, e.g., New South Wales had one heading ""Hardware and Ironmongery,"" while in others of the States, in addition to this there were "" manufactures of metals,"" and ""galvanized iron manufactures""; again, in machinery such items as cream separators, typewriters, and weighing machines, were entered' separately in some and not in other States; under the circumstances, therefore, it has been deemed advisable to group such lines rather than attempt greater detail. It should also be borne in mind that the term manufacture of metaU necessarily includes items of metals other than iron and steel; the proportion would be small, but it is impossible to state it, and further, that a reliable comparison as regards particular items between the years 1902 or 1903 (more especially the latter), and any previous year, is rendered practically impossible by reason of the Commonwealth Tariff and classifications differing so widely from those of the several States. The totals are, approximately-in 1899, £[6,000,000; in 1900, £[8,000,000; in 1901, £[8,400,000; in 1902, £[8,100,000; and in 1903, £[7,200,000.  that return are not borne out by the eviI dence given before the Royal Commission which investigated this question.",26

"" I therefore move That after the letter "" e"" in the word "" manufactures"" the letter "" r "" be inserted. think there are good reasons lor supporting this amendment. The object of the Bill is to give (£2*50,000, in roundfigures;,to two or three men who are prepared to establish iron works. According to the report of the Commission, the capital required to set up an up-to-date furnace would be something like shall £[125,000, so that it must be recognised that only a company or a very wealthy man could establish the necessary works.

74,Mr SPENCE,MANUFACTURES,"I take the point of order that the amendment goes beyond the order of leave, and is irrelevant.

Is it not true that the money which we are asked to vote will benefit one firm only ?",33
111,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,"I would remind the honourable member that whatever his private opinions may be, there are certainrules which govern parliamentary debate, and he must conform to those rules.  the powers at my command to prevent the Bill being pushed any further during the current session.",33
112,Mr LONSDALE,MANUFACTURES," The honourable member for Parramatta has lectured myself and others for the attitude which we have adopted towards this Bill. I claim that I am .justified in blocking sage by every means in my power. I am responsible to the country, and not to any member of this House, for my action.",33
113,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member is a "" wrecker.""",33
114,Mr LONSDALE,MANUFACTURES,"Yes , I am a I ""wrecker"" so - far as this Bill is concerned. I intend to support the amendment, and later on will submit other amendments with a view to prevent the measure being passed into law this session. What right have we to confer any undue advantage upon a section of the community? I refuse to assist private individuals with State money. Why should we take money out of the pockets of the man. who is earning only 30s. a week for the purpose of enriching the capitalists?",33
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"Parramatta) The honourable member for New England has accused me of lecturing him. I delivered no lecture, so far as I am aware. I merely appealed to honourable members who are opposed to this Bill to evidence their opposition in a legitimate way. The honourable member for Grey has expressed astonishment at my action in connection with this matter. I claim that my action upon it has been straightforward, and I defy anybody to challenge any vote which I cast upon the Tariff. I did not go wrong upon salt, or upon iron.",33
116,Mr WEBSTER,MANUFACTURES,What has salt to do with this Bill?,33
117,Mr TOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES,"It has nothing to do with the Bill, but it has something to do with the propriety of the honourable member for Grey taking exception to the action of another honourable member. All that I wish to say is that this Bill should be proceeded with so that finality may be reached. That at least is due to those who are interested in its fate outside this House. A very easy method of determining the matter is by voting upon the amendment which will shortly come under consideration. I appeal to honourable members to allow the fate of the measure to be definitely decided.",33
118,Mr LONSDALE,MANUFACTURES," In reply to the honourable member for Parramatta, I wish to say that I desire equal treatment all round. I think that the men who will suffer by the imposition of this taxation should receive some consideration. If we can afford to give these manufacturers £[350,000, I say that we can better expend that money by assisting the poorer classes of the community. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Member s of Parits pas- liament, for instance.",33
119,Mr LONSDALE,MANUFACTURES,No ; there are plenty of people who are worse off than we are. I am sick of all this talk about the salaries of Members of Parliament.,34
120,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,I would remind the honourable member that his remarks are distinctly outside the scope of - the amendment.,34
121,Mr LONSDALE,MANUFACTURES,"I wish to secure equal treatment for all. I have never yet seen any legislation enacted to assist those who are really suffering. The wealthythe men with large capital-see m always to receive special consideration. Why should we give this money to manufacturers? If we are going to distribute it, let us divide it fairlv among the poor and the rich.",34
122,Mr GB EDWARDS,MANUFACTURES," I must deprecate the condition into which the Committee has fallen. The amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa is certainly not an amendment of principle. All that he has said in support, of it was advanced by him on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, and I would remind him that there are other clauses on which he might reasonably take action to defeat the principle to which he is so strongly opposed. It seems to me to be a gross waste of time to be considering amendments of the short title of the Bill. It merely serves to show that in these the last hours of the session the Committee and the House generally is not in a proper frame of mind to deal with such important legislation. Those who complain that a piomise was made that the Bill should not be taken beyond the second-reading stage would be fully justified in moving that gress be reported; for undoubtedly the Prime Minister informed the House yesterday that it was intended only to secure the second reading of the Bill, and not to pass it through the Committee stage. If a motion to report progress were moved, I should support it, notwithstanding that I voted for the second reading of the Bill. I think that we have done as much as we can during this session, so far as the consideration of this measure is concerned, and that it is undesirable that the time of the Committee should be wasted in discussing amendments on which no question of principle is involved. I admire the outspokenness of the honourable member for New England, and the honourable and learned member for Werriwa; but, as they had a full opportunity during the .second-reading debate to express the strong views which they 'hold on this question, they have no right to block the consideration of the measure by means of dilatory motions. It is open to either of them to move that progress be reported, and why should we waste time, as we have been doing, when we might dispose of the business for this afternoon, and return to our homes ? Mr Webster. (Gwydir) - I appeal to the honourable member for New England and the honourable member for Werriwa to refrain from moving inconsequential amendments, which serve only to make this House look ridiculous in the eyes of the people. There are other clauses dealing with important questions of principle, on which they might rightly take action, if they desired to do so; but they certainly ought nor to persist in their present line of conduct, which is calculated to make themselves the laughing stock of the whole community.",34
123,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES," I - move That the Chairman do now leave the Cfiair, report progress, and ask leave to sit again. It would be idle to continue this debate, in view of the temper of the Committee. Many honourable members have returned to their homes, feeling that they might safely do so in view of the understanding arrived at yesterday that this Bill would not be taken beyond the second-reading stage, and I do not think any attempt should be made to pass it through the Committee.",34
124,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURES,That is why I have objected.,34
125,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"I thoroughly agree pro- with those who take exception to the more or less frivolous amendments that have been moved. Notice has been given of certain amendments which should be moved, and would require very careful consideration. It is only fair that honourable members should not be taken by surprise in this way. There was a general understanding yesterday that the Bill would not be considered in Committee, and in these circumstances we have not had an opportunity to give its provisions the consideration, which their importance warrants. The Rill requires to be carefully discussed by a thoroughly representative Committee. Many honourable members who are absent would certainly desire to discuss the measure, and to see their names appearing in the division lists. In their interests, as well as in those of the country at large, I think that progress should be reported. I deprecate the attempt that is being made to rush the Bill through the Committee at the present time. When Bills of this character, involving sums of such magnitude, are handed over to the care of private members, a grave suspicion may be created in the public mind that all is not as it ought to be.",34
126,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,"That is a wholly unwarrantable reflection, and the honourable member knows it.",35
127,Mr LONSDALE,MANUFACTURES,Look at the lobbying that has taken place.,35
128,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES,"I assert that the attempt to rush this Bill through such a sparsely attended Committee may give rise to an impression in the public mind that all is not as it should be, especially having regard to the fact that it is not a Government measure, but one that has been - handed over to a private member of the House. As I have already said, I do not believe there is any ground for such suspicion; but we must pay due regard to the Bill public sentiment, and certainly it is our duty to conserve the rights of the public. have in this Bill a proposal to vote mense sum-for what purpose? national enterprise ? No. Simply to put money into the pockets of private indivimore duals, for their own private gain. I think member. it is necessary that the eyes of the people should be opened to the true character of this measure. If we are to rush it through in this way, we shall be justified in hurriedly measures to divert public funds into the pockets of private individuals. Where this going to end ? The honourable member able member. for Grey has said, with deal of justification, that this prohonorable posal may prove to be only the record thin end of the wedge. Once we establish a precedent for legislation of this classlegislation to which I am absolutely posed it is impossible to say what will the outcome. It is impossible for us to deal with this measure this afternoon, it ought to be dealt with, in the public terests, and it is for that reason that mit my motion.",35
129,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURES," I hope that the honourable member for Hume, who is charge of the Bill, will agree to the to report progress. If he opposes it, I shall vote with him ; but I trust that he will see the wisdom of adopting the course posed, in view of the fact that it will an absolute waste of time to further sider the Bill this afternoon. Even if passed by the Committee today, it would be impossible for the Senate to deal with it during the present session, and under our standing orders, it would lapse. We should thus have to make a fresh start next session. In all the circumstances, I think it is highly desirable to report progress, for the further consideration of the Bill must result only in an absolute waste of time, and may engender bad feeling.",35
130,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURES," I certainly think that the motion to report progress should be agreed to. This has been a week of arduous work for the Chairman, and we are making an undue demand upon his powers of endurance by calling upon him to remain any longer in the chair this afternoon. We all are tired, and the best thing we can do is to report progress, and leave for our homes.",35
131,Mr HUME COOK,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member may leave; others are prepared to rea main and proceed with the consideration of,35
132,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURES,-The honourable memWe ber has only been in attendance for about an imfive minutes. during the whole week. For a Mr HUME COOK - That is not correct. My attendance during the session has been regular than has that of the honourable,35
133,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURES,"The honourable member suddenly enters the Chamber, and makes interjections which are inaccurate andimpertinent. I hope, Mr Chairman, that you passing other will protect me.",35
134,Mr HUMECOOK,MANUFACTURES,"I am prepared to is back my record against that of the honora good Mr ROBINSON - No one, not even the member himself, knows what that means. In the interests of the finances of the Commonwealth and of the States, I hope that this highly important proposal opwill be deferred until honourable members be are in a more vigorous frame of mind to deal with it. It embodies a number of conas tentious principles, and there are several inimportant amendments to be considered, I subnot the least among which is that of which I have given notice.",35
135,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURES,I have given notice of an in amendment that the necessary funds shall motion be raised by means of direct taxation.,35
136,Mr ROBINSON,MANUFACTURES,"I should like to have an opportunity to give that proposal earnest proconsideration; because I have fully made be up my mind to vote against it. Then, the conhonorable and learned member for Northit were ern Melbourne has given notice of a most important amendment, which deserves great consideration. I protest against rushing this measure through the Committee with indecent haste. Such conduct should' call for reprobation, not only in this Chamber, but in the press, and upon the public platform. Considering the condition of the finances of the States, we should not at the instance of a private member be asked to vote ,£35°,ooo in the manner proposed.",35
137,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES," I ask honourable members to allow the first two clauses, which are really only formal, to pass. If they do so, I promise not to go further with the Bill today.",36
138,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURES,"In that case, I am willing to withdraw my amendment.  ance of the honourable member for Hume that he will report progress when we have dealt with the ftrst two clauses of the Bill, I withdraw my opposition, but I wish first to make a personal explanation in regard to a matter in which I have been gravely misrepresented. The vote which I gave on the salt duty has been referred to during this discussion in a manner which allowed the inference to be drawn that I voted for that duty without any qualification. As a matter of fact, I voted to reduce the duty on salt from 20s. to ios., as a reference to the Hansard record will show, ancl, later, when 'it was necessary to arrive at a compromise between ios. and 15s., I pledged my word to accept 12s. 6d.. ancl voted accordingly. The honourable member for Parramatta, who was responsible for the innuendo, is not altogether without reproach in regard to what was done in connection with the Tariff, because he voted for a duty on eggs.",36
139,Mr JOHNSON,MANUFACTURES," In view of the promise of the honourable member for Hume to report progress when the first two clauses of the Bill have been dealt with. I will, with the concurrence of the Committee, withdraw my motion.",36
140,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES, I object to the withdrawal. It is evident that a section of the Committee is determined that the Bill shall' not be passed.,36
141,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURES,"Coul d it set through the Senate, even if we agreed to it?",36
142,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"It cannot be passed, so long as the honourable a d learned member obstructs its passage by moving all sorts of ridiculous amendments.",36
143,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURES,"Is that remark in order? Mr HUTCHISON:-Well , considering the source of these amendments, it is not necessary to characterize thern as ridiculous; that goes without saving. I , ' at any rate, can go back to my constituents, and tell them that, although I was exceedingly anxious that this measure should be passed, and believe that a large majority is in favour of doing something for the encouragement of our manufacturing industries, in order to provide employment for our people, nothing has been done, because of the obstruction of a small minority. Although this Bill has been before Parliament for two years, nothing has been done. We have given no consideration to the thousands who are walking the streets of our cities, looking for employment. When honourable members seek to do something for the unemployed, they are met with the unjustifiable charge that they are associating themselves with political trickery and jobbery. I repudiate that charge.",36
144,Mr THOMAS,MANUFACTURES,The Labour Party as a body killed the Bill last time.,36
145,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,The honourable member may not refer to expressions which have been withdrawn.,36
146,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,"When I go back to my constituency, and the unemployed come to me for bread and butter, to feed their starving wives and children, I shall tell them that a small section of honourable members prevented the passing of a Bill which would"" have given work lo thousands.",36
147,Mr LONSDALE,MANUFACTURES," The honourable member for Hindmarsh has accused me and others of seeking to take the bread and butter from the mouths of the people, whereas our object is to do all we can in their interests. The difference between us concerns the method in which the people can best be benefited, and I repudiate such a charge as has just been made. My sympathies are with the working classes more than are those of the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I have always done everything that I could for them, whereas be comes . here to help to take money out of the pockets of the people, and to give it to the rich. He, a pretended labour man, stands here today as one who will do all he can to help the wealthy against the poor.",36
148,Mr CONROY,MANUFACTURES," It is with great surprise that I have heard the rer marks of the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I ask him, how is the money which it is now proposed to give to certain manufacturers collected ? Is it not perhaps, taken from the workers and the poor of the community? Great indeed must be the power of the name, when a labour man can advocate the taking of £[300,000 from trie poor of Australia to hand over manufacturers! .",36
149,Mr HUTCHISON,MANUFACTURES,That is not being than done.,37

152,The CHAIRMAN,MANUFACTURES,The honourable and learned member may not ascribe to intentions by which he says he is not governed.,37

156,Mr CHANTER,MANUFACTURES,Such a statement of the objects of the Bil l is an absolutely fair one to place before the country.,37

Its intention is to encourage the investment of capital for the manufacture of iron and steel, in order to provide employment for the workers, and to increase wealth and prosperity of the country. I cannot understand the opposition to the measure. If honourable members object its principles, let them say so straightbeing forwardly, and attempt by legitimate methods to secure what amendments are deemed necessary. They have no right I 13 D to two to try to make the people believe that the objects of the Bill are other I have stated them to be.

159,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MANUFACTURES," I should not have risen again but for the honvigorous onslaught made upon me by the i nhonorable member for Grey. I feel very keenly the attack upon my fiscal reputation. It is no joke when one has eggs thrown at ill . him, and the' honourable member has no right to pelt me politically with eggs at this time busiof the day. His conduct might have been to appropriate at the time we were discussing If ' the protection of our own laying hens against the layers of China.

161,Mr SOLMON,MANUFACTURES," I desire the to make a personal explanation. Owing to the division bell not ringing in that portion of'the building.in which my room is situto ated, I was not aware that a division was taken this morning upon the motion for the second reading of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. Had I been present should have voted in favour of the motion. NA SECOND READING.",37
162,Mr MCLEAN,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S," I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill has been sent to us from the Senate,- where it was carefully considered. It is framed upon the lines of the Merchandise Marks Act which was passed by the Imperial Parliament in 1887. That Act has, on several occasions, formed the subject of inquiry by Committees of the House of Commons, but no important alterations have been recommended or made, with the exception that Customs entries have been included among trade descriptions. I might point out that legislation upon the lines of this Act has been adopted in almost every portion of the British Empire, including all the Australian States except Queensland. The administration in the States has not, however, been uniform, and the object of the Bill is to consolidate the legislation, and to bring it under a central administration for the whole Commonwealth. The Bill is of an eminently practical and useful character. It is very simple in terms, and, so far as I can see, it contains very little of a contentious nature. The measure does not make it imperative that every manufacturer or importer, or other person having goods to sell, shall' mark his goods. Perfect liberty is given to sell goods without any distinctive trade mark or description of any kind, but the Bill requires that if goods are marked in any way they must be truthfully described. The marks must not be misleading with regard to the quality of the goods, the materials from which they are manufactured, their place of origin, or in any other respect. For instance, under this legislation, it would not be legal for any person to mark as "" woollen,"" goods which in reality contain, as is often the case, 40 or 50 per cent, of cotton. Further, it would not be legal to mark reels of cotton as containing 100 yards, when in reality they contain only seventy or eighty yards. The same thing applies to the place of origin of goods. For instance, it would not be competent for any person to import goods having a brand upon them which would induce the public to believe that they were made in Sydney or Melbourne, even though they might have been made in a town bearing the same name in' some other country. It is not sufficient that the marks shall be truthful in that reBILL. spect, but they must not be misleading. If goods imported from abroad are marked with the name borne by some town in the Commonwealth they must also bear the name of the country in which the place of manufacture is situated. Clause 4 is very important, inasmuch as it contains definitions which considerably extend the application of the provisions of the Bill. Two kinds of trade marks are referred to. That is, any trade mark registered within any portion of the Commonwealth, or in the mother country, and also any trade mark that is used, but not registered. It is quite common for manufacturers to use distinctive marks which are not registered, but are well known. These ' are protected by the provisions of the Bill to the same extent as if they were registered. The Bill provides that persons making use of a false trade description shall'be liable to a penalty. "" Trade description "" is defined as any description, statement, indication, or suggestion, direct or indirect, which is misleading or untrue in any respect in regard to the goods to which it is applied or made. Further, a Customs entry is also made a ""trade description,"" and an incorrect description of goods in such entry would render a person liable under the Bill. Clause 5 applies entirely to the forgery of registered trade marks, which, as explained before, mean marks which are legally registered under any Act. Clauses 6 and 7 relate to the manner in which a mark shall be deemed to be applied, and it may be remarked that, according to the decisions given under the English Act, a person who invoices goods under an incorrect designation, Or mark, is taken to have applied the same. Clause 8 apples to the false use of trade marks. The next clause is an important one, inasmuch as it makes it penal to use any trade mark in an improper way, or to apply any false description to any goods, and throws the burden of proving innocence upon the person who applies the mark or description. Clause 10 deals with persons who may not themselves have actually committed an offence under the preceding clause, but who may sell or expose for sale, or have in their possession for sale, or for the purpose of trade or manufacture, any goods to which a false description has been applied. Clause 1.1 relates to the importation of goods with false marks. Clause 12 is a new one, and applies the ' same conditions to exports as are applied under existing legislation to imports. That provision is intended to prevent any manufacturer or owner of goods from exporting goods under any false trade mark or misleading description as to their character or quality. In fact, it is exactly the same provision that is applicable under existing legislation to imports.",38
163,Mr CARPENTER,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,Will it apply to butter which has a false brand upon the box?,39
164,Mr MCLEAN,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,"Certainly . It apply to any false description of any commodity exported. The object of the clause is to protect the honest manufacturer, the honest trader, and also the consuming public, either here or abroad. It is hoped that its effect will be to establish a reputation for Australian products, and prevent the damage of Australian trade by unscrupulous persons.",39
165,Mr SPENCE,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,"In other words, it is proposed to make it worth w hile to be honest?",39
166,Mr MCLEAN,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,"Yes . Clause 13 renders any person, or any accessory, even when the act is committed outside Australia, liable to a penalty. Clause 14 is another of the most important provisions in the Bill. Its object is to prevent a person from using the name of a manufactory or producing place within the Commonwealth, or within the British Empire, with the object of misleading. It classes as prohibited goods all goods to which a false trade description has been applied, and goods bearing the name of a place situated in Australia without qualification, or foreign-made goods with a British name upon them, without similar qualification. Clause 15 further emphasizes this, by prohibiting use of any name which is similar to the Australian name of a place unless there is_ complete evidence as to the country in which such place is situated. The next clause applies in the same way to places in the British Dominions. Clause 17 enables all the powers of the Customs officers ancl Customs Act to be applied to imported goods referred to in clause 14. Clause 18 enables the Customs, when there is no evidence that the importer has been in any way concerned in the illegality, to deliver up the goods imported, and clause 19 contains a similar provision in regard to goods exported. These provisions are intended to protect an innocent person from punishment for an unintentional error. Part I V . of the Bill refers to legal proceedings, and is in harmony with legislation which already prevails both in England' and the 13 D 2 different States. Consequently, it does not call for any special comment. Clause 35 is of importance, inasmuch as it provides that when goods are sold with a trade description, the vendor shall be deemed to give a warranty that the goods are as described, unless he voluntarily, and in writing at the time of the sale, expresses otherwise to the vendee. It is a moat important provision. Clause 36 provides for making regulations for giving effect to will the various provisions of the Bill. I do not think that there is much of a contentious nature in this measure; it is a very useful and practical one, and I trust that the House will allow it to pass its second reading without undue delay.",39
167,Mr WATSON,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S," I do not think it is necessary for me to 'say much in regard to this Bill , except that I am heartily in sympathy with its object. The only doubt which I entertain is, whether our r powers under the Constitution are comprehensive enough to allow of efficient treatment of a subject of this character. There is an element of doubt as to whether we are empowered to legislate to the full extent in regard to false descriptions of goods as distinct from trade marks, as they are conventionally understood. Another question may arise as to how far we are justified in attempting to deal with false descriptions of goods manufactured in one State, which it is not attempted to export from that State. However, I am inclined to go as far as the Constitution will allow us to go in that direction. I think that the public throughout the Commonwealth are not only in favour of this the kind of legislation, but that they would welcome any attempt to comprehensively deal with the subject in a measure which would minimize, if not to prevent absolutely, the troubles which have arisen in this connection. There is no doubt that, in regard to importedand in a lesser degree in regard to some classes of manufactured goods- a great deal of misrepresentation exists. Some of it has been of an innocent character, but some of it has exercised a very detrimental effect upon the purchaser. I feel sure that everybody will welcome this legislation, and I trust that the Bill will be placed upon the statute-book this session.",39
168,Mr CARPENTER,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S," I wish to express my pleasure that the Government, even at this late stage of the session, have given the House an opportunity to discuss this Bill. The measure has been hung up for several months, and I should have been glad if we had been afforded an earlier opportunity of dealing with it. aware that other business has had to take precedence of it; but I do not know that we have not wasted time in discussing measures which it was never intended should be passed-time which might fairly have been devoted to a consideration of' this The remarks which were made yesterday concerning another measure might very reasonably be applied to this. It is another instance of the wisdom and necessity of the public conscience being applied in some way as an antidote to the commercial immorality of the present day. Anybody who has read-and I suppose most honourable members have done so-the .extent to which fraud has crept into the ordinary affairs of commercial life, must be surprised that the confiding public, which pays an honest price for what it conceives to be honest goods, has had foisted upon it from time to time goods which are not in any sense what they are described to be. In nearly all instances, it is the poorest class of the community who suffer most, because its members have to purchase the cheapest goods. The individual who can afford to pay top prices for everything generally escapes, although I am not sure that he is altogether free from this evil. But the poorer man, who has to carefully study the expenditure of every penny, suffers considerably by .such practices as this Bill is intended, in some degree at least, to cure. Some time ago I had the privilege of conversing with a gentleman who, during the past two years, has been engaged in commercial pursuits. Having entered upon a commercial occupation late in life, he expressed astonishment that in almost every department of the business in which he is engaged, he met with fraud and misrepresentation. He said, "" The commercial life of this city is hollow and rotten from top to bottom. I had no idea, when I entered this business, that I should find so much fraud and pretence."" Honourable members may, perhaps, 'have observed in an newspaper some statements upon this subject, which I to read. I am quite prepared discount a good deal of what is published in the English press concerning any class in Australia, because as a rule its reflections are cast upon the political party with which I am associated, and the particular Mr Corf enter. section of the community to which' I belong. But it occasionally happens that it is impartial in its condemnation. Hence I find the following passage in the Morning I am Post, which, as honourable members are aware, is a Conservative journal:Fraud and trickery of the meanest and most despicable kind permeate the - commercial life of the country, and this re-acts in turn upon those representatives in national and municipal instiBill. tutions who are elected by the votes of these disreputable citizens. That journal comes to the conclusion that where corruption exists in commercial life it must also exist in political life. I hope that that is not true. Indeed, I believe that the passing of this Bill will, at least, afford evidence that we are desirous of 1 putting down these evil practices. The Pall Mall Gazette, in writing upon the same question, says:At one time in England we were accustomed to look for commercial brigandage and acts of dishonesty that would disgrace the scum of.Whitechapel among those Armenian merchants who carried on the Levant trade with England. Today, we are sorry to state, the Armenian is outstripped by the Melbourne British Customs thief. It is humiliating to think that Australia is peopled by the British race. Fortunately for society, the working classes and the farmers are taking a deeper interest in the political life .of the country. Although no party has lived through more abuse than the Labour Party, still it 'contains and has for supporters in the country, the cnly stable elements in society. Their ideals are purity of public and municipal life. The Minister who has introduced this Bill is a farmer's representative. The revelations which have recently been made, not through the fault of the farmers, but through the fault of those who have had dealings with them, show that our export tradeparticularly the Victorian butter export trade-ha s suffered a good deal, and may suffer much more as the result of fraudulent practice. I am particularly pleased that this Bill is designed in some degree to prevent a continuation of that practice. Evidence has been forthcoming that even in the export of butter the practice of fraud has crept into such an extent that after a farmer has supplied a first-class article to the agent, it has been taken out of English the box, and an inferior article substibearing tuted. Honourable members scarcely need propose to be reminded that such practices must to exercise a bad effect upon our trade, and they certainly should not be permitted to continue. There is another point to which I must briefly allude. I am pleased that the Bil l contains provision not only against fraud on the part of manufacturers and importers, not only to encourage honesty in this class, but to give the public an opportunity to judge whether goods offered for sale have been (manufactured or produced under favourable conditions of labour. In asking for protection for the manufacturer and the importer the Government cannot very well refuse to demand similar assistance to the wage earners engaged in producing their wares. The introduction of what is known as the trades union label is justifiable on every ground, and I trust that that, part of the Bill which deals with the question, as well as the rest sure, will have the unqualified support not only of the Government but of the whole House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. TRADE MARKS BILL : ORDER OF BUSINESS. Motion (by Mr Reid) proposed^That the House do now adjourn.",39
169,Mr WATSON,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S," I thi^k that the Prime Minister might well indicate what business he intends to take on Tuesday next. I suggest for his consideration that it might be possible to deal not only with the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill, but with the Trade Marks Bill. The rieht honourable gentleman said that, if possible, he would deal with the measure if. there were no likelihood of a long debate.",41
170,Mr MCLEAN,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,There is one very contentious provision in it.,41
171,Mr WATSON,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,"I admit that one part of the Trade Marks Bill is a. somewhat contentious one, but. it is quite possible that honourable members would agree to come to a vote upon it without any lengthy debate. I think it is very improbable-althoug h I speak, of course, with some reservation upon the matter-that we shall be able to reap the full advantages of the international union with regard to patents laws generally until our trade marks legislation is put on' the same footing with our general patent law. If that be so, it is highly desirable that a Trade Marks Bill, as complex rnentary to the Commonwealth Patent Act, should be passed during the present session instead of its consideration being delayed until the secona session of the Parliament. Until such a measure shall have been passed our inventors must be deprived of the advantage of the seven months' protection which would accrue to them under the International Patent Union.",41
172,Mr CONROY,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,Is the honourable member referring to the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill or the other ?,41
173,Mr WATSON,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,I am speaking of the Trade Marks Bill. The point I have just mentioned constitutes an additional reason why some effort should be made to pass that measure .before the session closes.,41
174,Mr MCCAY,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,But it contains one very of the meacontentious provision.,41
175,Mr WATSON,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,Surely we can arrange to take a vote upon it without any lengthy debate.,41
176,Mr LONSDALE,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,"A number of honourable members might be absent, and I do not think the Bill should be dealt with unless the contentious provision referred to is dropped. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) - I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he will endeavour to set apart some time next week for the consideration of the motion relating tp Old-age Pensions, and one or two other matters in the list of private members' business ?",41
177,Mr FRAZER,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S," In view of the state of business in another place, it is probable that this House may sit a little longer than is at present anticipated. In that event, I should like to know whether the Prime Minister would have any objection to bring the message from the Senate with reference to the tobacco monopoly under the heading of Government business, and to allow us to devote any spare hour that we mav have to its consideration.",41
178,Mr KELLY,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,"-If the Prime Minister adopts the course proposed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, I hope that he will give the House ample warning, because there are several honourable members who, like myself, are very anxious to express their views with regard to the Senate's message. No. 3.",41
179,Mr ISAACS,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S," I would endorse the remarks made by the leader of the Opposition with regard to the Trade Marks Bill. It is a matter of great importance to the commercial community. As we all know, there are many anomalies in relation to the use of trade marks in the various States.",41
180,Mr WATSON,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,Thos e anomalies are being increased while the separate State Acts remain in force.,41
181,Mr ISAACS,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,"They are. We know that trade marks which are possessed by commercial men in some States are not their property in others. There is a great diversity of trade mark rights in the various States of the union, and the sooner this state of affairs is cured, the better. This is one direction in which the Federation should.prove very advantageous, and if the Prime Minister can see his way clear to deal with the Trade Marks Bill-certainl y the non-contentidus portions of it-befor e the prorogation, it will be appreciated by the commercial community.",42
182,Mr REID,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S," I am filled with a desire to meet all the wishes of my honourable friends if I can do so, but I should like to devote as much time as possible to the very. important question of Preferential Trade. I should also like to give some time to the further consideration of the Manufacturers Encouragement Bill in Committee, if there is any chance of OUT .doing useful work in that direction. A'certain Division has been included in the Trade Marks Bill, - which is entirely foreign to an ordinary measure relating to trade marks.",42
183,Mr WATSON,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,"Oh , no. /",42
184,Mr REID,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,"That , at all.events, is the view of the Government. The Division to which I refer seems to me to constitute the only contentious part of the Bill, and I am informed that it would evoke very considerable discussion.",42
185,Mr FRAZER,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,-There will be a considerable discussion if it be not taken up.,42
186,Mr WATSON,FRAUDULENT TRADE MARK S,"We desire to get a vote on .it. Mr Reid, - The honourable member asked, "" If there be a strong feeling in regard to this part of the Bill, why not take a vote on it ?"" I have ""had that yearning for something like three months. It has been on the tip of my tongue to say over and over again, "" Let us take a vote."" But that is one thing to which honourable members are not prepared to consent, even in regard to matters on which they do not entertain strong convictions. Those who .had a strong objection to the part of the Bill to which I have referred would, at this last Stage of the session, when there is not a full opportunity to consider contentious matters, certainly decline to take a vote without discussion, and the consideration of the matter might, therefore,, lead to only a waste of time. That would seem, judging from today's proceedings, to be the position with reference to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. The time to pass any measure is now so limited that it almost offers a premium to honourable members to throw difficulties in the way of the passing of measures to which they have very strong objection. I am anxious to make the best use of the time left at our disposal, and I should like to give prominence to the Preferential Trade debate. I wish to make some observations in reply to the speech of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. I should like to ask the House, so far as I can see at present, to deal on Tuesday with the Sea Carriage of Goods Bill, and also lo advance the debate on the motion relating to Preferential Trade another stage. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.X2 p.m.",42
