DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE N. J. O. MAKIN, A.O.",13
3,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,PARLIAMENTAR Y DEBATES,"Wannon-Prime Minister)-I move: That this house expresses its deep regret at the death on 20 July 1982 of the Honourable Norman John Oswald Makin. A.O - a member of this House for the Division of Hindmarsh from 1919 to 1946. Speakerfrom 1929 to 1931. member for the Division of Sturt from 1954 to 1955. member for the Division of Bonython from 1955 to 1963. a Minister of the Crown during the Second World War. Ambassador to the United States of America from 1946 to 1951. President of the Security Council of the United Nations in 1946 and 1947. places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. All of us were saddened to learn of the death of Norman Makin on 20 July. Norman Makin served Australia in a large number of capacities with great distinction. In his maiden speech in this House on 20 March 1920 Mr Makin spoke of his intention to further the interests of this country and to further its general prosperity and progress. He worked to this end in and out of the Commonwealth Parliament with distinction for the next 62 years. It is a proud record. In his last speech in this place in October 1963 he returned to that same theme of the need to build Australia up, saying that the Australian people had the capacity and the courage to continue to build up their country. Norman Makin was born on 31 March 1889 at Petersham in New South Wales. He was educated at the Central Public School in Broken Hill and in 1918 was elected President of the South Australian branch of the Australian Labor Party. He was first elected a member of the House of Representatives, representing Hindmarsh, in 1919. When Mr Scullin became Prime Minister in 1929 Norman Makin was elected Speaker of this House. As Speaker he was committed to this institution and was well respected by all who came in contact with him. Norman Makin also served with distinction on a number of committees of the House. From 1922 to 1925 he was a member of the Commonwealth delegation to the Empire Parliamentary Association in the United Kingdom. In 1937 he was a member of the delegation which visited that country for the coronation of King George VI. He was also a member of the Standing Orders Committee from 1932 to 1946 and from 1956 until his retirement from this Parliament in 1963. During the Second World War, Norman Makin was a member of the Australian Advisory War Council from October 1940 to 1945. He served as Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions from 1941 to 1946, during which time he presided over the rapid expansion of the Royal Australian Navy. He was Minister for Aircraft Production from 1945 to 1946. In 1946 he resigned from the House of Representatives to become Australia's first Ambassador to the United States, remaining in that post until 1951. In 1946 and 1947 he was also the first president of the Security Council of the United Nations. In both posts, he was able to serve this nation and the cause of international peace and security with great distinction. In the general election of 1954 Norman Makin was re-elected to the House of Representatives as the member for Sturt. Following a redistribution of seats in the year following, he was elected as member for Bonython and retained that seat until his retirement from Parliament in 1963. He gave many years of devoted service to this House and to Australia. He was a Minister, Speaker, a j11ember of the House for many years and our ambassador in a post which was and still is of vital importance to our interests. Above all, he was a man who was intensely proud of Australia and of the movement he so ably represented. He was awarded the Order of Australia in 1980. Norman Makin is survived by two sons. His wife, Ruby, predeceased him. On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, I extend my sympathies to his family. The life of Norman Makin is one of the great examples of an Australian who has served this country throughout more than a century. He did it in a way which was dedicated and which earned the respect of all those who came in touch with him. I was in this House when he was still here and I was privileged to know him. I valued his friendship as I am sure did all members of the House of which he was a part. He was one of those people from whom, I think, we could all profit and learn in certain times. I doubt that I ever heard words spoken in anger or bitterness by Norman Makin in making speeches in this Parliament. He put forward his views with strength but, at the same time, with a sense of moderation and a sense of understanding that this institution and the country it represents are much more important than anyone of us.",13
4,Mr HAYDEN ,PARLIAMENTAR Y DEBATES,"Oxley-Leader of the Opposition)-I join the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) in expressing condolences to the surviving members of the family of the late Norman Makin. It is a matter of melancholy circumstance that has us today expressing condolences to those surviving members of the late Norman Makin's family. Norman Makin I recall vividly on my entry to this Parliament 21 years ago. He was a man of considerable distinction physically. The measured diction with which he delivered his addresses to this Parliament, a steady commitment to principle, in spite of a long life of service in public affairs and in spite of the many frustrations and disappointments which must have confronted him over that period, and a practical idealism were the ingredients which, it seemed to me, went to make up the late Norman Makin in this Parliament. Norman Makin served this country well. He served it for long periods and on two occasions in the national Parliament. He served it elsewhere at international forums. At all times a steadiness of purpose guided him in the discharge of his duty the and public service. He was a man of great principle and, in the period during which I knew him in the national Parliament, he gave great encouragement, indeed fatherly encouragement, to the younger members who came into this institution. He was a man who by his physical courage-a courage by the way in which he projected his views by the moderation with which he expressed himself-was an inspiration to all who worked with him. His vivacity of interest in the political affairs of this country-a vivacity of interest which went well above party commitments on many occasions-stayed with him until the end of his life. I still vividly recall meeting him in Adelaide during the 1980 election campaign at the major rally which the Labor Party conducted in that capital city. His involvement then was as passionate in its commitment as it was when he was a youth. I suppose the thing which struck me most of all as I listened to him on many occasions speaking in this House and as I frequently and clearly recall those occasions was the way in which the man expressed himself. He clearly conveyed that his feelings were steeped in a sincerity which was unassailable. His record of service to this country, like the achievements of the governments in which he held prominent positions, speaks proudly for itself. He entered Parliament in 1919 when its meeting place was in Melbourne. He served as Speaker during the period of the Scullin Government. He was the first Speaker to shun the gown and wig, preferring a distinguished black suit and bow tie, I am informed, and proudly boasting that he 'did not need a mace to control the Parliament'; a proud boast which would be resorted to with greater caution these days, I expect, Mr Speaker. Prime Minister Curtin appointed him to the crucial wartime post of Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions. He was a War Cabinet member and a member of the Production Executive of Cabinet. He also served as a member of the Australian Advisory War Council from 1940 to 1945. In 1946 Norman Makin became the first President of the United Nations Security Council. Following service as Minister for Aircraft Production under both Forde and Chifley, Prime Minister Chifley appointed him the first Australian Ambassador to the United States of America. His contribution within our Party, the Australian Labor Party, was equally commendable and just as enduring. He served as President of the South Australian Branch of the Party from 1918 to 1919, and was Secretary of the Parliamentary Labor Party from 1928 to 1929 and from 1934 to 1941. He served for a time also as Federal President of the Party. His character was suited to the many overseas roles entrusted to him-from ambassador to his membership of the Far Eastern Commission, and his governorship of the International Bank in Washington. He established easy and often quite personal relationships with such eminent figures as the late President Truman, Nelson Rockefeller, General Marshall, Governor Dewey, Eleanor Roosevelt and a range of other people who in their own way had been instrumental in changing or influencing the course of history. The late Norman Makin was a noted lay preacher but he well respected the frailty of human nature. I was attracted to the obvious quality of the man of never being a moraliser, even though he was devoted, quite obviously, to the belief in the perfectability of man and society if ideals were established and pursued with generosity and sincerity. His services to the United States, to the Australian Parliament and to the Australian people exemplify that commitment in practice. The Australian Labor Party remembers Norman Makin with warm admiration and it extends deepest sympathy to his sons, Lloyd and Harold.",14
5,Mr ANTHONY ,PARLIAMENTAR Y DEBATES,"Richmond-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources)-On behalf of the members of the National Country Party I would like to join in the very fine tributes that have been paid to our late colleague Mr Norman Makin, A.O. I knew Norman Makin in this House. I also knew him long before I became a member of this House. My association goes back to the time when as a very young schoolboy my parents brought me to Canberra. We lived in the Kurrajong Hotel. Norman Makin then had a young family and everbody lived as a very happy group in either the Hotel Canberra or the Kurrajong. We lived in the Kurrajong. There was no going home at the weekends. It was just one great community with everybody relying on and getting to know each other. I remember Norman Makin as a real gentleman. He was a very dedicated, very sincere person. He certainly was the elder of this House at the time of his retirement. I think that to reach the fine age of 93 dispels all the theories that politicians die early. The fact that he was a very good Methodist and did not drink or smoke probably added considerably to his life span. His lay background was exhibited in the way he behaved in this Parliament, in his approach to carrying out his responsibilities as a member of parliament and in his sincerity towards the Australian Labor Party, to which he had devoted his life. I recall Norman Makin having onerous responsibilities during the war years as Minister for the Navy and then as Minister for Aircraft Production. As a boy I recall going to Garden Island for the opening of the new dock. It was Norman Makin's efforts that led to the building of that dock and he opened it on that occasion. He was a man with a most distinguished record. Very few Australians will ever achieve the record that he achieved of 36 years in Parliament, two of them as Speaker, having held a number of portfolios. He was appointed the first Australian Ambassador to Washington. During that period he was made the first President of the Security Council of the United Nations. For anybody to have that sort of record is noteworthy and something for all of us to be proud of. Certainly this is an occasion on which to pay a tribute to him and to express sympathy to his family at the loss of a great Australian.",15
6,Mr YOUNG ,PARLIAMENTAR Y DEBATES,"Port Adelaide)-I join earlier speakers-the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden), and the Leader of the National Country Party ( Mr Anthony)-in expressing condolences to Lloyd and Harold and to their wives Pauline and Colleen and their children. I say at the outset that, had he been here, certainly the honourable member for Hawker ( Mr Jacobi), who was a lifelong and close personal friend of Norman Makin, would have wished to join in these condolences, as would every Australian Labor Party member who has retired from this Parliament, including Clyde Cameron, Jim Toohey, Clem Ridley, Fred Birrell, Martin Nicholls, Reg Bishop, Jim Cavanagh-all people who worked with Norman over a long period of years. Norman Makin was one of the greatest sons of the Australian working class. He was born at Petersham in New South Wales in 1889. He attended the Central Public School in Broken Hill. He was a pattern maker by trade and a member of the Australasian Society of Engineers. He entered the Parliament in 1919 at the age of 30 and he was the member for Hindmarsh until 1946. During that time he saw the transfer of the Parliament from Melbourne to Canberra. He often said that his first view of this place was from the earthable works under the floor before even one brick had been laid upon another. As has already been said, he was also Speaker of the House. He was a member of the War Cabinet from 1941 to 1946. As Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions from October 1941 to August 1946 he helped expand the Royal Australian Navy from a total strength of 16 ships at the beginning of the war to 350 ships at the completion of the war. He was also Minister for Aircraft Production from February 1945 to August 1946 and Acting Minister for External Affairs in 1945. He resigned from the Parliament in August 1946 upon being appointed the first Australian Ambassador to the United States when Australia u-graded its diplomatic representation from a legatIOn. Not only was he Australia's chief delegate to the United Nations, but also he became the first President of the United Nations Security Council. He was also a member of the Far Eastern Commission and Governor of the International Bank in Washington. Following the termination in 1951 of his appointment as Ambassador to the United States, he returned to South Australia and in 1954 ran for the seat of Sturt and was successful. After a redistribution, he transferred to the newlycreated seat of Bonython, which he won and held at two subsequent elections. Norman Makin eventually retired from politics in 1963. He accepted very few honours-a Doctorate of Laws, membership of the Order of Australia, a United Nations Peace Medal and a certificate from the Methodist Church commending him for 70 years of lay preaching. He served his party as South Australian President, as Secretary to the Australian Labor Party in the House of Representatives, and was the first South Australian to become Federal President of the Party he loved. He served the people of three electorates for a total of 36 years in Parliament, the country for five of those years in the war Cabinet, and the international community for a further five years as diplomat and statesman. Right up until the time of his death Norman Makin took an interest in the activities of the party. He always insisted on paying at every function to which he was invited. At every election and by-election until the time of his death Norman Makin forwarded a cheque to the Labor Party office to help its campaign funds. He was an outstanding person. He was dearly loved by everybody within the Labor Party, which is not an easy achievement, and he leaves behind him great warmth in the party. People will have great memories of Norman Makin. Very few of us will be to emulate the great achivements of this wonderful person.",16
7,Sir JAMES KILLEN ,PARLIAMENTAR Y DEBATES,"MoretonVicePresident of the Executive Council)-Politics generates its own distinctive misconceptions, and in the vanguard of those misconceptions is the view held by many people outside Parliament that personal friendships cannot be formed where there are political differences. I trust that it is the common experience of all of us in this Parliament to identify that as a misconception. Probably it is just as well that that is so because unrelieved conflict is not an emancipating element in the democratic process. ' When Norman Makin left this Parliament he came to me-he always addressed ,me as 'James'-and said: 'I want to give you sOmething.' I said: 'What is that?'. He gave me thebOufid volumes of the Convention Debates. It was a very generous gift, a very valuable gift. In-eOf the volumes, in what I can describe only as copperplate writing, he wrote: To The Hon. D. J. Killen, LL.B, Minister for Defence. In acknowledgment of a warm my highest regard. (Former Australian Ambassador to the USA, and Minister of the Crown.) He could have presented those volumes to scores of libraries and they would have been very welcome. Indeed, he could have given them to many of his colleagues who shared his political views, but he gave them to a person who did not share his political views. It was, I regard, a very generous expression of friendship. He held strong political views and he held strong social views, and this is no paradox. His early life was not easy. He had a strong personal commitment to the Christian faith and he held a strong commitment to the Christian ethic. Integrity and honour, to Norman Makin, were not some curious estates to be treated in a very casual fashion. They were very precious estates. To illustrate just that I will tell a story which, I suspect, has never been told before. When Norman Makin was Ambassador to the United States the then Prime Minister Menzies visited the United States and Makin accompanied him to the White House to visit President Truman. After discussion of a quarter of an hour or so, he turned to Prime Minister Menzies and said: 'I have no doubt you will be wanting to discuss matters of great confidence', and he rose to leave. Menzies put his hand on Makin's arm and said to him: 'I have no secrets from you.'. Norman Makin had a distinctive record of parliamentary service. It is incredible to think that a few of us sat in this House with a man who sat in the Parliament when it met in Melbourne. His political experience was immense. When in Adelaide I would visit him, and his interest was maintained to the end. He would recall with vigour past events and past political figures. He had an inquiring mind as to what was going on in politics today. On the occasion of his ninety-third birthday I sent a message to him and I received a letter in reply. I shall read it to the House. It states: My dear James, If my thoughts could be 'minted sovereigns'. you and your dear wife Joy would be millionaires. I am enriched ings by the most gracious and lation and good wishes on the occasion of my ninety-third birthday anniversary. You are both regal in the these my senior years with golden thoughts of the years that have been and for the years still to be for me. Yours ever to be with respect and goodwill, Norman Makin. The words of Robert Browning come back. He said: personal friendship and with Grow old along with me! NORMAN MAKIN The best is yet to be, The last of life, for which the first was made: Our times are in His hand. To the Makin family I extend my deepest sympathy. Norman Makin led a long life, a vigorous life. He had a very distinguished life.",16
8,Dr BLEWETT ,PARLIAMENTAR Y DEBATES,"Bonython)-I wish to join briefly in this motion of condolence. Norman Makin was older than the party which he served for most of his life-a life that is now inextricably entwined in the history of that party. He could recall the election of the first ever Labor Government with an absolute parliamentary majoritythat of the Verran Government in South Australia in 1910. He was a member of this House for 37 years and four months, the third longest serving member in its history, representing in turn the seats of Hindmarsh, Sturt and Bonython. He served under every Federal Labor leader to date except the first three and the last two. He remained until his death at the age of 93 actively and passionately concerned with the party to which, with his Methodism, he had dedicated his life. I regret that I had only a minor acquaintance with his vast fund of reminiscence, anecdote and legend about the Australian Labor Party. Others have already enumerated the high offices in which Norman Makin served this nation. I will only note, Mr Speaker, that out of that range of offices he most preferred your office. He once wrote: My favourite position was the Speakership of the Parliament. It seemed to lift the occupant right above the contentions of politics. This concern about the contentions of politics was a life-long theme for Norman Makin. Although he never flinched from the hurly-burly of politics, as is evidenced by his 37 years in this place, and although he always remained staunch in his convictions, he deprecated the animosity of political life. In 1931 he said: The reason why politicians do not get on better with each other is because they will not try to understand one another. Perhaps there are lessons for all of us here. Despite his achievements he remained always a very in my feel- humble and very approachable man, seeking generous telegram of congratuneither rewards nor honours for his service. Although he became the grand old man of South gifts of friendship that so crowns Australian Labor, his retention to the very end of an extraordinary youthful and zestful outlook on life enabled him easily to span the half century or more that frequently separated him from his conversational companions. I hope the day will come when this Parliament will honour him by renaming the seat of Bonython after its first and greatest member.",17
9,Mr SCOTT ,PARLIAMENTAR Y DEBATES,"Hindmarsh)-I wish to make a small contribution to the tributes to the late Norm Makin. I wish to pay a tribute for a number of reasons. I pay tribute to Norm Makin the member for Hindmarsh; to Norm Makin, the unionist; to Norm Makin, the statesman; and to Norm Makin, the local preacher. I was privileged to know Norm Makin initially through the trade union movement. He was a member of the South Australian branch of which I was the State Secretary. Just recently I attended a function in the company of Clyde Cameron and Norm Makin. I consider it a great privilege to have known the man. Norm Makin was elected to the House of Representatives for the Federal seat of Hindmarsh in 1919. He was re-e1ected on a number of occasions-in 1922, 1925, 1928, 1929, 1931, 1934, 1937,1940 and 1943. He resigned in 1946. However, he re-entered Parliament in 1954, representing the seats of Sturt and, later, Bonython, in 1955, 1958 and 1961. I know that the electors of Hindmarsh, of all political persuasions, would wish to record their thanks to Norm Makin for the care and attention he gave to their representations. Hindmarsh was well served by Norm Makin. On behalf of the people of Hindmarsh I say: 'Well done and thank you'. Norm Makin was a proud and loyal unionist, a member of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union. He joined what was then the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, known as the ASE, in July 1911 and was a pattern maker by trade. Norm Makin was born at Petersham, New South Wales, in 1889. His early life was spent in Broken Hill, where he became proficient as a metalworker. Trade union values and traditions were clearly a part of Norm Makin's life. He never lost those values and traditions. Speaking on the Supply Bill, in the House of Representatives on 4 March 1920, Norm Makin referred to an increase of 50 per cent over a period of eight months in the price of boots. In response to an interjection suggesting that people would end up with bare feet, Norm Makin said: ( have seen bare feet already. and ( know that children from some families are sent to school without the necessary food because the bread-winners are meet the exorbitant cost of living. a Government employee in South Australia. with a wife and nine children. He is in receipt of the minimum wage. He desires to conserve their interests and to be a faithful husband and father. ( said to him, '( suppose you will be attending the Eight Hours celebrations tomorrow?' but he replied, 'No, ( will not be able to do so.' ( said, 'Surely you are a good unionist, a good labourite?' 'Yes', he responded. '( am that, without doubt', but where I am unable to take my wife and children I am not prepared to go myself'. I pointed out that there was nothing in connection with the Eight Hours celebrations that should hinder him from taking his family to witness them, to which he answered, 'Of course not, but the fact is that I am unable to provide my children with shoes and stockings in order to make them presentable enough to go into the city.' Norm Makin went on to point out that at that time that was not an isolated case. Norm Makin retained his union membership right to the end. He never faltered in his passionate defence of the working class, the trade unions and the Australian Labor Party. He was proud of the Labor movement and the Labor movement is proud of Norm Makin. Norm Makin was a statesman. The Australian Parliament has seen, and will see, many politicians but few statesman. I doubt that we shall see statesmen of the calibre of Norm Makin. His many roles included Speaker of the House, member of the Advisory War Council, and Cabinet Minister with many important portfolios such as those of Navy and Munitions. On the international post-war scene he was the first President of the United Nations Security Council and the Australian Ambassador to the United States from 1946 to 1951. Norm Makin was recently awarded the Order of Australia-a somewhat belated but appropriate recognition of the quality of his service to the nation. Norm Makin, statesman, earned his place in Australian history. Norm Makin, local preacher, served for 75 years. In the early 1920s, when the Federal Parliament was still meeting in Melbourne, Norm Makin was much sought after by suburban churches as a preacher on special occasions. Recently he was awarded a certificate for completing 70 of those years as a local preacher in his church. Norm Makin has earned his place in Australian history. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA SIR PHILIP MCBRIDE, P.e., KCMG.",18
10,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"Wannon-Prime Minister)-I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 14 July of the Right Honourable Sir Philip ---ride. P.c., KCMG., a member of this House for the DIVISIOn of Grey from 1931 to 1937 a senator for South Australia from 1937 to 1944 and a me-ber of this House for the Division of Wakefield from 1946 to 1958, a Minister of the Crown for II not receiving an adequate wage to years; places on record its appreciation of his long and meri( can cite a caSe of one man, torious public service; and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. All honourable members were saddened to learn of the death on 14 July of Sir Philip MCBride. Sir Philip was born on 18 June 1892 and was educated at Burra Public School and later at Prince Alfred College in Adelaide. He was first elected to this House for the Division of Grey at the general election of 1931. Sir Philip was re-elected to this House in 1934 and, subsequently, in October 1937 was chosen by the South Australian Parliament to fill a casual vacancy in the Senate. He was re-elected to a full term in the Senate commencing in 1938 but was defeated at the general election of 1943. In 1946 Sir Philip was re-elected to this House as the member for Wakefield and retained his seat at the general elections of 1949, 1951, 1954 and 1955. Sir Philip began his ministerial career in the first Menzies Ministry as Assistant Minister for Commerce from April 1939 to October 1941. He was later Minister for Supply and Development and Minister for Munitions from 1940 to 1941. He was also a member of the War Cabinet during this time. Sir Philip was, in fact, the last surviving member of that first Menzies Ministry which led Australia through the early years of the Second World War. Following the return of the Menzies Government in 1949, Sir Philip resumed his ministerial career as Minister for the Interior from 1949 to 1950. In 1950 he was appointed Minister for Defence and retained that post until his retirement from Parliament in 1958. Sir Philip was also actively involved in politics outside the Parliament. He was a member of the United Australia Party when he was first elected to this Parliament and played an important role at the time of the establishment of the Liberal Party of Australia, and after his retirement from this House he maintained his involvement with politics and was Federal President of the Liberal Party from 1960 to 1965. Sir Philip also made a valuable contribution as a pastoralist and served as president of the Stockowners Association of South Australia. He was created a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1953 and a Privy Councillor in 1959. Norman Makin and Sir Philip MCBride were both born before the formation of the Commonwealth of Australia. They lived through two world wars and saw vast changes throughout the time they were in public life, and indeed before. I think it does not hurt us to recall at times the changes of which they were a part and which they helped to guide. They both had a wealth of history which is beyond the living memory of the current members of this House and an experience that few of us will ever attain. Again, it is a demonstration of the very great service that has been given to this Parliament and to the people of Australia by people who have served the major part of their lives in this institution. On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia, I express sympathy to Sir Philip's widow and two surviving sons.",18
11,Mr HAYDEN ,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"Oxley-Leader of the Opposition)-I join with the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and on behalf of the Opposition express condolences to the surviving members of the late Sir Philip MCBride's family; that is, to Lady MCBride and their two sons. The late Sir Philip MCBride gave long and distinguished service to this Parliament. He served in it for 27 years and represented the seats of Grey and Wakefield. In the period during which he served in this Parliament he gave public service as Minister of the Crown in the portfolios of Commerce, Army, Supply and Development, Munitions, and again later in the Menzies Government in Army, Navy and Defence. Up to his retirement from politics he served his party as Federal President of the Liberal Party of Australia-for five years to 1965. He was of course a close associate of the late Sir Robert Menzies for some 30 years-indeed from the time of the formation of the Liberal Party. In that formation he played an instrumental and valuable role. According to all accounts he was known for his down to earth approach to politics, and at the same time for his patient behind the scenes work in influencing Liberal Party organistion and policy-making methods. He gave, through these instruments, a quiet strength to his party, especially at times of strain, and functioned as an effective resolver of tensions, especially in situations where fissures were threatening. He is survived by Lady MCBride and two sons. He was aged 90 years at his death. He gave long service to this Parliament and enjoyed a long and fruitful life. We express our condolences to the surviving members of his family.",19
12,Mr ANTHONY ,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"Richmond-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources)-I would like to pay tribute to Sir Philip MCBride and to express sympathy to Lady MCBride and her two sons on his death. Sir Philip was very greatly respected in this Parliament. He was of immense importance to the Liberal Party organisation and he was greatly respected as a man. At the time of my entering this Parliament he was Minister for Defence. He held that position with great distinction. I think he was aptly described as man Friday in the Menzies Cabinet-a man who always adopted a low profile approach to questions but who seemed to wield very considerable influence. He was a practical, down to earth man who held great status. His point of view was always regarded as being sound. I found him a modest man-perhaps he was a shy man-but he was always totally responsible and totally conscious of his responsibilities a member of parliament. Sir Philip served in many roles in both Houses of this Parliament, the House of Representatives and the Senate, and was a member of Sir Robert Menzies' first post-war Ministry. I am told that until his death in July he was the last surviving member of the Menzies' first post-war Cabinet. He was a man one looked up to and admired. He kept active after his retirement. He was very prominent in business and within the pastoral interests of South Australia. On many occasions I had the opportunity to have discussions and exchange points of view with him. He was a man to be remembered, to be missed; a man one could easily love and respect. Therefore, I express sympathy to his family and to his friends.",19
13,Mr GILES ,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"Wakefield)-I thank the House for permitting me, as the member for Wakefield, also to say something about Sir Philip MCBride and to join in the motion of condolence. I did not sit in this House with Sir Philip MCBride; at that time. I was in the State Parliament. My early memory of the greatness of the man as it affected me at that time was the tremendous trust and faith that the Premier of South Australia, Sir Thomas Playford, and the Honourable Mr MCBride had in each other. I believe it was a very important facet of the trust that existed in those days between the State Government and the Federal Government, a trust which, to paraphrase the words of an earlier speaker, it is not always easy for one party to place in another. I believe he made a significant input into my State of South Australia. Sir Philip was a part of a wonderful, long line of members for Wakefield who achieved real greatness. I refer to Sir Charles Hawker, Sir Philip MCBride and, indeed, to our well-beloved Bert Kelly. Mr Speaker, Sir Philip MCBride was a very perceptive, quiet and astute man who went to the core of a problem very easily and capably. For that he earned very great respect from his party colleagues. I join with other speakers in expressing sympathy to his widow and two sons.",20
14,Mr WALLIS ,DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE,"Grey)-As the member for Grey I add my condolence to what has been said about the late Sir Philip MCBride. Sir Philip MCBride was the member for Grey from 1931 until 1937 and, of course, served later as the member for Wakefield and as a senator. Whilst I did not know Sir Philip MCBride personally, I certainly knew of him in politics in South Australia. He served not only as a member and as a senator but also as a Minister of the Crown in a number of ministries. As I said, I did not know him but I did as know of his political involvement. I know that he came from one of the large pastoral families in South Australia. His family was very well known. I remember my own association with one of his properties. I do not know whether Sir Philip MCBride ever knew, but we used to shoot kangaroos on his property without his permission. I add my condolences to those of the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and other speakers and extend my sympathy to the family of Sir Philip MCBride. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA JOHN MCLEA Y, KCMG., M.M.",20
15,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE SIR,"Wannon-Prime Minister)- Mr Speaker, I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 22 June of Sir John MCLeay, KCMG, M.M., a member of this House for the division of Boothby from 1949 to 1966, and Speaker from 1956 to 1967, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Mr Speaker, we were saddened to learn of the death of one our our former colleagues, Sir John MCLeay, on 22 June. Sir John MCLeay was one of a number of notable members who entered the House of Representatives as part of the first Liberal Government under Sir Robert Menzies in 1949. He served in this place until 1966 and held office as Speaker for a record term of ten and a half years. Throughout his lifetime Sir John and his family served this country with distinction. His brother George was a senator and Minister in the early Menzies governments and his son John succeeded him in the seat of Boothby on his retirement and also served as a Minister. Sir John MCLeay was born on 19 November 1893 at Port Clinton, South Australia. He was educated in that town and at Unley Central School. Later he took a commercial course at Muirden Col1ege. In 1915, after the outbreak of the First World War, Sir John enlisted in the first Australian Imperial Force and served in France with distinction as a stretcher bearer in the 13th Field Ambulance. He was awarded the Military Medal at Villiers-Bretonneux. Throughout his life Sir John maintained an active interest in veterans' affairs, being a past president of the South Australian Legacy Club and a past member of the board of the Returned Services League. Sir John MCLeay was wel1 versed in government before he was elected to this chamber as member for Boothby in 1949, having served in both local government and in the South Australian Parliament. He was a councillor of the U nley City Council for a long period from 1925, was Mayor of that city and served as a member for Unley in the South Australian Parliament. He was also a councillor of the Adelaide City Council and the Lord Mayor of Adelaide from 1946 to 1950. As a member of the House of Representatives Sir John served on the Privileges Committee from 1950 to 1956 and was Chairman of that Committee from 31 August 1954. He was Temporary Chairman of Committees from 27 August 1952 until he succeeded the late Archie Cameron as Speaker on 29 August 1956. It is as Speaker that Sir John MCLeay is best remembered. Indeed in the decade in which he served as Speaker he became almost an institution in the chair, carrying out that role, as Harold Holt said at the time of Sir John's retirement, in a way which preserved the dignity of the House and its stature. The late Arthur Calwell, when congratulating Sir John on achieving a record term as Speaker on 12 November 1964, said that had the Opposition won the 1961 elections it would have kept Sir John as Speaker and even allowed him to wear his wig. Sir John MCLeay gave great and meritorious service to Australia through a very long lifetime in many offices. He served in all levels of government with great distinction and with great honour. On behalf of the Government and the people of Australia. I extend my sympathy to Sir John's family.",20
16,Mr HAYDEN ,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE SIR,"Oxley-Leader of the Opposition)-On behalf of the Opposition I join with the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) in extending condolences to the surviving members of the late Sir John MCLeay's family-his son John, now Consul-General in Los Angeles, his son Peter and his daughter Barbara. Sir John, as the Prime Minister correctly pointed out, had a long and distinguished career of public service. He served in local government. He served as Lord Mayor of Adelaide. He served three years in the State Parliament of South Australia. He served 17 years in the national Parliament and, as if that strain was not sufficient in itself, he served in most trying position of all-a decade as Speaker of the House of Representatives. My recollections of him are clear. He was Speaker when I arrived in 1961 and still Speaker in 1966 at the time of his retirement. I should clearly acknowledge that there was a distinct quality to the style of control of the chamber that he adopted as Speaker. One would say that he gave it great stature and great strength but he discharged the administration of his responsibilities not always with an elegance. One suspects that the robust good humour which he almost inevitably displayed spilled over into a general robustness at times of particular tension in the Parliament and he adapted the Standing Orders according to the circumstances prevailing. I say that with a clear recollection of some bruising which still lingers on my political psyche. I had been here but a short time and sat near where the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Free) is now seated. Not far from me was a then irrepressible member of the Parliament, Freddy Daly. It is hard to believe these days that Freddy Daly would have been responsible for what might be described as at least moderately unseemly behaviour in the Parliament from time to time. But it was a fact, as some of us recall, and indeed witnessed. On one occasion Freddy Daly was making some pungent points in the Parliament and injecting great disorder in the ranks of the conservative Government opposite. Sir John MCLeay made the quiet but firm observation that the next person to misbehave or behave in a disorderly way would be ejected from the Parliament. At that point I got up to walk out and leave the Parliament. He misinterpreted my physical movement and had me ejected immediately. Having a very conservative electorate and an extraordinarily slender majority in those days, I went back to my electorate with some timidity, but survived. I learned to respect Sir John MCLeay as Speaker in the discharge of his duties at trying times, but I learned to respect greatly and unstintingly the way in which he controlled this place. He did it mostly with a display, I repeat, of robust good humour and an understanding of the way in which the people who come to this Parliament at times conduct themselves when the going gets a little rough and provocative, and always in a way that suggested that he was prepared to make some adaptation of the Standing Orders to get around a tight spot. I observe in passing and in fairness to you, Mr Speaker, that I have noted that you too have been capable of doing that on the odd occasion, and we wish that you would extend it more often to this side of the House. But let me the make it clear, and in conclusion, that my recollections of the late Sir John MCLeay are affectionate ones, deeply respectful ones and ones appreciative of the service which he gave to this Parliament and service which obviously he gave to the community, while in the State Parliament of South Australia and in local government in that State. The Opposition expresses its deepest condolences to the surviving members of Sir John MCLeay's family.",21
17,Mr ANTHONY ,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE SIR,"Richmond-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources)--I would like to associate the National Country Party with the motion moved by the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden), by extending my sympathy and that of my party to the MCLeay family. The death of John MCLeay in June came as a very sad blow, an especially sad blow to many of us who remember Sir John with a great deal of affection. He was a jovial character who had a great capacity for remembering details about people and their lives. He was always inquiring after family circumstances. He was a very lovable character. I found out that only last year when I happened to meet him in Los Angeles, where he was visiting his son. He still recalled all the personalities and inquired fondly after them. He was a man who gave very distinguished service. He holds the record for length of service as Speaker of this House, having served a IO-year term. He followed the illustrious Archie Cameron in that position. He carried on the high standards that had been established under Archie Cameron, and I am pleased to say that they have been carried on by his successors too. Sir John MCLeay came from a very distinguished political family in South Australia. His brother, George MCLeay, was a Cabinet Minister. He was a member of Sir Robert Menzies' first post-war Cabinet. In fact he was in Sir Robert's Ministry before the war. George MCLeay died in office in 1955. Sir John was followed as member for Boothby by his son John, who is now Consul General in Los Angeles. Sir John MCLeay will be remembered for his very outstanding service and his dedication. He was a greatly respected man, loved and admired by all. I extend very great sympathy to his son John, to John's brother Peter, his sister, Barbara, and to Lady MCLeay.",21
18,Mr DOBIE ,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE SIR,"Cook)-I rise to speak briefly as a friend,of the family. I wish to record that Sir John MCLeay was proud of several things. He was extremely proud of his Scottish heritage; he was extremely proud of every member of his family; and he was extremely proud of having been a member and a Speaker of this House. He always had a clear, lucid mind. It was my good fortune to be with him only a couple of nights before his death. At his great age he recalled with great humour the personalities of this place. As we have heard, he was a great Australian, not only in relation to his family and to his local area but also to his State and to his country. He was somebody to whom we should all look as an example. He had pride in what his sons and daughter had done. The mark of his real achievement in life is the affection with which he was held and regarded at the time of his death.",22
19,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE SIR,"In the course of time my family and the family of John MCLeay-that is Sir John and his son John-became very closely associated. I was deeply concerned when John MCLeay became ill and death was close. Notwithstanding his impending death, he was able to maintain an attitude to life which demonstrated the generosity he displayed to all people throughout his life and illustrated why he had acquired the affection of everybody who knew him. He was a very fine man, one whom I greatly admired and whose friendship I cherished. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places.",22
20,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE SIR,I thank the House. DEATH OF MR C. E. GRIFFITHS,22
21,Mr MALCOLM FRASER ,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE SIR,"Prime MinisterWannon)-I move: That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 17 May of Charles Edward Griffiths, a member of this House for the Division of Short land from 1949 to 1972, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its sympathy to his family in its bereavement. Honourable members will be saddened to learn of the death of one of our former colleagues, Charles Griffiths. Charlie Griffiths was born on 26 June 1903 at Jesmond, in New South Wales. He was educated at the Bribbaree Public School. Upon leaving school, Charles Griffiths joined the New South Wales Railways. He became actively involved in union affairs and was, in turn, an organiser and State councillor of the Australian Railways Union. From 1940 to 1952 he was State Secretary of that union. He was first elected to this House at the general election of 1949 for the newly created seat of Shortland. In his maiden speech to this House on 28 February 1950 he spoke of the great sacrifices made by the working people of Australia to aid the war effort and the evil influence of communism which he believed could be defeated if people could look to a secure economic future, free from poverty. Charles Griffiths served as a member of the Printing Committee from 1951 to 1954 and was a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works from 1959 to 1966. He was a member of the Australian delegation to the ninth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1964 and, in 1966, was a member of a parliamentary delegation to South Asia. In 1969 he was a member of the parliamentary mission which visited Hong Kong, Japan, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan. At the general election of 1972 he retired from this Parliament. On behalf of the Government and people of Australia, I extend my sympathy to his widow, Jess, and to his family in their bereavement.",22
22,Mr HAYDEN ,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE SIR,"Oxley-Leader of the Opposition)-On behalf of the Opposition, I join with the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) in extending sympathies to the surviving members of the late Charlie Griffiths's family. He served in this Parliament for 23 years. I served with him for II of those years. He was well known to me and recognised and respected as a hard working representative of his electorate. He was, in truth, an authentic voice of a very large and important section of the Australian community. He sought to present the problems which confronted ordinary people in the day to day challenge of living in society in the context of the speeches which he made in this Parliament. It was clear from the way in which he projected those experiences of ordinary people and the feeling with which he presented those experiences that he was dedicated in his service to his electorate. It is important in this institution that not only the technical and complex matters that present themselves to this Parliament be responded to technically and in a complex way, as befits the particular issues of the time, but that also the problems that confront ordinary people, as prosaic as they may be, are also addressed. If that responsibility is failed, a very serious failure is evident in the way in which this parliamentary institution functions. Charlie Griffiths's speeches, as I say, were always down to earth. There was a homespun quality about them. But they were always relevant to the experiences of people who were struggling, often with the greatest disadvantages, in ordinary society. They are innumerable; and they go to make up the Australian community. But his speeches were not always prosaic. Some of them were quite significant in the way in which they addressed themselves to particular issues, and some were memorable. I seem to recall that his farewell speech had a rather rivetting quality, and the Leader of the Opposition at that stage probably gave more attention to it than he gave to any other speech which the late Charlie Griffiths delivered in this Parliament. The service of the late Charlie Griffiths in this Parliament has been referred to in some detail by the Prime Minister. It scarcely, therefore, requires me to go over that service again. I repeat that the Opposition feels greatly diminished at the loss of a former colleague who served the Labor Party well and who gave it lengthy service. Our condolences are conveyed to the surviving members of his family.",23
23,Mr ANTHONY ,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE SIR,"Richmond-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Resources)-On behalf of the National Country Party, I would like to support the condolence motion and express sympathy to the members of Charlie Griffiths's family. Those honourable members who were in Parliament during this period will remember him. He was one of those people who had very strong beliefs. He was a very earnest character, but he had a great sense of humour and could always laugh at himself if need be. He was ready and willing always to get into the debates of this House. He was a very hard worker and, as the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) has said, he had a great social conscience. Hardly an adjournment debate or a grievance debate would go by without him revealing some particular hard case. He was very concerned about social welfare and about pensions. He was well known for his participation in debates and his contributions to trying to help people in this area of great need. Charlie Griffiths was an unfortunate member of Parliament in that he came here in 1949 and he retired in 1972-a long period of some 23 years and the Labor Party was in opposition for all of it. If the Labor Party had been in office, I am sure that Charlie Griffiths would have been a Minister and would have played an important part in a Labor government of the day. He was a man who was always hard working and who was ready to do his bit for the party, for the Parliament and for Australia. My sympathy goes to his family.",23
24,Mr MORRIS ,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE SIR,"Shortland)-I join the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Anthony) and the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Hayden) in paying tribute to my predecessor and friend, Charles Edward Griffiths, or Charles as he was known to his family and close personal friends. His career was that of a local boy who devoted his life to the service of the community in which he grew up and of his fellow unionists of the Australian Railways Union. In the latter half of his life he went on to represent them in this House as the member for the new electorate of Shortland from its creation in 1949 until his retirement in 1972. He started work in 1917 at 14 years of age as a shop boy in a railway depot in Newcastle. He progressed to become a top tradesman as a machine moulder at Honeysuckle workshop. From an early age he was active in industrial and political affairs, having joined the ARU in 1919. He became secretary of the Newcastle branch of the ARU in 1941 and then in 1945 its northern organiser for the area from Gosford in the south to the Queensland border in the north. In those - as union organisers did not have access to provided cars or other forms of transport. Many former colleagues of Charles still remember the familiar sight of him pushing his way to the various wor-­ shops and job locations along the track on his push bike. His political career began when he joined the Adamstown branch of the Australian Labor Party in 1924. He later became president of the branch for 13 consecutive years. He was also elected to the presidency of the Hamilton State Electorate Council and served as a member of the State Executive of our party for the 11 years prior to his election to this House. As the first member for Shortiand, Charles quickly earned a reputation as a fighter for the rights of the battler, the ordinary man, the disadvantaged, the pensioners and the ex-servicemen. Literally thousands of his constituents would not have received their rightful entitlements had he not been here to fight their case for them either with the bureaucracy or with the Ministry. In the Parliament, in addition to normal parliamentary duties, Charles served as a member of the Joint Committee on Publications for two years and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for eight years, when he stood down to provide opportunity for younger colleagues to participate. Charles Edward Griffiths was a humble man and a good family man. He was a man who did not seek the limelight. He chose instead to serve the people he represented. I was very moved when I visited him a few weeks prior to his death on 17 May 1982 when, although fully aware of the seriousness of his illness, he stressed to me his of Australia and his love of the Labor movement. He stressed to me also the vital need to carryon the struggle for the rights of the less privileged the disadvantaged members of our community. His regret was that he had spent all his parliamentary life in opposition. If there was one tinge of bitterness in those last remarks and those last words to me it was in respect of a matter, the motive for which he was never able to understand. That concerned a reference to him by a weekend newspaper journalist as 'Charlie Who?'. That was something which hurt him deeply and it was something that he never got over. Charles was the mainstay of his family-a large and close family-and a respected member of the Uniting Church. He served the electors of Shortland well; he served his union well and he served this Parliament well. Many people have reason to be thankful that Charles Edward Griffiths was their representative in this House. To his widow, Jess, who supported him throughout their life together with all the pressures of union and parliamentary duties, to his son, Neville, to his daughter, Anne, and to the members of the Griffiths and Moxey families, I express my deepest sympathy in their bereavement.",23
25,Mr LES JOHNSON ,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE SIR,"Hughes)- Mr Speaker, you and I served with Charles Griffiths for 17 years prior to 1972 when he left the Parliament. I suppose the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) would also recall, as he was also involved in debate in the Parliament at that time, that Charles had a great devotion to social welfare cases and to repatriation cases especially. He was not a man who had a hilarious sense of humour by any means, but I do recall a number of anecdotes about him. One is the connection with an occasion when he was telling the Parliament in great detail about the adversity of an ex-serviceman who, he said, had lost a limb, had had two heart attacks, and also had had a steel plate inserted in the back of his head. The man was totally disabled. Charles Griffiths said accusingly to the Government: 'What work do you expect a man such as that to do?' Eddie Ward retorted: 'Put him in the Senate.' That was one of the few occasions on which Charles took a joke very well. Charles Griffiths was a very earthy man and a great family man. He served on the New South Wales Executive of the Australian Labor Party for nine years. He was devoted to his son and daughter and to his wife Jess. We would call Charles Griffiths a fair dinkum Labor bloke of the old school. He used to say that the rot set in in this country when people stopped using the lay-by syslove tem and resorted to using credit and hire purchase systems. That will give honourable members an idea of the type of fellow he was. I have very fond and recollections of the service he gave to this Parliament and of the great devotion and sense of duty he had to under-privileged people in the community. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. DEATH OF MR J. L. CREMEAN",24

28,Mr SPEAKER,HOUSE PROCEEDINGS IN THE,"On 20 July 1982 I approved a request from counsel assisting the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry that I allow certain Hansard reports of proceedings of this House to be adduced into evidence and referred to by the Royal Commission. Before giving that approval I satisfied myself that there was no question of privilege involved and that to refuse the request could have caused a delay in the work of the Royal Commission. I informed the Leader of the House ( Sir James Killen), the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen), and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) of my decision. To avoid delays in the administration of justice it was long the practice of the Speaker of the United Kingdom House of Commons to grant such requests when the Commons was not sitting. This practice is no longer followed since the Commons resolved in October 1980 that its leave to use House records in the Courts was no longer required. The decision I made on this occasion was entirely in accordance with the practice previously operating in the Commons. I propose to follow a similar practice in the future when the House is not sitting provided I am satisfied that there is no question of privilege involved. However, in doing so, I shall ensure that the attention of the court or tribunal concerned is drawn to the need to have proper regard to the limitations imposed by Article 9 of the Bill of Rights as applied through section 49 of the Constitution to safeguard the interests of this House and its members.

BROADCASTING: NON-METROPOLITAN",26
36,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Minister for Communications. The people of the areas involved noted recently with jubilation and with appreciation the announcement on the introIs duction of supplementary licences for nonpayers metropolitan radio and television services. This, of course, will bring an improvement in the choice of broadcasting outlets available to people in these areas. However, is it not true that there are our young people off the streets. some people in other parts of Australia, such as Muttaburra, Jundah, Dajarra and other small BUDGET centres, who do not have access to any radio or television services at all? Can the Minister please inform us what is proposed to be done to provide broadcasting services and television services to these people?",26
37,Mr NA BROWN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is true, as the honourable member observed, that only a few days ago the Government announced that it would introduce a system of supplementary licences for radio and television. This, as I think the honourable member indicated, will bring frequency modulation radio to many country and regional towns and also a second television channel to those areas. However, the honourable member quite rightly drew attention to the fact that there are also some particularly remote areas of this country which still do not have any radio at all and which do not have any television at all. The Government has been concerned for a number of years about the lack of services in those areas. The Government's response to this problem has taken several aspects, one of which is the Remote Areas Television Service, which takes television NA signals from the international satellite. Without having to pre-empt anything the Treasurer may cuts say tonight, I am confident that our program in Austhis regard will be continuing. There are many which are scheduled to receive that satelof lite television service. I am in the process of examining a number at the moment. Bya remarkcoincidence Muttaburra, which is oneof the inplaces that the honourable member just menis one such place to which I have very recently approved the extension of the Remote Areas Television Service. That town has a population of some 400 people. In view of the fact that acquisition of land, which is necessary for the system, and the acquisition of equipment, which is necessary for the system, are both well adthe vanced, I am confident that television will be brought to that town and that area at least by the time of the Brisbane Commonwealth Games.

Finally, is it a fact thatacCOrdingt? the latest statistics all average wage earners will be paying a marginal rate of 46c in the dollar by the end of 1982 unless the upper income threshold is changed for the 32c category?",26
39,Mr HOWARD,TAXATION,"I do not remember what claims I made about the standard rate system because I was under the severe disability of not being Treasurer in 1977 when those rate scales were introduced. But I remember, in joining my colleague the then Treasurer, and the Prime Minister, making the entirely correct claim that the standard rate reform of 1977 introduced a simplified three-step rate scale which replaced the infinitely more complex rate scale which had, of course, been the subject of very significant change in 1975 when the Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer. NA NA",27
40,Mr FALCONER,FIGHTER SQUADRONS IN MALAYSIA,My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. It concerns the news release which he made in Kuala Lumpur on II August relating to the deployment of Royal Australian Air Force fighter aircraft in Malaysia. Did the Minister say that one of the two RAAF Mirage squadrons presently located there would be withdrawn to Australia in 1983 but that a decision about the other squadron would be left to a later stage after consultation with the Government of Malaysia? What circumstances have influenced this change in the previously announced decision to withdraw both squadrons from Malaysia? What consideration is presently being given to the stationing of RAAF FA 18 aircraft in Malaysia?,27
41,Mr SINCLAIR,FIGHTER SQUADRONS IN MALAYSIA,"To start off with I should explain that there has been no change in the Government's announced position. At no stage have I or my predecessor suggested that a decision with respect to the second RAAF fighter squadron would be made before the discussions which are to take place in 1984. Those discussions are expected to embrace the degree to which the FA 18 has been progressed in its introduction to service in the RAAF and, of course, the manpower requirements that will be involved in the change from the existing Mirage squadrons to FA 18 squadrons. Any involvement of the RAAF in Butterworth has, of course, been in total agreement with the Government of Malaysia. There is no doubt that the presence of RAAF aircraft there has not only been appreciated by that Government but also has contributed significantly towards the enhanced security that is apparent in the region. In the future matters will need to be considered by both governments. It is for that reason that the whole question is up for review in 1984. In addition to the Mirage squadrons there is a flight of transport aircraft and P3C long range maritime patrol aircraft stationed there from time to time. NA",27
42,Mr MOUNTFORD,SALE OF SHARES IN TREAMOG LTD,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Does an appendix to the MCCabe-Lafranchi report show that vendors who sold shares in Treamog Ltd received in cash an amount equal to the accumulated funds of the company including the amount that ought to have been set aside as legally payable income tax? Since the Treasurer said on 25 July that his proposed legislation to recover tax evaded would be aimed at those who practised what could be called the Treamog ploy, will he guarantee that the legislation will take effect from at least 10 December 1976 the day on which the Treamog vendors sold their shares?",27
43,Mr HOWARD,SALE OF SHARES IN TREAMOG LTD,"I cannot recall every appendix to that report which was, of course, commissioned by the former Liberal Government of Victoria, not by the Victorian Labor Government, after discussion and consultation with the Federal Government at that time. Be that as it may, I accept that what the honourable gentleman said about the appendix is probably correct. I can say to him only that the Government has already announced its intention to bring in special legislation to collect taxation which was illegally evaded under the so-called bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. I am not yet able to say who will or will not be affected by that legislation. In the nature of the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act I doubt that I will be able to do so. Frankly, I do not know that I would want to be-I do not know that any Treasurer should specifically want to be-in the situation of knowing whether individuals might be affected by that legislation. However, I can give the honourable gentleman and the House an assurance that the legislation, if approved by the Parliament, will fall where it may and that no individual will receive preferential treatment from this Government as it prepares the legislation or, indeed, from the Commissioner of Taxation in his enforcement of that legislation. VICTORIA: DROUGHT RELIEF",27
44,Mr FISHER,SALE OF SHARES IN TREAMOG LTD,"Is the Minister for Primary Industry aware of a reported request by the Victorian Government for special assistance for drought relief in that State? Can the Minister advise whether any such request has actually been made? If so, what is the Government's reaction to it?",27
45,Mr NIXON,SALE OF SHARES IN TREAMOG LTD,"It is correct that a request has come from the Premier of Victoria to the Prime J\.1iqister for fin-ncial - ssistanc- in drought aid !n that State. I noticed with some mterest a report m the Press that the Premier had asked for in the ordef.,o(SIOm. The telex that has come in does not mention any figure, but is simply a request. Indeed the telex shows a lack of appreciation and of real' knowledge of how the system of drought aid felllly works. I would like the Premier of Victoria to know that the present drought funding arrangements go back to the early I 960s when a formula approach was devised by the then Treasurer, the late Harold Holt, which formula with some changes, is still in existence. All that is required for the Premier to ensure that he obtains funding is for him to make sure that the first $7m of drought assistance is paid by the State. The Commonwealth will contribute $3 for $1 after that amount has been paid. It is interesting to note that, over the last three years, the Commonwealth has contributed $100m towards State drought assistance under that formula. The Premier ought also to know that there is no limit to the amount of funding available on the $3 for $1 basis once a State is eligible for it. Once the Premier has spent his first $7m, the Commonwealth will provide funding in a big way. The sooner the Premier gets on with the busiriess of assisting the farmers with their problems, the better it will be for all. The Premier has said that we have been kind enough to assist New South Wales in a different fashion. He is again obviously unaware that New South Wales unlike Victoria, has suffered significant droughts and is now running into its fourth season of drought. For that reason, last year we made $20m available as an interest-free loan-not as a grant, as I suspect the Premier of Victoria believes-and this year we made available $ 10m as an interest-free loan. New South Wales has run into genuine financial difficulties because of the continuing drought over a number of years. Victoria is not in that situation. Therefore, I do not think that the Commonwealth would see it as proper to depart from the normal drought arrangements at this point. The Prime Minister will be responding to the Premier in due course. NA",27
46,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MR DENIS HORGAN,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. I remind him that, on 2 June last, the Prime Minister, when referring to those people holding government positions identified by the MCCabe-Lafranchi report as being involved in tax rorts, said that the responsible Ministers should consider whether those persons should continue in their positions. Has the Treasurer, as the Minister responsible for the Australian Industry Development Corporation, yet reconsidered his appointment to the board of the AIDC of Mr Denis Horgan?",28
47,Mr HOWARD,MR DENIS HORGAN,"The answer to the honourable gentleman's question is yes. Certain provisions under the AIDC Act govern the fitness or otherwise of people to continue to hold such a position. The Government has very carefully considered Mr Horgan's position. I can tell the House that the Government does not believe that the naming of certain individuals in reports which have recently been published of itself represents sufficient grounds for those people to resign or to be removed from public positions that they might now hold. Mr Dawkins-Oh, he is a crook. He is a crook! The Liberal Party employs people like that and to two or get rid of them you would have to sack the whole party.",28

50,Mr SPEAKER,MR DENIS HORGAN,The Treasurer will resume his seat. The honourable member for Fremantle will cease interjecting. I call the Treasurer.,28
51,Mr HOWARD,MR DENIS HORGAN,"I can only repeat that this Government will not yield to the yahoo pressure which suggests that just because somebody is named in a report that is ipso facto a reason why that person should be removed from a position. I repeat-this is what matters to the people of Australia who are concerned about an equitable taxation system which honourable members on the other side of the House ought to be concerned about-that the Government has already announced its intention to bring in special legislation to collect taxation which was illegally evaded under the schemes covered by that report. I am not able to say who will be affected by the legislation. However, I assure the House, as I did in answer to the honourable member for Banks, that that legislation will indeed fall where it may and that no individual, irrespective of the position that that individual holds, will receive preferential treatment from the Government, as it prepares the legislation, or from the Commissioner of Taxation in his enforcement of the legislation. I believe and the Government believes that that is the right, correct and proper attitude to take. We will not yield to yahoo pressure simply because somebody happens to be named in an individual report. NA NA",28
52,Mr BURR,NEW ZEALAND,"My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. In view of the effect that closer economic relations with New Zealand may have on a number of industries in Australia and in particular in Tasmania, will the Government agree to ask the Industries Assistance Commission to conduct a full inquiry into all the implications of CER before any agreement is concluded with the New Zealand Government?",29
53,Mr NEWMAN,NEW ZEALAND,"The honourable member would be aware that quite detailed consultations have taken place between me and other senior Ministers of the Federal Government and Tasmanian interests over a range of industries. They include particularly the vegetable industry, the dairy industry and latterly the timber industry. In all of those consultations, we have sought to make very clear to those interests what the Government's policy is, that is, principally that there should be industry to industry consultations between the two countries. As the question of the lAC was raised, I will refer the question to the other responsible Ministers. NA",29
54,Mr BEAZLEY ,PROPOSED TAXATION LEGISLATION,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has his attention been drawn to reports of a campaign by various high income groups against legislation which proposes to enable recovery of tax lost through bottom-of-theharbour schemes? Is he also aware that the Liberal Party in Western Australia and the Premier of Western Australia endorse this campaign? Will the Prime Minister give an undertaking to the House that opposition to the proposed legislation from vested interests will not stop him from introducing it as soon as possible and will not influence its content in any way? Will the Prime Minister now say when the House can expect to see this legislation?,29
55,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,PROPOSED TAXATION LEGISLATION,"The draftsman has been given instructions for that legislation to be prepared with maximum urgency. It will be introduced into the Parliament as soon as it has gone through the processes. It is intended that that should be early in this session. I give a total and unequivocal commitment that the kind of campaign that is being pursued publicly and through advertisements in the newspapers will not push the Government from its intention, its decision and its determination. There is no way that that statement can or will be qualified. It does not matter who is involved in particular campaigns. I think the honourable gentleman may have taken the name of the Premier of Western Australia in vain. I have not seen comments associated with the Premier in relation to this matter. The legislation, once it has gone through the processes, will be introduced into this Parliament and will be pressed through the Parliament with the utmost vigour which the Government can command. NA",29
56,Mr GILES,LEBANON,"Has the Minister for Foreign Affairs any information as to whether the Lebanese Government and, through it, the Palestine Liberation Organisation, have accepted Israeli final conditions governing the enforced exodus of the PLO from Beirut?",29
57,Mr STREET ,LEBANON,"I cannot give an unequivocal answer to the honourable gentleman. We have maintained contact with the activities of Mr Philip Habib, the United States emissary who has been trying to arrange a satisfactory agreement between the various parties for a withdrawal of the PLO and, indeed, all forces, from that unhappy country, Lebanon, and to enable the sovereignty of the Lebanese Government over its country to be returned to it. We certainly hope that this can be achieved. As the Prime Minister announced only a week or so ago, the Australian Government has given a lead to the world community in announcing that Australia will make $lOm available for the rebuilding of Beirut when circumstances allow that to happen. We hope that other countries of the world will follow our example. NA Mr Cunningham having addressed a question to the Prime MinisterMONICA",29

59,Mr HAYDEN ,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. Tax dodging is a very serious matter in the community, creating great vexation for ordinary, decent and honest members of the community. Such a serious declaration by a senior member of the Liberal Party serving in this Parliament and former Minister requires some sort of response from the Prime Minister.",29

63,Mr TAMBLING,URANIUM MINING,"My question is directed to the Minister for Trade and Resources. Now that the Jabiluka project has received the necessary approvals and authorisations to proceed to production as a uranium miner and exporter in the Northern Territory, can the Minister advise the House when he expects the Koongarra uranium project to be in a similar position? Mr ANTHONy-it is the Government's policy to encourage the development of uranium resources in the Northern Territory and it is very pleasing that we have reached the stage where the Jabiluka project has now been given approval to proceed. As far as the Koongarra project is concerned, it is necessary for three requirements to be met before development approval can be given; that is, it must have the agreement of the Aboriginal people, it must conform with the environmental requirements and there must be compliance with our foreign investment policy. In relation to the environmental area, this Parliament passed legislation last year changing the original excised area for the Koongarra project. This was as a result of a request from the company and an evaluation of the possible environmental consequences for the Kakadu National Park. It was pointed out in the second reading speech that this change would actually improve the value of the park as well as help the mining company to meet the environmental regulations. That legislation was passed. Up to this point, although there have been discussions with the Aboriginals, they have some reservations about the altered boundary.",30
64,Mr HOLDING ,URANIUM MINING,The Aborigines have said they are opposed to it.,30
65,Mr ANTHONY ,URANIUM MINING,Allow me to finish. I am saying that they have some reservations about the area.,30
66,Mr UREN ,URANIUM MINING,The Ranger Inquiry had a few reservations too.,30
67,Mr ANTHONY,URANIUM MINING,"If the honourable member wants to talk about uranium, we are quite happy to do so, because we are happy with his policy. At the moment, further discussions are scheduled between the relevant land council and the traditional owners. I believe they will take place shortly. I hope that agreement will be reached. There is no objection to the actual mining of uranium; it is more a concern about the new boundaries around the prescribed area. As far as compliance with the foreign investment rules is concerned, Denison, which is a wholly-owned Canadian company, will be required to divest down to 25 per cent of its current interest. At this point-to the best of my knowledge at any rate-no proposal has been put to the Foreign Investment Review Board. I hope that all these requirements will be satisfied in the fairly near future so that the Koongarra project can proceed, as is the Jabiluka project, because uranium development is very important to the commerce of the Northern Territory, and to employment and, of course, is of benefit to Australia in relation to a further export earning and making our contribution to the energy requirements of a needy world. NA Mr Les Johnson having addressed a question to the Prime Mini5terMONICA",30

69,Mr YOUNG ,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker. This matter is already of some public consequence because the Treasurer has put out Press releases about it, I understand.",30
70,Mr SPEAKER,DISALLOWED QUESTION,"But the question, in the way in which it is framed, is asking whether it is legal and proper. It must be asking for a legal opinion. NA EARNINGS: EFFECT ON TRADE",30
71,Mr BRADFIELD,INCREASE IN AVERAGE WEEKLY,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. It stems from statistics released yesterday that show a 17 per cent-plus increase in average weekly earnings. I ask: What effect will this have on our international competitiveness and what measures can be taken to stop Australia's gradual self-destruction through selfish and unrealistic earnings expectations?,30
72,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,INCREASE IN AVERAGE WEEKLY,"I think that there is a great deal that can be done. I think that a good deal has been done over the recent period. The conference that was held between the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Government had a number of common elements. Whilst the parties to that conference would have given different emphasis to different events and circumstances, I think there was a common thread running through our concerns for the Australian economy, caused significantly but not exclusively by two factors, one being the downturn in the world economy, which is having a dramatic effect on export income and commodity prices. Nowhere is that more evident than in my electorate, where the Alcoa smelter has come to a halt. It will be a ghost works for a considerable period. Honourable members may not be aware that that plant was being established not to supply the Australian market but to supply world markets in total, using Australian bauxite and Australian power. Those markets, of course, do not exist and the company ran out of funds and could not get partners. In those circumstances, it unfortunately had no choice. That is one of the starkest reminders of what can happen as a result of world recession and world difficulties. On top of that many countries, because they were in a period of recession and of high and rising levels of unemployment-up to nearly 14 per cent in the United Kingdom and about \0 per cent in the United States-had been achieving through last year and the period before that levels of wage settlement of around 5 per cent or 6 per cent. The mood in the Australian economy and, I think, amongst the overwhelming number of Australians at this time last year was quite different from that which exists today. Unfortunately, there were wage pressures and wage agreements which tended to make Australian industry and exporters much less competitive at a time when other countries were becoming more and more competitive, even though they were under the threat of the difficulties imposed by the very real economic downturn in those countries. Be that as it may, the kind of figure that the honourable gentleman gave, which has recently been published, obviously makes us less competitive at a time when other people have been becoming more competitive. There is much that we need to do about it. I think the conference organised between the ACTU, the CAl and the Government provides a foundation upon which it is possible to build. I think also that the acceptance of the parties concerned-the maritime unions, the industries or companies concerned and the Government-of the Crawford report provides an example of working together, of a very real recognition that Australians have to sit down and solve problems together rather than try to argue about them or cast blame for what might have happened in the past. In relation to the coal industry, there are Jhings that have needed doing. It would have been very easy to take certain attitudes about the reasons for delays out of certain coal ports. Instead of taking that as a purely political point it is much more portant to sit down with the New South Wales and Queensland governments and the unions and companies concerned to take measures and decisions which will get coal moving and which will remove the bottle-necks, whether they are physicalor industrial relations, so that we can deliver coal on time to our customers overseas. A great deal has been achieved in the last three or four months. There is much yet remaining to be done in that particular area. Obviously the Government can take other decisions. We believe that we needed to make a special effort to set an example from the highest paid people within the Commonwealth environment. As a result of that, special submissions were made by me and by the Treasurer, obviously with the Government's full support, to the Remuneration Tribunal. Honourable members all know the result of that. If there had been a recommendation for a 12 per cent, 13 per cent or a 14 per cent wage increase, coming on top of what had happened before, it would have been very easy for that to be regarded as a bench-mark for other decisions. It could be said: 'You have had your 12 per cent, why shouldn't we?' A very different recommendation came forward in the event. The Academic Salaries Tribunal has followed that lead. A number of private enterprise companies around Australia have followed that lead and some have indeed gone a good deal further than that. Other submissions are being made before wage fixing tribunals. I have written to Premiers in relation to these matters. The Premier of New South Wales has already taken action of a quite dramatic kind in relation to certain salary increases for public servants of the Government of New South Wales. So long as there is a recognition that this kind of restraint is important throughout all sections of the Australian community to return this country to the kinds of economic health and growth that we would all want, then I believe we have a capacity to work together and to achieve just that. Statements by significant union leaders in recent times have contributed to the mood for restraint. I will be very disappointed, and I believe the Government and the Treasurer will be very disappointed if, as a result of the Budget that is announced tonight, there will not be a capacity to build more on the mood for restraint. I think that the Budget will establish substantial arguments in support of that in future wage determinations. Therefore, a number of avenues are open to the Government, and a number of avenues are open to other sections or groups within the Australian community, but overridingly we have to recognise im- that there are significant problems, some of which are home grown and some of which are caused by the wider world outside. We are not going to overcome those problems unless we have a capacity to work together to achieve results. I believe a significant advance in that direction has already been made. NA",30
73,Mr LES JOHNSON,TAX DEDUCTIONS,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Has the tax deduction offered by the Liberal Party of Australia to those who help fund the Cook electorate been brought to his attention? Is any action being taken to prevent this scheme from being implemented? Can the Treasurer guarantee that no other form or variation of the access scheme is in operation?,32
74,Mr HOWARD,TAX DEDUCTIONS,"That matter has been brought to my attention. I made a statement a couple of weeks ago making it perfectly clear that there is no provision in the tax law of this country which would enable donations, as such, to a political party to be tax deductable. I discussed the matter with the then Acting Commissioner of Taxation who told me that contributions to bodies of the type described by the honourable member would not be tax deductible. He also said that contributions to foundations established by financial supporters of another political party would likewise not be tax deductible. Under those circumstances I give the maximum assurance that can be given by a Treasurer, having regard to the responsibilities of the Commissioner of Taxation for administration of the Act. I think the honourable member is really concerned, as I believe his question indicates, that moneys which are not tax deductible do not wind up in the hands of a political party. I gather by his nodding that that is what he is concerned about. I hope that he will talk to the treasurer of every branch of the Australian Labor Party around Australia as a result of his concern in the matter and make sure that the next time the treasurer of that Labor Party branch receives a donation from a trade union movement, that treasurer gets a written undertaking from the secretary of the trade union movement that none of the contribution has come out of the fees of the members of that trade union, because those fees themselves are tax deductible. NA",32
75,Mr COLEMAN,DONATIONS TO RELIEF FUND,"My question, which is directed to the Treasurer, refers to the national organisation, of which the Prime Minister is patron, which is seeking to raise funds for relief in Lebanon. Has that organisation applied to have donations to that relief fund made tax deductible? Has the Treasurer made a decision on those representations?",32
76,Mr HOWARD,DONATIONS TO RELIEF FUND,I have been approached by that particular organisation. I can inform the honourable gentleman that the request is being sympathetically considered at present. I hope to be able to make a statement about it tomorrow. NA,32
77,Mr CUNNINGHAM,TAX DODGING SCHEMES,"Is the Prime Minister aware of any of his ministerial or former ministerial colleagues being involved in tax dodging schemes? What action has the Prime Minister taken to guarantee that neither he, nor any present or past member of his Ministry, is or was involved in tax dodging schemes?",32
78,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,TAX DODGING SCHEMES,"The Treasurer has made it very plain and I have made it very plain that as a result of legislation that is being introduced, it will fall where it may. That will be a matter for either the law authorities or the Tax Commissioner to prosecute. I am no more aware of negotiations that have gone forward between any members of this - arliament, whether they are Ministers or private members of parliament, and the Tax Commissioner, than I am of the negotiations that have gone forward, no doubt from time to time, between the Tax Commissioner and members of the Australian Labor Party of the Opposition. Those matters, as the honourable gentleman would know, are matters for the Chief Commissioner of Taxation to pursue. There are certain laws of secrecy in relation to that. If the honourable gentleman would like the Tax Commissioner to inform me of negotiations with all members of Parliament, including all members of the Australian Labor Party, I suspect he will be advancing something which his colleagues may not want. NA",32
79,Mr LLOYD,LIVE SHEEP EXPORTS,Can the Minister for Primary Industry inform the House of any progress in the resolution of the live sheep export issue?,32
80,Mr NIXON,LIVE SHEEP EXPORTS,"I held a meeting in Melbourne yesterday with the producers, processors and the Australian Council of Trade Unions on this question. At yesterday's meeting the producers confirmed that they were prepared to accept a levy of 2c per head on sheep slaughtered, raising therefore some $600,000 for promotion of sheep meats, mostly in the Middle East. This would of course be matched dollar for dollar by the Commonwealth. If the processors were to join the producers in making a donation-they talked about a Ic offer-this would add another $300,000. That has not yet come to pass. The House will know that the Commonwealth has made $lm available for dollar-for-dollar matching. The significant thing is that the qualification the Commonwealth and the industry have relates to there being a resolution of industrial difficulties on the live sheep issue around Australia, but particularly in Portland. The Vice-President of the ACTU, Mr Crean, has agreed to take this very question back to the ACTU Executive this week and provide me with some response by the end of the week. I look forward to that. As I understand, he has fairly detailed consultations to undertake not only with the ACTU Executive but also with the Trades and Labour Council in Melbourne or the Trades and Labour Council down in the Portland district. The market development fund will be handled under the auspices of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. There is to be an advisory committee on the expenditure of funds which will . consist of three producers, one processor, one resentative of the ACTU and a couple of Commonwealth Government representatives. All in all, some considerable progress was made at the meeting. Much depends on the outcome of the talks Mr Crean has with the ACTU Executive.

86,Mr LUSHER,AUSTRALIAN HOSTAGES IN,Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a position to inform the House of the latest information available concerning the hostages that were taken in Zimbabwe? Are we as a Government satisfied that the authorities there are doing everything that can be done to recover those people?,33
87,Mr STREET,AUSTRALIAN HOSTAGES IN,"Mr Speaker, as I am sure all members of the House would know, on 23 July two Australian citizens, Mr Bajzelj and Mr Butler, together with four other people, two United Kingdom citizens and two American citizens, members of a tour group, were abducted by armed bandits in Zimbabwe who subsequently demanded the release of some political detainees as a condition for the release of the hostages. The rep- Zimbabwean authorities immediately started an intensive search operation covering an area of some 1000 square kilometres. I regret to report that so far these efforts have failed to make any contact with the kidnappers or their hostages but the Zimbabwean authorities are continuing to do everything they can to rescue those hostages. In particular we welcome the statement by Prime Minister Mugabe that his prime objective is the release of the hostages unharmed. Our High Commisison in Harare is in constant contact with the Zimbabwean Government about the matter. I should say that there have been many conflicting reports about the hostages and their captors, but despite best efforts by everybody concerned it has been impossible to determine the truth or otherwise of these reports. As I said a moment ago, the present whereabouts of the captors and their hostages is unknown. I realise the enormous strain this places on the relatives of the people concerned and I am sure I am correct in saying to them that all members of this House extend their sympathy to them. For our part, we are continuing to inform the families of any developments as soon as we know about them. TAXATION: QUEENSLAND NATIONAL NA",33
88,Mr HUMPHREYS,PARTY ADVERTISING,Has the Treasurer's attention been drawn to the fact that a 46 per cent tax deduction is being offered for companies which advertise in the journal of the Queensland National Party? Has that tax deduction been approved by the Australian Taxation Office?,33
89,Mr HOWARD,PARTY ADVERTISING,"-My attention has not.until now been specifically drawn to that alleged offer. I will investigate what the honourable gentleman said. I can, only by way of preliminary comment, say that obviously for any company that takes out advertising space in any journal which is publicly ZIMBABWE disseminatedI do not know the dissemination of that journal, and this would apply to a journal of the National Party, the Liberal Party or the Australian Labor Party-to the extent only that a claim is made for bona fide advertising expenses, that claim would presumably be deductible under the general deduction provisions of the taxation Act. There is nothing in the world about that that would in any remote sense be regarded or could be regarded as a tax avoidance practice. The important point is that contributions as such either so named or under the colour of something else which amount to donations to a political party are not permissible, but I will investigate the matter further. But to the extent that it is possible for the Taxation Commissioner, under the secrecy provisions of the Act, to tell me anything that is useful I will let the House and the honourable member know.

I table a paper entitled 'Government Decisions in Response to the Recommendations of the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission'. I seek leave to make a short statement on that matter. Leave granted.,35
106,Mr NA BROWN,COMMISSION,"The paper which I have tabled is a copy of the statement which I released on 4 July last to announce the decisions of the Government on the recommendations of the Dix Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Having concluded its consideration of the Dix Committee's report, the Government took the view that the public interest would be best served if I announced those decisions as soon as possible. We also considered that there was a responsibility to inform the Australian Broadcasting Commission and Commission staff as soon as practicable ment's intentions regarding amendments to the structure, charter and responsibilities of the Commission even though this meant announcing these decisions during a period when the Parliament was in recess. I hope to be able to give notice, within the next few days, of my intention to introduce Bills to implement those decisions which require legislation. The Government's intention is that sufficient time be set aside for a cognate bate on the Bills and on the paper I have just tabled. It is probably also appropriate that I should take this opportunity to note that today is the last day of service of Sir Talbot Duckmanton who today is retiring as General Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Sir Talbot Duckmanton has had a long and distinguished career in Australian broadcasting. He started to work for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in 1939. Mr Barry Jones-As a sports broadcaster.",35
107,Mr NA BROWN,COMMISSION,"He is working with the Commission until the close of business today. I am reminded by the honourable member for Lalor that he started as a sports commentator. Except for a period of war service he spent his entire working life in the ABC. He presided over a great expansion of the ABC. He is a distinguished broadcaster and his public service and community service was recognised, of course, by the conferring of a knighthood upon him. I am sure that all honourable members would agree with me that it is appropriate to recognise his retirement after a long and distinguished service with the ABC and wish him well in his retirement. Motion (by Sir James Killen) proposed: That the House take note of the papers.",35
108,Mr DAWKINS ,COMMISSION,"Fremantle) (3.57)- The Minister for Communications ( Mr N. A. Brown) has indicated, in tabling the Government's response to the Dix Committee report, that it is his intention to make time available in the future to have a debate on it. Therefore I will reserve any remarks I have to make until that time. I would like to associate the Opposition with the Minister's remarks about the retirement of Sir Talbot Duckmanton. The Australian Labor Party recognises the huge contribution that he made to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, both as General Manager and in the many years that he spent in the organisation leading up to his assumption of that position. I am sure that all members of the Labor Party would like to wish Sir Talbot well in his retirement. Debate (on motion by Mr Bourchier) of the Govern- adjourned. NA NA NA NA Report and Ministerial Statement",35
109,Mr NA BROWN ,RELATED MATTERS,Diamond ValleyMinister for Communications) (3.58)-For the de- information of honourable members and pursuant to the appropriate statute I table a summary of the report and recommendations of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal inquiry into cable and subscription television and related matters. I seek leave to make a short statement on that matter. Leave granted.,35
110,Mr NA BROWN,RELATED MATTERS,"The subject of the Tribunal's inquiry, the report of which I have just tabled, is of prime importance to the Australian community. The matters investigated have obvious social, economic and technological implications. For these reasons the Government has decided to make this summary of the report and its recommendations available now rather than wait for the complete report to be printed. The full report of five or six volumes will be tabled in Parliament at the earliest opportunity after I receive copies of it for tabling, and this will probably take place early in September. There will be a parliamentary debate on the report as soon as possible after that. The Tribunal's major recommendations are that: Australia should introduce both cable television and radiated subscription television as soon as practicable. There should be limitations on the ownership and control of cable and radiated subscription television licences, based on factors such as prescribed interest levels, total media interests and the viability of existing broadcasting services. The restrictions on foreign ownership of commercial radio and television should generally apply, with some qualifications in respect of cable television, particularly in respect of companies that are naturalised for the purposes of the Government's foreign investment policy. In respect of cable television, a further recommendation is that separation of ownership of the cable reticulation system and the operation of cable television should be permissible. The private sector and public authorities-including Telecom Australia-should have equal opportunities to own and maintain the cable reticulation system. Public authorities should not hold cable television licences but may lease channels on the system. Cable television licensees should provide separate channels for community, education and children's programming. Cable television systems should be permitted to carry enhanced services such as security services or two way tele-shopping services. Each conventional television broadcaster whose service is substantially within the licensed area of a cable television system should have the right to require his signal to be carried on that system. Cable television licensees should be prohibited from importing signals from conventional stations in other localities, except in special circumstances. Advertising should be permitted on basic cable television services such as local broadcast television channels but not on additional pay channels such as those which televise recently released movie programs. In respect of radiated subscription television services, advertising should not be permitted within services that are encoded. The Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Special Broadcasting Service should not own or operate radiated subscription television services. Cable television and radiated subscription television licensing processes should generally be similar to procedures under the current Broadcasting and Television Act. The licensing process for cable television should be administered by a single federal regulatory authority. The Government intends to process the report promptly. It also wants to receive the widest possible range of views from the community on the inquiry's findings. I wish to thank the Tribunal and inquiry Chairman, Mr David Jones, the other members of the Committee, Mr Moremon, Mr Archer, Professor Gibson and Mr Wilkinson, and the Tribunal staff for their work in producing the report. The inquiry was established in July 1980 by one of my predecessors, the Honourable A. A. Staley, to report on a wide range of issues associated with the possible introduction of cable television in Australia. Later the terms of reference were extended to include a full examination of radiated subscription television. It is evident that the inquiry has had to confront many complex social, economic and technological questions. It has done so in a most professional and competent manner. Finally, I reiterate the point that the intention' with respect to tabling this report, which honourable members will see is described as an interim report but which is really a summary, is to enable people to have it as quickly as possible and to have access to it earlier than they would if they had had to wait for the entire six volumes or so to be printed by the Printer and then tabled. The Government feels that it is in the public interest and in the interest of all those concerned and interested in this issue that people should have access to this document at the very earliest opportunity. Motion (by Sir James Killen) proposed: That the House take note of the papers.",35
111,Mr BARRY JONES ,RELATED MATTERS,"Lalor) (4.4)-Ofal\ the social, political and economic problems facing Australia today the lack of cable and subscription television services does not rank very high. The ministerial statement made today is extraordinary in its timing and frustrating in its lack of content. The Minister for Communications ( Mr N. A. Brown) has given us the menu but nothing to sink our teeth into. We are provided with a two-page statement by the Minister for Communications and a short interim report by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. We are told that the full report of five of six volumes will be tabled at a later date-in September unless an election intervenes-and then debated. The timing of the statement on cable and subscription television is significant. It is clear that the Government intends to adopt the report if it holds office long enought to do so. The announcement today is intended to guarantee financial support for the Government in what will probably be an early election campaign, depending on the public's reaction to tonight's Budget. The Minister's statement shows exactly what the priorities of the Fraser Government are. With half a mil\ion unemployed, the best that the Fraser Government can offer is to provide them with 60 television channels to watch. Perhaps we are to witness the spectacle of a cable televisionled recovery. How extraordinary that the Government should be paving the way to adopt the Tribunal report on cable and subscription television before the report of the Davidson Public Inquiry into Telecommunications Services is received and debated. It is clear that, if the Tribunal report on cable and subscription television is adopted, it be another nail in the coffin for Telecom Australia. We have always argued that Telecom should provide the technical infrastructure for any cable system to be introduced in the future. Estimates of costs put before the Tribunal for cabling major cities were about $3,000m. Telecom's estimate was $1 ,200m. Telecom has the ducts underground and would presumably replace existing cable with optical fibre when the technology becomes generally available in about five year's time. It would be absurdly wasteful to introduce cable now with conventional technology and not to take advantage of fibre optic technology when it becomes available. This would be a classic example of built-in obsolescence. In any case the development of satel\ite systems may make cable and subscription television systems much less attractive economically, especially if RCA's new second generation satel\ite is adopted. This may mean that a television set owner, by the use of a black box which he or she hires and which unscrambles signals from a satellite, will have access to more than 100 channelsassuming that this is regarded as an advantage in our media saturated society-without having to pay for the cost of constructing a cable network and hiring out his or her own line. If cable is to be introduced Telecom should provide this using Telecom ducting and the operators should be licensed through Telecom. If subscription television is to be introduced, the Australian Broadcasting Commission should have it because of its already existing national network capacity and because it would provide an additional and independent source of revenue for the ABC. We condemn cable television in principle, at this moment, as an extravagance in times of economic recession-a modern form of bread and circuses. The Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) cannot give jobs but will offer the top 20 per cent of Australians a vast choice of television programs. Cable television wil\ have nothing in particular for specific identified needs in broadcasting, such as the needs of regional areas for example. Any employment generated would be short term and wasteful in the sense that it would be involved in duplicating Telecom resources. It would be better to develop the Australian television system in an orderly way offering additional over-the-air services and consider the possibility of introduction of cable television in specific areas when the new technology is available. There is a very real politico-cultural problem in the programming of cable television. There is no doubt that the bulk of program materialwil\ witnesses to the Tribunal inquiry said up to 60 channels-would be imported from the United States of America. In our broadcasting system, we have always seen the development of the system as one which sought social cohesion and cultural identity in this country. This Government adopted the report on self-regulation of the Broadcasting Tribunal which said that television should have 'an Australian look'. There is no way that cable television can operate in the foreseeable future on that basis. With four networks in Australia at the moment, we already have more than 450 hours of television programming in the major cities each week. Honourable members could imagine how exponentially that would increase if there were 60 networks operating right around the clock, seven days a week. That will effect a very serious diminution in the degree of Australian content. The interim report is a very unsatisfactory document. The Opposition is unable to examine vital issues properly because the reasoning for those decisions is not supplied; it is in the other five or six volumes which, as the Minister said, have not yet been tabled. Yet we are asked to accept on trust statements such as this one on page 64 of the report: The Tribunal reached the conclusion that the social. technical and economic arguments against the adoption of Cable television were outweighed by the favourable arguments. But we are told for instance about the economic argument that there is doubt about the economies of program provision for al\ those new channels but that it is merely a commercial matter and not one for the Government. If that is the case, why has every Australian government since broadcasting began always been concerned with questions of viability? Why has this Government paid great attention-quite rightly-to the question of the viability of country television stations, as recently as the announcement on supplementary licences? Surely they are commercial decisions? The report is absurd. It so severely breaks practically every established policy which has given us a reasonably good broadcasting system that it must be rejected and sent back to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal with the request that it should try again. Amongst the other objections to the report is the fact that, first, there is no separation between the control of hardware-that is, the transmission systems themselves-and the software, the programming. Secondly, licences are to be for a whole system, not just for a channel. Is the system operator to say who gets the channel? That throws out of the window the present system of licensing a channel only after proper inquiry. Of course, this comes from the licensing body itself. Thirdly, we are told that the initial grant of ing is to be for 15 years with 10 year renewals compared to five years and three year renewal periods at present. If we had neutral, public authority ownership of cable systems, renewals could be maintained at a five year or three year interval. But on this basis there is such a dramatic break with precedent that we need to know far more why the licence needs to be granted over a 15 year period. The report is very lax on foreign ownership and on Australian content-all things patiently built up over the years. On top of this, we are told that public authorities are not permitted to hold cable television licenses. Why is there this discrimination? The report is hasty and ill-thought out. It is no basis on which to prepare the plan for cable television.",36
112,Mr NA BROWN ,RELATED MATTERS,Hasty!,38
113,Mr BARRY JONES,RELATED MATTERS,"The Minister has interjected 'Hasty!' The report has come down with lightning speed for this Government. It has taken only two years for this Government to bring the report down. That counts as a hasty report with this Government, where like the mills of God things are inclined to grind very slowly.",38
114,Mr NA BROWN ,RELATED MATTERS,"You regard two years as hasty, do you?",38
115,Mr BARRY JONES,RELATED MATTERS,"The timing is very significant. The Government wanted out just in case it needed to rattle the tin in front of industry for a forthcoming election campaign. The report does not answer the fundamental question that the industry and people who are concerned with the future of the communications industry in this country are asking. It does not present anything except a crude dogmatic approach. The Opposition is also disturbed at implications of conflict of interest in this report. A consultant to the companies interested in cable television-Myer, Amatil, Elders-IXL and other generous contributors to Liberal Party funds is Mr Henry von Bibra, a former legal partner of the Chairman of the Tribunal, Mr David Jones. The Chairman showed a surprising and a quite uncharacteristic lack of discretion in not disqualifying himself from sitting on this important matter given that such a critical role was taken by his former legal partner and where it is fair to say that the report completely accepts the argument put by his former legal partner.",38
116,Mr NA BROWN ,RELATED MATTERS,That is very ungenerous. Mr BARRY JONESIt is not ungenerous. It is outrageous that the Chairman should not have disqualified himself in a situation such as this. It is licensthe clearest kind of conflict of interest. Mr Charles-What is his name?,38
117,Mr BARRY JONES,RELATED MATTERS,"The Chairman, Mr David Jones, and his former partner, Mr Henry Von Bibra. It shows a fundamental lack of sensitivity on a very difficult issue such as this that the Government should allow the Chairman to continue to sit in this matter. This is a profoundly disappointing report. We should not report to judgment on it.

118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,TAX AVOIDANCE,"Mr MilIar)- Mr Speaker has received a letter from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The loss to revenue of many millions of dollars because of the Government's failure to pursue the collection of income tax and to prosecute persons responsible for defrauding the Commonwealth of revenue. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMONICA",39
119,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,TAX AVOIDANCE,"Kingsford-Smith) (4.16)-There can be no more important matter in the Australian political climate at present than the matter of tax avoidance. During the recessnamely, in May-a report called the MCCabeLafranchi report was tabled in the Victorian Parliament. It was a report of an investigation of certain companies in Victoria. In the process, that investigation revealed the most massive fraud of Commonwealth revenue. It says that the fraud amounted to at least $200m. In a subsequent statement-what would be called a mea culpa statement-the Treasurer ( Mr Howard), in endeavouring to explain the Government's inaction and apathy, admitted that he knew of at least 31,000 companies being involved in tax avoidance over a five year period. That is in his Press statement. If one were given an extrapolation of that in relation to the number of companies investigated by MCCabe-Lafranchi, one would see that it is no exaggeration to say that tax avoidance at present could be costing $6 billion. What would happen if, this evening, the Treasurer were able to allocate $6 billion to the needy in Australia? That would amount to at least four times what he might give by way of tax cuts. And there are all the questions that apply to the needy schools and hospitals and the fact that the States are entitled to at least a third of that money. Let us look at the facts. In the statement made by the Treasurer, who apparently does not have time to come into this House to debate the matter, this situation is made very clear. This is a very portant matter. We are dealing with a matter of fraud and the failure of a government to do anything about fraud-a criminal action. The MCCabe-Lafranchi report refers to transactions in which companies are bought by dealers and sold-on to directors who are sham directors and nobody can ever trace them or the company after that happens. In the process of the sale of this company-in the sold-on provisions-all the tax liabilities that should have been paid to the Commonwealth are avoided. As the investigators said, the transactions were a sham, the companies were dumped and the loss of revenue to the Federal Government was massive. The generated losses of many millions of dollars come about because of the trading in shares of companies sold-on to sham directors in sham transactions. There is fraud all the way through. The report clearly states that the Melbourne operation was established in 1976 as Commercial Securities Ltd. It names the directors. It says that a network of commissions was established and that the process was the largest tax avoidance operation in this country. The factor which assisted the growth was the failure of the Australian Taxation Office to take any action. One cannot blame just the people in the Taxation Office. The Treasurer and the Government have the laws that apply-they are the laws of income tax and the laws of crime-so they have plenty of laws to catch in the net those who want to avoid tax and those who are guilty of fraud. We have only to look at Part IV of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which relates to penal provisions. There is a penalty for failure to furnish turns, a penalty if a person refuses to give evidence, a penalty for lodging a false return and a penalty for lodging a false declaration. There is certainly a double penalty for what is called fraudulent avoidance. There is certainly clear evidence of what the Commissioner can do by way of making prosecutions. He needs only a mere averment of the offence to make a prima facie case. Nothing has happened in a period of years. Let us go back to this report. It talks about the arrangements that were made. Discounts were given to those who were handling the matter. There were those willing vendors who obviously participated in this fraud. That is a significant point. We have all the details. Here is some of the evidence: The sham directors were procured by a Mr Faint, an associate of Mr Maher. Faint alleges that Maher required him to procure purchasers who would be able to disappear, who were of little or no substance and who had little or no assets. We now have this classic result of the bottom-ofim- the-harbour scheme. The Treasurer is now known in the cartoonist's situation as the Calamari Kid because nothing has happened about the whole matter of dredging up what should have been obvious in any reasonable legal approach to this issue. Do we have to accept the view that the Taxation Office is so devoid of legal intelligence that it does not know fraud when it sees it? Are the Attorney-General's Department and the CrownSolicitor so unable to see the situation that they cannot lodge one prosecution for fraud when this evidence is within the knowledge of the Department of the Treasury? Is it a cover-up by a Government which is not able to admit that it could not cope with the situation or, worse still, is unwilling to cope with the situation? The dreadful explanation given by the Treasurer in a massive tome of 27 June can be summarised by saying that the Treasurer is not expected to know everything that is going on in the Taxation Office and that perhaps there was some legal advice to the contrary. I doubt that very much indeed. In summary, the vendors, that is, those people who have got away with the money-perhaps they are not the ones one would call the shams, but they are the beneficiaries-received a generous consideration which had no regard to tax liability. The dealers went on to withdraw the balance and give themselves secret commissions, but the Taxation Commissioner was left lamenting. If this is the evidence, how is it that the Government is now talking about doing something about it and introducing some legislation rethat needs to be brought in? I submit to honourable members that the legislation already exists. It is contained in the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. There can be prosecutions for either stealing or, certainly, conspiracy. The Crimes Act provides for it. It is about time this Government did something about it instead of trying to mislead the public of Australia that nothing could have been done. There is evidence from a Mr Hurley who admits that the persons involved were shams and stooges. He would be an excellent witness in the box if one is talking about conspiracy. Pages 18 and 19 of the MCCabe-Lafranchi report list the names and addresses of all the sham directors. These people knew that the directors and secretaries had no knowledge of the companies into which they were capitulated. They were sham transactions. It was obvious that they would never be found and could never be established in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act. So let us get it very clear. The real issue is that there have been transactions covering thousands of companies over a period of years extending perhaps as far back as 1973. In fact, we cannot find any prosecutions at all. In one case only a liquidator was appointed. Why were liquidators not appointed in all the other cases? That is the normal process when a company cannot pay its debts. What is wrong with this Government that it cannot find out where crime, particularly conspiracy, takes place? It wasted $20m in a conspiracy case against unfortunate Greeks. All they received was the invalid pension and they are still getting it. But the Government wasted $20m trying to persecute them. It is very clear from the investigations that they asked this rhetorical question: 'Why was no action taken?' Whatever the position those responsible for the decision not to prosecute ought to be regarded as being answerable for the losses that have flowed from the abuse. That matter comes right back to this Government. It cannot avoid this in any shape or form. In the report of June which the Treasurer gave at length he said that he did not really understand the position himself. He came back with a further statement a month later saying that he had more advice and that the Solicitor-General would indicate that in one case there was some cause for action. I know that the Solicitor-General is a man of the utmost integrity. I submit that if he had had a look at the report, if he had seen the evidence that was available to the Taxation Office, to the Treasurer and to the Government, prosecutions would have been lodged years ago. This is the significant point of this report. Because no prosecutions were lodged, as the investigators said, this increased the nerve of Mr Maher. The lack of decision promoted the nerve of Maher. The schemes are now, of course, jokingly referred to as bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Maher's nerve was so increased that he just stepped around the tax avoidance legislation of 1978 and apparently he was not too worried about the legislation of 1980. I want to deal with the fact that I now know that an opinion was given to the Taxation Office, one which would have been available to the Treasurer if he had asked for it-if he has not already done so-and certainly to the Attorney General's Department, by a leading silk in Melbourne to the effect that something should have been done. That option dates back to 1978, and it notes that if a conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth can be established, there is a strong possibility that the agreement being the subject of that conspiracy is itself a nullity. In other words, the transfer of shares has never taken place. We see the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer here today saying: 'Oh, we are going to bring in some Act to try to avoid the transfer'. There was a learned Queen's Counsel opinion which any reasonable lawyer would support that if a transaction is done by fraud it is no transaction at all; it is a nullity. Those shares have never been transferred. What about having an explanation from the Government as to why this opinion has never been disclosed in any report by the Treasurer? The reason is that the Government does not want to attack some of its own kith and kin. Let us make this very clear. The Queen's Counsel makes the point himself: It is impossible of course to hypothesise as to degrees of informality which might be produced in any particular set of circumstances but assuming that the purchaser is for example, non-existent and that the transactions upon which the vendor embarks are nullities, the real risk is' that the vendor remains the shareholder and director as previously and the company has to discharge the tax liability despite the fact that the assets have found their way into the hands of the entrepreneur. In that situation and from a practical view-point the Commissioner would probably look to the vendor to recover the lost income tax. Nothing has been done. The Queen's Counsel said: The above considerations lead me to conclude that a prudent vendor of current profits in today's climate should satisfy himself (to the extent of obtaining competent advice) that the sale in contemplation: (a) will not involve him in any offence under the Companies Act, (b) will not involve him in a conspiracy to defraud and, (c) will be made to a bona fide purchaser of substance (not straw) conscious of his prospective liabilities and with acceptable means of discharging them. That is the position. That is the law. So why did we have this nonsense brought in today that we will have some legislation that will amend and cure the situation? I make it very clear againthis is a very significant point in this opinion that where people such as this have been engaging in the practice of what we can only say is fraud the vendors themselves could well be indicted. So, from a practical point of view in the short few minutes available to me I say that the Opposition is able to establish to honourable members the names of the people through the MCCabeLafranchi report; it is able to establish that there was a learned Queen's Counsel opinion back in 1978 that there should have been prosecutions. There has not been one prosecution. Billions of dollars are being lost in the hands of these crooks who should be brought to book. The only way, as this report says, that we will ever stop tax avoidance is by bringing in criminal penalties. If we prosecute these people one knows very well that juries will convict them. Is the Government fearful that some of its own friends will be involved? Is that the real reason it has not acted, when one looks at some of the people who are involved in the vendor position? That is the real reason. It is no good just arguing that the Government cannot do it because it does not have the law on its side. I emphasise the point that there is that opinion. I think any reasonable lawyer must say that the law is surely not such an as that we can have all the provisions for preventing conspiracy to defraud, stealing and for dealing with the question generally of failure to lodge returns under the taxation Act which can all go for nought because these people did nothing at all about it. The investigators make the point about how the banks got involved in this issue. They picked a little place called Stones Corner up in Brisbane where there were three banks. They make the point that on just one afternoon 60 companies were transferred through one branch of a bank. This involved $30m to $60m in the one afternoon. They make the point also with regard to a used car salesman being able to buy a company for $1.3m. He was an employee of Maher and others. What other evidence does the Government want? People who are working hard and paying their taxes are paying more taxes now because this Government has failed. The real issue is: We should be asking for the Treasurer's resignation. If he cannot administer an Act better than this he ought to get out. Admittedly, he only got this information in 1978 and a lot of defalcation and defrauding took place before that. But it is no excuse to say to the people of Australia, anything about it' when there is this report, when there is the law and when the Treasurer failed to admit that he had an opinion from a learned silk in Owen Dixon Chambers in Victoria which clearly says that as far back as 1978 action should have been taken. The Opposition wants to know why it was not taken. It looks forward to an immediate explanation from the Treasurer.",39

126,Mr BAUME,TAX AVOIDANCE,"Tax avoidance is now dead. They are not my words; they are the words of the national chairman of one of Australia's largest accounting firms. In a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald this morning Mr Roderick C. Cameron stated: Tax avoidance is now dead. I refer to avoidance (use of artificial schemes) as distinct from evasion (the cash economy). When are the media going to give due recognition to the achievements of the Treasurer, Mr Howard, in relation to tax avoidance? Mr Cameron went on: There continues to be widespread coverage of the avoidance of huge sums of taxation in past years in such a way that the public must believe that a major problem still exists. From listening to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen) today one would get the false impression that it would still exist. Mr Cameron continued: Extensive coverage given recently to the rather emotive remarks of Mr John Miller, president of the Australian Society of Accountants, would have added further to that impression. The fact is that tax avoidance is finished. Mr Howard has had to overcome enormous problems, particularly those arising from certain High Court decisions in years past. The war has been won by the Treasurer and the public should be left in no doubt of it. Mr Howard deserves the highest praise. Tax evasion, however, by those engaged in 'cash' business continues to be a major problem·Particularly for many supporters of the Aus'I can't do tralian Labor PartyAnd involves a vast amount of lost revenue. The Treasurer will not make much headway in overcoming it without the active co-operation of all members of the community. We should all resist making payments in cash (even if offered a lower price) and should not co-operate WIth those who obviously evade their responsibilities to the communIty In this way. I read that letter, particularly the last bit about the cash economy, to drive home to the Australian Labor Party that some officials in unions which are very close to the Australian Labor Party protested violently when there was an attempt some years ago to examine methods by which the cash economy, which is now the biggest area of tax evasion in Australia, operates. It involves the payment by cash for work done by people who do not want to have any record kept of that work. Various unions close to the Labor Party violently protested when attempts were made to examine methods by which this money could be recouped for the benefit of those Australians who are obliged to pay tax as pay-as-youearn taxpayers. It seems to me that we have simply to examine whether the points made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition can, in fact, be even vaguely sustained. He said that the Government has failed to pursue the collection of income tax. Now that is an incredible statement. The announcement of the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) of 25 July to which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred in such a disparaging way clearly rebuts the statement but no doubt he did not want Schedule A6Legal proceedings Office New South Wales Victoria Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania Northern Territory Australian Capital Territory MR BAUME-I thank the House. I proceed now to the general question of whether the tax which was not paid at the time in respect of bottom-of-the-harbour activities has in fact been lost. The Opposition has quaintly ignored the fact that there has already been an announcement that this money will be pursued; that is, money that was evaded by fraud, in effect. There is no doubt that the statement made recently by the Treasurer clearly indicated that those people who have benefited as a result of fraud will be obliged to pay back the money involved. The analogy I make is a simple one. If someone in a pub buys for $30 what he knows to be a $1,000 gold watch he has no good title to it and to read that bit. The Treasurer said that the amount of revenue which can be collected from vendor shareholders in bottom-of-the-harbour strips of untaxed company profits is estimated to be $450m and we are proceeding to get that money. The matter of public importance also states that the Government has failed to prosecute persons responsible for defrauding the Commonwealth of revenue. This is clearly wrong. The report of the Commissioner for Taxation for 1980-81 clearly shows that in the preceding financial year legal proceedings were taken in 68,394 cases to recover income tax and additional tax. The amounts sued for in such cases totalled $151 m. In 68,394 cases legal proceedings were taken and yet we are told by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that we have failed to pursue the collection of income tax. I seek leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard the table of the number of cases and the amounts sued for by States, which is in the official report of the Taxation Commissioner. Leave granted. The table read asfollowsto recover tax and additional tax. Period: 1 July 19791030 June 1980 ScheduleA6 Number Amount Costs of cases sued for incurred $ $ 28,428 73,172,513.52 448,607.27 16,419 21,644,558.00 643,289.00 5,203 16,687,894.33 262,678.20 3,275 6,702,976.87 48,995.55 9,249 18,945,975.15 22-,537.70 2,506 5,807,554.69 41,513.10 461 2,740,917.60 28,377.70 2,853 5,545,385.00 86,723.00 Total 68,394 151,247,775.16 1,789,721.52 - Including additional tax and tax instalment deductions. the owner can in fact, as I understand it, recover it. Certainly, that is the clear moral situation. When someone buys a thousand dollar watch for $30 he does not have good title to it. I use those figures because that is exactly the sort of proportion that was involved in bottom-of-theharbour deals where someone would sell a company which had a net worth of nothing. It may have had, say, assets of $IOO,OOO-for example cash in the bank. But it may also have a bill due to the Taxation Commissioner of $100,000. So the one balanced the other. The company really had no net worth. Yet the vendor would sell that company to a promoter for $97,000, in other words less 3 per cent. He would get cash for the payment of a small commission just as the fellow in the pub would get a watch for the payment of a very small commission. I want it recognised that there is very little difference between the people who benefited in both casesthe man who bought a thousand dollar watch for $30 and the man who got cash by selling his company, knowing it to be worthless, for an enormous sum, such as $100,000. They are the very people that this Government is pursuing for the recoupment of that money. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition suggesting that nothing is being done indicates an extraordinary approach to reality. It seems to me not only that a lot has been done already, as the official statistics show, but also that a lot more is being done. Let us deal with the question of how much has been lost. The most important point to be made in this respect is that the money has not been lost. Certainly the promoters of these schemes who perpetrated the frauds do not have the money to pay it back. They ended up with only the 3 per cent. They are like the fellow in the pub who sold the gold watch for $30. All they have is the $30. We want the thousand dollar watch back. We want the total proceeds. To carryon as though all we have to do is prosecute the promoters is arrant nonsense. We want the money back. The promoters do not have it and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows it. He knows that he is putting up an immense smokescreen which has absolutely nothing to do with recouping the money. This Government is keen on recouping the money rather than putting on an act. It is keen to recoup the money from the people who have benefited and that is why it made the announcement last month which is most significant and which, of course, was ignored by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition because it did not fit into his version of history, which is arrantly nonsensical. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition talked about the immense delays involved in getting things done. I remind him that when the Labor Government was in office it was pe:fectly well aware of the Curran schemes and all it got around to doing was making a 'Thou shalt not operate Curran schemes' statement. It did nothing more than that because it is very difficult to proceed in this way. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition knows that from his own experience in government. That is why I am so disappointed to hear the sorts of comments he made today. It seems to me that we have to recognise that this money is not lost. The announcement of 25 July foreshadowed legislative measures to be introduced to obtain payments from the vendor shareholders, the people who actually benefited and who, in effect, ended up with the gold watch for only $30 when they knew it was worth $1,000. The proposal to recoup the unpaid company tax from these strips indicated that a substantial amount of the $500m-odd attributable to such activities prior to the amendment to the Income Tax Assessment Act in 1980 which banned this sort of thing is capable of recoupment. Let us remember that this practice, this style of bottom-of-the-harbour activity, was in effect prohibited by action of this Government in 1980. The Opposition will say: 'Oh, but it hasn't worked'. Of course it has worked, just as a law against murder is fairly effective in diminishing murder. The existence of a law cannot assuredly prevent every murder. Even when people were being hanged for murder people still committed that crime. The question is whether these actions of the Government have prevented the continuation of these kinds of frauds. The answer to that is clearly that they have. The second question is what are we doing about recoupment. The clear answer is that we are proceeding to recoup the money. The question we keep on hearing is: 'Why don't you proceed against the promoters?'. Let us get this exactly clear: Last month a revised advice from the Solicitor-General came to the Government and in the light of that recent opinion action is being taken to bring before the courts the promoters and their associates under provisions of company and criminal law.",42
127,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,TAX AVOIDANCE,Now.,44
128,Mr BAUME,TAX AVOIDANCE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says 'now'. The fact is that we now have an opinion which says we can prosecute those people. But let us get this clear: Whether we prosecute them or not does nothing for the recoupment of tax. The promoters charge only about 3 per cent. We want the 97 per cent. In other words, this Government is more interested in the substance. The Opposition is concerned with the 3 per cent. We are concerned about the 97 per cent and about the people who got the benefit of the frauds. There is no doubt that we will proceed-I trust successfully, in the light of the amended legal opinion we now have-against the promoters. I do not know what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will then have left to say on this topic because the legislation that this Government has introduced has killed those kinds of devices; it has killed the whole industry. We did not hear the Deputy Leader of the Opposition address himself clearly and unequivocally to the fact that this Government has prevented and has now killed off tax avoidance of this nature and certainly tax evasion. Mr CampbellNo one believes that.",44
129,Mr BAUME,TAX AVOIDANCE,"We hear from the more intelligent members of the Opposition that no one believes that. All the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Campbell) has to do is to find out, if he can-no doubt the honourable member has appropriate people to find out from-whether there has been any continuation of this kind of activity. I am unaware of it. If the honourable member is aware of it, he would be doing his duty to the nation and certainly to the Australian Taxation Office if he reported those activities instead of coming into this House and pretending, with no information whatsoever, to know about these schemes which have been outlawed by this Government and in respect of which recoupment and prosecutions are under way. If he can do anything more than pretend that these actions, this kind of activity, have not ended, it would be his duty not to make a smart-A lick interjection but to provide some material so that action can be taken against the people who he apparently knows are proceeding with these activities. If he does know and if the Opposition knows, they have a duty to report it. They have failed to do so. There is no evidence of a continuation of these schemes because the Government has ended them. As the senior partner of this major accounting firm and many other commentators, including leaders of the accounting industry, have said, this Government has done more than any other government to end this kind of tax avoidance and to recoup the proceeds of tax evasion. The record is clear and unequivocal. The sorts of nonsensical statements made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and, by way of interjection, by other members of the Opposition, do their case no good.",45
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,TAX AVOIDANCE,Mr MilIar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,45
131,Mr DUFFY ,TAX AVOIDANCE,"Holt) (4.48)-The contempt with which the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) treats this matter has obviously been shown to this Parliament this afternoon by the Mickey Mouse reply to the allegations that were put forward in a hard form today by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen). However, I would like to deal very briefly with a couple of matters from what the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Baume) had to say, which included a fair amount of fairy tale stuff. He announced that Mr Roderick C. Cameron had said that tax avoidance was dead. We are supposed to end the debate on that issue. He then went on to point out that the High Court of Australia had presented problems to the Government. It has not presented any problems to the Government in respect of prosecutions under the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. That is what we are talking about and that is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was talking about. There have been no prosecutions under that Act. The honourable member for Macarthur then referred to a list in the report of the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in relation to tax collected from other people. That is not what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was talking about. It is a pity that the honourable member did not have enough intelligence to understand what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was talking about. The only thing that came out of the speech of the honourable member was that the promoters of the schemes will be delighted because he indicated quite clearly that the Government will not be taking any action against them. Of course, that is something which we all knew. He then stated that there was no evidence that the schemes were still continuing. There is plenty of evidence that the schemes are still continuing. If this Government does not have the facilities or the intelligence, and if it does not know where the Corporate Affairs Office in Victoria is situated or how to search those companies, it is not our obligation to provide them.",45
132,Mr LUSHER ,TAX AVOIDANCE,Where is this evidence?,45
133,Mr DUFFY,TAX AVOIDANCE,"It is in the Corporate Affairs Office in Melbourne, if the honourable member could be quiet and listen; I have told him that twice. The response of the Federal Treasurer to the MCCabe-Lafranchi report was confirmation that his so-called fight against tax avoidance has been nothing more than hollow rhetoric. His first reaction was to brand the report as a political stunt. Within two days the Treasurer-a self styled crusader against tax avoidance-was on the back foot desperately defending the hopeless record of the Government in this area. Firstly, he peddled the line that no action could be taken against the practices referred to in the report which took place prior to the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980. I will deal with that matter once and for all because it is just another excuse for the lack of will by this Government to act on tax avoidance. The Treasurer yaps at the heels of the tax avoidance industry while it goes from strength to strength and continues to defaud the Commonwealth of revenue at the expense of the wage and salary earners of this country. On 26 November 1980 the Treasurer announced pompously in this House that the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill, under which there had been no prosecution to this date, would impose severe penalites on those who engaged in evasion of income tax or sales tax through the use of 'straw' companies and 'straw' trusts. It does not matter much what the penalties are if a government does not prosecute anybody, and that is what this Government has done. He went on to admit that the Bill did not in principle break ground that company and criminal laws had not already touched. In a letter dated 28 November 1980 the Law Institute of Victoria provided the Treasurer with two opinions, the reason for doing so being the unjustified opposition of the legal profession to the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill. Unfortunately, the reason for providing the opinions to the Treasurer was not very highly motivated. However, the opinions were important for other reasons. The opinion of Mr N. H. M. Forsyth spelt out that calculated and fraudulent tax evasion was already a grave criminal offence. The opinion cited section 23 I (I) of the Income Tax Assessment Act, section 86 (1) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and section 124 (I) and (3) of the Companies Act. These were only examples. The opinion also stated that other sections of the Companies Act, Bankruptcy Act, State crimes Acts and common law offences could have been used against calculated and fraudulent evasion of tax. The opinion further stated: How it can be said that they--referring to the sectionsare inadequate when they have not even been tested in situation, I find rather surprising. Not once had this Government taken any steps under any of those Acts to take action against people who were defrauding the Commonwealth. Yet the Treasurer stated in the House on 26 November 1980 that he could not do anything. He was introducing this great new legislation which would solve all the problems! Now, 20 months later, we have still had no prosecutions. In his second reading speech the Treasurer dealt with the situation in which a company having a tax liability or a possible tax liability lends money to another company out of which it is stripped so that the first company cannot obtain payment of the loan. In such a case the opinion to which I referred cited the case of Walker v. Winborne (1976) ALJR 446 as authority that directors in such circumstances were guilty of misfeasance under the Companies Act and were liable to repay the money lost to the liquidator of the lender company. No action was taken and still has not been taken against people in those circumstances. A joint opinion of Mr G. L. Davies, Q. c., and Mr D. G. Russell, also provided to the Treasurer, supports this view. Another offence clearly disclosed by the MCCabe-Lafranchi report was to deprive the Commonwealth of Australia of revenue. These offences were covered by the Income Tax Assessment Act or in furtherance of a conspiracy by section 86 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. For the Treasurer to claim otherwise is nonsense. He is not fair dinkum on this issue and has shown himself incapable of enforcing existing laws against those who are prepared to use devices which have distorted the whole tax system in this country. Worse than the conclusion that the Treasurer was incapable of carrying out his job is the obvious conclusion that he lacked the will even to have a go. His grandstanding does not cover up his lack of action. Clearly the claim by the Treasurer that no action could be taken prior to the enactment of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 is incorrect. The fact is that he preferred to take the easy option, that is, to do nothing. The Act on which the Treasurer places so much reliance was passed 21 months ago in this House, yet we have not seen one prosecutionsomething which the honourable member for Macarthur did not understand. He has left the chamber, unfortunately-not that it would make any difference; if one told him again and again he would not understand. The time for the Treasurer to put up or shut up has long passed. I now turn to the Australian Taxation Office, which copped a fair bit of flak when the whole such a situation blew up. Everybody said that it was the fault of the Taxation Office; they would have liked to transfer the blame to it. On I June 1982, members of the Taxation Officers Branch of the Federated Clerks Union challenged Mr Howard to 'explain why nothing has been done about this massive evasion of taxation by a wealthy section of the community'. There has been no reply to members of that union by the Treasurer. The president of the Victorian Branch said that none of the $200m in lost revenue had been collected and that no prosecutions had been launched against anyone involved in the schemes. I would like to lay odds about how much will be collected. We heard a great deal of nonsense today from the honourable member for Macarthur about how much money will be collected.",45
134,Mr HAWKE ,TAX AVOIDANCE,What would you offer?,46
135,Mr DUFFY ,TAX AVOIDANCE,"One could have good odds on that; five to four, anyway. The day after that attack by members of the Taxation Office-the very next day- Mr Fraser really jumped a big hurdle. He then started talking about retrospectivity. On the same day, Mr Howard asked Mr O'Reilly, the Commissioner of Taxation whether staffing of the Investigation Division of the Taxation Office could be strengthened. The chickens were coming to roost. What had the Treasurer discovered? He had discovered nothing. It was just another attempt to create a smokescreen. He knew that the infamous razor gang decisions taken last year imposed a reduction of 324 on the staff of the Taxation Office. These levels were appealed against, but staff levels had not been restored for nine months. As Mr O'Reilly, the Commissioner of Taxation, said, the most serious effect on the Taxation Office has been the loss of experienced staff in the audit and investigation areas. He added: There is a lag in getting trained staff. You cannot off the street and make them experienced auditors or investigators. That is a process that takes time.",46
136,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,TAX AVOIDANCE,Mr Millar)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,47
137,Mr LUSHER ,TAX AVOIDANCE,"Hume) (4.58)-Tax avoidance is the issue that it is in Australia today because of this Government's active campaign against it. It is an issue not because of anything that the Opposition may have done or may have thought that it has done, but simply because the Government, in its endeavour to ensure that there is a policy of ensuring that the tax burden is shared fairly across the community in Australia as a whole, is seeking to protect its revenue and to ensure that people are not getting away with tax avoidance in this country. This Government has done more than any other Government to stamp out tax avoidance in Australia. It is on the record that, since July 1977, this Government has brought in 30 separate measures to deal with specific tax avoidance arrangements. The Government, of its own making, has created an issue out of the tax avoidance industry in Australia. It has wiped out tax avoidance in Australia and the Opposition has done nothing other than to jump on a bandwagon which the Government has created. There has been a lot of discussion here today-I think most of what the Opposition is trying to put to the House today is based upon it-of the report by MCCabe and Lafranchi from Victoria. It needs to be understood that that report is historical. It describes what was done by certain companies and certain promoters before legislation was passed in this Parliament which has effectively stopped that practice. That is what needs to be understood. The schemes referred to in the report are no longer operating. They have not operated since legislation was passed in this House some time ago. I understand that the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission is drawing up a list similar to that which MCCabe and Lafranchi drew up in Victoria. That will expose the names of those companies and those operators who have done in New South Wales what MCCabe and Lafranchi exposed in Victoria. I have no problems-with the exposure; I think that is a good thing. The fact of the matter is that we have to recognise what it is. It is an exposure of something that happened before legislation was passed which has stopped the operation of those schemes.",47
138,Mr DUFFY ,TAX AVOIDANCE,They could have been prosecuted before; you know that.,47
139,Mr LUSHER,TAX AVOIDANCE,"The Opposition has come in get people today and accused the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) of contempt for not coming in and dealing with this matter proposed for discussion. They have introduced the debate on the day when the Treasurer is to bring down his Budget. Now, if one wanted to get the Treasurer's attention on this matter, today was really the day to bring such a debate on. Some points need to be made in relation to this matter of public importance which has been brought forward by the Opposition. The first point is that the revenue has not been lost. The revenue has not been lost until such time as assessments have been raised and contested and it has been found in favour of the taxpayer, or against the Commissioner, that the tax will not be collected. That is the first thing that needs to be understood. The second thing is that legislation is in place which makes virtually most, if not all, of these schemes inoperative. Further legislation is proposed by the Government to ensure that revenue which may be in doubt will in fact be collected. That is an important point. The third point that needs to be made is that new arrangements about taxation in dispute have been announced. The Treasurer has indicated in a recent statement that the penalty rateMONICA",47
140,Mr DUFFY ,TAX AVOIDANCE,Recent?,47
141,Mr LUSHER,TAX AVOIDANCE,"Recent, August. The Treasurer indicated that the penalty rate for late payment of tax will be 20 per cent whereas it has previously been 10 per cent; that the 50-50 rule under which taxpayers who have an amount of taxation in dispute pay half now and leave the other half until it is determined whether it is in fact due or will no longer apply; that all tax in dispute will have to be paid; and that if ultimately the finding is in favour of the taxpayer, he will get his money back and he will get interest on it. I believe those new arrangements will do a significant amount to ensure that the tax in dispute is not withheld from the revenue. I say to my friend the honourable member for Holt ( Mr Duffy) that these arrangements, which he keeps on interjecting are new-I do not dispute that they are new-were not brought about as a result of any action from the Opposition or any suggestions of the Opposition; they have been brought about on the initiative of this Government in exactly the same way as all the legislation to which I have referred has been introduced on the initiative of this Government. This Government is concerned to protect all taxpayers in Australia, to make sure that tax is collected and that no sectors of the community are immune from tax, thereby putting greater burdens on the rest of the community. Another point that needs to be raised in relation to the matter that has been brought froward is that the Taxation Office is stilI raising assessments against companies which were stripped before the Crimes (Tax Offences) Act became law. I believe that is a point which needs to be raised. For the benefit of the House, I need to make a few points about the effectiveness of what has been achieved by the Treasurer. I wish to give a few quotations. The first is a quotation from a Mr Keith Knight who is a former director of the Ward Knight and Dunn Merchant Bank, which was named before the Costigan Royal Commission into the Painters and Dockers Union as being a promoter of tax schemes. Mr Knight said: John Howard has been more successful than any other Treasurer. He has effectively for the general taxpayer. Mr Ron Crowe, the chairman of the national tax committee of Arthur Young & Co., a national firm of accountants, said: There are still trust stripping and sales tax schemes, takes a brave man to get involved in them. That statement was made before further statements by the Treasurer which would have firmed it up. Mr Jon Kirkwood, a taxation partner at Ernst and Whinney, chartered accountants, said: The use of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes would be a ridiculous risk for both the vendors and the purchasers. As for trust-stripping, there must be very little left in this area and what is left can only be said to be very risky. The Treasurer has made it out and I would not recommend it to a client. Mr Bruce Fisk, a partner in Touche Ross and Co., another national accounting firm, when asked whether he believed the use of bottom-of-theharbour schemes was stilI widespread, said: No, at least not in New South Wales. Our experience is that tax avoidance in the form of paper schemes are now not available in New South Wales. As the honourable member for Macar!hur ( Mr Baume) indicated earlier, Mr Roderick Cameron, the National Chairman of Coopers and Lybrand, another national accounting firm, stated: Tax avoidance is now dead. The war has been won by the Treasurer and the public should be left in no doubt of it. Mr Howard deserves the highest praise. If that is not enough, the Treasurer has revealed in recent days that the provisional tax receipts for the last financial year, 1981-82, were more than $200m above the Budget estimate. He claims that that is significant evidence of the success of the Government's campaign against tax avoidance. I agree with him. The Fraser Government has done more to stamp out tax avoidance than any other Federal or State government in Australia's history. This commitment can be evidenced by the number of announcements and pieces of legislation enacted by this Parliament. Part IV A of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which has applied since 27 May 1981, was inserted into the Act to provide an effective general anti-avoidance provision. We overcame something which no previous government was able to overcome. The Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 provides five years gaol or $50,000 fines for persons who engage in evasions through straw companies or straw trusts. The Acts Interpretation Act has been amended to require the courts to pay attention to the law's intent and spirit instead of the strict letter of the law. During the Fraser Government's period in office the Treasurer has acted on killed the tax avoidance industry 26 occassions, through 22 pieces of legislation, against 54 separate schemes. With the approval of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lionel Bowen), to whom I have shown this tabulation, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a summary but it of tax avoidance schemes legislated against or proposed to be legislated against since I July 1977.

(2) PVR will not enhance Australia's access to improved plant varieties developed overseas but will encourage the dumping of unsuitable market. (3) PVR will restrict the public plant breeding program to basic research for exploitation and discourage breeding varieties. (4) PVR will lead to the domination of the seed industry by foreign interest not responsible to the Australian people. (5) The proprietary rights granted by PVR will encourage the introduction of seed distribution and marketing monopolies and lead to seed price increases.

Proposed Student Loans Scheme Service Pensions To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that the introduction of a comprehensive student loans scheme will: I. Restrict Access to EducationPeople from poorer backgrounds will be deterred from studying by the prospect of incurring large debts. These people, if enrol, will be forced to amass loan debts. Richer students do not face this handicap. 2. Undermine the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme-TEAS should cover the basic living costs of students. Currently the time students and the maximum level of TEAS is a mere $49.67. Government statements indicate TEAS will be further downgraded if loans are introduced. 3. Disadvantage Women-Women students would be disadvantaged by a loans scheme as they have a lesser ability to repay loan debts, because on average women earn less and have a higher unemployment rate. 4. Disadvantage Mature-Age Students-Usually mature age students forego income to study and already have large financial commitments. They could not return to study if it meant incurring substantial debts. 5. Distort Educational Choices-Mounting loan debts would force students into studying shorter courses or not continuing with post-graduate study. 6. Result in Massive Attrition Rates-Students will attempt to undertake extensive part-time work or overload courses to minimise their loans. Increased failure rates will result forcing students to 'drop-out' rather than continuing study and increase their debts. 7. Cause Administrative & Financial DifficultiesOverseas experience shows high default rates will occur on student loans. Government money will be channelled away from TEAS to paying off banks. The government will also bear the administrative burden of pursuing defaulters. Therefore, the proposed student loan scheme wilrhave disastrous effects on tertiary education, which we believe benefits the whole community, not just the individual student. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that: The House of Representatives will reject the introduction of a student loans scheme.

144,Mr HODGMAN ,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Denison-Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce) (5.23)-I move: Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 13,14, 15,I6and 17 (1982). The Customs Tariff Proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. Proposals Nos 13, 14 and 15 (1982) formally place before Parliament, as required by Law, tariff changes made by Gazette notice during the last recess. Proposals No. 13 which operates from 1 June 1982 contains changes resulting from the Government's decision on recommendations made by the Industries Assistance Commission in its report on preparations, extracts and juices of meat. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendations except in relation to canned ham, canned poultry and frozen cooked turkey roll. A general rate of 15 per cent will apply to canned ham with imports from developing countries being entitled to admission under tariff quota to an initial level of 900 tonnes at a rate of 5 per cent. Imports in excess of that level from developing countries will be dutiable at the general tariff rate. Canned poultry, frozen cooked turkey roll, meat extracts and meat juices will be dutiable at minimum rates. All other goods under reference will be dutiable at \0 per cent general and free from developing countries. Proposals No. 14 which operates from 17 June 1982 contains changes resulting from the Government's decision on recommendations made by the lAC in its report on miscellaneous manufacturing. Group A: Articles of stone, plaster, cement, asbestos, mica and similar materials (excluding certain refractory products) GroupE: Ceramics. In respect of certain insulating materials the lAC recommended a rate of 15 per cent. The Government has decided that the duties will be phased down to this level over a two-year period to allow for a more stable adjustment within the industry. The Government has accepted the lAC's recto these so called ""dries"" in the ommendations that: Goods of asphalt, bitumen or pitch be dutiable at 25 per cent reducing to 15 per cent after 2 years. Certain friction materials be dutiable at 25 per cent; Sanitary fixtures be dutiable at 20 per cent; Certain goods of stone, slate, abrasive materials, plastering materials, asbestos cement goods, mica and certain ceramic goods be dutiable at 15 per cent; Goods of cement and certain non-refractory construction products be dutiable at 10 per cent; Other goods under reference continue to be dutiable at minimum rates. Proposals No. 15 (1982) which operates from 1 July 1982 contains tariff changes resulting from the Government's decision on recommendations by the lAC in its report on miscellaneous textile products. Mr Barry Jones-Does that cover Tasmania?",65
145,Mr HODGMAN,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Indeed it does. The Government has accepted the Commission's recommendations except in respect of embroidery and articles of knitted or crocheted fabrics, elastic or rubberised. These latter goods are receiving further consideration by the Government. The Commission's recommendation to apply a duty of $2.25 per square metre to fabric not meeting the requirement of being embroidered over 10 per cent or more of its area has not been accepted. Embroidery will be defined specifically for tariff purposes and will attract a duty rate of 10 per cent with fabrics falling outside the definition attracting the duties applicable to the base fabric. The Commission commented in its report that the effectiveness of assistance arrangements for a number of sectors of the textile industry could be eroded by the substitution of similar products imported at lower rates of duty. The Government has decided that imports of coated bonded fibre fabrics, certain double side coated polyolefin fabrics and tarpaulins, chenille fabrics and fabrics of flax or ramie will be closely monitored. If the level of assistance is being seriously eroded appropriate action will be taken by the Government, as it always does. Also incorporated in these Proposals are the developing country quota arrangements for 1982-83 and provision for a new tariff quota permitting duty free entry for specific amounts of sawn Caribbean pine of Forum Islands origin. Proposals Nos 16 and 17 (1982) are new. Proposals No. 16 which operates from 27 May 1982 is an administrative change which restores phasing rates which were deleted from the Customs Tariff as a result of a drafting error. Proposals No. 17, which operates from 20 July 1982, implements the Government's decision taken as part of its consideration of the Crawford report on the revitalisation of Australian shipping to remove the 2 per cent revenue duty applying to ships. A comprehensive summary setting out the nature of the changes has been prepared and is being circulated to honourable members. I commend the Proposals to the House.",65

149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TARIFF PROPOSALS,That is true.,66
150,Mr SCHOLES,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"I want to draw the Government's attention to the fact that it is possible that the rather cumbersome and slow methods by which duty arrangements are made cannot, in the current circumstances, operate to protect employment in the Australian work place. There is evidence of widespread dumping, due to economic recessions outside Australia, and threats to Australian industry which require urgent consideration and urgent action. I am aware of a textile and the International Harvester factory in my electorate where 2,000 employees have disappeared. I am sure that the Minister for the Capital Territory ( Mr Hodgman) has similar problems in Tasmania with respect to both textile and other manufacturing processes. I hope that the Government can bring about a situation in which, as a matter of urgency, consideration of the problems in these areas is made without undue delay. The situation at the moment is that in Victoria and New South Wales, mainly in protected industries, up to 100 people a day are being retrenched. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

154,Sir JAMES KILLEN ,DEFENCE FORCE DISCIPLINE BILL,"Moreton-Leader of the House)- Mr Deputy Speaker, may I make a suggestion that it may meet the convenience of the House to have a cognate debate covering this Bill and the Defence Force (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 1982 as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be put on each of the Bills at the conclusion of the debate.",66
155,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,DEFENCE FORCE DISCIPLINE BILL,"Mr GILES) - Is it the wish of the House to have a general debate covering these two measures? There being no objection, that course will be followed.",66
156,Mr SCHOLES ,DEFENCE FORCE DISCIPLINE BILL,"Corio) (5.33)-These Bills are the culmination of probably one of the longest and most protracted examinations of a piece of legislation in Australian history. The Bills modernise-but do not necessarily completely modernise-the various laws which have applied to the Australian defence forces for disciplinary and other purposes and also other laws, which in the past have been subject to serious misunderstandings and complexities, in respect of relationships between civilians and the defence forces. It is, as was stated to me, a major improvement on the existing law. Therefore the Opposition does not propose either to oppose the Bill or to seek to delay significantly its passage. There are matters in respect of the Bill which we will raise in debate and it is my intention, at the Committee stage, to move an amendment-it can be done only at that stage-which would require the then Minister to appoint a board of review, after the Bill has been operative for three years, to examine its operation and make a report to the Parliament within a year of its appointment. If one looks at the history of this legislation one will find that it is extraordinarily difficult to obtain agreement on a review of this sort of legislation and to have that agreement brought before the Parliament. For the record I indicate that rather traumatic passage this piece of legislation is currently bringing to a conclusion. An inquiry into punishment and trial of military offences was ordered by the then Minister for Defence immediately following the conclusion of World War II. Mr Justice Reed delivered a report to the then Minister in 1946. This Bill represents the legislative outcome of an initiative which was taken over 30 years ago. Through a series of delays, reviews, and I think, periods of pigeon-holing, the current military code or laws which cover discipline and other related matters in the various defence forces have remained in operation for a period which would not have been tolerated in the civil law of any State or in any comparable country. The law as amended or as replaced by this legislation takes out such offences as those related to beating of the drums and other matters which only now similarly exists, as far as I can see, in the Commonwealth Electoral Act which has a similar dating process because of its lack of cleaning-up. In this particular case some of the matters which still exist, and which will exist until this Bill becomes law, are of far more serious consequence. We have a case on record, for example, of an officer charged with an offence and found not guilty being re-charged under the existing law. This particular case was never tried because of ministerial intervention. Also there was the case of Papua New Guinea civilians being convicted and sentenced to death by an army officer during World War II who had no authority or jurisdiction over those civilians whatsoever. This proposed law clarifies that position and fairly specifically indicates where jurisdiction starts and ends and sets out, to a reasonable extent, the arrangements which exist between military law and civilian populations. I will refer to the matter relating to civilian power and military assistance to the civilian power. The proposed new law is far better than that which now prevails but it is lacking in clarity. Certainly, in our opinion it does not give adequate cover to Service personnel in respect of protecting their position where they are in fact involved in activities of assistance to the civilian power. We believe that it would be absolutely essential that total clarity should exist in this area. There is one other part of the Bill in which the common law is applied and where there is some doubt about the meaning of its application. I hope that the Minister for Defence ( Mr Sinclair) will in his response to the second reading debate or during the Committee stage of the Bill set out quite clearly what applications of the common law are meant by clause 10 of the Bill and that he will specify to what extent that applies. In the areas of criminal matters the Australian Capital Territory law is applied. That is a considerable improvement on the application of the variety of laws which had existed before. It does constitute one problem which in the future may have to be reviewed. At present the Australian Capital Territory law is the province of the Commonwealth Parliament and therefore represents the view of the Commonwealth Parliament on what the civil law should be. It is possible and probable that within a very short number of years Australian Capital Territory law may be made by persons representing the residents of the Australian Capital Territory, as is now the case in the various States. One would not be sure whether it would then be appropriate to apply that law to a Commonwealth activity. It may well be that we would continue to do so but it is an area where some future consideration may be necessary in order to ensure that the law as it applies to the defence forces is a law which would have been and which is approved by this Parliament. A second problem-as we see it-exists in clause 12 of the Bill. In that clause there is an onus of proof reversal which while existing in other Commonwealth law seems to be inappropriate, given the general application of common law and other legal aspects in respect of a person's defence. Under that clause of the Bill it is the defence which must prove its case rather than the prosecution. That clause is substantially in respect of a plea of insanity and a plea that the offence was committed under a pre-existing or an old law. Sir James KilIen- That is the case under the code and at common law.",66
157,Mr SCHOLES,DEFENCE FORCE DISCIPLINE BILL,"1t is in a clause of the Bill at the moment. We suggest that this is not in line with modern legal practice. The matter will be argued further during the Committee stage and certainly will be subject to an amendment, I think, in the Senate. We are merely pointing out that we believe that the onus of proof should never rest with the defendant in the case of a serious charge. I draw attention to a number of other areas of the Bill. In the provisions for summary offences and other trials the Bill now requires that a pleading should be made either guilty or not guilty by the Service personnel. There is also a limitation of paid legal advice to the legal office of the defence forces. I think the first matter that one would be entitled to raise is that if legal advice is limited to the defence forces some provision for independent legal advice is necessary. It is also necessary that the serviceman should have access to legal advice at the time of charging, which is critical in any action taken against an individual, and also prior to any requirement to plead or the making of a decision which is of legal consequence to the person who is charged. There are a number of areas of the Bill where decisions have to be made in respect of the future conduct of the case which rest with the defendant as opposed to the person who is prosecuting. I will point to one area which concerns the requirement that the defendant will determine whether a commanding officer or the person conducting a summary offences hearing will in fact pass sentence or whether the case will be referred to a magistrate or to some other area for sentencing. At that stage if legal advice has not been available or is not available the person who is making the pleading is doing so usually without full knowledge of the consequences of the pleadings which will be made. It would seem that legal advice should be available to the person concerned in the first instance in respect of the fact that the consequences of a plea of guilty or not guilty should be clearly known to the person who is charged and in the second instance in respect of the consequences of a request that sentencing should be passed to another area from where the charge has been heard. One other area of some concern is in regard to the fact that the Act allows that a conviction may be entered but no punishment recorded. At this stage the Bill does not provide-it is a matter which one would think current legal practice should suggest should apply-for a conviction to be found but not recorded. It is possible for technical offences of some limited consequence to take place and it is legal practice in civilian courts that convictions can in fact be entered without being recorded on a person's record. We ask that that be looked at. It is an option which I think ought to be available to a sentencing authority. Where the case is of such significance that the person hearing the case does not want to enter a conviction or some other reason is apparent, that option should be open to that person. I do not think it should be a mandatory provision in a Bill that a conviction be recorded in cases where a conviction is obvious but need not necessarily be shown on a person's record. It is one of those situations in which, 20 years later, a conviction on the record would not reflect the circumstances at the time it was entered and it could be to a person's serious disadvantage. We think there is need for some modification of the requirements in the Bill that bar the Commonwealth Ombudsman or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from in any way involving themselves in a review of the proceedings or those matters related to the proceedings of a military tribunal. The situation suggested in the Bill is such that all proceedings will be reviewed by a reviewing authority. I do not believe it would be unreasonable in circumstances where it was felt that the reviewing authority particularly or the conduct of the case in general were contrary to proper practices for the Ombudsman's office or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to have the right to review the case. I would not suggest that they should have the right to reverse a finding or to quash a trial but certainly they should have the right to advise on proceedings which have been conducted. It is an area in which one would think that a change in the present situation would not adversely affect the applications of the Bill. It is a very large and complex piece of legislation. It constitutes a major advance in the law in Australia and it is an even greater step forward in respect of the military law in Australia. The Bill constitutes what is practically a totally new area of law. There will be and are areas of some concern. I presume the Minister has had representations-I certainly have-claiming that it discriminates against homosexuals. I cannot find examples in the Bill to show that that is true. But there are some areas of the Bill, especially in the application of Australian Capital Territory law, where some discrimination could be seen. We do not propose to move in that area because I think the Bill is, in fact, relatively fair. Actually, it discriminates against all sexual activities because it makes them an offence on all military property. That is something I hope never to have to police. In respect of clause 61, I am told that it is possible that there may be some degree of discrimination. If so, one would hope that that could be cleared up. Certainly, there could be discrimination in other clauses of the Bill but those provisions are of an administrative nature rather than a legal nature and are not consequent upon the provisions of this Bill. In the Committee stage, I will be moving an amendment which is extraordinarily long for the purpose for which it was drafted. Nevertheless, the purpose of the amendment is to require that, after a period of operation of three years, the ister shall appoint a board of review to examine the operations of the Act and to make a report thereon. It requires that that report come to both Houses of the Parliament. In proposing to move that amendment, we are also accepting that some parts of the Bill, which we will probably move to amend at this stage, will remain operative for a reasonable period. But we believe that a set of laws which is totally new, whose application has not been tried or tested and which may be found to have deficiencies, should be examined as a matter of automatic consequence after a reasonable period of operation. It is an amendment which I think the Government could and should accept. If one looks at the traumatic history of getting this Bill into the Parliament, one can see that the first draft of the Bill was presented 27 years after the first inquiry and this Bill has arrived 9 years the first draft. I am not blaming anyone for that. Obviously Ministers of both parties were involved. Obviously it is an area in which very significant disagreements have existed over the years. It is probably a tribute to the former Minister that the Bill is in the House at all. It ably a tribute to, I think, Lance Barnard that the legislation again started its tortuous progress towards this House in 1972-73 when he ordered the matter to be brought to a head. The Opposition is not opposing the Bill. There are a number of aspects of the Bill which we think probably could do with modernising. We do not intend to try to move the necessary amendments at this stage. We would hate to think that we have sent this Bill on another 30-year cycle before it comes back to this Parliament. The Bill improves military law materially. One hopes it can be passed through this Parliament expeditiously with the amendment agreed to so that a review takes place after three years of operation.",67
158,Mr COLEMAN ,DEFENCE FORCE DISCIPLINE BILL,"Wentworth) (5.52)-1 particularly welcome the Defence Force Discipline Bill as it brings about several major reforms. Let me mention five of them. Firstly, it Australianises the military law. That is, it replaces British law with new and more appropriate Australian law. Secondly, it modernises our military law which, until now, has often been notoriously out of date. Thirdly, it provides a uniform code for the three armed Services. Fourthly, it simplifies the military law and its rules and procedures. Fifthly, it provides more lenient penalties in line with the reforming tendencies in civil criminal codes. Achieving the first of these three reformsAustralianising, modernising and uniformity-is significant in itself. The different laws formerly applying to the three Services have been compliMin- cated enough, but the situation has been further complicated by a mixture of British and Australian law where the British law has been already repealed in the United Kingdom itself. All three Services have been subjected to these anomalies, but the Royal Australian Air Force has had to put up with the greatest mixture of anomaly and antiquity. It has been subject to three codes. The first is the United Kingdom Air Force Act of 1917. This Act is the United Kingdom Army Act of 1881 applied to the Royal Air Force. It was replaced by new legislation in Britain in 1955, but it still applies in Australia, as in force on 15 September 1939, as modified by Australian Air Force Regulations. But that is not enough. Secondly, the United Kingdom Kings Regulations and Air Council Instructions for the after Air Force, which ceased to apply in Britain in 1953, continue to apply in Australia, as in force on 18 July 1940, subject, however, to some modifications made by our own Air Force Regulations. Thirdly, the United Kingdom rules for procedure of 1933 still apply to the RAAF as in force on 31 is probDecember 1956, although they have ceased to apply in Britain. Moreover, as well as Australian Air Force Regulations, certain provisions of the Australian Defence Act of 1903 also apply to the RAAF. Sometimes they parallel the United Kingdom Law and yet at other times they replace it. It is easy to make fun out of the quaint archaicisms to be found in the codes that this Bill will replace. One is the offence of having taken a ship as a prize and failing to send the papers to a prize court-an offence taking one back to the days of Horatio Hornblower. To end this tangle of confusion, obscurity and archaic ism is a definite achievement. More to the point, however, is the modernisation and rationalisation that the new code will bring about in matters essential to service discipline. In place of the old tri-Service codes, which laid down vague offences of conduct 'calculated to prejudice both good order and discipline', a new uniform provision covers conduct likely to prejudice the discipline of the Defence Force or to bring it into disrepute. This rationalises and modernises the previous codes yet still meets the requirements of service discipline. The penalties under the new code are more lenient-three months gaol as a maximum penalty instead of the old penalties, which were cashiering for Army and Air Force officers and two years imprisonment for Naval officers and for other ranks in all three Services. The demands of discipline are still upheld, despite the lenient penalty in the new code, because under this code it is now possible to charge offenders under clause 60, covering 'prejudicial conduct', with offences covered by other clauses of the Bill. This replaces rather contradictory pr0visions between the three Services over this point in the old codes. One piece of updating in the Bill is the section covering narcotics-clause 59. There was no specific mention of narcotics in the old mixed codes. Clause 59 is in line with the approach of the rest of the Bill in that it prefers, where possible, refer matters to civil courts. Therefore, the general principle of clause 59 is that narcotics offences committed by Defence Force personnel in Australia will be dealt with by the civil courts of the land. However, the Bill in this clause, as elsewhere, seeks to make the law of the Australian Capital Territory the standard of reference for Defence Force law and in the matter of possession of small amounts of cannabis or the use of cannabis inside or outside Australia it prescribes the same kind of lenient penalties for these offences that obtain under Australian Capital Territory law; that is, a fine of $1 00 maximum. Similar considerations apply to the Bill's approach to homosexuality. I noted what the honourable member for Corio ( Mr Scholes) had to say on this matter, but I am as surprised as he appears to have been concerning criticisms. Clause 61 of the Bill follows Australian Capital Territory law-the Law Reform (Sexual Behaviour) Ordinance of 1976-in not making any offence out of the conduct of non-incestuous consenting adults in private. Under clause 3 (14) the concept of privacy does not apply to Service premises-other than married quarters-Service ships, aircraft or vehicles. Turning to the question of how a uniform triservice code will benefit the discipline and morale of all the armed Services, mention should be made of the Bill's approach to the offence of mutiny. Clause 20 of the Bill not only clarifies and modernises but also replaces different definitions of mutiny among the Services by a single rationalised definition of the offence. Under the old codes there is no statutory offence of mutiny in Army or Air Force law, although in general mutiny has been taken to be collective insubordination or the combination of two or more persons to resist lawful military authority or induce others to do so. The Navy, on the other hand, has had a statutory definition of mutiny. This not only encompasses such conduct as the Army and Air Force codes seem to cover but also deals with conduct subversive of discipline or with the object of avoiding duty or service against the enemy or conduct which impedes the performance of duty or service in the Navy or co-operating forces. The Bill in fact both simplifies and makes the law more definite in this area as well as ensuring a unified approach throughout the armed Services. Care is taken to distinguish between conduct intended to overthrow authority and conduct which is merely the expression of discontent and which is not directed towards the general overthrowal of lawful authority. The latter kind of conduct is to be covered under the Bill's provisions regarding disobedience to to lawful commands-that is, under clause 27. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

160,Mr SCHOLES ,DISTRIBUTION OF BUDGET PAPERS,"Corio) (8.0)- Mr Speaker, may I ask whether you have discussed the matter of distribution of the Budget Papers? I understand that senators have been distributed with Budget Papers. Members of the House of Representatives are denied this until the finish of the Budget Speech. I think members of the House of Representatives are treated quite unfairly compared with members of the other chamber. Has the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) in fact arranged for the Budget Papers to be distributed?",70
161,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF BUDGET PAPERS,"The honourable member for Corio raised this matter last year. The matter was considered and I had a response at that time by the Leader of the House. I have not pursued the matter since. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) 1982-83 Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation for proposed expenditure announced. Bill presented by Mr Howard, and read a first time. Second Reading",70
162,Mr HOWARD ,DISTRIBUTION OF BUDGET PAPERS,"Bennelong Treasurer) (8.2)- I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. In doing so, I present the Budget for 1982-83. NA The past year has been an extremely difficult one for the Australian economy. The international recession is now hitting us hard. Our overseas markets have shrunk. Economic growth has faltered. Unemployment is rising. Inflation remains far too high. Interest rates are hurting many of us. Whilst much of this is due to the state of the world economy, the excessive growth of wages in Australia has made matters worse. At a time when Australian industries should be more competitive we have made ourselves less competitive. These developments have affected all Australian families. To some, the past year has meant either the loss of a job or job insecurity. To those paying off a home, the past year has seen unwelcome increases in interest rates. To those Australians who live in many parts of our rural areas, the added burden of a widespread drought has compounded other difficulties. In many parts of Australia major increases in electricity and other State charges have added to the burden of balancing the family budget. Prospects for a rapid recovery in the world economy are at best very faint. It is therefore unrealistic covery in the Australian economy to occur in the near future. There are no quick, easy solutions to our present problems. Such a background has made the framing of this Budget by far the most difficult since the present Government took office. On the one hand it was necessary to recognise that present economic conditions cause real hardship to many Australians. On the other hand, we must never lose sight of the need to maintain an economic strategy which is responsible and which effectively addresses those economic developments which have contributed to our present situation. The Government has accordingly endeavoured to balance these two considerations in the fairest and most responsible way possible. In short, we have done all we can to provide relief, assistance and incentive within the confines of a responsible economic policy. This has necessarily meant some increase in the size of the overall Budget deficit compared with last year. But the outcome-a deficit of $1 ,674m-is only one per cent of gross domestic product and produces a domestic surplus of $230m. The Government is confident that this deficit can be financed in a non-inflationary manner. The principal features of this Budget are: some personal tax relief and other assistance specifically designed to give maximum help to Australian families especially those on lower and middle incomes; interest relief for people paying off their home; a shift in emphasis towards capital works expenditure, including a special roads program, with beneficial employment consequences; increased assistance for pensioners; the introduction of a new Family Income Supplement to help certain low income families; an increase in job training opportunities and other help for the unemployed; and some increases in indirect taxation and a modest broadening of the indirect tax base. These items should be looked at in conjunction with the major incentives provided to Australian industry by the measures announced by the Prime Minister a few weeks ago. NA Few predicted the extent of the present world to expect a major rerecession. For a period we in Australia were fortunate not to feel its full effects. Our economic policies and relative energy endowments created a more favourable investment climate in Australia than in most other countries. This sustained our economic growth beyond that of others. However, the continued deterioration of economic activity around the world with all its implications for trade and commodity and energy prices ultimately affected our exports. It also dampened enthusiasm for a number of mineral and energy related projects. These adverse international influences were compounded by a significant worsening on the domestic wages front. The need for maximum wage restraint has therefore been much in the Government's mind in framing this Budget. Further progress on this front must be achieved if we are to become more competitive as a nation, thus reaping in full the benefits of a revival of the world economy when it comes. The plain, inescapable fact is that Australia has priced herself out of many world markets. For example, last year wage levels in this country grew by some 3 or 4 per cent more than the rate of inflation. By comparison recent wage settlements in West Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom, countries that rank among our major trading partners, have been around or less than the rates of inflation in those countries. Unless our relative performance is improved, our living standards will suffer. This problem can only be solved through a total community commitment. The recent tripartite discussions between the Government, employers and the unions have already made a valuable contribution in this context. For its part the Government will continue to follow those policies which create the right general economic environment for wage restraint. As a major employer the Government has recently sought a significant degree of wage restraint in respect of its own employees. There have already been a number of private sector and State government responses to this lead which the Government welcomes. The unions too have a major role to play. All of us must become more conscious of the appalling consequences in terms of more unemployment which flow from excessive wage rises. The Government welcomes recent statements by some trade union leaders acknowledging the importance of wage restraint. The taxation relief and other assistance, particularly for families, contained in this Budget should be taken account of by wage and salary earners in making their wage claims. THE OUTCOME FOR 1981-82 For the year as a whole both production and employment grew more slowly than in the previous year-and more slowly than expected at the time of last year's Budget. Nevertheless, private business still grew very strongly in real terms. Real personal consumption expenditure rose by 3t per cent; however, private dwelling investment fell by 3 per cent. Exports remained flat and imports rose strongly. Gross domestic product rose by 3 per cent and non-farm product by 2* per cent. Many of these figures, however, disguise the marked slowdown in activity which occurred during the course of 1981-82 as the effects of the international recession and adverse wage developments began to take their toll on the Australian economy. As a result, non-farm product grew at an annual rate of only one quarter of one per cent during the second half of 1981-82. For 1981-82 as a whole, average weekly earnings appear to have risen by about 14 per cent. That figure would have been serious enough. However, it conceals the jump in average weekly earnings at an estimated annual rate of around 20 per cent between the December and June quarters. It also conceals the fact that, during the year, shorter working hours added further to labour costs. All of this was occurring at a time when overseas wage and price inflation was coming down. In consequence, Australia's rate of wage and price inflation moved sharply above those of our major trading partners and the competitiveness of much of our industry was severely eroded, despite considerable depreciation of our exchange rate. Over the year to June 1982 Australia's inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index was 10.7 per cent-almost 2 per cent above the rate over the previous twelve months and some 4 per cent above the average for our major OECD trading partners. The profit share fell in the first half of 1982 to the average level of 1974-75. Employers reacted quickly by pruning their labour forces, and unemployment, which had been gradually rising over the second half of 1981, has increased sharply so far in 1982. Interest rates in Australia were extremely high during 1981-82 in both real and nominal terms, reflecting in a major way interest rates abroad. Our high interest rates also reflected, however, domestic influences including the increased defixed investment mand for funds. The Commonwealth demands on financial markets were again lower but other levels of government continued to increase theirs. Corporate sector borrowing also remained strong, even while the growth of private investment was slowing, since the squeeze on profits and cash flows increased the corporate sector's need to borrow for working capital purposes. THE BUDGET OUTCOME FOR 1981-82 The overall Budget deficit in 1981-82 was $549m, the lowest since 1973-74. The deficit represented about 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product, the lowest such proportion since 1971-72. The outcome, however, was $453m higher than the Budget estimate, due entirely to outlays being one per cent higher than estimated at Budget time. Contributing to the overrun on outlays were greater than expected increases in public sector wages and salaries, unemployment benefits and public debt interest. Total receipts were marginally above the Budget estimate although there were variations in some of the main components. In particular, net PA YE and other individuals' income tax collections were higher than predicted by $162m and $202m respectively, the latter reflecting our successful campaign against tax avoidance. Indeed, 1981-82 and 1980-81 have been the only occasions in the past six years that provisional tax collections have exceeded Budget estimates. I now turn to the main expenditure provisions of the Budget. Further details are provided in the accompanying Budget documents, particularly Statement No.3. Relevant Ministers will also be issuing more detailed statements. Total outlays for 1982-83 are estimated to be $47067, an increase of 13.9 per cent on last year, or in real terms just over 2t per cent. In putting together this Budget, the Government has placed considerable emphasis on capital expenditures. This emphasis is evident not only in the funding provided for programs of assistance to the States and local authorities but also in the Commonwealth's own civil works program. Major items in this field include ing for housing, particularly welfare housing, enhanced accommodation programs for the aged and disabled, a significantly increased roads program and expanded airport development. The greater spending under these programs will enhance employment prospects in those sectors. NA The Government remains strongly committed to increasing defence preparedness and improving Australia's defence capability. The $4622m which we are providing in the Budget for defence represents an increase of 11.8 per cent on 1981-82 and implies some further real growth. The Budget provision is expected to represent about 2.9 per cent of gross domestic product, in line with our target of 3 per cent by 1984-85. Further details will be provided to the Parliament by the Minister for Defence later in the year. NA The Government has decided on an extensive range of measures aimed at increased assistance to those most in need, particularly to pensioners and other social welfare beneficiaries, certain low income families and the handicapped. The Government has also decided to increase family allowances in order to further assist Australian families. Accordingly, total expenditure on social welfare is estimated to increase by $1774m or 15.4 per cent to $13 272m in 1982-83. I will outline the more significant items here. OUTLAYS Details of these and other measures will be provided in separate statements by the Ministers for Social Security and Veterans' Affairs. Assistance/or Families Family Allowances The rates of family allowance for the first and second child will be increased by 50 per cent with effect from November 1982. This follows the decision in last year's Budget to increase the rates of family allowance by 50 per cent for third and subsequent children. The rate for the first child will be increased from $15.20 a month to $22.80 a month and the rate for the second child from $21.70 a month to $32.55 a month. A family with two or more children will therefore gain by $18.45 a month. In all more than two million Australian families increased fundwill benefit. These changes are estimated to cost $250m in 1982-83 and $375m in a full year. Family Income Supplement Special consideration has also been given to the needs of families on low incomes. To this end the Government has decided to introduce from May 1983 a tax free Family Income Supplement of $10 a week for each dependent child of a low income family not in receipt of social security type pensions or benefits. This is the same rate of assistance for the children of pensioners and beneficiaries, and will ensure that low income working families with children are not disadvantaged by comparison with those on unemployment benefits. The full rate of Supplement will be paid to families whose joint income does not exceed the income limit under the disadvantaged persons health care arrangements for a married couple without children. In November 1982, this limit will be $184 per week, and this amount is subject to further upward adjustment in May 1983. Payments of the Supplement will be reduced by $1 for every $2 of income beyond that level of joint parental income. The necessary administrative arrangements required to put a new benefit of this kind into operation will mean payments cannot commence until May 1983. The Supplement is estimated to cost $3.5m in 1982-83 and $30m in a full year. The Minister for Social Security will announce further details. Children's Services Program The Government has undertaken a thorough review of the children's services program. As a result, total expenditure under that program will be increased by 28 per cent to $1 03m in 1982-83 and a number of innovations will be undertaken. These include: an increase in the operational support grants to family day care schemes from $7 to $10 a week per child in full time care; the development of an income test to determine eligibility for a fee rebate for pre-school day care for families in need; and the three year pilot Youth Services Scheme has been extended for one year to 30 June 1983 to enable final evaluation of the Scheme. Additional funds will be made available to increase assistance to existing projects for this period. The Minister for Social Security will announce further details. Indexation 0/ Pensions and Benefits Basic pension and benefit rates will continue to be adjusted each November and May in line with movements in the consumer price index. In November the standard or single rate of social security pension, for example, will rise by $3.10 to $77.25 a week, while the combined married rate will increase by $5.20 to $128.80 a week. Later in this Speech, I shall announce details of a special tax rebate for pensioners designed to improve the relative position of pensioners with per child paid small non-pension incomes. Rental Assistance/or Pensioners The Government recognises the special problems faced by many pensioners in rented accommodation. Following an increase of $3 in the maximum rate of supplementary rental assistance in February of this year, from November 1982 it will be further increased by $2 a week to $10 a week. This is estimated to cost an additional $16.7m in 1982-83 and about $24m in a full year. Pension Income and Fringe Benefit Limits The Government has decided to increase the levels of private income that pensioners and supporting parents can receive without any reduction in their pension. The levels were last increased in 1972. The new levels will increase by 50 per cent to $30 a week for single pensioners and by 45 per cent to $50 a week for pensioner couples from November 1982; higher levels apply where there are children. This will mean, for example, that a married couple in receipt of an age pension will be able to receive a total gross income of $178.80 a week before their pension is diminished on the basis of 50 cents for each $1 of non-pension income in excess of $50 a week. The pension will not be totally withdrawn until their gross income reaches $307.60 a week. Comparable figures for a single pensioner are $107.25 and $184.50 a week. The income limits for fringe benefit entitlement including pensioner health benefits are also to be raised. From November 1982, these will be increased by 35 per cent to $54 a week for single pensioners and by 32 per cent to $90 a week for pensioner couples. Additions to the limit for dependent children will be raised to a uniform $20 a week for each child. These measures are estimated to cost $72.2m in 1982-83 and about $11 Om in a full year. Unemployment and Sickness Benefits The Government has decided on further measures to assist the unemployed. The,non-indexed rate of unemployment benefit for persons 18 years and over without dependants will be increased from $58.10 a week to $64.40 a week and the rate of unemployment and sickness benefit for persons under 18 years will be raised from $36 to $40 a week. Both increases will take effect from November 1982. The income tests for unemployment and sickness benefits are to be standardised with an increased uniform 'free area' of $10 a week and an increase to $60 a week in the upper limit to the range of non-benefit income over which the benefit is reduced on a 50 per cent basis. These measures are estimated to cost $68.1 m in 1982-83 and about $1 03m in a full year. In addition, eligibility for pensioner health benefits has been extended to all sickness beneficiaries irrespective of income. Assistance to the Handicapped For 1982-83, we have decided on a range of measures that will meet many of the concerns expressed by groups of the disabled. The main initiatives are: the introduction, from April 1983, of a nontaxable mobility allowance of $10 a week for severely handicapped people in employment or undertaking vocational training who are unable to use public transport; a $12 a month increase in the rate of handicapped child's allowance, to $85 a month from November 1982; and $750,000 to improve and extend regional services under the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. Accommodationfor the Aged or Disabled As already announced, additional capital funds will be made available for aged or disabled persons' accommodation. Over the next two years $170m will be provided for the program with $83m being allocated in 1982-83. In addition, $37m and $14m will be spent over the next two years on capital facilities under the Handicapped Persons' Assistance Program and on senior citizens' centres; $18.5m and $7m respectively are to be spent in 1982-83. Personal Care Subsidy We have decided to increase the personal care subsidy from $20 to $30 a week for each eligible person in hostel-type accommodation, backdated to July 1982. The cost of this measure is estimated to be $12m in 1982-83. Assistance to Veterans New measures of particular importance to veterans include the following: the disability pension will be totally disregarded in the income test for service pension and fringe benefits; repatriation treatment benefits are to be extended to veterans of World War II who receive not less than 50 per cent disability pension plus a service pension; service pension eligibility is to be extended, with effect from 3 February 1983, to Commonwealth and allied merchant mariners; the disability pension at the 100 per cent general rate will be restored for pulmonary tuberculosis from 6 January 1983, for those veterans who were in receipt of the benefit prior to 2 November 1978; the maximum rate of repatriation funeral benefit will be increased from $400 to $500 and the eligibility tests will be eased; and there will be increases in many supplementary repatriation benefits. These initiatives are expected to cost $14.5 million in 1982-83 and about $24m in a full year. Assistance for Aboriginals The Budget provides $164m-a 12.4 per cent increase-for Aboriginal advancement programs administered by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. $51.4m of this is for the Aboriginal Development Commission. In addition, other expenditure programs directed specifically to assisting Aboriginals, including programs funded under other portfolios, total about $1 07m. NA The Budget provides $3379m for health services, an increase of 16 per cent on 1981-82. Pharmaceutical Benefits The Government has decided to introduce a three-tier Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme from I January 1983, to provide further benefits to pensioners and the disadvantaged. These new arrangements will operate as follows: those pensioners and beneficiaries who have been receiving their pharmaceutical benefits free of charge will continue to do so; a new concessional contribution rate of $2.00 per benefit item will be introduced for health care card holders and their dependants and all pensioners not already entitled to free pharmaceuticals; and the general patient contribution rate will rise from $3.20 to $4.00 per benefit item. The expected net cost is $2.8m in 1982-83 and about $7m in a full year. Payments to pharmacists for dispensing pharmaceutical benefit items were increased from I July at an estimated cost of $8m for this year. In addition, the Government has agreed to an increase in drug prices-3 per cent on the price to chemists plus 9 cents per benefit item-from I November 1982 with an estimated cost of $12.4m for 1982-83 and $24.8m in a full year. NA In 1982-83, total direct outlays on education are estimated to increase by 13.5 per cent to $3792 million. Most of these funds-over $3000m-are being spent on the programs administered by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education and Schools Commissions. Details of the funding for these programs in 1983 have already been announced. Student Assistance In making its decisions in this area, the Government has had in mind the high level of youth unemployment, lower participation rates in education and the difficulties faced by many very low income families in meeting the cost of their children remaining at school or attending a tertiary institution. The Government has therefore decided on a number of changes in student assistance programs for the 1983 academic year. Allowances under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and the Secondary Allowances Scheme will be increased by 20 per cent and allowances under other student assistance schemes by II per cent. In 1983 the number of Commonwealth Postgraduate A wards will be increased by 100 to 900 and the basic allowance raised from '1)4620 to $6850 per annum, an increase of 48 per cent. The income test requirements of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme will be eased with the limits being increased by II per cent for 1983. In addition, the limits for the Secondary Allowances Scheme will be adjusted to the same level, an increase of over 44 per cent in limits for this Scheme. The cost of these two Schemes is estimated to increase this financial year by $17m and the number of beneficiaries to increase by over 10 000 in 1983. Student Loans Scheme The foreshadowed Tertiary Student Loans Scheme will commence from the beginning of 1983. Subject to a means test, loans of up to $1000 per year to a total of $8000 over the period of full time tertiary study will be available, with a generous interest rate subsidy and exemption from repayment for up to two years after completion of study. Thereafter a repayment period of up to \0 years is provided for. The Minister for Education will announce further details. NA Over recent months the Government has announced significant improvements in housing assistance measures. The total of $571m provided for housing expenditure in this Budget includes: a significant increase in welfare housing assistance to at least $333m-an increase of 27 per cent on 1981-82 outlays-which can be supplemented by additional funds nominated by the States through their works and housing programs; and $147m, an increase of about 28 per cent over 1981-82, as grants to first home buyers. In addition, $20m has been provided as the Commonwealth's contribution to a new Mortgage and Rent Relief Program to provide assistance to families facing severe financial hardship. The Government has decided to ask the Reserve Bank of Australia to consider making a release of one percentage point from the Statutory Reserve Deposits it holds from the major trading banks for the special purpose of lending for housing. Any such release would, of course, be additional to the amount of $400m the major banks agreed to increase their home lending by earlier this year. I shall be announcing further housing assistance measures later tonight. NA NA Increased unemployment, particularly amongst young Australians, which the current economic difficulties have produced, requires further emphasis on employment and job training programs. Last financial year we spent $206m in this area. In 1982-83 this will be increased by 21 per cent to $250m. We shall continue to give special weight to assistance programs for the young unemployed. Employers will be encouraged to provide more opportunities for unemployed young people to obtain work experience and job skills and to become established in the work force. Expenditure on assistance for work experience is to rise by $20m or 37 per cent to $74m in 1982-83. This will allow for over 74,000 new work experience placements in 1982-83 and increases of up to 36 per cent in the rate of subsidy to employers. Support for the apprenticeship intake will also be maintained through significant increases in CRAFT rebates, with effect from the beginning of 1983. Total outlay on CRAFT in 1982-83 is estimated at $84m. This will enable employers to receive assistance in respect of some 111,000 apprentices in 1982-83, compared to 99,000 last year. NA The Budget provides $501m for culture and recreation activities in 1982-83. The Australian Broadcasting Commission will receive $256m, which will permit some expansion of acti vit y. An amount of $12m has been provided for the installation of new transmitters and translators, including $1 m to commence a three year program for the extension of multicultural television. The Special Broadcasting Service has also been allocated $26.2m in 1982-83. Other expenditures of note are: 34m for the Australian Council including about $3.7m for the Australian Opera, more than $3m for the Elizabethan Theatre Trust orchestras and about $1.8m for the Australian Banet Foundation; $15m for the Australian National Gallery, which is planned to open in October this year; $26m for sports programs, which includes $4m for operating expenses of the Australian Institute of Sport, over $8m for payments to State and Territory governments to develop international sporting facilities, and assistance for sport and recreation for disabled people; and an increase of over 50 per cent in expenditure on the Australian War Memorial. This includes a significant provision for the Memorial's permanent exhibition and its collection and very necessary repairs and maintenance to Memorial buildings. NA A total of $713m is provided for foreign aid expenditure in the Budget, an increase of $72m on last year's expenditure. Priority will continue to be given to bilateral assistance to Papua New Guinea and countries in South-East Asia and the South Pacific region in addition to continuing support for various multilateral and regional organisations. NA In his Statement of 19 July last, the Prime Minister announced major new incentives for Australia's manufacturing, mining and rural industries. In particular, these included more generous depreciation provisions, a continuation of the Industrial Research and Development Scheme and a significant strengthening of the Export Market Development Scheme. Depreciation allowances were also introduced for all new non-residential income producing buildings. These measures were introduced in recognition of the subdued level of economic activity at present and the special need to make all sections of Australian industry as competitive as possible, particularly those striving to win export markets. A revival of the fortunes of those Australian industries now experiencing difficulties and an expansion of job opportunities within those industries will depend very largely upon an improvement in general economic conditions, particularly at the international level. However, the measures announced by the Prime Minister will greatly enhance the ability of Australian industry to take part in a revival when general economic conditions do begin to pick up. This year total Budget outlays for industry assistance and development are estimated to exceed $1 ,000m for the first time. Rural Assistance The extended drought in many parts of Australia has already had an extremely serious effect on large sections' of our rural industries which are so vital to our export earnings as a nation. We have made an interest free advance of $1 Om to the New South Wales Government for drought relief purposes in that State. The Government has the drought situation under constant surveillance and stands ready to provide appropriate further assistance. The Government's decision in 1980 to allow immediate write off of the cost of water storage facilities as a drought relief measure has been of considerable help to primary producers. Tax savings as a result of this to primary producers to end 1981-82 are estimated at more than $30m. Net payments from this year's Budget to rural industries are estimated to total $313m. The Government will seek passage of the phosphate and nitrogenous fertilizer subsidy legislation in this Parliamentary session. In view of the depressed conditions being experienced in the cattle and meat industries, the Government has decided to write off the industry debt in respect of the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign, estimated to be $23.Sm. Charges under the Campaign of up to $4 per head will be levied from I October 1982 and reviewed annually to ensure contributions cover the industry's share of future costs. Water Resources Programs The Budget provides $41.7m for the National Water Resources Program, an increase of 27.S per cent on 1981-82 expenditure. A further $6.Sm is expected to be provided in 1982-83 for the construction of the Burdekin Dam. Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme Total expenditure on this Scheme in 1981-82 amounted to some $148m. The Government has in recent times become concerned that the Scheme could be the subject of some abuse and fraud which might have caused some of the significant cost increases which have occurred in the operation of the Scheme. It has therefore been decided that the Scheme should be the subject of a thorough review. Pending the outcome of the review the Scheme will be amended to subsidise freight cost differentials in excess of I cent per litre instead litre as previously applied. Further details will be announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce. NA Total Budget outlays on transport and communication are estimated to increase by 2S per cent to $1 ,47Sm. Roads Assistance Under the normal roads program the Commonwealth will provide $734 million to the States and the Northern Territory this financial year as part of our undertaking to provide a total of $3,6S0m for roads over the five years to 1984-8S. In addition-and as a major initiative to bring about a lasting improvement in the road and transport system of the nation-the Government has decided to establish an Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. Its goals are to be achieved by 1988, our Bicentennial year. The special Bicentennial Road Development Program will include national, arterial and local roads in all parts of Australia and also provide for upgrading elements of our urban transport network. The priorities and allocations under this Program will be finally determined by the Commonwealth Government. It will be a fundamental requirement of the Program that the States and local government at least maintain in real terms their expenditure on roads and in other areas touched by the Program. The Program will be entirely funded by a special surcharge on motor spirit and distillate. This will initially be set at 1 cent per litre, with expenditure under the Program totalling $IS0m in 1982-83. The surcharge will be increased on 1 July 1983 to 2 cents per litre. The proceeds of this surcharge will be paid into a special trust fund so that none of those proceeds can be used for purposes other than the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. About $2,SOO million is expected to be provided under this Program over the period to 1988-89. Further details will be announced tonight by the Minister for Transport and Construction. Air Navigation Charges The Government has decided to increase air navigation charges for domestic trunk and regional airlines by 20 per cent and for the general aviation sector by 12 per cent, effective from 1 of 0.44 cents per October 1982. Additional recoveries of $8.4m in 1982-83 and $12.Sm in a full year are expected from these higher charges. Charges for the international sector, where there is already full cost recovery, will remain unchanged. Rail Budget outlays are estimated to be $94. Sm for rail transport in 1982-83 of which $21.8m is allocated to mainline upgrading and $3m is provided for the continued planning of the proposed Alice Springs to Darwin railway. Domestic Communications Satellite A further equity contribution of $18m will be provided to AUSSAT Pty Ltd, which will own and operate the proposed domestic satellite communications system to be introduced in Australia in 1985. It is planned that, in due course, the private sector will be invited to take up a substantial equity interest in AUSSAT Pty Ltd. The New Australia Telescope The work of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization has won world respect, not least in radio physics through the work of the radio telescope at Parkes. The Government has now decided to fund the construction by CSIRO of a new radio telescope to cost a total of $25m to be known as the Australia Telescope and to be completed by our Bicentennial year 1988. PAYMENTS TO THE STATES, NA NA The major decisions affecting payments to the States have already been announced. Total net payments to the States, the Northern Territory and local government, including all specific purpose payments, are estimated to increase by $1 ,956m or 13.9 per cent in 1982-83. Special assistance totalling $105m for various capital purposes is also being provided to a number of States. This assistance is expected to have beneficial employment consequences. The details are: $20m to Western Australia for sewage works in the Cockburn Sound area with $12.1 m being made available this year; $lOm to Tasmania for tourist road development in 1982-83; $IOm to South Australia for upgrading water supply facilities in 1982-83; and $35m to Victoria, $20m to Queensland and $IOm to South Australia in 1982-83 for upgrading their transportation systems. In this same general context it should be noted that removal of the $1 a tonne coal export levy, at a cost to revenue of $25m this ticular benefit to New South Wales, which is the source of the great bulk of export coal in this category. NA Taking direct capital expenditures together with capital grants and net advances, the total provided by the Budget for capital purposes in 1982-83 is over $4,000m, an increase of more than 17 per cent on similar outlays in 1981-82. By far the major part of this amount will fund capital works. Budget-Financed Civil Works Some $336m in 1982-83 is for civil works financed directly from the Budget. This is an increase of $136m or 68 per cent on 1981-82 expenditures and will provide a boost to the building and construction industry. Airports Airport works approved for commencement in 1982-83 are estimated to cost a total of $355m over the next four years and $49m in 1982-83. Included are major development works for Brisbane, Perth and Townsville airports and the upgrading of facilities at a number of other airports. Also included is $12m under the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan for the upgrading of a number of country airports in New South Wales and Queensland to permit the introduction of medium jet aircraft to those centres and for new developments associated with the transfer of Government airports to local ownership. Total expenditure in 1982-83 under the Plan is estimated at $38m. Other Civil Works The Government has also decided to proceed in 1982-83 with major redevelopment works at Repatriation General Hospitals at Daw Park and Hollywood, extensions to the National Library, and the construction of an indoor sports training facility for the Australian Institute of Sport. NA I turn now to the revenue proposals. Total receipts are estimated at $45,393m, an increase of 11.3 per cent on last year or, in real terms, of only 0.3 per cent. This is the smallest real rise in receipts for ten years. A major factor in producing such a small rise in revenue collections is the impact of the slowdown in economic growth on collections of income and year, will be of parcompany taxes. Revenue collections have also been affected by the taxation reductions in certain areas which I am about to announce. As will be apparent from recent decisions and from other announcements contained in this Speech, the Government remains committed to effective measures against both tax avoidance and evasion. In a separate statement tonight I shall indicate steps we shall take to recover unpaid Division 7 tax in 'bottom of the harbour' cases. Our past legislation has proved effective. The most recent evidence of this is the fact that the Commissioner of Taxation has informed the Government that this financial year it will not be necessary to make an adjustment to projected revenue collections to allow for tax avoidance losses in the way that has been done in the last several years. Our continuing success on this front played no small part in making it possible to provide some personal tax relief in this Budget. Personal Income Tax We propose to make a substantial reduction in the personal income tax burden and, in so doing, give particular attention to those on low to average incomes and to the needs of families. With these objectives in mind, three changes in the tax scales are proposed. First the tax-free threshold is to be increased by $400 per annum, from $4,195 to $4,595. This means that no tax will be payable until a taxpayer's annual income exceeds $4,595. As a result of this change alone about 300,000 pensioners and low income earners who would otherwise pay tax in 1982-83 will not now do so. Secondly, the standard rate of tax is to be reduced from 32 per cent to 30 per cent. Thirdly, the top of the standard rate step, namely the point above which a taxpayer commences to pay 46 per cent of each additional dollar he or she earns in tax, is to be increased from $17,894 to $19,500. The most direct and highly beneficial consequence of this change is that many thousands of average wage and salary earners now have the incentive to earn additional income without fear of moving into a higher tax bracket. This change will also mean that about 75 per cent of all Australian taxpayers will be on the new and lower standard rate after 1 November. The combined effect of these three measures will be to provide the largest proportionate tax reductions to those receiving lower taxable incomes. Detailed tables illustrating these changes at various income levels are being provided. For example, a taxpayer on average weekly earnings of about $344.60 will receive a boost in his take home pay of $7.65 as a result of the changes I have just explained. Single Income Families To give additional help to single income families with dependent children it is proposed to increase the dependent spouse rebate by $200 per year, from $830 per annum to $1,030 per annum, where there are dependent (including student) children. For a taxpayer on the average wage with a dependent wife and children, this particular measure will mean a further tax saving of $3.85 per week, additional to the saving of $7.65 arising from the general tax reductions outlined earlier. These same levels of rebate will apply for a housekeeper or daughter-housekeeper where there are dependent children. The sole parent rebate will also be raised by $200, to $780 per annum. Commencement Date and Cost All of these changes will take effect from I November 1982 and will be reflected in PA YE instalments, and hence paypackets, from that date. For assessment purposes, the rate scale applied to 1982-83 taxable incomes will be an average of one-third of the present scale and two-thirds of the new scale. Similarly, the increase of $200 per annum in the rebates which I have mentioned will average $133 for the 1982-83 income year, reflecting the operation of the higher level for two-thirds of the year. The cost of the various personal income tax measures I have mentioned is estimated at $1,570m in 1982-83 and $2,567m in a full year. Net P AYE income tax collections will be 2 per cent lower in real terms this year than last. Pensioner Rebate Over the past year there has been growing concern amongst pensioners in Australia that, in the absence of corrective action, their pensions would increase to the point where the pension alone would become taxable. One of the major reasons for our decision to increase the tax-free threshold to $4,595 per annum, or approximately $88 per week, was to stop this occurring. However, in addition, we have decided to introduce a special pensioner rebate for income tax purposes. This will ensure that people wholly or mainly dependent on a taxable pension do not bear tax. The maximum rebate will be $250 per annum. This means that a pensioner can have a total income including a pension of $5,429 per year without having to pay any tax. For every additional dollar of income that a pensioner has over and above $5,429 per year, the amount of that rebate will be reduced by 12 t cents, so that by the time pensioner's income reaches $7,429 the rebate will no longer be applicable. The rebate will take effect from 1 November 1982 and, for assessment purposes, the level of 1982-83 maximum rebate will be $167, with corresponding shading-out provisions above $5,007. Married pensioners will each be entitled to the same rebate as a single pensioner. This rebate is estimated to cost $7m in 1982-83 and $36m in a full year. It should be noted that the increased income to pensioners as a result of the combination of cash benefits and reductions in tax from November this year, ranges from up to $12.79 per week for a single pensioner to $17.08 per week for a couple, along with the extension of fringe benefit entitlements. Non-resident Taxpayers At present the first $4,195 of taxable income of non-resident as well as resident individuals is free of tax. However, the reasons for freeing residents from tax on the lowest slice of income seldom have much relevance to non-residents, and there is already no tax free amount for withholding tax purposes. It is therefore proposed to withdraw the effect of the zero rate from non-residents, other than those in receipt of taxable social security and patriation payments, and subject that slice of income to tax at the standard rate. This measure will have some anti-tax avoidance benefits and is in line with overseas practice. This measure which, subject to some matters mentioned in Statement No.4, will take effect from tonight is estimated to yield $lm in 1982-83 and $15m in a full year. Home Loan Interest Rebate The Government has decided to provide some taxation relief to people who are paying off their home, irrespective of whether it is their first home, thus broadening in a significant way the housing interest relief which I announced on 18 March this year. The new rebate will allow persons paying off their own home to claim (in 1982-83) a rebate at the standard rate on the amount of interest they pay on their housing loan, from any source, over and above 10 per cent on up to $60,000 of mortgage or other loan arrangements. For example, a taxpayer paying interest at 13.5 per cent on a mortgage from a savings bank of a $25,000 would obtain a rebate of $5.05 per week. Similarly, if a taxpayer had a building society mortgage of $30,000 at an interest rate of 15 per cent, the rebate would be $8.65 per week. Eligibility for this scheme will, of course, be restricted to the sole or principal residence of a taxpayer. Unlike the present scheme, the new rebate will not be limited to first home owners nor the first five years of home ownership, and the amount of rebate will not be subject to specified ceilings. First home buyers will still be able to use the existing scheme, rather than the new scheme, where it confers the larger rebate. PA YE instalments can be adjusted to allow for the rebate from 1 November 1982. The rebates scheme already in place would, on its own, have cost $1 OOm in 1982-83 and $230m in a full year. It is estimated that the effect of the new measure will be to add $55m in 1982-83 and $185m in a full year, to the overall revenue cost. Rebate on Dividend Income It is a fundamental part of the philosophy of the Government parties that maximum encouragement be given to small investors. As a result we have had under study for some time submissions from many suggesting that there should be some relief given from so-called double re- taxation of dividend income. This issue was the subject of recommendations by the Campbell Committee. The Government has decided-as from 1982-83-to allow a rebate at the standard rate of tax on up to $1000 of dividends included in taxable income received by resident individual shareholders from resident companies. Certain exceptions are noted in Statement No.4. This measure is estimated to cost $36m in 1982-83 and $75m in a full year. Employee Share Acquisition Schemes The Government has also received many representations to provide a greater incentive for schemes whereby employees can purchase shares in the companies which employ them. The Government sees merit in this idea. We have therefore decided to provide an incentive whereby employees will not be subject to tax on any benefits arising from the price at which shares are issued under an approved scheme. The Government believes that this course of action will provide benefits to productivity and industrial harmony. There is much to commend the view that employees should feel an increasing stake in the fortunes of the companies employing them. Guidelines for approved schemes will include the important requirements that the shares are offered to all employees on a non-discriminatory basis and that, at the time of allocation, the discount on market price does not exceed 15 per cent. This is estimated to cost $5m in a full year, but will not affect revenue in 1982-83. Retention Allowance for Private Companies The Government has previously indicated that it would examine further the distribution requirements on private companies under Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. We now propose to increase the retention allowance for trading or business income by 10 per cent, ie from 70 to 80 per cent, for distributions from taxable incomes of 1981-82 and subsequent years. This means that in the time it has been in office this Government will have increased the retention allowance for private companies from 50 per cent to 80 per cent. No change is being made to the 10 per cent retention allowance for property income or to the rule that there is no retention allowance for dividends received by one private company from another. This measure is estimated to cost $2m in 1982-83 and $30m in a full year and should be of considerable benefit to the small business sector. Gift Provisions A number of conservation organisations will be given access to the gift provisions of the income tax law. Full details of eligible organisations are provided in a separate release. Company Groups Both the Asprey and Campbell Committees expressed support for provisions which would allow losses by one company in a group to be offset against profits of others in the group, where there is effectively 100 per cent common ownership of the companies. The Government proposes to introduce measures to give effect to such a provision, supported by various safeguarding and other technical provisions. Tax Evasion through Cash Payments In recent times, much of the debate on tax avoidance and evasion has tended to concentrate almost exclusively on sophisticated tax avoidance arrangements and has therefore largely ignored the enormous losses to revenue which occur through the so-called cash economy. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that as much if not more revenue is lost through outright evasion and non-declaration of income together than under artificial tax avoidance schemes. Therefore as part of its ongoing policy against both tax avoidance and evasion the Government has taken a firm decision to introduce from I July 1983 a system of deducting at source an amount on account of tax in respect of certain payments for labour and services. It will be separate from the normal P AYE system although it will operate like that system in respect of payments to which it applies. There are certain industries where evasion poses particular problems. An information paper on the proposed new system is being released tonight. The new system will be the subject of extensive discussion and consultation with relevant industry groups and representatives of the trade union movement. Whilst the Government has taken a firm decision to launch the new system it wishes to fully consult affected groups regarding implementation. The Government will take particular care when implementing this system to protect the separate status of sub-contractors. The thrust of the change is to ensure that the honest sub-contractor is not put at a competitive disadvantage. The revenue effects of this measure will begin to be felt in 1983-84 and I am advised that the revenue gained in that year from these measures will be in the order of $500m. Indirect Taxation Although the overall taxation burden in Australia is relatively low amongst industrialised countries our reliance on direct personal taxation as a source of revenue is relatively high amongst those countries. The Government has always seen merit in gradually moving away from an overreliance on personal income tax as a source of revenue. This Budget contains significant net reductions in personal income tax and the opportunity has been taken to achieve a modest broadening and deepening of the indirect tax base. Two measures are proposed in the sales tax area. First, after tonight each of the three rates on goods at present taxable will be increased by 2t percentage points, raising an estimated $370m in 1982-83 and $490m in a full year. Secondly, it is proposed that a number of goods which are at present exempt be made taxable as from I January 1983 at a rate of 7t per cent. This broadening of the sales tax base is to include goods such as hand tools, construction equipment and manchester. It does not include what some have regarded as the 'necessities of life'. Further details are given in Statement No. 4 and in the legislation being introduced tonight. This extension of the sales tax base is estimated to yield $44m in 1982-83 and $1 05m in a full year. I turn now to excises. Off-Road Use of Distillate Exemption of excise duty on diesel fuel is allowed at present for all use off public roads. The exemption arrangements have proved difficult to administer so as to prevent abuse. There is also some evidence that because of price advantages excise-exempt distillate is being used for purposes such as heating and power generation for which other fuels would be more appropriate. The concession also ensures certain competitive advantages, for example, rail transport as against road transport. As from tonight, all diesel fuel will bear the full rate of excise duty, irrespective of its end use. We shall however introduce a system to allow users to claim rebates of this excise in respect of certain categories of off-road end use-broadly, domestic use, hospitals, nursing and convalescent homes and in the agricultural, mining, fishing and forestry industries. The legislation will contain provisions allowing claims to be made in respect of diesel fuel purchased from tonight in the specified end uses. The Minister for Industry and Commerce will advise the Parliament of further details. The changed arrangements are estimated to yield a net increase in revenue of $161 m in 1982-83 at the previously existing excise rate of 5.155 cents per litre and $176m in a full year. Sales Tax Beer and Tobacco Excise Excise rates on beer and tobacco products have not been increased since 1978; the real rates of such duties during this period have declined by about 25 per cent. Beer and tobacco products excise rates will increase by approximately 15 per cent and 20 per cent respectively with effect from tonight. The increase in excise on beer-only the fourth in twenty-four years-will be by 8 cents to 60 cents per litre. While retail price effects will depend on mark-up practices in the industry, the increase in the price of a glass of beer as a result of the rate increase could be 3 or 4 cents. The measure is estimated to yield an additional $113m in 1982-83 and $135m in a full year. Excise rates on tobacco products will rise by approximately 20 per cent to $29.70 per kilogram Excises for cigarettes, $15.1 0 for manufactured tobacco and $25.34 for cigars. These measures are estimated to raise about $98m in 1982-83 and $125m in a full year and could raise the retail price of a packet of 20 cigarettes by about 12-14 cents. There will be no increases this year in the rates of excise on potable spirits. However, some spirits are subject to sales tax and will therefore be affected by the general sales tax increases I announced earlier. For each of the excise increases announced tonight, there will be commensurate increases in the corresponding customs duties on imports. Tax on Bank Transactions Consistent with the Government's desire to broaden the indirect tax base, it is proposed to introduce a tax on certain bank transactions, with effect from 1 January 1983. The tax will apply to all debits to bank accounts that are subject to operation by cheque or like payment instrument, whether or not the particular debit arises from a cheque (or like) transaction. Four rates of tax will apply, ranging from 10 cents on debits of less than $100, to $1 on debits of $5000 or more. Full details will be given in the legislation. This measure is estimated to raise $80 million in 1982-83 and $200 million in a full year. All these measures are detailed in Statement No.4. Australian Capital Territory Stamp Duty Several amendments of a technical nature are proposed for stamp duties in the Australian Capital Territory, with the aim of removing anomalies and bringing the ACT duties more into line with those of the States. Their revenue effect is negligible. THE BUDGET'S IMPACT ON FAMILIES As I have already said, the Government is particularly concerned at the effect of current economic circumstances on average Australian families. The taxation and other assistance measures of a general character contained in the Budget have been designed to give maximum help to the generality of Australian families. Thus, in a genuine sense, this Budget deserves the description of a family Budget. Let me illustrate by referring to the impact of this Budget on a family comprising a sole breadwinner with a dependent spouse and two dependent children, who in 1982-83 will have an income of $300 per week. Let us also assume that the person is paying off the family home and has a mortgage liability of $25 000 at an interest rate of 13t per cent. This family will receive the following main benefits as a result of the Budget. The personal tax changes from I November will mean an extra $10.54 per week. The home loan interest rebate will mean an extra $5.05 per week. The increase in family allowances will mean an extra $4.25 per week. The total benefit from these measures will therefore be some $19.84 per week to this family. If we assume that this famiily has a consumption pattern similar to the weightings for the CPI and spends all of its disposable income, the direct effect on it of indirect taxes in this Budget could be about $3 per week. Therefore, the net weekly benefits for ily of this Budget would be about $16.84 per week. Let me stress again that the above is an average example only and subject to qualification on that account. However, it does illustrate the substantial family benefits contained in this Budget. Detailed tables illustrating some of the Budget's effects on families in different situations will be made available. NA Total outlays in 1982-83 are estimated to increase by 13.9 per cent to $47 067m; this is an increase of 2.6 per cent in real terms. Total receipts are estimated to increase by 11.3 per cent in 1982-83 to $45 393m; this is an increase of 0.3 per cent in real terms. The overall Budget deficit is therefore estimated at $1674m, an increase of $1125m on the outcome for 1981-82. After allowance for transactions abroad, there will be an estimated domestic Budget surplus of $230m. NA In framing the Budget the Government has tried to give relief and assistance to those in the community who most need it within the confines of a Budget which is economically responsible. This Budget does not represent a change in our economic objectives. It should not be seen as lessening our commitment to achieve a substantial and sustained reduction in inflation. Although this year's deficit is bigger than last year's outcome, it remains at only I per cent of gross domestic product. For only the third time in the last eight years a domestic surplus is being budgeted for. The Government is intent that the deficit will be financed in a non-inflationary manner. Our armoury of monetary policy instruments has recently been greatly improved. As a result of recent Loan Council decisions regarding the setting of the interest rate on Australian Savings Bonds and the move to a tender system for selling Treasury Bonds, we now have much greater freedom than in the past to use those instruments in the achievement of our monetaryobjectives. Interest rates on each of the three types of Commonwealth security can now vary with the requirements of the market so as to ensure adthis fam- equate sales to the private sector. In line with those requirements, we have already increased the rate of interest on Australian Savings Bonds and conducted the first, quite successful, Treasury Bond tender. In last year's Budget, I announced an M3 projection of 10 to 11 per cent over the course of 1981-82. The outcome, at 11.3 per cent, was very close to that projection. On a number of occasions I have expressed reservations concerning the June on June basis of measurement. It is prone to erratic and unpredictable shortterm factors, particularly in the closing months of the year, which can give a misleading indication of underlying monetary developments. This year's projection will therefore be expressed as an annual average growth rate; that is, in terms of the movement in the average level of M3 between one financial year and the next. The Government in fact gave serious thought this year to formally abandoning the announcement of a monetary projection. Quite apart from anything else, there are many who would argue that M3 is a less than representative measure of overall credit and monetary conditions and that a complete assessment of the monetary situation necessitates a review of a range of aggregates. But because a projection is generally seen by the market as important to expectations and as a useful indication of the Government's intentions, we decided to retain it. However, I would want to make it clear that the projected range is in fact a projection should not be taken as a firm target. It should not, as some would wish to make it, become a formal measure of the success or failure of monetary policy. Against this background, the Government will be seeking to restrain the growth of financial aggregates to a degree consistent with growth in M3 within the range of 9-11 per cent for 1982-83 as a whole. Monetary policy will be directed at enhancing the recent signs of slowing in the growth in wages and encouraging settlements in the major wage agreements in the months ahead that will provide a basis for improving business sector profitability and thus arresting the recent sharp deterioration in the employment situation. A more market responsive system of wage determination could also help produce wage outcomes closer to the capacity of individual firms, and hence the economy, to bear. Notwithstanding the initial steps that have been taken, we remain well short of such a system and the Government will be seeking to achieve further progress in this direction during 1982-83. As it is, present indications are that average weekly earnings in 1982-83 as a whole could rise by 12 per cent. In this regard it should be noted that when allowance is made for increases affecting 1982-83 already determined, further increases of only about 6 per cent during the remainder of this financial year are consistent with the 12 per cent assumption. Such an outcome would be below the increase in 1981-82 and would entail some slowing from now on but it would still be well above what is required for resumption of sustained employment growth. The Consumer Price Index in 1982-83 as a whole could increase at a rate of about lOt per cent. The direct price effects of the revenue measures announced this evening amount to about one per cent-so that, those aside, the underlying rate of 9t to 10 per cent is much the same as in 1981-82. With continuing uncertainty abroad and at home, it is more than usually difficult to forecast the Australian economic outlook with any confidence. That said, I have to add that barring an unexpectedly rapid improvement in the world economy, or a sharp drop in business costs, it is difficult to envisage any real growth in domestic non-farm only and product in 1982-83 as a whole. Business fixed investment, which has grown at record real rates in recent years, and which during that time has been the single most important feature distinguishing the Australian economy from its overseas counterparts, could well decline a little in 1982-83. In addition, and notwithstanding the personal tax reductions announced tonight, personal consumption expenditure in 1982-83 is likely to grow considerably more slowly than the 3t per cent rate recorded in 1981-82, at about It per cent. Even with the measures announced both last March and this evening, real private dwelling investment is still forecast to decline faster in 1982-83 than in the previous year. Among other factors, an adequate supply of private housing finance will be critically influenced by the extent to which specialist housing financing institutions are able to offer competitive interest rates on their deposits. Farm production is, as always, subject to considerable uncertainties but, given the severe nature of the present drought, will decline in 1982-83 from the previous year. On the basis of this outlook, there is unlikely to be any growth in employment in 1982-83 so that, with the labour force continuing to grow, unemployment therefore seems likely to increase. The outlook for the balance of payments will reflect the developing outlooks both at home and overseas. The prospect of some growth in world trade should result in a modest increase in export volumes in 1982-83, while import volumes may remain broadly unchanged. After taking account of some increase in the invisibles deficit, the current account deficit may be broadly similar to that in 1981-82. As always, that deficit will need to be financed by capital inflow, principally on private account; monetary policy settings will need to be tailored accordingly. In those circumstances a surplus on private sector foreign exchange transactions of around $1500m is expected. NA This Budget represents the endeavour of the Government to provide a fair and workable response to the very difficult economic problems which Australia faces at the present time. We have not been insensitive to the fact that many Australian families need help. We have also not been insensitive to the fact that many young people, especially those out of work, might need special help at a time when job opportunities are declining. We believe that help to these groups and others is being provided in this Budget. However, we have not ignored the compelling necessity to maintain an anti-inflationary economic strategy. To abandon that strategy would be to condemn the Australian economy to much greater travail than it presently experiences. We have not put this Budget together in isolation from the views expressed to us by different sections of the Australian community. We have endeavoured to structure personal taxation relief in a way which meets the reasonable aspirations of the average Australian wage earner. We have been aware that the level of taxation, particularly for the PA YE taxpayer, influences wage and salary claims. In a very real sense we believe the taxation and other family assistance provided by this Budget provides a basis for the exercise of wage restraint across the broad spectrum of the Australian workforce. If this restraint can be achieved, a major blow will have been struck for the cause of economic recovery in Australia and many jobs will be saved in the process. I commend this Budget to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Hayden) adjourned.

Nevertheless, the USA, it is considered that the aim of the taxation system.

Again for pragmatic reasons, most viewed as tax expenditures. It follows that in 1978, recent indexation adjustments announced in the last Budget, would account.

While information on many of the items statistics derived from the administrative which to base costings of other items are be placed on external sources where these possible to provide a costing, for reasons the items concerned. There are limits to the range of taxation statistics. The basic data are record the required figures when tax returns usually only includes items needed for must be made from items contained on the task of assessing returns, collecting only a limited time can be devoted to statistical work. These constraints require the Taxation items that apply to large numbers of specialised items are not capable of being amount of effort to this work. and documentation the cost of special taxation considered as alternatives to direct expenditure some ideal taxation system and show devibroad based changes to the tax system are not the introduction of the standard rate system to the rate scale and the sales tax rate changes all be ignored in any taxation expenditure State and local governments and some not be regarded as taxation expenditures. expenditures in Australia along the lines possible, provides an indication of their cost expenditure account, the list is wide ranging not regard in whole or in part as taxation different items is relatively easy to determine required is not finer than that in the cannot be said for taxation expenditures. requires some statistical estimation and the cost of some taxation expenditures by for a given year. This could be done, for method the latest available statistics are for for the calculation of costs in respect of expenditure cannot be ascertained from taxation based calculations to be made. Items involving of tax expenditure is readily available from processes of the Taxation Office, data on more difficult to obtain and reliance has had to can be used. In some cases it has not been indicated in the comments in Attachment A on items which can be separately tabulated in the derived by statistical staff and assessors who are assessed. The range of data tabulated assessment purposes. Furthermore, a selection returns, because the need to complete speedily the revenue and accounting for it requires that Office to concentrate on the major statistical taxpayers. Statistics of some of the more compiled without devoting a disproportionate Particular difficulty exists not only with tax deferrals but also in formulating concessions of a deferral nature include write-off provisions for the mining difficulty with these items is that their tax expenditure accounts relate to single concession such as an acceleration of depreciation two years may be small, yet the cost may is equivalent to an interest free loan Even if investment in the relevant area cost over a lengthy transitional period revenue would never make up that loss date. If investment in a relevant area continuing lower level of taxation than discussed further in Attachment B to this paper. The lack of precise information on absence of the provisions and a satisfactory interest free loan involved make it difficult expenditures in respect of tax deferrals, been in place for a long time. Estimation of individual taxation expenditures the present law with that expected if the all other features of the taxation system is made by reference to the taxpayer's possible to aggregate and produce a total items. The following example A concessional rebate is available expenditure on certain concessional items concessional rebate in 1979-80 is estimated are eligible for the rebate normally claim insurance and superannuation and of $300 or principal place of residence as well cost of the concession (or more accurately withdrawal of the concession) in respect estimated to be $69 million while that million. Abolition of both items together, revenue by the sum of the two, $101 million, the estimated total cost of the concessional rebate. In the estimation of individual taxation that the removal or reduction of a concession the activity which attracts the concession. in some cases, and an alternative assumption that elimination of any tax expenditure their affairs in order to minimise the impact concession could spur them to make use of for such response effects the revenue effect in calculating taxation expenditures associated a concept to convey the costs clearly.

These matters are the amounts that would be deductible in the basis for determining the value of the to provide reliable estimates of taxation particularly where the special provisions have is done by comparing revenue under relevant provision alone were eliminated and remained the same. In most cases the estimate marginal tax rate. As a consequence it is not for taxation expenditure from individual may help to explain the point. in Australia to individuals where the aggregate exceeds $1,590. The cost to revenue of the to have been $77 million. Taxpayers who up to around the limits of $1,200 for life for rates and land tax in respect of the sole as some additional concessional expenditure. The the gain that would have resulted from of life insurance and superannuation is for rates and land tax is estimated to be $32 however, would not result in increasing the but by something approaching $77 million, expenditures it is also generally assumed would not alter behaviour with regard to This may be a somewhat heroic assumption is sometimes made, as it could be expected provision would cause taxpayers to rearrange of the change, just as the introduction of a it. If it were practicable to allow in all cases could be expected to differ to some extent from the cost of a given concession as actually usually assumed that there is no effect result of the elimination of a given tax expenditure. Numerical estimates of taxation expenditures some caution. The estimates for taxation expenditures 1979-80 income year, although estimates reasons mentioned earlier, it has not been item listed. As later data become available, revised. Conclusion It is appropriate that where possible indication given of their individual over-ambitious with the presentation of realised that there are difficult conceptual figures are only statistical estimates as a tax expenditure does not necessarily an equitable tax. distribution but rather direct expenditure. estimated.

This Appendix briefly describes the and uses of the classifications. Most of the information in the Budget Budget sector.

Underlying the classifications of information accounting conventions used by the Australian for the Commonwealth sector and for differences between the treatment of data in Australian Bureau of Statistics publications erally the same and are those set out of National Accounts, which provides use of national accounting conventions actions, other public sector transactions, Their use thus facilitates an assessment rest of the economy. A basic distinction is made in the transactions-outlays and receipts, the 'below the line' transactions-transactions financing transactions are transactions in, and consist of borrowings and changes in investments recorded in the Public Account, Such advances are more akin to direct pact and are accordingly classified Budget outlays consist of expenditure (such as personal benefit payments, grants consist of taxes together with interest, sector business enterprises, and proceeds are used in the National Accounts Statements. The adoption of national accounting lay figures in the Statements show the net of the economy. Some important implications (a) The transactions of the three Account (the Consolidated sector, however, consists of the transor largely outside the Public Account; these as the Australian Postal Commission, the AusQantas Airways Ltd and the Australian of the transactions of such authorities are There are, however, some transactions between sector (e.g. advances from the Budget to an payments of interest, dividends and, in some to the Budget sector).

163,Mr HOWARD ,DESCRIPTION OF FUNCTIONS,"Bennelong Treasurer) (9.34)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill seeks appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1982-83 totalling $1,976,195,000. Of this amount, $797,209,000 was authorised by the Supply Act (No.2) 1982-83; the balance of $1,178,986,000 would be authorised by this Bill. The Bill provides for proposed expenditure on the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, certain advances and loans, items of plant and equipment which are clearly definable as capital expenditure and expenditure on new policy initiatives for which legislation has not previously been provided. Provision is also made for grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution and for payments to the Northern Territory. An amount of $100,000,000 is included under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, the same level as provided in the past four years. Details of the proposed expenditures are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill and the main features were outlined in my Budget Speech. 1 commend the Bill to honourable members.

164,Mr HOWARD ,DESCRIPTION OF FUNCTIONS,"Bennelong Treasurer) (9.38)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is to provide appropriations liamentary departments. The Bill seeks appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1982-83 totalling $30,208,000. Of this amount, $10,902,000 was authorised by the Supply Act (No. I) 1982-83, the balance of $19,306,000 being authorised by this Bill. The Bill arises from the Government's consideration of, and response to, the report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing which was tabled on 19 August 1981. Two of the principal recommendations of the report dealt with the provision of a separate parliamentary Appropriation Bill and with the Parliament's control of its funding. Honourable members will recall that the Second Reading Government agreed to the provision of a separate Appropriation Bill which, consistent with the Select Committee's recommendations, will not be treated as a Bill for the ordinary annual services of the Government. Honourable members will also recall that the Government recognised that detailed control over individual expenditure items for the Parliament was not necessary. Accordingly, the Government proposed that it would approve the overall recurrent and capital expenditure provisions of the Bill. This has been done and the amounts included in the Bill have been agreed to between the leaders of the Houses and the Presiding Officers. 1 commend the Bill to honourable members.

SALES TAX AMENDMENT BILLS (Nos 1 to 9) 1982 Second Reading Bills presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time. Second Readings",443
166,Mr FIFE ,DESCRIPTION OF FUNCTIONS,"Farrer-Minister for Aviation) for the par- (9.40)-I move: That the Bills be now read a second time. These Bills will give effect to the Budget proposal to increase the various rates of sales tax by 2.5 percentage points. The Bills will increase the respective rates from 5 per cent to 7.5 per cent, from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent and from 30 per cent to 32.5 per cent. These Bills do not alter any of the exemptions from sales tax that are conferred by the first Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Some deletions of existing exemptions are, however, proposed by another Bill that 1 will shortly introduce. The second Schedule to the exemptions and classifications Act identifies the goods that are to be taxed at the top rate, now to be $32.5 per cent. Goods embraced by the second Schedule include radio and television receivers, record players, cameras, household-type video recorders, films and photographs, non-commercial slide projectors and viewing equipment, watches, jewellery, cosmetics, fountain pens, certain goods made of precious metals and furs. Goods in the third Schedule to the exemptions and classifications Act have attracted a rate of 5 per cent, which is now to be increased to 7.5 per cent. This covers household furniture, appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and a range of household goods. Motor cars and commercial motor vehicles are in the fourth and fifth Schedules to the exemptions and classifications Act and they, together with goods not coming within any Schedule to the Act, are at present taxed at 17.5 per cent. It is proposed that they be taxed in future at 20 per cent. Other goods also now to be taxed at 20 per cent include boats, confectionery, stationery, computers, soft drinks, potable spirits and imported wines and beers. It is customary for changes in the rates of sales tax to take effect on the day following the introduction of amending Bills and these Bills, when enacted, will accordingly operate on and after 18 August 1982. The sales tax is basically a tax on sales at the wholesale level and, in the ordinary case of sales by a wholesaler to a retailer, the increased rates of tax will accordingly apply to sales made after Budget day. As usual, an explanatory memorandum covering technical aspects of the Bills and providing, on this occasion, a detailed listing of the goods affected by these measures is being made available to honourable members. The net result of the changes in sales tax rates will be an increase in revenue estimated at some $370m in 1982-83 and $490m in a full year. 1 commend the Bills to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Young) adjourned. SALES TAX (EXEMPTIONS AND CLASSIFICATIONS) AMENDMENT BILL Bill presented by Mr Fife, and read a first time. Second Reading",443
167,Mr FIFE ,DESCRIPTION OF FUNCTIONS,"Farrer-Minister for Aviation) (9.44)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. As announced in the Budget Speech this evening, the Government has decided on two sales tax changes. Legislation for one of them-an increase of 2.5 percentage points in existing rates-has just been introduced. The Bill I am now introducing deals with the second aspect and will impose sales tax of 7.5 per cent on a range of goods that are now exempt from tax. This extension of the sales tax base will have effect on goods that pass the taxing point-normally the last wholesale sale-on or after I January 1983. The Treasurer ( Mr Howard) drew attention last year to the clear advantage that lies in effecting some change in the mix of direct and indirect taxation. 1 again emphasise the potential that such a change generates for desirable reduction in direct taxes, particularly personal income tax. The technical effect of the Bill will be tax at 7.5 per cent, on and after I January 1983, goods which are at present exempted by items 53, 58, 105,107 and 113F, sub-items (4), (SA), (6), (7) and (10) of item 120 and item 120A in the first Schedule. The broad classes of goods which fall within the scope of the items other than 113F, are maps, hand tools, motion picture films, household drapery and soft furnishings, cleaning and polishing cloths, braid, ribbon and tape, blankets, handkerchiefs, cleaning sponges and enginecleaning cotton waste. The goods covered by item 113F are, very broadly, servicing equipment and construction equipment. More particularly, this equipment covers servicing equipment used to service, repair or recondition motor vehicles, aircraft, ships or railway rolling stock or in retreading and repairing of tyres and repairing of footwear for human wear. The item also covers equipment used for constructing, maintaining or repairing buildings or other structures, roads, dams, pipelines, drains, trenches, tunnels or other works. I should emphasise that this item deals with equipment et cetera which is used in the course of servicing, repair or construction as the case may be. It does not include goods which become part of the goods being repaired or the structures built. Using buildings as an example, equipment for use in construction of a building will become taxable at 7.5 per cent but the materials used to construct the building and thereby become part of the building will remain exempt from sales tax. 1 emphasise 1982 that goods falling within any of these categories will still be exempt from sales tax if they are sold in circumstances in which an overriding exemption in the first schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act applies. Similarly, where a manufacturer purchases such goods for use as 'aids to manufacture', the goods will remain exempt under the 'aids to manufacture' head of exemption. I do not think that I need to go into greater detail at this stage. As usual, however, an explanatory memorandum covering technical aspects of the Bill is being made available to honourable members and this provides details of the goods affected by these measures. The net result of the changes will be an increase in revenue estimated at some $44m in 1982-83 and $1 05m in a full year. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Blewett) adjourned.

168,Mr HODGMAN ,DIESEL FUEL TAXES LEGISLATION,"Denison-Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce) (9.50)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is one of several measures to give effect to the new diesel fuel duty payments and administration arrangements foreshadowed by my colleague the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) in his Budget Speech earlier tonight. On and from 8 o'clock tonight the existing diesel fuel certificate scheme, wherein certificates were issued to purchasers of diesel fuel for 'off road' use to obtain the fuel at duty free prices, will be terminated. In its place this Bill will introduce a new rebate system which will require all purchases of diesel fuel to be made at the duty paid price with rebates payable to persons in certain categories for their 'off road' use. have already revoked the relevant Customs and excise by-laws which provided the authority for the issuance of diesel fuel certificates under the previous scheme. This Bill contains amendments to a number of pieces of legislation including amendments to the Diesel Fuel Taxation (Administration) Act 1957, to terminate the operation of that Act on and from 8 o'clock tonight. Any purchases of diesel fuel for 'off road' use made at duty free rates under the certificate scheme up to 8 o'clock this evening will remain subject to the end use provisions of that Act. Similarly, purchasers who, before 8 o'clock this evening, purchased diesel fuel at duty inclusive prices and used that fuel for 'off road' purposes will be entitled to rebates as provided for under the old arrangements. The Bill also amends the Customs Act and the Excise Act to introduce new provisions into both of those Acts relating to the new rebate system. I would now like to outline some of the details of the new rebate system. As from 8 o'clock tonight all diesel fuel sales will be required to be made at a price inclusive of the duty. This means that no users of diesel fuel will be able to purchase, as they did in the past, duty free diesel fuel from oil companies, agencies or distributors. The users of diesel fuel in the categories defined in clause 5 of the Bill who use the fuel for 'off road' purposes are eligible for a rebate of the duty paid on the diesel fuel used in their operations. To obtain the rebate the user must lodge a claim with a collector of Customs. The categories I have just referred to relate to the use of diesel fuel in the agriculture, mining, forestry and fishing industries, in domestic premises, hospitals, aged persons homes and nursing homes. The overriding qualification for rebate Second Reading will be that the fuel so used will be used otherwise than for the purposes of propelling a road vehicle on a public road. It has been necessary to include in the Bill powers that are similar to those powers contained in the Diesel Fuel Taxation (Administration) Act. These investigative powers are essential for the protection of the revenue and for the effective administration of the new rebate system. It is proposed that the Customs and excise regulations be amended to require certain information to be submitted by claimants for rebate and for claimants to keep records of their purchases and use of the fuel for a period of not less than two years from the date of their purchase of the fuel. Claims for rebate for domestic use may be lodged on a continuous basis but all other claims for rebate will be limited to a minimum rebate amount of I $100. Claims for rebate will not normally be payable unless they are lodged within 12 months of the date of the purchase of the fuel. Claims will be processed after the date upon which the amending legislation receives the royal assent. The Department of Industry and Commerce will be issuing an information pamphlet detailing eligibility and operation of the new rebate scheme and copies of this pamphlet will be available from Customs offices, oil companies, their agencies and distributors. It is expected that the rebates paid to claimants under the new scheme will amount to approximately $112m per annum. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Dr Blewett) adjourned.

171,Mr WILSON ,SOCIAL WELFARE,"Sturt-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Social Security)-by leave-In his Budget Speech the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) made reference to a number of initiatives in the social security area. I should like to expand upon some of the points he covered and give the House a more detailed account of what this Budget has achieved in terms of the Government's social welfare objectives. In this year's Budget the Government has allocated $11,983m for social security pensions and benefits, other welfare programs and services and housing programs administered by the Department of Social Security. During the year the Department has acquired important new functions relating to housing, and (No.2) 1982 the allocation for these programs in 1982-83 is $512m, an increase of 31.6 per cent over last year's expenditure. In the area of more traditional social security and welfare programs, spending Second Reading has increased from $9,997m to an estimated $ll,471m, an increase of 14.7 per cent. However, just as the apparent increase in expenditure announced last year was slightly reduced effectively by an extra pension pay-day that had to be accounted for, so this year's figure is increased. This means that the effective rate of increase in social welfare spending is some 18 per cent. I have a table illustrating this, which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The table read as followsOF SOCIAL SECURITY: 1981-82 TO 1982-83 Change 1981-82 1982-83 Actual Estimated Amount Per cent $m $m $m % 9,997 11,471 +1,474 +14.7 279 Plus housing programs transferred from former Department of Housing and Construction Total - Includes $342m charged to former",446
172,Mr WILSON,SOCIAL WELFARE,"I thank the House. While this is a larger increase than we have seen in the welfare areas in recent years, in terms of the assistance it will provide I believe it is an increase that represents particularly good value for money. This is because many of the initiatives included in this year's welfare budget are designed as incentives to welfare recipients to improve their own positions and so become less dependent on government for direct assistance. This Budget provides valuable benefits to many groups who are clients of the Department. We have taken significant steps to improve our total package of assistance for Australian families. We have moved to improve the financial position of many age pensioners. We have provided additional help for many unemployed people, and provided greater opportunities for them to supplement their benefits through part time work. We have developed new schemes of assistance for the disabled. Debate interrupted. NA",447

174,Mr WILSON ,SOCIAL WELFARE,"Sturt-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Social Security)- We have also introduced measures in the field of housing that will be of benefit both to individual home buyers and, through increased activity, to the housing industry as a whole. Before I go into detail in each of these areas I should like to say something about the overall strategy that the Government has adopted Change 1981-82 1982-83 Actual Estimated Amount Percent $m $m $m % 9,718 11,471 +1,753 +18.0 *389 512 + 123 +31.6 10,107 11,983 1,876 18.6 Department of Housing and Construction. in framing this year's welfare Budget. Decisions we have taken in this Budget complement the important measure adopted by the Fraser Government in 1976, to protect automatically most pensioners and beneficiaries who receive the basic rate of pension against inflation, by twice-yearly adjustments in pension rates linked to consumer price index increases. These automatic increases are the best indication that Australian pensioners could have of the Government's continuing concern for these people in Australia who have nothing to live on except the pension or benefit they receive from the social welfare system. Because those changes have been made automatic it is easy to overlook the fact that they are an important and costly commitment. In November 1982 and in May 1983 increases will cost about $770m in a full year. Indeed, the provision we have had to make for indexation accounts for some 40 per cent of this year's increase. That is a substantial basic commitment when you are beginning to shape a Budget. There are other areas of increase too that could not be avoided, such as expected increases in the number of welfare beneficiaries. These, and other increases already built into the system, account for over 30 per cent more of the overall increase. So, in total we were committed to an extra expenditure of more than $1.3 billion before we began to look at any new policy initiatives-and that $1.3 billion accounts for some 75 per cent of our expenditure increase. Given this, our aim has been to spend the funds we felt able to allocate for new initiatives in a way that would alleviate the particularly pressing problems in the welfare system and also to give taxpayers good value for the extra dollars we proposed to spend. The Government is aware that there are some areas falling within the scope of the welfare system where inflation has caused special problems for particular groups of people. Many of the initiatives we have adopted this year are aimed at alleviating these problems. They will also, as I have already mentioned, provide greater incentives for people to improve their own positions and become less dependent on government. Help for Families In developing our package of assistance for families we have had in mind the additional costs that all parents undertake in bringing up children, and the particularly harsh impact of inflation on families with low incomes. To help in meeting these extra costs we have decided to increase the rate of family allowance by 50 per cent for the first and second children in a family from October 1982. This will bring family allowance for the first child to $22.80 a month and for the second child to $32.55 a month. This increase, which is part of the Government's tax relief measures in this Budget, will cost some $250m in 1982-83 and will consolidate the increases for third and subsequent children we introduced in last year's Budget. While it will be of particular benefit to the 1.6 million families in Australia who have one or two children, all 2.1 million families with children will gain. In addition to this general assistance for families, we will introduce, from May 1983, a tax free family income supplement for low income families apart from pensioners and beneficiaries of up to $10 a week for each dependent child. This not only reflects our recognition of the particular cost burden borne by low income families who are bringing up children, but it also helps to avoid the unfair and clearly undesirable situation where an unemployment beneficiary can be better off financially than a person in similar family circumstances who is in employment, but earning low wages. The income limit for this supplement will be closely linked to the income test for health care cards. However, full details of the new arrangements will be announced well before the implementation date, which has been set in May 1983. The Government is anxious to get this new scheme of assistance operating as soon as possible, and has settled on Mayas the earliest date by which the necessary administrative action to introduce a completely new benefit can be completed. Because the family income supplement is a completely new benefit aimed at assisting low income families who are mainly in employment, the Government will monitor it closely to ensure that it meets its objective of relieving hardship among those families who are not pensioners or beneficiaries. Low income families will also be assisted by a rise in the qualifying limits for health care cards which, as a result of CPI-linked increases and adjustments to the income test for unemployment benefit to which they are linked, will go up from November to $184 per week for a married couple without children plus $20 for each child in the family. Holders of the health care cards will be able to get certain pharmaceutical items at concessional rates from 1 January 1983 under the new scheme announced by the Minister for Health ( Mr Carlton). There will also be changes in the rates and income tests for certain education and living allowances, details of which will be announced by the appropriate Ministersbut parents who receive allowances for children under the Secondary Allowances Scheme and related schemes will not also be able to get family income supplement for the same child. There has been widespread concern recently about the growth in the number of sole parent families in Australia. There has also been particular concern about the growth in the number of such families receiving income support from the Commonwealth. On the other hand, there is no doubt that some sole parent families are among the most needy of all families in the Australian community. In shaping its policy of asistance to families the Government has kept these concerns in mind and has sought to strike a balance which recognises the particular problems faced by sole parents, but, as far as possible, avoids creating further financial incentives for separation and reduces disincentives for forming new, lasting relationships. The increases in family allowances, the introduction of the family income supplement, and the adjustments in personal income tax announced by the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) will have a significant impact on the disposable income of many Australian families. I have a number of tables detailing the gains for families in various circumstances, which I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted.

From Benefits card, while eligibility of unemployment beneficiaries when private income reaches $130 a week. 1983 by the percentage increase in the CP[ between the June and to 12 show, in week for a child, the excess will, from February 1983, be treated as the parent's own income for income test purposes. This will bring the treatment of maintenance for the children of supporting parent beneficiaries into line with that applying to widow pensioners. From November 1982 it will be no longer possible for a supporting parent beneficiary to be regarded as a dependant of another person for the purpose of any payment of pension, benefit or allowance, although existing recipients will be exempted from the affect of the change. In addition, existing provisions in the Social Security Act concerning the requirement to take reasonable steps to pursue maintenance action will be reactivated. Children's Senices The Government also proposes to develop a rationalised and extended program of children's services. To this end there will be an increase of almost 50 per cent in funding for child care services under the Children's Services Program for 1982-83 from an expenditure of $47.56m in 1981-82 to $70.04m. Under the program the States and the Northern Territory will also receive $33.09m as a contribution to pre-school education. In future not less than 75 per cent of funds under the Children's Services Program, apart from the pre-school grants, will be spent on 'mainstream' services-that is, day care services for young children. The Budget allocation for the 1982-83 year will, broadly speaking, enable the Government to continue to support existing services and, where necessary, increase grants to maintain their viability; direct additional assistance to those people in the community who need it most, through revised funding arrangements for day care services ($6.86m has been specifically earmarked for this purpose); carry out a pilot testing of the feasibility of providing a subsidy enable the children of parents with modest incomes to attend commercial child care centres ($200,000 has been allocated for this in 1982-83); fund new projects to meet high priority needs for children's services ($5m has been specially set aside for this purpose). The revised funding arrangements for day care will ensure that economically needy families are not denied access to care because they cannot afford to pay the fees. The major aspects of the new funding package are: There will be an increase in the operational support grant for family day care schemes to $10 per week per equivalent full time child. This new rate will represent an proximate overall increase of 33.3 per cent over the amounts payable under the existing formula and will be paid from I July 1982. A new fee rebating arrangement for economically needy users will be introduced. This will replace existing special need arrangements where appropriate, and will provide each service with funds according to the need for fee rebates among its economically needy users. This will be known as the Special Economic Need Subsidy. New grants will be introduced to assist children with particular development and cultural needs. These will be known as Supplementary Services Grants. Housing Assistance Another area where we have recognised the adverse impact of inflation is in housing. To tackle some of the problems here, we have increased our commitment to direct assistance to home buyers and improved funding arrangements for welfare housing. Our housing initiatives will not only provide significant additional assistance for families in need but will serve to boost activity and employment in the housing industry. The new arrangements the Treasurer has announced for taxation relief in respect of mortgage interest payments will be a significant measure to assist Australian home buyers and will extend the assistance already provided through the housing package announced in March this year. Funding for the various components of that package in the 1982-83 Budget is as follows: A total of $147m has been allocated to meet commitments under the Homes Savings Grant Scheme and under the new Home Deposit Assistance Scheme which has replaced it. This compares with expenditure of $114.6m in 1981-82. The sum of $20m has been allocated for distribution to the States to fund the new mortgage and rent relief scheme which will help low income to families who face severe financial difficulty with their mortgage or rent payments. The tax rebate for first home buyers announced in March is expected to cost some $1 OOm in 1982-83, although in a full year of operation it will cost some $230m. There has also been an increase of 27 per cent in direct funding to the States and Northern Territory for welfare housing, with specific allocations earmarked for the high priority areas of housing for pensioners and Aboriginals. In addition to these increases in funding, the money available for the family crisis accommodation program, which provides short term emergency apaccommodation for families, has been doubled to $4m for 1982-83. A total of $6.7m has also been allocated in 1982-83 to subsidise new and existing services for homeless people under the Homeless Persons Assistance Program. Of this total, $3m has been earmarked for new capital projects. In addition, from I October 1982, the subsidy paid to funded organisations for food and accommodation costs will increase to $1.35 a person a day and the subsidy for a meal provided to a homeless person who does not stay overnight will rise to 45c. Assistance for Pensioners Adjustments to the pension system in conjunction with the adjustments to the income tax system announced by the Treasurer will benefit invalid pensioners, widow pensioners and supporting parent beneficiaries, as well as age pensioners. Tables II to 16 of the tables I referred to earlier show the impact of these adjustments on the disposable incomes of pensioners in different circumstances. Retired people on fixed incomes have been among the groups hardest hit by inflation in recent years, and many have suffered a significant erosion of their living standards. We have made a number of adjustments to the pension and benefits system designed to improve the position of such people, and also to act as an incentive for people who want to improve their position by savings or by casual employment. We have therefore liberalised the income test, both for the basic pension and for fringe benefits. From November 1982, single pensioners will be able to have $30 of private income a week without affecting their entitlement to a full pension. Couples may have $50 a week. This compares with current rates of $20 a week for single people and $34.50 for couples. The Government has also decided to increase the income limit for pensioner health benefits to $54 a week (single) and $90 a week (married couples) to take effect from November 1982. A new uniform increased limit of $20 for each dependent child in a family, on top of the base limits, is also to apply. The additional income limits for children currently vary between $11 and $17 a week. Pensioners who qualify for a pensioner health benefit card are entitled to a range of Commonwealth concessions, the most important being free medical and hospital treatment, free pharmaceuticals and telephone rental concessions. The Government was concerned that a number of pensioners had lost entitlement to fringe benefits, perhaps through no action of their own, because their incomes had risen above the limits set in 1979. It was also concerned that others might have placed themselves at a disadvantage by arranging their financial affairs so as to keep their incomes below the current limits and qualify for a card. The increase in the income limits should help people in both these categories. The higher limits will also apply to eligibility for pensioner neral benefits. In addition, all pensioners who are not eligible for fringe benefits, including all supporting parent beneficiaries and people over 70 who get an income-test-free pension, will be able to get pharmaceuticals at a new concessional rate of $2 under the proposed new three-tiered pharmaceutical benefits scheme to be announced by the Minister for Health. A further small but important change is that from November 1982 wife pensioners resident overseas may qualify for a widow's pension without having to return to Australia. Supplementary Assistance The Government has also decided to increase the maximum rate of supplementary assistance by a further $2. It will go up to $10 a week from November 1982. In particular all pensioners and long term sickness beneficiaries paying private rents above $26 a week and with private income below $16 a week will gain from this change. At the same time, to ensure that pensioners do not suffer any loss of entitlement to a pension or supplementary assistance, rent subsidies paid to private tenants by State public housing authorities will be excluded from the definition of income for pension, benefit and supplementary assistance income test purposes. Increased Subsidies for Services for the Aged We have also extended our assistance for aged people by increasing the money available for subsidies for accommodation for elderly people and services for old people living at home. Funds available in 1982-83 for capital grants under the aged or disabled persons accommodation program have been increased by more than 46 per cent, compared with expenditure of $56. 7m in 1981-82. This includes an additional allocation of $18m to expand the program in 1982-83, the last year of the current three-year funding period. The additional allocation will effectively allow the approval of approximately 100 new projects. Funding of $87m for 1983-84 under this program has also been approved. Under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act the maximum building grant has been increased to $14,000 for each single unit or person housed and $16,240 for double units. Under the Aged or Disabled Persons Hostels Act the maximum grant is now $21,000 per person housed. Both changes apply to contracts entered into on or after 1 July 1982. Subsidies for land components, furniture and so on remain unchanged. fuThe subsidy paid to organisations caring for frail aged people in approved hostels will be increased to $30 a week for each eligible person from July 1982. This is an increase of 50 per cent on the present level, or 100 per cent since October 1980 when the rate was last increased from $15 to $20. It will help to ensure that a high standard of care continues to be provided. Help for the Unemployed In its overall Budget strategy, the Government has been concerned to introduce measures that will improve the employment prospects for many Australians. However, we are aware that unemployed people, and particularly those who are unemployed for long periods, have special difficulties. We have taken steps to help them by a series of initiatives that will raise the level of payments for many unemployment beneficiaries and increase the scope for them to obtain additional income and valuable work experience through casual employment. From November 1982, single unemployed people age 18 years and over who have no dependants will get a rise of $6.30 a week in their benefit, bringing their weekly rate to $64.40. Single unemployed people and sickness beneficiaries aged 16 and 17 years will also get a rise. They will get an extra $4, giving them a total of $40 a week. At the same time, the regular automatic adjustments for CPI increases will mean a rise in the maximum single and married rates of benefits by $3.10 for a single person and $5.20 for a married couple. The new rates will be $77.25 a week for single people over 18 with dependants and $128.80 for a couple. To encourage unemployed people to take advantage of opportunities to earn extra income and gain job experience by casual work, they will also be allowed to earn more without losing their benefit. This will apply to people receiving sickness benefit as well as to the unemployed. The more generous income test will mean that everyone who receives unemployment or sickness benefit will be able to have $10 a week of private income without affecting their rate of benefit. The amount allowed currently is $3 a week for single people under 18 and $6 for everyone else. People who have more than $10 a week of private income will lose 50c benefit for every $1 of extra income up to an income limit of $60. This represents a substantial increase in the amount of extra income that can be earned before the benefit is reduced by $1 for every $1 of income. At present the upper limit is only $40 for single people under 18 years and $50 for others. Eligibility for health cover will also be extended. Unemployment and special beneficiaries will be eligible for heath care cards under the higher pensioner fringe benefits income limits I have already outlined. All sickness beneficiaries will be eligible for pensioner fringe benefits. Tables 17 to 22 of the tables I referred to earlier show the impact of welfare initiatives in this Budget on the assistance received by unemployment and sickness beneficiaries in different circumstances with different levels of income. The Government is also specially concerned about young Australians who are homeless because of family breakdown or violent family relationships, or for other reasons. Many of these young people are also unemployed and have particular difficulties in finding suitable accommodation. Long term measure to help in this area will be considered in the light of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare's recent report on the problems of homeless youth and in the light of the final evaluation of the Youth Services Scheme. However, as an interim measure, $300,000 has been allocated in 1982-83 to help non-profit organisations provide accommodation or other assis-nce for homeless single people under 18 years of age who receive unemployment, sickness or special benefit. The Government hopes that an additional effort in this area will help to prevent many young people from falling into a pattern of homelessness and chronic poverty. Assistance for Disabled People The Government's wish to encourage people to help themselves by finding employment is also reflected in its proposals for assistance to disabled people. Our initiatives in this area have a basic orientation towards helping people to get into employment that is sound in economic terms and reflects the wishes of disabled people themselves, particularly as they were conveyed to the Government during the International Year of Disabled Persons in 1981. At the same time there are initiatives in this Budget that will be of assistance to all disabled people, whether in terms of improving their financial position or increasing the services available to them. Invalid pensioners, for example, will benefit directly from the package of adjustments to the pensioner system which I outlined when speaking of our initiatives to help aged people. In addition, we have introduced a series of measures that will be of particular assistance to disabled people who are in the work force or who want to work. From April 1983 a mobility allowance of $10 a week will be introduced for severely handicapped people who are in employment or undertaking vocational training and who are unable to use public transport to travel to their work or training because of their disability. This benefit, which will cost some $18.2m in a full year, will be free of any income test or income tax. It will not, however, be available to those receiving the benefit of sales tax exemptions on new motor vehicles. The new allowance recognises the additional travel costs incurred by disabled people who undertake employment or vocational training. The Government has decided to move as quickly as possible in this area to meet pressing needs but will keep the scheme under review to make sure it is effective in its operation. On lated front, we have also decided to carry out a pilot study to test alternative modes of attendant care assistance. Additional funds have been earmarked for this purpose and $100,000 will be available in 1982-83. From March 1983, a new form of income maintenance payment will be introduced for people who undertake a Commonwealth rehabilitation program and who otherwise would be eligible for another social security pension or benefit. The new rehabilitation allowance will be at the same rates and under the same conditions as invalid pensions; that is, income-tested but income tax free and attracting the same fringe benefits. It may be paid during the rehabilitation program and for up to six months afterwards. The plans announced in June for the extension and development of the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service are also to be set in train during 1982-83. During IYDP the Government also had put before it the views of numerous invalid pensioners who feel that existing invalid pension arrangements prevented them attempting to take up employment. The Government wishes to give as much help as possible to invalid pensioners who feel able to make the transfer to open employment. A major concern is the loss of pensioner health benefits. To meet this concern we have decided to grant health care cards to people who give up an invalid pension or sheltered employment allowance to take up open employment. The card will last for 12 months and will not be subject to an income test. The Health Insurance Act will be amended to enable this provision to be introduced from 1 January 1983. This decision should improve incentives for invalid pensioners and people in sheltered employment to attempt to enter, or to re-enter, the open work force. It will also protect them against any above average health costs during the period of adjusting to employment. As health care card holders they will be eligible for free medical and hospital treatment. They will also qualify for concessional charges for pharmaceuticals, because the Government has decided to introduce a concessional $2 rate of contribution for health care card holders under its proposed three-tiered pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Their other major concern is that, should their efforts to retain employment be unsuccessful because of their disability, the very fact of having made the effort might disqualify them from regaining their pension. Therefore as a further means of encouraging invalid plo!nsioners to take up employment where possible, the Directora reGeneral of Social Security will be arranging for them to be reconsidered for a pension immediately if they have to give up work within 12 months. In some cases the pension will be granted again without the need for a medical review, and in others they will be given priority in arranging such a review. From November 1982 the incentive allowance paid to people in sheltered employment will be increased to $10 a week. In addition, from February 1983, eligibility for incentive allowance will be extended to invalid pensioners undertaking activity therapy and adult training centre programs under the Handicapped Persons Welfare Program. In all the above cases the incentive allowance, unlike the supplementary assistance which it replaces, will be paid regardless of the income a person receives or rent paid. These measures remove the anomalies that previously existed in the treatment of handicapped people attending these different categories of special services. Another change will affect people who get a sheltered employment allowance. Currently they enjoy a more liberal income test for fringe benefits, particularly if they are single. It is not proposed to increase the current income limit for single people, which at $68 a week will still be $14 higher than the general limit proposed. However, for married people the income limit will increase from $73 to $90, the same as for other married pensioners. To improve incentives for invalid pensioners to participate in activity therapy and adult training centres, the higher income limit of $68 a week for fringe benefits will also apply, from November 1982, to single invalid pensioners participating in the programs of such centres. Families with a severely handicapped child who is cared for at home will be assisted by an increase in handicapped child's allowance by $12 a month to $85 a month from November 1982. Increased funds are to be provided to subsidise building projects under the handicapped persons welfare program, which makes grants to non-profit organisations providing prescribed services for disabled people such as training, activity therapy, sheltered employment and associated residential accommodation. Details are provided in the Minister for Social Security's news release of II August 1982. The increases mean that, during the financial years 1982-83 and 1983-84, some $37m will be available to subsidise capital projects, of which about $21m will be ear-marked for entirely new projects. In addition there will be a new provision for new services not requiring building subsidies and $500,000 will be available for this in 1982-83. The money available for funding recurrent expenditure such as salaries, rent, equipment, minor works and the payment of Handicapped Children's Benefit and for upgrading services provided under the program has also been increased. In summary our welfare Budget for 1982-83 has addressed many areas of need within the welfare system, particularly those that have been exacerbated in recent years by the effects of inflation. Addressing those problems has meant that the total expenditure in the welfare area for 1982-83 will be close to $12 billion. Some will inevitably see this as inadequate; others will see it as extravagant. At the beginning of this statement. I provided figures showing how the increase in total estimated expenditure for 1982-83 is made up. However, in looking at the total size of the welfare budget it should be borne in mind that $1 ,360m for family allowances, which shows up as welfare expense, could more correctly be presented as a reduction in taxation for families with children. Like the dependent spouse rebate and the former dependent child tax rebates, family allowances provide an offset to tax in recognition of the lower capacity to pay tax of taxpayers with dependants. For this reason, the Government decided to increase the rates of family allowances for first and second children this year as part of its review of the personal income tax system. The cost of this initiative-$250m in 1982-83-is a substantial component of the overall increase in expenditure in the welfare area this year. I believe that we have spent the additional funds allocated to welfare wisely-on initiatives that, as well as being on a sound welfare basis, have many spin-off benefits in encouraging people to do more to help themselves, providing incentives for pensioners and beneficiaries to make better use of their savings, and providing a significant boost to the housing industry. I hope this Budget will be welcomed as a constructive attempt to come to grips with the problems our community faces in 1982.

176,Dr BLEWETT ,IN CASH ASSISTANCE FROM,"Bonython) (10.37)-At this late hour of the evening there are only two brief observations that I wish to make on the ministerial statement. Firstly, I think it should be observed that nothing concentrates the mind of this Government so wonderfully on the needs of the poor as the nearness of an election. Secondly, the figures given in the statement clearly underwrite the accuracy of the costing of the Australian Labor Party's health plan. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Conclusion Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA NA Ministerial Statement",465
177,Mr HODGMAN ,SUBSIDY SCHEME,"Denison-Minister for the Capital Territory and Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce)-by leave-As the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) has announced the Government has decided to review the Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy Scheme. This review will commence immediately and will enable the Government to examine the objectives of the scheme and options for ensuring that it is not subject to abuse. The Government's objective in introducing the scheme was to assist in achieving equality in the price of petroleum products between city and country locations. Under present arrangements the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority determines maximum justified wholesale prices for each of the major oil companies. These comprise a base wholesale price-the capital city price-plus a maximum justified freight differential for various country locations. The operation of the freight subsidy scheme ensures that maximum wholesale prices in country areas are not more than 0.44c per litre above the maximum capital city prices. Despite the freight subsidy scheme variations exist between retail prices for petroleum products in various localities. While the scheme has ensured that freight is not a significant cause of these variations, there are other factors at work including differences in State fuel taxes, discounting and differences in reseller margins between capital city and country areas, reflecting differences in throughput volumes and the degree of competition. These factors will of course be taken into consideration in the review. Since the scheme was introduced the Government has become concerned that it is being abused by certain parties. Investigations have led to some successful prosecutions for fraudulent claims, while there have been allegations that the scheme is being manipulated in other ways by certain distributors for gain. The Government has also become concerned at the escalating costs of the scheme, which rose to $147m in 1981-82 compared with a Budget estimate of $129m for that year. As the Treasurer has also announced, pending the outcome of the review, the scheme will be amended to subsidise freight costs in excess of Ic per litre, instead of the 0.44c per litre which previously applied. Although this will mean a slight rise in the freight component paid by consumers, the scheme will continue to make a significant contribution to reducing freight differentials. I present the following paper: Petroleum Products Freight Subsidy SchemeMinisterial Statement, 17 August 1982. Motion (by Sir James Killen) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.

178,Mr HODGMAN ,NEW PARLIAMENT HOUSE,"Denison-Minister for the Capital Territory)-by leave-For the information of honourable members. I wish to announce that the updated building budget for the design and construction of the new Parliament House is $370.4m at March 1982 prices. It is the Government's intention to report periodically to Parliament on the updated budget for the new building, and honourable members will recall that in September 1981, when this House approved the latest declared stage, the building budget was $303.9m atJune 1981 prices. In accordance with the Government's determination to contain costs on the project, the Parliament House Construction Authority has succeeded in containing the increase in budget figures between June 1981 and March 1982 to the inflationary effects of movements in the cost of labour and materials. I, therefore, wish to stress that the budget originally approved by Parliament, plus approved variations amounting to only 2.9 per cent, is being maintained in real terms. I present the following paper: Updated Building Budget for New Parliament HouseMinisterial Statement, 17 August 1982. Motion (by Sir James Killen) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.
