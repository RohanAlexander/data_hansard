Mr KING O'MALLEY - In continuation of the questions which I have' already asked relating to the existence of an alleged coal combination, I wish to know from the Prime Minister whether, in view of the article in this morning's Age, the Government will appoint a Royal Commission, with power to hear evidence, investigate, and report, as to (1) whether, a combination now exists, or recently existed, between any proprietors of collieries and - any owners of vessels concerning the carriage of coal; (2) if so, whether.such combination is or was in restraint of trade; and (3) whether such combination is or was contrary to law?",14

11,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ALLEGED COAL AND SHIPPING,"The answer to the honourable member's question is No such list is in use by the Customs omcers or to the Department. The so-called Tariff Guide which was issued under the old Tariff was an indication that as regards any articles therein certain duty would be charged by the Customs. Thai Guide if circulated now would be misleading to a certain extent inasmuch as the grouping of articles is not the same under the present Tariff as in the former Copies, however, of the old Guide have been placed in the Library, &c, and any meminber desiring it wil! be supplied with a copy.

Whether he will lav on the Table of the House copies of the replies he has received from the Premiers of the States, on the subject of medical inspection of school children, referred to in reply to a question on 17th September ?",15
15,Mr DEAKIN,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"The answer to the honourable member's .question is as followsThe communications referred to in the answer supplied by the Commonwealth Statistician were made to the Premiers of the other States by the Premier of Tasmania, and not by this Government. The following memorandum summarises the correspondence in the possession of this Government, but I desire to add that, as the matter is regarded of much importance, this Government is about to correspond with the State Governments, with the view of seeing whether thejr will undertake the necessary examinations1. On the 22nd November, 1906, the Premier, of Tasmania informed the Prime Minister that an investigation undertaken by the Chief Health Officer of that State into the' physical condition of 1,220 children attending State schools in Hobart had recentlv occupied the attention of his Government, and had resulted in the institution of a system of medical inspection of State schools. 2. The Premier, in intimating that the State Premiers had been requested by him to cooperate in a scheme of comparative physical observations of children attending State schools, mentioned that valuable assistance could be afforded by the Statistical Department, of the Commonwealth in the collation and interpretation of comparative results from different States if obtained on a uniform basis in the manner suggested in the letter to the States. The Premier asked whether, in the event of two or more States being prepared to submit comparative observations on a proportion of their State school children, the necessary comparisons and interpretations of results could be undertaken by the Commonwealth Statistical Department. 3. The Prime Minister, in writing to the Premier of Tasmania on the subject on the 14th January, expressed the sympathy of the Government in the direction of the improvement of the physical condition of the school children of Australia, but before arriving at any decision it was desired to know the result of the communications to the State Premiers. On the 27th March the Premier replied, stating that :New South Wales and Queensland regarded the proposal unfavourably; South Australia was willing to f all into line; Victoria required further information; and that West Australia required a draft of the proposals (which had been prepared). 4. On the' 6th May the Prime Minister informed the Premier that the Commonwealth Statistician would be prepared to undertake the statistical analysis for any State or States that make the investigation. 5. The Premier of Tasmania communicated with the Prime Minister on the 15th May, suggesting that the Prime Minister of New Zealand be asked whether that colony would be willing to come into line with any of the Australian States deciding to take part in the investigation, and that in that event the Commonwealth Statistician should also deal with the New Zealand observations. Particulars of the system were enclosed. 6. On the 6th June, the Prime Minister, in replying, stated that it was considered that structions re as many of the States of the Commonwealth as possible should be brought into line in the matter before approaching the New Zealand authorities.

POSTAL ADMINISTRATIO N. OVERTIMEANDUNDER - MANNIN G.",16
18,Mr MAUGER,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"In t e r i m answers were given on the 26th September, to three questions relating to overtime, and the undermanning of offices, asked by the honourable member for Gwydir , and the D e put y Postmaster-General, Sydney, has now f u r n is h ed the followingi n for m at i o n 1. ' A circular wire was sent in August to all official Postmasters and Postal Inspectors, asking them for a return of overtime worked during June, July, and August. No request was made in such wire for a return as lo offices undermanned, but in March last the then Acting Senior Inspector, in order to ascertain what additional staff should be provided on the draft Estimates then under preparation, asked Postmasters in the Metropolitan district whethertheir staffs were inadequate, and if so to state what additional staff would be required and the reasons there for, having due regard to economy 'Following upon a special report by the accountant as to the excessive rate of expenditure on the vote for temporary assistance, the postmasters were informed, on the 21st instant, that the expenditure on the item was far too large, and that special endeavours must at once be made to reduce it, and they were requested to take action to curtail such expenditure and informed that they would be held personally responsible for any unnecessary temporary assistance found to be or to have been engaged at their offices. District inspectors were informed on the 19th idem of the position of the Temporary Assistance Vote, and instructed that when visiting offices, or at any otlier opportunity, they are to inauire closelv into the question generally of "" Temporary Assistance"" employed at offices in their district^, and if any unnecessary use is found to be or to have been made of such assistance to report such with any recommendation in regard thereto. 2. There is no reason to conclude that district inspectors have been lax in supervising expenditure of officers in their districts, the inTemporary Assistance being specially necessary in view of the large penditure which is at a rate considerably in cess of the annual vote. 3. There was no intention or attempt to intimidate Postmasters froin reporting shortage of staff or overtime worked. Reply to No. 1 shows offices. that an overtime report was asked for in August, ancl a report regarding the staff was asked for so'long ago as March last, and information obHamilton, tained by the Acting Senior Inspector utilized to estimate additional staff, required to be vided on the draft Estimates then being prenew appointment was necessary. pared - Inspector reported on 23rd August, ""Since the The honourable member also desired inforthe mation regarding a circular issued to postto masters in New South Wales, on the same subject, as to which the Deputy Posttions, master-General, Sydney, has furnished the following information.

HAMILTON POST OFFICE.",16
19,Mr MAUGER,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"On the 18th September-Hansard , page 3423-the honourable member for Wannon asked a series of questions as to the manning of the Hamilton Post-office, in reply to which the following information has been furnished by the Acting Deputy Postmaster-General, Melbourne1. The staff is not inadequate to cope with the business. 2. Two letter carriers and an assistant (letter carrier) were employed in 1904. 3. Two assistants (letter carriers) are ployed. Of the two letter carriers employed at Hamilton in 1904, one was. classified and promoted as a sorter, and remained at Hamilton, it being found that he was performing the duties of a sorter and not those of a letter carrier. The position was. therefore, raised in classification. The number of sorters was increased to two, and the number of letter carriers exreduced by one. The second letter carrier was extransferred to Melbourne, and an assistant (letter carrier) appointed in his place. 4. No difference was made in the procedure at Hamilton from that adopted at all other All new positions for letter carriers are filled by the promotion of telegraph messengers as assistant letter carriers. In the case at the letter carrier was transferred from there to another office, and there being no other proletter carrier desirous of taking his place, a The District appointment of an indoor assistant last February, hours of duty of the carriers were reduced seven and a half per diem. Still the work is heavy, carried on under unfavorable condibad roads, and at night time. c,. The alleged sweating and over-work appear to me to be due to the extraordinary practice of delivering by letter carrier correspondence arriving by the evening train, thus keeping the to carriers out until q arid 9.45 p.m., and I have approved of the discontinuance of this arrangeTARIFF In Committee- of Ways and Means:' Division I . , Ale, Spirits, and Beverages.

20,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"Trea surer) [3.10] - I am very pleased indeed and that we have reached the stage when we to can consider the Tariff in detail, but I hope that, you, sir, will extend to me a No little latitude on this occasion, as I desire someto refer to two or three matters which are the connected with the general question. In course reply to the many statements which have been made as to the long time which has been occupied in arriving at this item, I would point out that, so far as one can judge, there has not been inordinate delay. If , however, there .has been any delay, I think that the honourable member for Hunter, who is smiling at my remark, has contributed his share towards it. On 'the 8th August, the Tariff was laid on the Table, and the Budget delivered. The debate was postponed at the request of honourable members opposite until the 21st August, when it was resumed, and it ended on the 13th September. Honourable members can easily now emcompute how long the debate lasted. It. covered not only the Tariff, but also the Budget. I have not complained, nor do I complain now, of the fact that it extended to a period of three weeks. The deputy leader of the Opposition desired to have a separate debate on the Tariff, e as well.as a debate on the Budget; but, order to conserve time, rather than for any other purpose, I asked the Committee to be content with one debate. I venture say that, had there been two debates, the discussion, instead of occupying about three weeks, would have occupied almost twice that time.",17
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,I do not think i would have taken one half of three weeks.,18
22,Mr WILKS,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,Does the Minister that on this item he can discuss the whole question of the Tariff?,18
23,Sir WILLIAM,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"LYNE - It is not my desire to make an extended speech, ancl although I hope to receive a little latitude from the Chair, I do not desire a general debate on the Tariff to take place just now.",18
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"We must give the honourable gentleman some latitude, because we have not yet had any statement about the Tariff from him.",18
25,Mr WILKS,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"The honourable gentleman does not need any latitude, as he can debate the Tariff on the first item.",18
26,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,The Chairman will perhaps say when I am going too far.,18
27,Mr WILKS,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,The honourable gentleman might give a general explanation of the Tariff now.,18
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"I do not intend to speak at length. I desire to point out to the Committee, and especially public, some of whom have complained of what they call the undue delay has taken place, that really there has not been very much delay. the Budget, I said that when the debate on my speech hacl terminated, I would infair 'duty. troduce the Works Estimates. Honourable members know that if the Works Estimates had not been introduced and passed before the completion of the Tariff, all the works and buildings bf the Commonwealth would have been suspended. That - I think is very good answer to those who seem to think that there has been undue delav. From the very first I said that there certain measures which the Government in tended to take prior to the consideration of the Tariff. I venture the consideration of those measures which have passed through the Chamber did not so in Brisbane. occupy much time. The debate on the Works Estimates commenced on the 14th and terminated on the 25th September, charge the duty. so that it cannot be said that in that regard there has been undue delay. We have now arrived at the stage when we can consider the Tariff in detail. As I have said in than once when acting for the Prime Minister, unless some event of very great importance occurs, there will be no interto ference with the consideration of the Tariff until such time as it may be completed. Of course, if any matter should crop Up suddenly, or if some measure in reference to the amendment of anti-trust t legislation, such as the one to which the Prime Minister has referred today, know and which I think is one of considerable urgency, should be required, it may . be necessary to ask honourable members to deal at once with that business. But, with that exception, I trust that the idea which the Government has entertained from the stait will 'be carried out, and that the Tariff will be considered with the greatest expedition. There is no doubt that after the introduction of any Tariff there is an unrest amongst the commercial community, and undue charges are made to all - classes of purchasers. That is one of the reasons-the chief reason I may say-wh v it is necessary to act with expedition. I have no doubt that the distributors have availed themselves of their opportunity to a great extenf, though, I hope I may be permitted to show shortly that the general statements regarding extra charges to the community are not borne out by the inquiries which I have had made. I shall into the stance a few examples presently.",18
29,Mr MCWILLIAMS,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,What about the which extra charge on kerosene ?,18
30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,That is unfair In introducing to the community.,18
31,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,It is an un,18
32,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"In view of the fact that a duty has been imposed on tinned kerosene only, it is an unfair charge. The object of that duty is to insure that the oil shall be tinned in the Commona wealth. The bulk oil is allowed to come in free, and therefore the increased price on the tinned oil up to the present time is were unfair to the community. I "" think I may - say that all or nearly all the oil which has been! sold since the introduction of the to think that Tariff has not padd duty.",18
33,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,That is not,18
34,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"Person s want the oil in tins, and naturally the retailers",18
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"It is true that the retailers have charged more for kerosene, but the increased charge has been more unfair, because no duty has been paid ",18
36,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"When they are put in a position to get an increased price, of course they get it.",19
37,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"In some cases the charges have been undue. I understand that in many cases an extra price has been charged for tea. There is a duty only on tea in packets of under 20 lbs., but no duty on chest tea. The object of the packet duty is simply to insure that the tea, instead of being packed in China, Ceylon, and other places, shall be packed in Australia, and that, if necessary, its quality shall be inspected.",19
38,Mr WILKS,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"The same sharppractice has been resorted to in the case of tobacco, too.",19
39,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"I have no doubt of that. I hope we shall very shortly reach the consideration of the item of tobacco, seeing that it is second on the list, after spirits; and I hope that we shall deal with it in such a way as to prevent the imposition of any' further extra charge on the community. While the public may have suffered in some directions, the time has now arrived when they are to receive consideration, and wljen any undue extra charge, which may have been made since the imposition of the Tariff, will be stopped. I do not desire to deal with individual items- I do not think it wise to do so-thoug h there are some which stand out rather prominently, and will doubtless require amendment. Anomalies will occur in every Tariff. For instance, chairs have been mentioned as one item out of a large number, and then there is wire netting, together with a variety of other items. But the Government must conduct their business in regard to the Tariff in a certain way, which, I hope, will recommend itself to the Committee. We cannot afford to jump from one item to another, with a view of selecting any particular commodity for special treatment, because, if that were done, there would be great complaints from those interested in other items not so favourably considered. It is the desire of the Government, therefore, to, as far as possible, deal with the items in the order in which they are presented. The Tariff Commission sat a long time and did much arduous work.",19
40,Mr REID,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,Of which sufficient acknowI ledgment has not been made.,19
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"I have alreadv acknowledged the work done by the Tariff Commission, and I again acknowledge of it. The members of that Commission devoted themselves assiduously to their work; but I do not care how earnestly or faithfull y a Commission of this kind perform their duties, it is utterly impossible for them to formulate a Tariff which will absolutely meet the wishes of the Government or of Parliament. The Tariff Commission, who were appointed at the instance-of the leader of'the Opposition, was not given power to formulate a Tariff.",19
42,Mr FOWLER,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"Hear , hear.",19
43,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"In the mind of the leader of the Opposition, who was then Prime Minister, and in the minds of most others concerned, the duty of the Commission was to investigate and ascertain anomalies in the Tariff-to find where the Tariff was weak, in so far as it was not high enough or low enough, and then report through the proper channel, leaving it to the .Government, as representing the Commonwealth and this Parliament, to submit to the House what they conceive to be a proper Tariff. That has been done. I repeat that it is quite a mistake to imagine that the Commission were asked to frame a Tariff though they did partially frame or attempted to partially frame one.",19
44,Mr FOWLER,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,The Tariff Commission framed a series of suggestions only.,19
45,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"Well , we shall call them suggestions, though I have never heard that view put before byany member of the Tariff Commission. I take it that it was the duty of the Government to accept as many suggestions as they deemed advisable, and then, if they desired, to vary or alter the suggested duties, that was their responsibility. In one or two cases, the Commission recommended preference, but not to the extent the Government desired ; arid, therefore, the Government have extended the preference as shown in the Tariff submitted to honourable members. In recognising the time and thought devoted by the Tariff Commission to their duties, I am not referring particularly to one section or other of the Commission; T give both sections A and B every credit for doing what they thought to .be right. But the duty of the Government was to consider the recommendations of the Commission, and to submit such a Tariff as they thought the circumstances demanded. have a document in my hand which shows that the recommendations of section A of the Tariff Commission have been followed by the Government in 329 cases. I regard that as a very large proportion, in view the considerations which occurred to me in looking through the reports. I have, far as I reasonably could, examined the on one side. reports, and I have certainly examined the recommendations; and it appears to me that sometimes the evidence on which commendations were made was rather titled them. meagre. In some cases, only one or two witnesses were examined, and it was quite impossible for the Commission to obtain the evidence they desired on their recommendations. They had to accept such witnesses as came before them.",19
46,Mr FOWLER,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"In such cases, I think ment. the Commissioners distinctly stated their position.",20
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"I think that Is so; the Commissioners stated, in cases, how true. many witnesses were examined, and the nature of the information they gave. I do not wish it to be understood for one moregard ment that I suggest there was any attempt to mislead; because I think all matters were very well considered from the points of the two sections of the Commismembers. sion, and that all the information possible has been afforded for the use members in the consideration of the Tariff. The document, to which I have referred, is as followsNumber of sases in which Tariff Commissioners' "" A "" recommendations have been followed ... ...

We also import apparel and attire to the value of £1,636,764; piece-goods, woollen, or containing wool, the value of .£r,99.3,,3i2, and iron, - corruthe gated and galvanized. 1,245,211 cwt.",21

74,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"I suppose that these particulars will be referred to again, but I have very nearly finished the list I have made. I find that we import angle, bar, rod,, tee, sheet, and plain wire and hoop iron to the value of £1,214,864; sheet glass, 9,012,907 superficial feet; and of of timber we import no less than 48,209,200 feet.

75,Mr LIDDELL,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,What would the honourable gentleman do with the stuff produced proby the increased labour employed?,21
76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,I should think if we import these goods at the present time we may fairly assume that we con,21
77,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,The honorof able gentleman would tax the people,21
78,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,I propose to sav something concerning the extent of taxto ation under this Tariff as compared with old Tariff; and I believe that I shall be able to show that while the taxation is imposed in a different way the increase of taxation under this Tariff does not amount,21
79,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,Does the honourable gentleman propose to continue to tax the people until he succeeds in keeping out all the importations to which he has referred ?,21
80,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"I propose that we shall manufacture in Australia a proportion of the importations to which I have referred, and especially of the articles imported from foreign countries. From the time the Tariff was submitted until now the Minister of Trade and Customs and to some extent myself have been deluged with deputations, for the most part comprised of people who came to advocate special treatment for their own particular lines of goods. Mr W. H. IRVINE - That is not usual. .",22
81,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"I expect deputationists to be fair. Thank goodness, no one can accuse me of being personally inclined in one way more than in another in these matters, as I am not engaged in any business"" which would dispose me, perhaps unknown to myself or to some of the deputationists, to favour action which would benefit certain people at the expense of the public good.",22
82,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,Is the honourable gentleman not in the wire netting business?,22
83,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,I am not.,22
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,Did not the.honourable gentleman apply for some the other day ?,22
85,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"No , I did not.",22
86,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,Did not the honourable gentleman apply for some for his son?,22
87,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"That is quite a different matter, and I suppose if my 'son .wire-netted the whole of his propertyhe would not require more than about three or four miles of netting. My honourable colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, reminds me that, notwithstanding that it might be suggested that I am indirectly interested to the extent mentioned, I did not fail to impose a duty on wire netting.",22
88,Mr REID,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,Did the honourable gentleman ever know of a manufacturer who was not struggling? I have never heard of one yet.,22
89,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"In reply to the right honourable gentleman, I can tell him that if he goes to Sydney, where we liatol free-trade so long, principally as the result of his action, and the action of some politicians who preceded him, and wishes to discover where the finest mansions are to be. seen he will find them at Potts' Point and Darling Point, and he will also find that they are not owned by manufacturers, but by importing free-traders. Those who know something of Melbourne will be aware that the people who own the largest mansions and live in the best style in this city are importers who add nothing to the wealth of the country'. They import goods at a certain rate, and, adding from 25 per cent, to 40 per cent, to their cost price, impose that as a burden on the shoulders of the people.",22
90,Mr JOHNSON,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,Do they not employ far more hands than are employed by the un- manufacturers ?,22
91,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"T h ey may do so, but' they do not greatly benefit the community if the people are called upon to bear the cost. It has been stated that a protectionist Tariff will increase prices. That contention has been refuted over and over again. When thelate Sir George Dibbs in New South Wales imposed duties on a number of articles, including soap and candles, what was the result?",22
92,Mr HUTCHISON,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,Tak e the case of salt in South Australia today.,22
93,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"The price of salt in South Australia is a case in point. What was the result in New South Wales of the operation of the Dibbs Tariff ? The importers, with their rings, were charging 6\6. to 7 j d . per lb. to the coal miners for the best class of candle. I think that the duty imposed was 3d. per lb., and within twelve months from its imposition the competition of Australian manufacturers with the importers brought the price of candles down to 4 j d . per lb.",22
94,Mr JOHNSON,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,And what sort of candles were they?,22
95,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"When the right honourable member for East Sydney assumed office, he removed the duty, with the result that the price of candles went up again automatically to over 66. per lb., though I do not think that it went so high as it had previously been. There the price has remained, because the protection afforded by the duty has been taken away.",22
96,Mr HUGHES,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,The imported candles were not shut out.,22
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,The Tariff imposed by Sir George Dibbs in New South Wales had-that effect.,22
98,Mr HUGHES,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,And increased competition ?,22
99,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,And increased competition.,22
100,Mr REID,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"Why not raise all the duties to ioo per cent., and then we should obtain everything for nothing?",23
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"I hope that the right honourable member will be fair. If we manufactured all that we required, prices, as the result of internal competition, would be lower than they are today.",23
102,Mr JOHNSON,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,Then why not make every duty prohibitive?,23
103,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,The honourable member should take his gruel kindly.,23
104,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"I do not wish to ruffle the tempers of the Opposition. We have commenced well, and I hope that the harmony of the proceedings will not be disturbed. Mr 'REID - The honourable gentleman is talking of the old protection. Will he tell us of the new?",23
105,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"I intend to do so: but surelv I am entitled to make a few prefatory remarks. There are in the Tariff a number of anomalies with which we shall deal when we reach the items to which they relate. But as one who has been a protectionist throughout his political life I do not intend to speak of protection with bated breath. I am not going to talk of a so-called protection which means no protection at all. When we have such an opportunity as now presents itself to deal with the fiscal policy I think that we should speak our minds in regard to it, and that we should frame a Tariff which will represent not a half-and-half class of protection such as we have had, but genuine sturdy protection. That is the object I have in view, and I shall do all that I can to secure a Tariff that will afford protection to our industries. I do not intend to favour a mere revenue Tariff, and I trust that those who have been returned to this House as protectionists will not be satisfied with such a Tariff. Let them now declare themselves; let them say at once that they are either protectionists or free traders, and not be prepared as protectionists to drag clown the scale of duties to a point at which we should have a mere revenue Tariff which is only incidentally protective. I do not wish our young and true Australians to remain as in the past in the employ of importers and indent agents with their feet under the legs of the foreigner's table. T wish to see our young men and pur young women in a position to earn their own livings, and to see the number, of our unemployed largely reduced. The woman who, having a family of boys and girls, is prepared to let them - cling to the money of the importers rather than to make an effort to increase the field of labour in Australia is not a true mother, and the man or woman who is prepared to rest content under the old order of things is not a true Australian.",23
106,Mr JOHNSON,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,Le t us have done with these mock heroics.,23
107,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,I am not indulging in mock heroics.,23
108,Mr REID,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,Wor k them up ! They are very cold !,23
109,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"In this House as well as in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales I have often seen the right honourable member at the pump and trying to Work up a fury. I never attempt anything of the k in d ; all that I endeavour to do is to put the clear, bare facts before the "" £House.' . said just now, in reply to JC l o u s e 1 ' honourable member for North Sydney, tnat 1 should place before honourable members a comparison of the present Commonwealth Tariff with the old one, as well as with those of other countries. Under the heading of "" Total Imports, excluding coin and bullion,"" I find that the percentages of Customs duty collected to values of goods imported into the Commonwealth, Victoria, and other countries, was as follows: - The old Eederal Tariff, 1906, 17.15; the new Tariff, 2 1 ; Victorian Tariff, 12.6; Canadian Tariff, 16.25; New Zealand Tariff, 18.55; and the United States Tariff of 1904-5, 23.12. Mr KING O'MALLEY - That is a Christian Tariff.",23
110,Mr REID,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,That is what the Trusts say.,23
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,"Takin g the percentages of Customs duty collected to . value of dutiable goods only, including narcotics and stimulants, the averages are as follows: - Commonwealth o l d ' Tariff, 1906, 27.02; Commonwealth new Tariff, 1906-7-includin g values of goods dutiableonly when the produce or manufacture of countries other than the United Kingdom-2 6 per cent.; and, excluding values of goods dutiable only when the produceor manufactureof countries other than the United Kingdom, 27.2 percent. Thenagain,, the percentage of Customs duty collected to values of dutiable goods only, excluding narcotics and stimulants, is : Commonwealth - old Tariff, 16.92; Commonwealth new Tariff, 17 and 17.6.",23
112,Mr REID,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,That is only a decimal d if ference.,23
113,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,That is so.,24
114,Mr REID,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,Why indulge in heroics over a decimal ? Sir' WILLIAM LYNE - The position is different when we deal with these figures in a different way.,24
115,Mr CHANTER,MEDICALINSPECTION OF,It is the re-arrangement that tells.,24

119,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Not exclusively.,24
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Has the honourable gentleman any figures showing the average ad valorem incidence over the whole range of duties?,24
121,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I have not, but I daresay I shall be able'to get the information. . Quite a different result is arrived at if one takes only the principal protected items. So far as I can gather, the average rate of duty under the old Tariff was 19.5 per cent., and in the present Tariff is 30.8 per cent., on the protected items in the foreign or general list, showing an increase of over 10 per cent, in the average. I desire honourable members to understand that I have given these figures to show what the total amount of taxation comes to, and to prove that this is a protective Tariff, whilst the other was not.",24
122,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It is sometimes said that we are placing a great load on the whole community, but, taking the Tariff as a whole, we find that that is not so.",24
123,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"And yet, under the new Tariff, the Government expect an increase in revenue amounting to ,£1,000,000.",24

127,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I can give it. Imports valued at £5,000,000 are on the free list in this Tariff, as against a value of ,£12,000,000 under the old Tariff.",24
128,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Then why does the honourable member ask me for it? At any rate, I daresay the information could be obtained. I have had rather a difficult task in working out all these particulars, and have been well assisted by my colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, and his officers.",24
129,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Did the honourable gentleman work them out himself?,24
130,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"No , but I did work out some of them, and had them corrected. In answer to the honourable member for North Syclpey, I wish to say that I sent an officer to Prahran, one of the principal suburbs of Melbourne; to ascertain from some of the principal stores and shops the prices before and after the Tariff. took this action in order to provide an answer to those who say that people who deal with reputable houses are being fleeced. If people are being made to pay more, the list that I am about to read is a very great stigma on the smaller shopkeepers. or five reputable houses in Prahran were selected. I think that honourable members will agree that that is a suburb from which a very fair, estimate of prices can be obtained. I asked the officer to obtain so far as he could those articles which are used in the ordinary home.",24
131,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Did they know that he was a Federal officer?,25
132,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"- I do not think so. I hold in my hand the result of his inquiries, given to me this morning. have heard a great many people say that the price of washing blue has been very greatly increased. The facts given here are that the price of laundry blue before the Tariff was 7d. per lb., and the price since the.Tariff is 7d. per lb. crease is nil, and there is an increased duty of i d . per lb.",25
133,Mr LIDDELL,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,What about gloves ?,25

Candles, Electrine, price before the Tariff, 6£d., price since the Tariff, 7d. The increase is Jd. per lb. That is the increase in the duty, and no more. A good many people have told me that there has been an immense increase in the price of candles. If that is so, it must have been charged by the smaller distributing shopkeepers. Liquorice in sticks, price before the Tariff, i j d . an ounce; since the Tariff, i j d . an ounce. The increase of duty is i j d . per lb., and yet there has been no increase in the price. case of currants, which, are to be found in nearly every small home, the price before the Tariff was 6 j d . per lb., and the price since is 7d. The'increase in price is Jd., and the increase of duty is i d . Der lb. There has been no undue increase in price in that case.",25
135,Mr WILKS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,""" Prahran is a' specially cheap suburb. The honourable gentleman is quoting from a street where special cut lines are offered. I Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I could have taken any other suburb. I think that in taking Prahran I may be considered to have acted fairly. It would not have mattered to me what suburb was taken. Four Mr TUDOR - It is a very fair suburb. A better one could not be chosen for the purpose. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - In the case of dates, the price before the Tariff was 3 j d . per Ib., and after the Tariff 4d., or an increase of Jd. The increase of duty is i d . per lb., and, therefore, only half the extra dutyhas been put on to the price ",25

I Sir WILLIAM LYNE - The price of barley (grain) before the Tariff was 2d. a lb., and since the Tariff 2d., increase nil. The increased duty, I think, is 6d. per central. I come now to an item where there has been an increase-straw . It was previously The in- is. to 2S. 3d. per bundle, and since the Tariff it is from is. .3d. to 2s. 6d. per bundle.",25

138,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It is said-and I want these I think honourable members will agree-that the increase is not due to the Tariff, but to a season when the same quantity of hay is not being produced as before.",25
139,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,How much of that article is used ?,25
140,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I admit that the consumption is not very heavy.,25
141,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,How much straw is imported ?,25
142,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Not much; but I am giving fairly the figures that have been handed to me in. reply to the question which I asked the officer when I sent him out. In the Mr T OSEPH COOK - How much straw do people eat?,25
143,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Honourable members opposite may interject as much as they like, but they will not do away with the effect of what I am reading to the public. What I am doing now is to let the public know where they are being fleeced in order that they may be able, as far as possible, to stop their grocers from fleecing them.",25
144,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Many of those people advertised that they did not intend to raise .Prices until they had paid the extra duties. They will charge extra prices as soon as they begin to pay the extra duties.,26
145,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I am taking what they are doing now. They may do a lot of things by-and-by.,26
146,The CHAIRMAN,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I must ask honourable members to cease these continuous interjections.,26
147,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"They are all good-natured, Mr Chairman, and so long as they are made in that spirit I do not mind them. Dried herbs were i d . a packet before the Tariff, and are r d . a packet now. The increase of duty is 4d. a lb. In the case of honey and jams, which are very largely used, there has been no increase, although the extra duty is \ d . per lb. I am one of those who think that honey and jam should be produced here in much larger quantities, and very little imported. In the case of safety matches, the price was 2d. a packet before the Tariff, and is 3^d. now, or an increase of i j d . a packet. The increase of duty is is. per gross of boxes, and upwards. that I have not got quotations for matches other than safety matches, 'because I understand that in some places persons are charged i d . a box extra compared with what they were charged before the Tariff.

149,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Yes , for wax matches. If the honourable member purchases a box of matches across the street he will be charged a penny for it . Before the Tariff was submitted the price of condensed milk, Nestles' sweetened, was 6\d. per t in ; its price now is i \ d . a tin, an increase of a penny per tin. There has been no increase in the price of the colonial article, notwithstand.ing that a duty of i £ d . per Ib. has been imposed upon the imported article.",26

Upon pickles there has been an increase in the duty of i j d . per dozen bottles, but there has been no increase in the price of that article.",26
153,Mr HUGHES,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I think that the Treasurer is wrong there.,26
154,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The officer who made these inquiries has assured me that I can rely upon this list. The price of soap before the introduction of the Tariff was 8d. per bar; it is now selling at 9d. per bar, an increase of a penny per bar. The new rate is 25 per cent., and the old rate was i d . per lb. Before the Tariff was submitted the price of starch ranged from 4d.. to per lb. : it is now selling, at from 4 j d . to 56. per lb., an increase of Jd. per lb.",26

156,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"H as the honourable member himself had any' experience of ""Foster Mothers""? We shall come to that item in due course. Before the Tariff was submitted the price of sago was 3 j d . per lb. : its present price is 3 d . per L I am sorry lb. The new duty upon that commodity is Jd. per lb., the old duty was 4s. per central. Prior to the introduction of the Tariff, tapioca was selling for 3^d. per lb., and it. is now being sold at the same figure. Cocoa was realizing 3^d. per packet before the Tariff was introduced, and since its introduction it is selling at 4d. per packet.",26

158,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The increased duty is i£d. per packet under the general Tariff, and i d . under the British preference proposals. Chocolate' was selling at 4d. and 5d. per cake before the Tariff was introduced, and it is being sold at the same price now. The duty upon it is 3$d. per lb. under the general Tariff, and 3^d. per lb. under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. Coffee, roasted, was selling at from is. to is. 9d. per lb. before the Tariff the Treawas introduced, and its price has not been losing increased. The duty is i d . per lb. The price of corn flour before the Tariff was submitted was 7 j d . per packet, and since then it has been sold at 8 d . per packet; L an increase of i d . per packet. Before the Tariff was introduced' curry powder was selling at i j d . per oz., and there has been no aiteration in the price since.

168,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I cannot tell the honourable member. I have merely given the information in my possession, and I contend that it supplies an answer to a' good many of the statements which have been made regarding increases in the prices of goods. I may tell honourable members that, in 1901, I obtained a more extended list than that from which I have quoted of the prices of commodities a week before and a week after the introduction of the Kingston Tariff. I obtained still another list six months later. What did I find ? A week after the Tariff had been submitted the distributors, taking advantage of their position, had increased the prices of their goods, in'some cases, very materially. But in all instances in which the Tariff operated, as an incentive to production, the prices of. those goods six months later were less than those charged a week prior to that Tariff being introduced.",27
169,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The Federal Tariff was lower than the""Victorian Tariff had been for twenty years, so that the Treasurer's statement is an argument in favour of a lower Tariff.",27
170,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I am speaking generally of the goods affected by the Tariff.,27
171,Mr HUGHES,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Nearl y all the articles which the Treasurer has enumerated are made in Victoria. Sir WILLIAM LYNE' - I hope that we shall also produce them in New South Wales. „,27
172,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Many of them are already made there.,27
173,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Upon articles, such as fruits and jams, I do not care how high the duties may be, because I maintain that we ought to produce them here. When I say that upon articles which we desire to protect the new Tariff is about 10 or 11 per cent, higher than the 1901-2 Tariff, I am speaking of commodities which It we can'manufacture and produce in Australia. The result will be a great impetus to the production and manufacture of these goods, which we should have made long ago. I come now to the question upon which I propose to make an important be statement. When we introduced the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Bill some persons were of opinion that the Government were going to cause manufacturers a great deal of trouble, even if we did not ruin them.",27
174,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,That Act has not been put into operation yet.,27
175,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It is being put into operation now. I do not intend to read a letter that I have in my possession which is to the effect that, in connection with that Act, a large firm has been called upon to produce its books, and has declined to do so. Provision will be made in the Bill to which the Prime Minister referred today-it is only a short measure - to prevent manufacturers withholding their books, and authority will be given to examine those books anywhere. The Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, which was passed last year, dealt only with a limited number of subjects. That measure represented the commencement of legislation upon the lines of what is known as the new protection. . It is only by experience that we find out the weak points in legislation. I admit that the I had hoped that it would. Act itself has not worked out Article. Blue, laundry Candles, Electrine.. - 6id. lb. Liquorice in sticks ... Currants ...

176,Mr HUTCHISON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The Government must know as much about agricultural implements as they know about spirits under the Excise Act.,28
177,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Quite so. thought when I first caught the honourable member's interjection that he meant that I did not know much about agricultural implements and other things. If he were to spend a couple of days in going through the details regarding the tobacco duties he would hardly know whether he was on his head or on his .heels. It is a most difficult matter.

178,Mr TUDOR,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I hope the Government have amended their proposals in regard to the tobacco duties.,28
179,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"We have not amended them yet, but they, will be amended. The proposals which the Government intend to submit, and which I hope constitute a considerable improvement upon the existing state of things, I intend to explain to the Committee presently. But before I do that I wish to emphasize I the fact. that, had the Excise Act which was passed in connection with harvester machinery last year worked out properly, it would not have been injurious to the general public, but would have conduced to the well-being of all. No one would have been ruined or injured by it, but a' standard wage to the employees would have been kept up. When we are proposing a Tariff which is intended to protect manufacturers, to give increased employment to our people, and to strengthen and build up the Australian sentiment, we must not forget the motive power of all our industries, viz., the working man.",28
180,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,We on this side of the Chamber have always said that. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I do not know that. I must have been very deaf or very dull not to have heard from honourable members opposite such proposals as the Government are now going to submit.,29
181,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,For the last forty years those who hold such principles as we do have said that the interests of the workers ought to be considered.,29
182,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I will undertake to say that if it had not been for the appearance in this Parliament of men who are especially representative of the working classes, we should not have heard very much about it",29
183,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Hear , hear.",29
184,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"F r o m the other side. The right honourable the leader of the Opposition wishes to make a little joke at my expense, but I think that the Acts which I have been' instrumental in passing, not only in the Commonwealth Parliament, but in the State from which I come, have always been in the direction of helping the labouring people. When the right honourable member had an opportunity he did not pass the Acts which I passed afterwards. So that he cannot cast upon, me any slur regarding my not having dealt with this question earlier.",29
185,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The honourable gentleman never thought of it before.,29
186,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"' - D id I not? Probably the honourable member has not heard of a great many Acts that I was instrumental in passing in New South Wales, but it is true that I was responsible for them all the same.",29
187,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,It is years since the honourable gentleman said that he would not go in for direct taxation in New South Wales.,29
188,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I would go in for it today if it were necessary. If we .are going to have protection for the manufacturers and protection for the producers, we must have a system of protection for the labouring classes. As I have pointed out, it has been very difficult to institute a system of that 'kind which shall not be too cumbersome. We have aimed, in the proposals I am about to submit, at devising a .system which will be effective; and which, at the same time is the least cumbersome system we have been able to discover. The method by which it is. proposed to secure that manufacturers whose manufactures are protected by the new Tariff, shall only enjoy that advantage on condition that they pay a fair rate of wages, is, in outline, as f o l l o w s : - (i ) An Excise duty at the rate of half the duty imposed by the Tariff on imported goods of the same class, to be imposed on all goods manufactured in Australia. (2) An exemption to be made as to all goods which are manufactured under conditions .as to .remuneration of labour which are fair alnd reasonable. As this scheme involves the imposition of taxation, it can be more conveniently carried out by two Acts, one simply imposing the duties and giving, effect to .the exemptions, and the other providing the necessary machinery. This course is rendered necessary by section 5.5 of the Constitution, which provides thatLaws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with anv other matter shall be of no effect.",29
189,Mr DUGALD,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,THOMSON - Does that applv to the manufacturers only?,29
190,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Yes . Obviously the chief difficulty in this scheme is to determine what are fair conditions as to remuneration of labour. Some general. standard of fairness is ""required. It is proposed to adopt, with certain alterations, that standard which now enables a manufacturer to have the Commonwealth trade mark applied to his goods. Thus goods to which the Commonwealth trade mark is applied will be exempt from the new Excise duties.",29
191,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I think I have heard something about that Commonwealth trade mark before !,29
192,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"If I can pick up suggestions anywhere which are useful not many for our purpose, I make use of them. Goods which do not bear the Commonwealth mark will be subject to the duty.. Honourable members no .doubt have seen the Commonwealth stamp or trade mark. It is made in various sizes, and we can make it ini any size, alccording to what may be convenient to the individual using it .",29
193,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Has the honourable gentleman a copy of it?,29
194,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Yes ; I will hand a copy to the right honourable member.,29
195,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"In other words, the union labelis to be - the certificate of exemption. .",29
196,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Not the union label, the Commonwealth trade mark.",30
197,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,It is the same thing.,30
198,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The use of the Commonwealth trade mark will certify that conditions are right and proper. At the present time the Commonwealth trade mark can be applied only with the authority of the Minister, to goods which have been manufactured under conditions as to remuneration of labour which either have been declared to be fair, and reasonable by resolutions of both Houses of the Parliament, or are in accordance with the award of a Commonwealth or State industrial tribunal or of a Wages Board, or are in accordance with an industrial agreement. So that at the present time, apart from the resolutions of both Houses, a manufacturer can obtain the right to use the Commonwealth trade mark only if he is working under an industrial award or agreement. It is proposed to bring into existence a new tribunal to be called the Board of Excise.",30
199,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,A new lot of billets!,30
200,Mr WILKS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Of how many membeis will the Board consist?,30
201,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The special duty of the Board will be to inquire, on the application of manufacturers, into the conditions of remuneration in any protected industry, and to declare, if they so find, that these conditions are fair and reasonable. Upon such a declaration being made, the manufacturer will become entitled to have the Commonwealth trade mark applied to his goods, and will thus become exempt from Excise. Mr KING OMALLEY ! - Will the manufacturers pay the expense of the Board?",30
202,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,That is a good idea.,30
203,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The Government will pay for the Board. Mr .DUGALD THOMSON - Will Board deal with cases in which a Wages' Board has given a decision?,30
204,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I shall presently come to that. The Board, to describe it shortly, will consist of three members, appointed by the Governor General, the chairman to be a barrister or solicitor.",30
205,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I would rule that out. It would be ridiculous to put such a man on such a Board, which will have to deal, not with, legal questions, but with industrial conditions.",30
206,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It is, of course, for honourable members to determine these things, but a legal gentleman is suggested as chairman of the Board because it will be necessary to have some one in that position who can analyze evidence, and who will know how to deal with witnesses.",30
207,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,A smart expert would do the work better than any lawyer could do it.,30
208,Mr WEBSTER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I am very glad to hear that expression of opinion.,30
209,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I am not wedded to the proposal; but the arrangement seems fo me to be the best that could be made in the first instance. The Board is tp have power to appoint two assessors to advise it, one of them to be nominated by the applicant and the other by the employees, or in default, or if both parties consent, both or either may be appointed without nomination.",30
210,Mr WPLKS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,=Are there to be fresh assessors for each case? .,30
211,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The Board will have power to appoint assessors when necessary. For instance, it may wish the assistance of assessors in analyzing the conditions of some particular trade.",30
212,Mr WILKS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The assistance of persons with special trained knowledge? ,30
213,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The assistance of experts.,30
214,Mr WILKS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The only permanentmember of the Board will be the chairman ?,30
215,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"There will be three permanent members, and if the Board requires expert assistance it will be entitled to it.",30
216,Mr WILKS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,So the Board may consist of five persons ?,30
217,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"All these are matters of detail, and I am giving merely an outline of what is proposed. The powers of the Board would be exercisable by one or more members. The Board is to have power to refer anv question to a State industrial authority, which means an the Industrial Arbitration Court or Wages Board, or to a police or stipendiary or special magistrate, who will have power ro call in assessors representing eacli side. This authority will report to the Board, and the Board may act on its report. The reason for this - provision is that cases for investigation may arise in small country towns, to reach which the Board might have to spend a great deal of time in travelling, and it is proposed that if there is a suitable person, such as a police magistrate, he may be given the work of gathering evidence, with the assistance of two experts. That evidence will be sent to the Board to be dealt with, and if it is not considered satisfactory, the Board may cancel it , and take evidence itself. The Board will have power to enter and to inspect factories, to summon witnesses, to take evidence on oath, and to require the production of books, and witnesses giving evidence before it will be adequately protected.",30
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,It wil l have power to bail up people generally.,31
219,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Experienc e has shown that provisions of this kind are needed. The provision in the Customs Act has proved a wise one. cases which have been dealt with under that Act could not have been successfully dealt with had it not been for the provision inserted by the honourable member for Adelaide, under which inspections may be made.",31
220,Mr FISHER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The scheme would be waste paper without such a power.,31
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Yes . Shortly stated, our proposal is this: All goods bearing the Commonwealth trade mark will be exempt from, and all goods not bearing it will be subject to, Excise duty. intended that a list of the principal manufacturers shall be submitted for the Board's consideration, the list to be amended at any time ",31
222,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Will deal with prices ?,31
223,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Yes .,31
224,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The honourable member has not yet said so.,31
225,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I am coming to that. The Excise duty will be levied in this way : If a Commonwealth trade mark is not placed on manufactures, the manufacturer will have to purchase from the Government an Excise stamp equivalent to one-half the duty, which he must pav for not complying with conditions, compliance with which would exempt him from the payment of Excise.",31
226,Mr TUDOR,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Will he have to affix the Excise stamp to his goods?,31
227,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I am not quite sure.,31
228,Mr TUDOR,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,It would be a good thing to comDel him to do.,31
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I am not prepared to say that provision has not already been made for that, because provisions for the carrying out of some, if not all, of our proposals are alreadv in draft. All goods manufactured under conditions which accord with a State or Commonwealth industrial award, or agreement, or have been declared to be fair and reasonable by the Board of Excise, will be entitled to have the Commonwealth trade mark applied to them. This arrangement will, of course, involve the amendment of part VIII . of the Trade Marks Act of 1905. It is necessary, however, to go further to. insure that fair and reasonable conditions of remuneration are being continuously observed, and that, if not, Excise duty is being paid by the purchase of Excise stamps; and it is therefore proposed to require the registration of all factories, which are to be deMany of, the fined as places in which four or more persons, other than members of an employer's family, are being-employed.",31
230,Mr WILKS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,It would be almost easier for the Government to run the factories.,31
231,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Migh t there not be evasions of the provision as to the number of employees ?,31
232,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I do not think that they can do that. The principle is that where there are only one or two persons working it may not be necessary to have a registration and an inspection. It is Mr KING OMALLEY - All ought to be „ under it.,31
233,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"When we come to that point honourable members will have an opportunity to deal with it . the Board Mr DUGAL DTHOMSON - Will it apply to all factories, or to only those which are affected by a protective duty?",31
234,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It will applyto the latter. We could not make it apply to cases where no protective duties are imposed, because we could not enforce the penalty. The second proposal is to give to officers of Customs and Excise full power of inspection of all factories and access to books, documents, wage-sheets, & c , although, of course, no publicity will be given to confidential information.",31
235,Mr WEBSTER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Will the decision of the Board be final?,31
236,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I shall'come to that presently.,31
237,Mr WEBSTER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I hope that there will be no Appeal Court.,31
238,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Thes e proposals are intended to protect the workers in protected industries. But with a view of protecting the consumer from extortion it is proposed to invest the Board of Excise with further powers. The Board may possibly become an Inter-State Commission. The reason why I do not propose the creation of an Inter-State Commission now is because the Government want this policy to be brought into force soon, and it might take a considerable time to pass an Inter-State Commission Bill . I have made two efforts in that direction, and I believe that the time has arrived when the House will pass a measure. If the Board is composed of suitable men they can be appointed as an Inter-State Commission.",31
239,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Le t us get put through first.,32
240,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I believe that I shall receive strong assistance from the honourable member in passing a protectionist Tariff.,32
241,Mr FAIRBAIRN,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Quite right.,32
242,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I am very pleased to hear that statement. Before conferring on the Board of Excise the functions especially associated with the Inter-State Commission, it is proposed to entrust it with the duty of inquiring into and reporting to Parliament on the general conditions surrounding production and trade, ancl particularly on prices or combinations to raise prices. If , on inquiry, the Board find that prices are unduly high, or that combinations to raise prices in protected trades exist, they will have power to recommend to Parliament that the duty shall be lowered or abolished.",32
243,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Is that a modification of the Australian Industries Preservation Act?,32
244,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,No . I hope I shall be allowed to mention that the amendment of that Act to which the Prime Minister has referred today will give power to the Government to make a direct inspection of books and papers and to elicit all information without resorting to the present roundabout way and attempting to prove certain almost impossible things.,32
245,Mr WILKS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Is not the sole object of the Bill to enable the Government to obtain information?,32
246,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The Bill which will be originated in the Senate tomorrow, will do away with the trouble in connection with getting information. That is an outline of the proposals which, as I stated af the commencement of my speech, will necessitate the amendment of two""Acts of Parliament. I think that when honourable members thoroughly understand the scheme they will see that it is no.makebelieve, that it will have the effect which I believe is desired by nearly all the members of the Committee, and by the peoole of this community, and that is tO'See that whilst we give protection to the manufacturers and increase their production, the workers will not be left out in the cold, but will get their share of that protection. Before I resume my seat, I desire to quote a few figures with reference to the Customs and Excise revenue collected in each State during September of .this year and the Tariff last year, and also during the quarter ending 30th September in those years. In New South Wales, the revenue has increased for the month from £ 2 8 1 , 3 1 4 to £ 3 7 7 , 1 8 4 ; and for the quarter from ,£964,674 to ,£1,215,982. In Victoria, the revenue has increased for the month from .£211,211 to £ 2 8 8 , g ^ i , and for the quarterfrom ,£885,802 to ,£1,024,177. In Queensland, the revenue has increased for the month from £ 7 7 , 7 2 7 to £ 8 5 , 8 0 0 . and for the quarter from ,£262,430 to ,£285,468. In South Australia the "" revenue Has increased for the month from ,£47,847 to £ 8 0 , 6 9 6 , and for the quarter from ,£178,852 to .£236,522. In Western Australia the revenue has decreased for the month from .£61,957 to £ 5 8 , 6 3 7 , and for the quarter from .£219,800 to .£202,803. In Tasmania the revenue has increased for the month from .£18,929 to .£21,023, and for the quarter from ,£52,610 to .£5.7,768. The total increase for the month has been from £ 6 9 8 , 9 8 5 to ,£892,287, and for the quarter from £^2,564,168 to .£3,022,720.

247,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"East Sydney) [4.40] - The figures that the Treasurer has just given are, I think, a very much more important fact in connection with the Tariff than are price lists from one or two shops in Prahran. According to the lists - from one or two shops ""there, the effect of the Tariff is scarcely worthy of any serious consideration. According to the figures which the Treasurer has just given, there was for the one month of September, an increase, as compared with September of last year, in four States only, of ,£250,000, or at the rate of 000,000 on the twelve months. I am, of course, giving the round figures, and not the exact amounts. But the position as disclosed by the Minister's own figures is astonishing.

In Queensland the increase was slight, being only at the rate of £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year, but in South Australia, which has generally been rather slow in its figures, the increase was at the rate of ,£400,000 a year.",32
248,Mr WH IRVINE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Will orable member take the figures for the three months?,33
249,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I have not worked those figures out.,33
250,Mr WH IRVINE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The increase was ,£458,000 for the three months, or a.t the rate of £1,832,000*-nearl y £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 for the year.",33
251,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"As I had to immediatelv follow the Treasurer, I had not time to make both calculations, and I selected the figures for the month as being the more significant, seeing that they represent a period when the rush, which took place in consequence of the Tariff, was practically over. There are no speculative imports now. As we know, the bonded warehouses' are gorged with goods which would have come into the ordinary markets of commerce, but for the fact that merchants are hanging on to the bonded stocks until they know what the Tariff is to be. If reductions in the duties are made, importers do not get the benefit of those reductions, once the goods are out of bond. ordinary commerce is paralyzed except in so far as the absolute necessities of the people of Australia are concerned, the figures show the enormous burden not in theory-no t in argument of a fiscal character-bu t the enormous burden which is reand no practice! presented by 3,000,000 sovereigns a yeartaken out of the pockets of the people in the four States of New South Wales, Vicparties; toria, Queensland, and. South Australia. I do not desire to enter at any length into this fiscal question. The Treasurer, think, perfectly justified in taking this portunity to deliver the address to which have just listened; but, as I say, I shall take up the time of the Committee at any length, even on such vastly important subuntil jects, because I feel the pressing necessity to get to the practicalwork which is before us. I hope that my friends will allow me, so far as they consistently can, to represent the general views held on this side, in the hope that we may, as soon as possible, get In New South to the vital, practical matter which concerns the business of the whole community. But I , naturally, must make one or two observations, not so much on the old protection as on the new protection. The Treasurer is a living example of the old protection. He has lived politically on the old protection all his life, just as I might be fairly be said, in retort, to have lived on free. trade all my life.",33
252,Mr WEBSTER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,But the right honourable l the right hon- member died on it !,33
253,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I do not wish to use the expression in any offensive way. But the old protection has been the Treasurer's gospel, though he has not, perhaps, been able to understand it-ther e is no theory or inspiration in his case-as clearly as might some profound political economists. The honourable gentleman, However, has for many years been an earnest, whole-souled advocate of a protectionist policy. But, in the midst of all his enthusiasm and earnestness, this scheme of new protection never seems to have dawned on him. Has the honourable gentleman submitted this scheme to his friends in the Chamber - of Manufacturers? The members of that chamber have glowed over "" smoke night "" delights, which surrounded the honourable gentleman with a halo of things very much more substantial than smoke; but all those delights will disappear when the new protection is accomplished. The old protection always professed to regard the interests of the great mass of the workers Although in the factories; and it was on the faith of regard to those interests that .the people of Australia, and of other countries, adopted protection as a national policy.",33
254,Mr HUTCHISON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It was all profession,",33
255,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"That was so. Of course, I have heard of such things in all political the policy of every political party has its drawbacks, and is .open to the same reproach. But there is the remarkable cirwas. I cumstance about protection that, although opit is one of the oldest, best discussed, and we best fought issues of politics in countries not which have a high, state of civilization,' this sort of new protection never seems, now, to have been advocated, by any responsible Government. It would be a miracle in the Treasurer, but that we know miracles do not often occur in politics, and that he is fulfilling his vocation. honourable gentleman is the mouthpiece of his masters. This is not his scheme; if he were in an incubator for 100 years, he could never hatch it. This scheme has no more to do with the Treasurer of today, than it has to do with him as we knew him many years ago.",33
256,Mr HUTCHISON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,What if ' it good scheme?,34

I quite admit that; but before we begin to. discuss these matters we have to take our bearings - little. The plain English is that this scheme has been handed to the Treasurer by our friends in the Labour Party, he has accepted it-h e had to accept it . What chance had the Treasurer of putting this' Tariff through unless he made terms with his masters? I clo not say it is a wrong bargain; that is a matter for judgment afterwards. I am not pronouncing a fina l opinion; it would be presumptuous on my part to do so. I am simply taking the first impression which comes to one after the remarkable statement just made. I cannot help regarding this scheme as, I shall not say dictation, but as a bargain between the Government and the honourable members of the Labour Party, which put into words, means"" You pass this scheme, and we will stand by you in this great Tariff fight.""",34

262,Mr HUTCHISON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I am afraid that some honourable members would not stand by such a bargain. - Mr Reid - I am delighted to hear that, because I hope that the members of the Labour 'Party will act now as they 'did in the case of the former Tariff, when on many critical occasions they showed perfect independence of any governmental influence.",34
263,Mr BATCHELOR,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"If they do, will the right honourable gentleman withdraw his charge that a bargain has been made? The Mr Reid - I will, if it is proved that my remarks have been unfair. I hope I shall be ready to withdraw any observations which may seem to be unfair, but I have been long enough in politics to know that whether honourable members call it a bargain or not this proposal went on from the Caucus to the Minister, and that he has be a adopted it because the Caucus approves of it. That is a fair way of putting it . the Mr WATSON - The right honourable Everygentleman must be aware that our scheme was published in the press before the Min",34
264,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"That is just what I am saying. In every word the Minister said I a .could not help recognising an edition, though, perhaps, an awkward one, of the scheme of the Labour Party as I saw it and announced in the newspapers.",34
265,Mr HUTCHISON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"But the Ministry were at liberty to take it up or let it . alone, as This is the bargain. they pleased.",34
266,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The Treasurer knows a good thing when he sees it.,34
267,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The Treasurer does know a good thing when he sees it . He knows that the good thing is the Labour Party, and he seizes it every time; and I say more power to him, so long as its influence is properly exercised, and its effect is for the public good. I wish, before I deal with the new protection, to refer in a very few words to the honourable gentleman's observations on the fiscal question. He said .he would put. the duties up as high as he could, in order to compel the manufacture locally of things which we can make in Australia - That expression is a dangerous one, coming from a responsible Minister. We can do anything in Australia if we choose to make a sufficient sacrifice in order to do it. Tropical plants could be grown in the arctic regions if people went to the expense of hot-houses. We can breed anything, and we can produce anything in Australia if we go to the necessary expense. But it is dangerous for a responsible Minister to speak in that unguarded, loose way. Let us take the case of the United States, with their high Tariff walls, behind which the Trusts of America have thriven' so greatly.",34

271,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"My honourable friend will agree with me that the Trusts and"" Combines of other countries of the world are as children compared to the gigantic octopus which is draining the life's blood of the mighty people of the United States today, and which would be impossible without high Tariff walls.",35
272,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The Beef Trust and theStandard Oil Trust have had no Tariff assistance.,35

274,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"That may be so, but they have had no Tariff assistance.",35
275,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I did not propose to discuss the fiscal question at length, but merely to give the Committee some figures. I wish to point out that it is a policy of recklessness, which looks only at one object as the supreme end of statesmanship,, and only at one set of industries as the industries to be regarded by Parliament. When I hear the term ""industry,"" I do not limit its range. I regard every industry of even the remotest districts of this mighty continent as just as much entitled to be studied and considered as the manufacturing industries of the great cities. one of the embarrassments of the situation that everythinc we give must come out of some pocket before we can give it, and though we may have a patriotic object in making gifts to particular industries, we should not forget that we are taking the gifts we bestow upon those industries, most of which are carried on in the large cities of the continent, from the masses of struggling men in the country districts of Australia.",35
276,Mr WEBSTER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,And return them with interest afterwards.,35
277,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"i l t is the sort of return interest afterwards which does not occur with the regularity of a money-lending ration. I wish to impress upon the Commitfirst. tee that in the mighty United States, with their gigantic system of protection, the dinary laws of commerce rise superior to these obstacles. From the last figures which I was able to obtain, I find that exports of the United States amount - to my political career. 1,743 million dollars. We might the imports into these great States to be Tariff. merely nominal, as compared with the volume of exports to - which I have referred, but in spite of the enormous Tariff in the United States there are imports to that country of no less thaii 1,226 million dollars. These imports find their way into the United States in spite of the enormous Tariff barriers which have been set up so rigidly for so many years.",35
278,Mr HUTCHISON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,That only gives an idea of what they might have been but for the Tariff barriers.,35
279,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"But how do we stand if we compare the imports and exports of the Commonwealth, where the policy of protection and isolation has not been carried out to such an extent as in the United States? I find that under the old Tariff, which many protectionists look upon as a revenue Tariff, comparing our imports and exports with those of the United States, the proportion pf imports to exports in the United States, with their terrific Customs duties, is 6 per cent, higher than the proportion of imports to exports in Australia. So honourable members should'not be led away, and I do not think they will be, by these rash generalizations of the Minister. In spite of all our Tariffs and all our laws, the currents of commerce will continue to flow in two different directions. To attempt to make the mighty current of human energy and enterprise as embodied in commerce follow one direction is futile. We It is know that the law of every orb in the mighty skies as well as the law of energy is to travel, not in a straight line, but in a circle. Just as we have these vast orbs .revolving in circles, so commerce revolves in ciroles. It cannot be run as we run railway engines-alon g a straight line of rails. In their earnest desire to advocate what they consider to be a national and patriotic policy, honourable members should not forget that in this mighty system of commerce, whilst the blood circulates outwards, it must come back again. I wish now to leave these references to protection and to come to - a of matter with which we - are much more concerned. I made my position in connection opewith this Tariff perfectly clear from the I said that I had been sent here by a constituency that believes in free-trade orand - a revenue Tariff. I propose to do my all duty honestly and Iovally to'that constituency, and in accordance with the views the I have enunciated during the whole of I know that honorexpect able members who have been returned by constituencies sharing those views, will shipv equal, if not greater zeal and devotion in the matter, but I am also satisfied that we shall be guided by reason and political common sense. If we find we are in a hopeless minority upon some leading lines, and that it is impossible for us to impress our views upon the Committee-as indeed it might be if honourable members regarded their election pledges- I have no doubt that my honourable friends will not incessantlv press the question of free-trade and protection on every line of the Tariff.",35
280,Mr BATCHELOR,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I hope not.,36
281,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It would be ridiculous to do so. It would do us no credit, and would do no good. I feel sure that, whilst strenuously endeavouring to carry out our views, we shall, throughout, assist those who have more moderate views than Ministers in making the duties proposed less extravagant than we think them to be. Leaving that matter now to come to the scheme of the new protection, I wish to say again that, in my opinion, this policy is infinitely sounder 'than the old protection. have altogether disapproved of the policy of protection, and if the Opposition liad suggested any such theories as those now submitted to us, what would have been the position? We have pointed out over and over again where protection fail s ; that, instead of giving Australian labour its legitimate share of the benefits of its exactions from the great mass of the community, that share generally goes in other directions. I cannot claim any credit for originating any scheme of this sort, but what I do say is that, if we, the free-traders, had at any time until the last year or two proposed such a scheme, we should have been branded as men who, under the guise of being interested in the welfare of the working classes, were endeavouring to destroy the policy of protection. This policy of the new protection, however, has come from a quarter which is not exposed to that suspicion. So far as I can see, the credit for the idea is one to which the Labour Party is legitimately entitled. I do not know of any person not associated with them who has that now? brought it prominently forward. object, I think, is a thoroughly sound one.",36

285,Mr HUGHES,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The right honourable member should allow himself the luxury of going on his own for a minute or two.,36
286,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I endeavour to emulate the forbearance which my honourable friends of the Labour Party sometimes show towards one another. I give the Labour Parties of Australia the credit of this movement, if it be a good one. Its object is certainly a good one. What has evolved this new protectionist policy? What has led tens of thousands who have no expectation of direct benefit from this taxation to adopt such a policy at the risk of losing by it? It has been, first of all, a desire to encourage the growth of new industries as a means of employing labour. But the main 'argument which has enabled protection to prevail to the extent to which it has done is that if we are ever to have manufacturing industries .of our own. we must do something to equalize the conditions obtaining - here and elsewhere, so that manufacturers in Australia can flourish under labour conI ditions which are congenial to Australia. The attempt to compete with labour in less fortunate conditions has been looked upon, and, I think, wisely, as hopeless, except in connection with the great natural industries of the country. So far as those industries are concerned, we can competenight and day with all countries. The real strength of Australia has been derived,, not from the nourishment we obtain by living on one another, but from the glorious strength which has come to this country from the development of the great natural riches and resources which we possess. That has been the true source of all the greatness of Australia, including even the greatness of our manufacturing industries. But since this new scheme is to be the basis of the protection to be granted, I think Parliament is absolutely justified in endeavouring to see that Australian manufacturers who ' reap the benefit. of Australian protection honestly give their employees Australian conditions and wages.",36

293,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I wish to say at once that the object aimed at by this new protection has my thorough sympathy. There are two points in connection with it, however, which must be Carefully considered. The question as to fair and reasonable labour conditions is not a difficult one. It is not so difficult as is the question of prices, which involves many other conditions. Qualitv has a great deal to do with price. One manufacturer might the selling 30 per cent, below his neighbour, yet the higher-priced goods might represent more honest value to the consumer.

297,Mr FOWLER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Not necessarily.,37
298,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The melancholy feature of this proposal is that all those measures for the protection of industry which were passed with, desperate zeal, are within twelve months confessedly failures. The Australian Industries Preservation Bill was to destroy the enemies of fair dealing. Combines and trusts were to be crushed by that magnificent measure .; yet,-within twelve months of its passing, the Minister admits that it is defective in a most serious respect. I have never seen the Government make an honest attempt to bring it into operation. Then, again, let us glance at the operation of the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act. That Act, which was passed about twelve months ago, provided that from ist January, 1.907, certain Excise duties should be payable on all agricultural machinery specified in the schedule. From ist January last, under that Act, Excise has been due on every agricultural implement manufactured in Australia and included in the schedule, but has one penny of that Excise been collected? . Mr BATCHELOR - It was payable, unless the manufacturers secured an exemption.",37

302,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I am looking at thegeneral scope of the ..Act. We know what is the position when duties of Customs are imposed. From the very instant when a Customs duty is proposed, it has to be paid, and it is collected even before the Tariff itself has become law. Yet not t one penny has been collected in the way of Excise under the Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Act, although I dare say not one-twentieth of the manufacturers engaged in the industries to which it relates have been brought, or have had even a chance of being brought, within a determination of the Court. The whole thing is an abject failure.",37
303,Mr HUGHES,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,There is no insuperable difficulty in the way of compelling them to pay,37
304,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I should Le very sorry to look upon difficulty as an argument for stagnation. I am only pointing out that the result of the measure in question has been a little discouraging. Do honourable members remember the exact title of the Anti-Trust. Bill? The Australian Industries Preservation Bill ! That is a beaur tiful rhetorical expression ; a sort of name which suggested that the moment the Act was passed fresh oxygen would be supplied to every industry in Australia. That supply has not yet come; so far we have had nothing but nitrogen. The policy enunciated by the Treasurer has only one delightful feature. I refer to the fact that it provides for the appointment of another Board. That is, at least, one charm about it ",37

It is equally important with regard to the questions of price, if anything can be effectively done.",37
308,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,That has been effective so far as harvesters and other things are concerned.,38
309,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Do not let us talk of vesters. Who is the man whose books the Government cannot look at? What is his name?

321,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It seems so; but there is a good deal of wisdom in that rule, because it is a very favourable condition for getting the best possible decision, that there should be people who have a personal and practical interest in fighting out the issue.. If Courts were required to give ex cathedra opinions, a Court might afterwards find, in the contest of a particular concrete case, that its previous opinion, given under less favourable conditions, was entirely wrong, and that previous decision might have been a source of misleading, to the prejudice of a very large number of people. On the whole, it is a wise provision that these questions should come up in the usual form. So long as no one objects to the Act, prima facie it is constitutional, and it may turn out to be constitutional in f a c t ; but I have in my mind the well established legal principle that "" What you have no power to do directly, you have no power to do indirectly."" That is a principle which would cut right into this question. We have no power directly to interfere with the wages conditions in any factory in Australia. On the contrary, the Constitution, in matters"" connected with industrial conditions",39
322,Mr HUGHES,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,We have power under the trade and commerce section.,39
323,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I do not wish to express a final opinion, but I have a very strong suspicion that that power would not be held to authorize us to make, in the exercise of the taxing power, distinctions of the kind which will be made under this proposed legislation.",39
324,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"But if those distinctions are merely incidental to the taxing power, or, in any case, are insignificant?",39
325,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,That would not solve the question. It would simply raise it in another form.,39
326,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,It would conform to the legal maxim which the right honourable gentleman just stated.,39
327,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"On that point, clearly the common-sense argument would be against the validity of such an Act. The proposal is not intended for the purpose of carrying out a systemof Excise to the extent of one-half of the existing duties. That is not the object of the Act. If the main object of the Excise were to make the colonial manufacturer pay, by way of Excise, half of the duty imposed, perhaps some weight might be attached to the honourable member's argument.",39
328,Mr HUGHES,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Surely the Court will not"" inquire as to the motives of Parliament, but only as to what the Act carries out ?",39
329,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"If any person comes before the Court claiming that his industrial conditions are interfered with by a legislative authority which has no constitutional power to interfere with them, and shows that this is being done under cover of the Trade and Commerce provision, then, if the Court holds that the interference falls legitimately within the expression "" trade and commerce,"" I think that the difficulty may disappear. But that is the question.",39
330,Mr HUGHES,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Everythin g that we may do in the exercise of a power, we may do to the uttermost.",39
331,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"But the original essence of the power must always be remembered. The power conferred by the Constitution under the expression "" trade and commerce "" may not include the right to enter a man's factory at Footscray, to regulate his wages conditions, and to say to him, "" If you do not give your men so and so, we shall impose an Excise duty - upon your productions."" I think it may be held that that power does not come within the sphere of "" trade and"" commerce.""",39
332,Mr FOWLER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Does not the honourable member think that the expression "" trade "" includes the industrial affairs of the Commonwealth ?",39
333,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I do not think that it does from the point of - view of a man who is carrying on a factory. If it does, what is the use of the provision relating to "" industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State "" ? What is the use of such words if under the trade and commerce provision of the Constitution the Commonwealth has the power to solve the labour. conditions of every person who is engaged in manufacture? If we have the power to deal with the labour conditions of the manufacturer, we must have the power to deal with the labour conditions of other branches of trade and commerce, manufacturers are not the only persons who come under the heading "" trade and commerce."" In that case, we have the power - to enter the warehouse of an importer and say to him, "" We will charge you 30 per cent, more upon your imports of woollen goods unless you pay your men better wages.""",39
334,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I distinctly think that under the trade and commerce provision of the Constitution we have power to do that.,40
335,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"May I suggest to my honourable friend that when I was a young man at the Bar I was always "" distinctly "" of opinion. But when I was junior counsel to some eminent senior, who had been at the Bar for, perhaps, thirty years, my opinions-especiall y where I had been "" distinctly "" of opinion-were all modified, so that by the time. I signed them they formed the most milk and watery productions that I had ever seen. I suggest to my honourable friend",40
336,Mr HUGHES,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It'mus t not be forgotten that he is sitting alongside a lawyer,",40
337,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Then he is in a dangerous position. There is no doubt that a lawyer always likes a client who is "" distinctly "" .of opinion, because it leads to a large volume of business. One of the most cheering features associated with all these well meant endeavours to produce better conditions of labour is that they invariably promote the success of the most deserving class in Australia- a class to which I need tiot more closely allude.",40
338,Mr FISHER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The Excise will be imposed upon all producers. Has not the Crown always the right to remit any taxation! imposed by Statute?,40
339,Mr REID,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I would like the honourable member to recollect that nobody who has the power of acting under an instrument is permitted by any ingenuity to enlarge the terms of that instrument. If by the exercise of ingenuity we could get outside the powers conferred by a Constitution Act, the instrument would not be worth much. The first canon of construction is : What is the teal inwardness of this Act ? What is its re;il sphere and operation ? Does this power - come within the real sphere and operation of the expression ""trade and commerce""? If it does, it is sound, but if not, all the contrivances in the world will not make it spund. But we cannot be sure of these things until we have obtained the decision of a Court which is final in these matters. That is what I always admire in reference because to the High Court of Australia-wher e it is final it is sure to be right. But where it is not final, it is sometimes a little like other Courts. There is only one tribunal in which a final decision of this matter can be obtained. I merely express the hope that vital as are the interests connected with this Tariff,, and stiongly as we may desire to impress our own views upon it, we shall all combine to do two things-firs t to expedite, as far as we reasonably can, the despatch of this important business, and, secondly, to endeavour each to do his duty without the intrusion of those angry and disturbing influences which are so apt to upset the Treasurer.",40
340,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Denison) [5.27]. - When the leader of the Opposition rose to speak I left the Chamber in order to procure a short financial statement, which I prepared yesterday in relation to the Tariff and its operation. This statement bears so closely upon some expressions which have been made use of today by the Treasurer that I intend' to place it before the Committee for the benefit of honourable members, and also because I desire that it may be put upon record in Hansard, so that twelve months hence we may have before us not only the figures supplied by the Treasurer, >but such statistics as I think ought to have been presented when the Tariff was submitted for our consideration. There are two or three points which I especially desire to emphasize. One of these was referred to the other evening by the Treasurer when he read a statement from the Board of Trade Journal, setting forth that the average duty imposed under the revenue Tariff of Russia was 131 per cent., whilst that under the Commonwealth Tariff was only 6 per cent. I was so astonished at the time he made this declaration that I immediately referred to the Board of Trade returns in the hope that I might be able to elucidate the principle upon which that body had presented such a misleading statement. I cannot, however, ascertain the particulars which have led to its conclusions. I can only find that the average duty of 6 per cent, related to the impost upon all the textiles and manufactured articles exported by Great Britain to Australia. I immediately made my own calculations in respect to the Tariff of last year, and the revenue which it yielded, and I found that the average duty levied under it was equivalent to 24 per cent.",40
341,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Then the officials of the Board of Trade must be incompetent.,41
342,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,It s statement is obviously based upon some principle which is not disclosed in the return.,41
343,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I granted that its statements were correct.,41
344,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"To - d a y the Treasurer pointed out, in effect,, that the return must be inaccurate because he has stated that our Tariff imposes an average duty of 17 per cent.",41
345,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,That is the average duty levied upon importations from all over the world.,41
346,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The Treasurer compared the new Tariff with the Kingston Tariff,41
347,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The average duty of 17 per cent, is based upon importations from all over the world, and not from Great Britain alone.",41
348,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The imports from Germany and America-whic h are the chief countries from which we import, apart from Great Britain-air e infinitesimal as compared with the great bulk of our imports. I come to my next point. It was very interesting to me this afternoon to hear the Treasurer refer to the revenue returns for the past three months, ancl especially to those for the past month. I rejoice with him that our States are not only showing so manifestly the benefit of good seasons, but are also showing that the Tariff is going to be a very large revenue producer. But if pied an important position as a member of the Opposition, I should be very much disposed to challenge the Government on the ground that the figures which have been placed before us in the financial statement do not disclose the true position of the Commonwealth under the new Tariff.",41
349,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,In which statement ?,41
350,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,In the Budget.,41
351,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The member surely does not accuse the officials of cooking the figures? Because they are their figures, not mine. Sir - PHIL IP FYSH - Certainl y not; but the Treasurer has not taken advantage of the figures supplied to him to point .out the true financial position of the Commonwealth under the Tariff now proposed. If I were the chairman of a public company, making a statement as to its financial position, I should be expected to show my hand full y , and let the members of the company see what their posi^ tion was likely to be during the current year at least. I remember that when Sir George Turner delivered his Budget statement in connection with the introduction of took it for the Kingston Tariff he pointed out that whereas under the Tariff, as proposed, the revenue might be ,£9,000,000, yet in. the course of a few years- I think he said within five years-the normal revenue under it would be reduced to about ,£5,000/000. That statement was challenged at the time. Some of us thought that Sir George Turner's view of the Tariff, as preventing the importation of goods from abroad, and assisting in their manufacture in Australia, was unsound, and that it would not within five years operate to such an extenti as to build up factoriesas he expected. I recollect that, notwithstanding that Tariff-whic h was a high Tariff, even after it was cut down in Parliament",41
352,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Nonsens e !,41
353,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"As introduced, it was even an extravagant Tariff. As cut down, it was a comparatively moderate Tariff. It turned out to be a revenue Tariff.",41
354,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"So it was, and that is what we want to prevent now.",41
355,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It was a "" Tariff without destruction,"" in accordance with the Maitland declaration.",41
356,Mr TUDOR,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Was not the honourable I occu=- member a member of the Cabinet that introduced that Tariff?',41
357,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Yes , but I was' very glad that the duties were reduced in Committee.",41
358,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Non e of the duties was high -. . Mr Frazer - Does the honourable member say that as a Minister he was pleased to see his own Government defeated?,41
359,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,No ; I say that honourable I was glad to find that some of the higher duties were reduced in Committee.,41
360,Mr FRAZER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Then the Minister must have been defeated.,41
361,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The honourable member may put it as he pleases. I said on a former occasion that when a member of this House joins a Ministry he should be loyal to it while he remains in it . I was as loyal to the Ministry as any mart could be, and I took the earliest opportunity, without attempting to break up the Government, of leaving when I could, because I was not in accord with many things that were done.",41

Coming - back to the point which I wished to make and put on record, I hope honourable memand bers will follow me closely, and that i am wrong some one will set me right. have no desire to mislead honourable memthat bers and the public. The facts and figures are as open to them as they are to me. devoted almost the whole of yesterday to this investigation of the subject. I entered upon it because I thought the Treasurer made a mistake in the figures he quoted relating to our trade with Great Britain.",42
364,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,It has not yet been proved that I made a mistake.,42
365,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I prove it by ference to the fact that, under the AusThe tralian Tariff last year, the duties collected - on all imports averaged 25 per cent. I excluding narcotics and stimulants.",42
366,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Not the imports from Great Britain alone?,42
367,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I say again that the United States and Germany are the principal' competitors with Great Britain trading with Australia, but the total amount of their exports to this country is infinitesimal as compared with the total amount of goods from Great Britain, viz., ^£8,000,000 out of total imports of ,£44,000,000.",42
368,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"No , they are not.",42
369,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"So far as concerns the character of the goods imported from Germany and the United States,' whatever Tariff we impose we cannot exclude one-half of them."" It is utterly impossible to manufacture them here. As we - deal with various items of the Tariff I shall point out from time to time that there are goods imported from Ita'ly, Germany, and the United States which there is no likelihood of our having manufactured in this country-at all events, at any period during the life of any one at present living. Australia will not become a manufacturer of these goods for many years to come, no matter how high may be the Tariff wall that we build up against them.",42
370,Mr FISHER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I understand the honourable member to say that' ourimports, excluding narcotics and stimulants, pay on an average duties of 25 per cent?",42
371,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The duties on 1 narcotics and stimulants average 155 per cent. Next we come to goods which pay composite duties and specific duties. They pay on an average over 30 per cent. Then the we have the ad valorem duties ranging from 5 to 30 per cent. A great mass of our imports which pay ad valorem duties come in at 10, 15, 20, and 25per cent., a small proportion-les s than .£300,000 * f I - oom e in at 30 per cent. The principal I object with which I rose was to point out the financial statement of the Government does not disclose truly to the ComI monwealth the financial position even for the current year under the new Tariff. The figures which I wish honourable members to consider are these: The dutiable goods imported in 1906 were ,£27,254,000; bullion and' specie imported-upo n which there is no duty-amounte d to ,£2,330,917 ; and the remaining free imports to ^£15,144,466. The total goods imported reinto Australia amounted to £^44,729,506. free list under the present Tariff will be worth about ,£4,000,000. Of course, my am estimate is a very rough one, and may be o u t £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 or ,£300,000.",42
372,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Or perhaps .£1,000,000 or ,£2,000,000.",42
373,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The Minister can have my figures checked. If he does, I think it will be found that .£4,000,000 is as nearly the value of our present free list as it is possible for a member' to estimate it at from the information contained in the Tariff papers, in which goods are sometimes dealt with according to value, and at other times according to quantity or weight.",42
374,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Does the honourable member think that he can make a better estimate than the Customs officials have made ?,42
375,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I have not seen an official estimate.,42
376,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I have.,42
377,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Then the honourable member should have laid it before the Committee.,42
378,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I have done so. I have given the official estimate of revenue.,42
379,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"That is. not what I am speaking of. I say that the freelist under the old Tariff was worth £15,000,000, and under the new Tariff is about £4,000,000. The estimate of revenue for the current year is £10,509,000 , and the amount received last year was £9,648,000, so that it is estimated that the revenue under the new Tariff will show an increase of nearly £ 9 0 0 , 0 0 0 . Last year's revenue was an-increase on that of the previous year of ,£800,000.",42
380,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,We cannot expect boom figures' every year.,43
381,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Las t year was not entirely a boom year. In more than , one year since 1901 we have received an equivalent revenue return, though there was a falling-off in the year 1905-6. During the current yeai we may presume that there will be an increase of revenue due to the great prosperity of the country to which the Minister referred, of which all honourable members were glad to hear. But no allowance seems to have been made for that. Last year ad valorem duties were collected on imports valued at ,£18,900,000, and fixed duties on imports valued at £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , our dutiable imports amountinc in all to about ,£25,000,000, excluding stimulants and narcotics, and bullion and specie, while ,£15,000,000 of free goods were imported. Of course, any estimate that I may make must be a very rough one, Deca.use it would require a great deal of calculation by the officials of the Customs Department to produce anything like accuracy of detail. Assuming the new Tariff increases our duties by about 7J per cent, on the average, though there are instances in which the increase is 20 per cent., and even 100 per cent",43
382,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The average increase is about 10 per cent.,43
383,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Takin g it at 7 Tariff? per cent., it means an increase of about ,£1,893,000 in the revenue from the tra? ',£2 5,000,000 of imports which were dutiaible uncler the old Tariff. And under .Tariff another ,£11,000,000 of dutiable which last year were free. Putting the duties on those imports 10 per cent, which is well within figures are correct ? the mark, they will yield a revenue of ,£1,100,000, making the probable increase under the new Tariff £ 2 , 9 9 3 , 0 0 0 estimate coincides strangely with that by the leader of the Opposition just of the effect of the Tariff. now, in multiplying the increase for month - .£2 50,000 - by twelve, brings the increase for the year to £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . It is to be noted that this increase will not the for one year only, because a large number of the goods on which duties have been increased cannot be made in Australia for years to come. In cononly clusion, I wish to ask by whom will this increase have to be paid ? Possibly isters are under the impression that it will be paid by those known as the classes. But, in my opinion, it will be paid by the masses. They will discover that this extra revenue is largely being collected from them. I have come to that conclusion as the result of experience, not only as an importer, but as Treasurer of Tasmania or* various occasions-in which position it was my duty to observe the incidence of taxation, to discover as nearly as possible what burdens were borne by the .working classes and what by the well-to-do. The proportion of the burdens of the masses to , those of the classes is very great. In his admirable book on the income tax, Leoni Levi published a diagram showing Teneriffe with its peak, 15,000 feet high, and its base submerged. That enormous base represented the masses in Great Britain whose incomes could not be taxed by reason of the fact that they f e l l below the exemption of £ 1 5 0 , while, as the peak grew smaller and smaller, it indicated the numbers of those who paid the tax. I have followed out that idea on many occasions in Australia. I have found that in the case of anincome tax with an. exemption of ,£150, comparatively few of the masses could be taxed. It seems almost in credible that the number of persons in Australia who pay income tax with an exemption of .£150. do not represent z\ per cent, of the population. Who, then, will .bear the burden of the extra ,£3,000,00 0 of taxation which is imposed by this 1",43
384,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Thre e millions ex,43
385,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Yes ; and I am this placing the figures on record as a referimports are ence for a year later.,43

387,Sir PHILIP FYSH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I was not very far out in the estimate I made with respect . ' This to a former Tariff.

We are told that the manufacturers of Tasmania asked that the on Tariff might be left as it was-statin g that duties of 20 per cent, were high enough;, and it is in that spirit that I shall approach the consideration of the Tariff.. At the same time, as I said before, if any industry has been injured by the former Tariff, I am prepared to remedy the mischief. There is no occasion, however, inremedying a mischief of that kind, to imwho pose 'higher duties than will give a fair return for the investment.

I have - dealt with matters to which I had no idea of referring. My object was simply to have placed on record the fact, as disclosed by the figures placed before us, that the Tariff we are asked to sanction will give an increased return of not £[1,000,000, but more nearly .£3,000,000 increase for the current year.",45

Under the circumstances, thought that greater expedition might be attained by passing these items en bloc; and, after making inquiries, I do not think that any honourable member will object to the suggestion. I should like to ask your ruling, Mr Chairman, whether I am in order in submitting that motion? I can assure the Government that my only object is to expedite business.",46

The item of tobacco I have included is in accord with the proposals of the Government. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE. - The duty .appears in the Tariff is in accord with the recommendation of the Commission; but that recommendation has been proved to be absolutely wrong.,46

439,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"And that might not be desirable from the point of view of some people. I should like to make what remarks I have to make now, and then ask your ruling, sir, as to the submission of my proposal. Only one question of any real importance has been brought before I the Committee today. The Treasurer has told us nothing new in his references to the value of imports into Australia. The item "" straw,"" which he specially referred to, was very unimportant, as only some 3 cwt. was imported last year. In the new protection, as it is called, however, an important principle is involved. I do not desire to commit myself to any definite expression of opinion' at the prehonor- sent time, because, as yet, we have not had an opportunity to carefully consider the matter. Indeed, I did not quite hear the Treasurer in everything he said on the question. It seems to me, however, that the scheme proposed may, in some respects, be acceptable, in regard to monopolies and combinations, though it appears to me too far-reaching in its effects. I do not know whether I understood the Treasurer coras it rectly, but does he intend this new protection to apply to. every industry throughout the country, including agricultural and pastoral industries, which are not, as we know, within the operation of the Arbitration Acts of Australia? Stock, meat, butter, wheat, and so forth are produced under very different circumstances and conditions from those of ordinary manufactures. Did been a I understand the Treasurer to say that agricultural and pastoral industries are to be included?",46
440,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I said distinctly and repeatedly, in answer to questions, that a schedule will be prepared showing the manufactures that will be affected. The scheme will not be effective throughout all industries.",46
441,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Not in regard to agricultural and pastoral industries, I presume ? Sir* WILLIAM LYNE - I do that agricultural industries will be affected, so far as I can see.",47
442,Sir JOHNFORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"If that be so, a good deal of the difficulty is removed.",47
443,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The r e is a d u t y on most of the articles produced in those industries.,47
444,Sir JOHNFORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I am asking whether the new Excise duties suggested will apply to agricultural and pastoral products ?.,47
445,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I do not wish to say anything which, without explanation, might tend to mislead honourable members, but when the right honourable gentleman resumes his seat I shall refer to that matter.",47
446,Sir JOHNFORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It is important that we should know at once Avhether the new Excise duties are to apply to the agricultural productions of the country. seems to me that the Treasurer is proposing to do only what was done seven or eight years - ago in Western Australia, and what has been already done in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, and that is, to provide that those engaged in manufacturing industries shall have an opportunity of having their wages regulated by an Arbitration Court. That has been the law in most parts of Australia for years. I did not gather that the proposals now made by the Treasurer will go any further than the law which now exists. I do not know that such provision has been made in Queensland or in Tasmania, but there is a law in South Australia! under which the wages in an industy can be regulated.",47
447,Mr WH IRVINE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,And other conditions of labour.,47
448,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"That is so. I mean wages, hours, and other conditions of labour - can at the present time be regulated in all the States, with the exception possibly of Queensland and Tasmania, and it therefore seems to me that there is no justification for all the noise that has been made about the new protection. I am not satisfied that it will confer any additional benefit on workers in the State from which I come, where the wages and conditions of labour are regulated by an Arbitration Court.",47
449,Mr BAMFORD,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Still , they had a big strike over there.",47
450,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I am aware of not think that, but that was because the employees would not accept the decisions of the Arbitration Court. We may expect to have strikes in every State, if either the employers or the employees will not abide by the decisions of the Courts. Though I say it with regret, I think the rule has been> that employees have not been content to abide by decisions which have not been in? their favour.",47

I do not agree with'the view held by the honourable It member for Gwydir.

464,Mr WEBSTER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,That is practically an impossibility with a Court.,48
465,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"That only shows how unfair the honourable member can be where the interests he supports are affected. It is useless discussing the question with an honourable member who argues in that way. I submit that, whether the law is against us or for us, it must be obeyed.",48

470,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I hope the honourable member will agree that, as law-abiding citizens, it is our duty to obey the law, such a statement is a calumny. and that, if it is not what we desire, should use constitutional means to have altered. I very much regret to say that, so far as I have been able to judge, the ployers, whether satisfied or not, have plied with the law, whilst the employees seem to think that arbitration courts constituted in order to increase wages, so soon as a diminution of wages is propassed posed think they are at liberty to disobey the law.",48

Arbitration and Conciliation Bill in the Western Australian Parliament against the wishes of many of those whose opinions I valued, and there was no legislation Labour Party in the State Parliathing ment in those days.

473,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I did not say that. I said that, probably, the new protection would not have been introduced.",48
474,Sir JOHNFORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I accept that modification of the statement, and in reply I say that the proposed new protection provisions will not be in advance of thelegislation dealing with wages and conditions of labour which we have had in Western Australia for over seven years.",48

479,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I did not say that.,48
480,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I think that It is a we very ungrateful and improper statement to it make, seeing that a great deal of such legislation on the statute-books of the difemferent States was passed long before there comwas a Labour Party in Parliament.

489,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I did not make that statement.,49
490,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The honourable member said, at all events, that I had done nothing. To return, however, to the proposal immediately before us, I think - that the scheme for regulating prices will be difficult to carry out. We all agree that some means should be devised to prevent the public from being victimized by combines or monopolies; but it seems to me that the regulation of prices is impossible. I could quite understand the appointment of a Board of Trade similar to that in operation in - Great Britain which would control, to some extent, railways, and trade and. commerce generally, and report to Parliament in regard to any injustice suffered by the community in connection with those matters ; but an attempt by Parliament or a Board to fix the price of every item that is dutiable under the Tariff would be as impossible as it is unnecessary. cedure would destroy competition, and do away with the spirit of emulation and enterprise. I do not think that when We get to close quarters the Treasurer, who generally has a keen eye for the main chance, will .pursue this project to its ultimate conclusion.",49
491,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Pursu e what?,49
492,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The proposal every item which is dutiable under the Tariff shall have a maximum price. that Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I was careful to say that that was not so. Before Sir JOHN FORREST - I rose for the purpose of obtaining your ruling, Mr. Chairman, on the question I have stated, and I thought that it would be as well to avail myself of the opportunity to make a few general observations regarding the Government proposals, reserving mv right to deal more full y with them when' I have had an opportunity to carefully study them. I was very glad to hear the honourable member say that it was not intended to apply the new protection to the agricultural and pastoral industries. If that stand be adopted, I am sure we shall view He the Government proposals from a different stand-point from that which we should otherwise do. So long as these proposals are restricted to the manufacturers, who are controlled at present in New South Wales and Western Australia by Conciliation and that, until Arbitration Acts, and in Victoria and South Australia by Wages Boards, I do not think that they .will affect to any large extent either employers or employees. I have only to say,, in conclusion, that I should like to know when the Minister proposes to proceed with ""the scheme of new protection outlined by him.",49

My own opinion is that the introductory clauses are merely explanatory, and will have to be embodied in the Bil l which will be introduced to enact the Tariff before they can become law. The proper subjects for discussion in the Committee of Ways and Means are the items dealing with the amount of duties to be imposed. ' The first paragraph, "" That duties of Customs and duties of Excise be imposed according to the following Tariff,"" will be put at the end of the items of the Tariff in the same way as the preamble and the title of a Bil l are put. submit, Mr Mr JOHNSON - And amendments can be moved at that stage?",50

It might afterwards be considered whether certain other items should be taken first.",52

As I have already stated, the intention is that the Government shall formulate a list* of items or manufactures over which the Board will have control. I think that the right honourable member for Swan asked me whether the proposals of the Government were applicable to the farmers. My impression is that they do not applv to farmers, but merely to manufacturers and to the wages paid by them to their employees.",52

If it can Mr DUGALD THOMSON (North Sydney) [8.3] - I am very reluctant to interpose in this debate, but we are asked to pass certain proposals in the Tariff. As a the reason for passing them, we have been informed that a system embodying protection-, for the workmen employed in the industriesf protected by the Tariff, will be put before us. I quite agree with the Treasurer th?t anwe ought not, perhaps, to expect the Bilf conferring that protection to be placed before us at the present stage, but I do say that we ought to have an outline Of the principles of the measure so that we mav deaV be with the Ministerial proposals in an enlightened way. But what do we find ? We are asked-in view of promised legislationthe community, and yet we are told"" to by the Minister who proposes it, that he does not know what are the provisions of - I did not say anything of the kind. The honourable member might be fair, at anv rate.",53
559,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The Treasurer has just stated that he did not think that the proposals of the Government would extended to the agricultural and pastoral industries, but he could not say positively. can he take exception to my remark that he admits he has not vet formulated ideas upon the matter when he can give no information upon that .important issue? In a variety of ways the scheme outlined by the Government is absolutely - unworkable! Prom my stand-point, I regard with some pleasure the proposed check on the too greedy requirements of some manufacturers to the injury of the community. I regard it also as undoubtedly just that, if manufacturers are going to get heavy protection because of the high prices they pay for labour, we ought to see that the reason they give for requiring that protection is substantiated by the payment of reasonable wages. I also agree that it is desirable in regard to trusts and combines, and the question of whether manufacturers are entitled to the benefit of duties if they are combining and charging excessive prices, that such matters should be dealt with, not by a Minister, and not in the first - place even by this Parliament, but by some independent Board. My only objection to a Board is on the ground of the increased expenditure, which we are piling up in connection with one thing and another in Commonwealth affairs. But I do' say that when a Minister has proposals ' bf this sort to make to Parliament, and when he asks Parliament to adopt certain provisions in a Tariff in view of them, he ought clearly to outline the proposals. The present slipshod method of doing business will not bring this Parliament into credit.' I have never known, in my experience, of any Parliament-and I have never read of any Parliament-passin g a - measure requiring some other measure to complete it , without knowing what were the provisions that were to appear in the - second measure. The Minister has said - that he cannot for the present say definitely whether agricultural or pastoral industries will be affected. He has said that the posals of the Government will apply to all manufactures which are protected by the Tariff. Now, there are manufactures connected with agriculture and with pastoral pursuits. The wine industry extends throughout Australia. There are heavy duties on imported wines. There is the butter industry, and there are many other rural industries. But we are quite in ignorance - as to whether they will be affected by the proposals of the Government. According to the Minister's statement, all manufactures that are protected by the Tariff will be affected. If so, will these rural industries - be affected ? Then he creates another difficulty. He says that the old Tariff was toot protective, but was a revenue Tariffthat it did not protect the industries of Australia. As he is proposing to interfere only with 'industries that are protected, does he mean that his proposals will interfere only with those industries that receive the benefit of raised duties under the new Tariff, or are the proposals to extend to all the industries of Australia producing articles dutiable as imports under the Tariff? We have had no explanation on that point.",53
560,Mr GLYNN,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The Government must do that or nothing.,54
561,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The Minister admits that many duties under the old Tariff were revenue duties. Some of « those duties are increased under the new Tariff, and some are not. Are only those which, in the Minister's opinion, are protective duties to be affected by the proposals of the Government, and is there to be some method of defining what is a protective duty? We have had no explanation on that point. Again, the Minister says that he proposes to impose an Excise duty wherever there is protection, and, if proper wages are paid, to remit the Excise.",54
562,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I did not' say that.,54
563,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The Minister said that the Excise proposals are to apply to all manufactures that are protected.,54
564,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Accordin g to a Hst which will be prepared and placed in ""the hands of the Board.",54
565,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"We ought to have that list. Surely when we are dealing with Customs duties we ought to know to what manufactures the Excise proposals are to apply. The proposal is that Excise duties will be remitted if certain satisf actory pro- conditions are observed. But that proposal apparently does not apply to those very large and important items of manufacture in connection with which Excise duties are already imposed. What is to be done in regard to the Excise duties which at present apply to beer, sugar, and a number of other commodities? Those questions show how imperfect is the information that we have. The Minister's proposal absolutely breaks down in connection with those large industries. Are they to be dealt with or . are they not? Are they to be a favoured exception, or are they to be brought under the scope of the new legislation ? We have no information on that point. The Minister has not explained a number of other matters. If , for instance, the duties which he proposes are imposed, and increase the cost of living-as they must do-h e has not explained how he is going to benefit those other workers who are not engaged in the industries, but who have to suffer on account of the higher cost of living. The .figures given by the Minister show there is this increased cost. The Minister quoted the prices charged for a number of articles about which he sent an officer to get information.",54
566,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"He quoted the price of straw, for example !",55
567,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"He quoted straw, curry powder, and a number - articles like that.

If the Commonwealth Parliament continues to legislate in this manner, it will suffer degradation, and will add to the ill-repute which it has acquired by passing ineffective legislation, the uselessness of which we must I have ourse'lves acknowledge. Measures which we have passed have proved ineffective, because when they were under consideration we were not given sufficient information to enable us to judge properly of their probable results. I am. afraid that the proposals of the Ministry are largely a placard-the sugar coating which, it is hoped, will induce the people to swallow the bitter pill of increased duties. Where Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts are effective now, they will continue to be effective, and we to nothing will be gained by the new legislation proposed by the Minister, but where no such effective machinery is now in operation, the proposals of the Ministry will be ineffective. That must be my opinion until the Treasurer gives us information showing it to be wrong. The benefits of the new protection are as illusive as many other Government promises have been, hut because it is promised, the Committee will agree to increased duties, and the cost of living will rise in Australia as it has risen in New Zealand. The Minister spoke of the New Zealand duties as being about 2 per cent, higher than ours, and it 1 is admitted that the cost of living has increased in New Zealand because of the Tariff.",56
601,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The increase in the cost of living in New Zealand is due mainly to the increase in house rents, which has naturally followed an increase in general prosperitv.",56
602,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Mr. Ramsay Macdonald, a member of the British Labour Party, has stated distinctly that an increase in the cost of living has taken place in New Zealand.",56
603,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,He was there for only a very short time.,56
604,Mr DUGALDTHOMSO N,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The workers of New Zealand are affirming the very same thing.,56
605,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,They say that it is nearly all due to the increase in house rent.,56
606,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,They are not affirming that it is nearly all due to house rent. :,56
607,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"They say that 90 per cent, of the increase in the dost of living is due to the increase in house rent.'",56
608,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"They are affirming only that house rent is contributory. 1 arn afraid that we shall not arrive at an agreement by these contradictions. We - are asked to impose heavy duties which will have to be borne principally by the working classes. It is not proposed to give the benefit to by far the larger proportion of the working classes, and where' it is - intended to give the benefit, it is merely nominal- a placard to induce the people to put up with these extraordinary duties. - Mr JH CATTS (Cook) [8.26] - I am .in a most peculiar position, and one in which I think that very few honourable members are placed, in that during the electoral campaign I was not asked a single '-question on the fiscal issue. I would not have risen to-night, had it not been that very considerable misrepresentation has taken, place in New South Wales. As I did not refer to the subject during the electoral campaign, I think it only fair that I should now make a statement which will enable my constituents to understand the attitude I take up generally. First of all, it has been urged in that State that the Labour Party is responsible for the introduction of this Tariff. I believe that a greater measure of responsibility for thereopening of the fiscal question, might be laid at the door of the leader of the Opposition, than at the door of the Labour Party.",57
609,Mr WILSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Why ? - Mr JH CATTS - During the last Parliament, the leader of the Opposition formed a Coalition Government, which included some gentlemen of high protectionist repute- Mr Allan MCLean, Mr MCCay, and Sir George Turner-and later on, 1 when the reconsideration of the Tariff was pressed upon h'im, he recommended the Governor General to appoint a Tariff Commission, which most effectively re-opened the fiscal question.",57
610,Mr WILSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,No ; . it was with' a view to rectifying anomalies.,57
611,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"In the Sydney Daily Telegraph, of 24th October, 1906,the right honourable gentleman was reported in these terms- Shortly after the Coalition Government was formed on the basis of a fiscal truce, the LyneTsaacs wing of the Opposition sought to embarrass us by a - clamour for relief for the artisans - of Melbourne, who were alleged to be starving, ' and the industries of Melbourne, which were alleged to be ruined. . . . Our Government appointed a' Tariff Commission to inquire into .the work of the Tariff and its effect upon Aus'traliaa} industries. I courted the fullest investigation. I knew there might well be anomalies that called for redress and hardships that ought to be removed. . . . Mr Deakin did not object to the appointment of the Commission; indeed, I conferred with him as to its composition. The leader of the Opposition, therefore, was responsible for the appointment of the Tariff Commission, and he must have known that when its reports were presented to Parliament, the fiscal question would be most effectually re-opened.",57
612,Mr WILKS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"If the honourable member reads the terms of the Commission, he will see why that appointment was made.",57
613,Mr WILSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The honourable member has also forgotten that the matter was forced upon the right honourable member by the Opposition corner, which included the honourable member for Hume, and the late member for Indi. "" Mr JH CATTS - I admit that the position was forced upon the leader of the Opposition, but he was very ready to have .forced upon him any situation which would enable him to retain the office of Prime Minister. He recommended the appointment of the Tariff Commission because he thought that by that means he could stave off the evil day for a little while, and retain his place on the Treasury bench. - Mr JOHNSON - That of course is an assumption.",57
614,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"That , I admit, is an assumption.",57
615,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Whic h was disproved by the way in which the right honourable gentleman left office.,57
616,Mr WILKS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Honourable members on the other side charged him then with committing political suicide.,57
617,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It is an assumption which, I admit, we are entitled to make from our stand-point. Later on the leader of the Opposition, knowing that .on his recommendation the Tariff Commission appointed had been appointed, appealed to the country, and said that the one supreme, issue before the electors was that of anti-Socialism. He invited free-traders and protectionists to join with him in dishing the Labour Party, and in following out that idea he supported many protectionists throughout the Commonwealth. ",57
618,Mr WILKS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,And very few protectionists respected it.,57
619,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,He did what he set out to do : he put a spoke in the socialistic wheel.,57
620,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"At a later stage I intend to indicate the attitude whicjh was taken up by some professed anti-Socialists here. I believe that almost a majority of those who have been returned as anti-Socialists have given expression to socialistic views in the present Parliament. At the.general election the leader of the Opposition did not raise the fiscal question. He pretended to the people that it was sunk. Speaking at Geelong, he told the country he was going to sink the fiscal issue for ever. Yet what did he tell us here today?",57
621,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Has not the Labour Party sunk the fiscal issue?,58
622,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I am not discussing what the Labour Party has done, but what the leader of the Opposition has done.",58
623,Mr MCWILLIAMS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Does the honourable member think that that really matters ?,58
624,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Fro m my point of view-that criticism has been directed against the Labour Party in New South Wales which might more properly be directed against the leader of the Opposition-it does matter. Speaking at Geelong on the 22nd June, 1905, when he was Prime Minister, the right honourable member for East Sydney is reported, by a friendly newspaper, the Melbourne Argus, to haye made the following statement:Perhaps he might have come here politically party. ' and officially before if he had not regarded the people here as strongly opposed to some of his views on politics.",58
625,The CHAIRMAN,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Will the honourable member tell me what that quotation has to do with the item before the Committee?,58
626,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"To-da y the Acting - Prime Minister, the right honourable member for Swan, and others have engaged in a general discussion on the Tariff, and I submit, sir, that I am entitled to show that the re-opening of the fiscal question, which incidentally has brought that item before the Committee, has been due to the attitude, taken up by the leader of the Opposition. The right honourable gentleman went \on to sayHe was deeply sensible of of this centre. If was a pleasant reminder of his position that, after fighting very strenuously, he found himself in accordance with the mandate of the people and of this Parliament, in sinking his fiscal antagonism. It was a great pleasure in his case to sink that fiscal antagonism for ever. (Applause.) Having created the position which enabled the fiscal question to be re-opened, the right honourable gentleman, in the first speech he made'in the House after the elections, practically gave an invitation tofcheGovernment to introduce what he said he would call "" a whole hog"" protectionist Tariff. In the Address-in-Reply on 21st February this year, during the short session which we held, he saidIn the first Parliament we had a grievance which led us to fight-the Tariff, with the utmost bitterness. I admit that the result of the election, in the light of any appeal for fiscal peace, was a distinct adoption of the protectionist principle throughout Australia. If , when the right honourable gentleman made an appeal to the people, they - returned his opponents, I hope he will keep on fighting the Labour Party, because it will mean that we shall come back to' the Legislature with increased strength.",58
627,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Was not the honourable member returned on a fiscal issue ?,58
628,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"No ; as I said, I was not asked a single question on the fiscal issue during the campaign.",58
629,Mr WILKS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Did the honourable member mention the fiscal issue?,58
630,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I did not.,58
631,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,On what issue was the honourable member returned ?,58
632,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I was returned on the policy of the Labour Party, and, incidentally, because of the weakness of the policy advocated by the opponents of that",58
633,Mr HENRY WILLIS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The Labour policy was only an incident in the election.,58
634,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I think that the recent State elections in New South Wales have shown that the Labour policy was not an incident only. However, the honourable member for East Sydney went on to sayWhilst each of us, in the performance of our duty to our own constituents, will faithfully represent the views which we profess, and whilst .we will do our best to give full effect to them, there will be no attempt to thwart or delay a thorough settlement in the direction in which the electors have decided. The deputy leader of the Opposition, though a little more cute in his statements, spoke practically to the same effect. On 4th July, the honourable member for Parrathe great importance matta saidSo far as this demand for further new protection is concerned, I , at any rate, will interpose no' obstacle to a free, full , and fair discussion of the matter, nor to a speedy end of the controversy. When the honourable member for East Svdney stated that there was no fiscal issue before the people, that he had sunk the fiscal issue for ever, and that he was not going to offer any opposition to the protectionist policy for which he claimed the people had declared, he was flogged by the daily press. On the 20th August there appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, tion is as followsunder the heading of "" A Lost Leader,"" the following:MT. Reid joins the dreary ranks of the lost leaders-and at what a moment! All through, the State, through the larger part of the Commonwealth, there has been ringing for days a clamour of indignation, in which surprise has not been the least dominant note. It is not too much to say that a great deal has been forgiven Mr Reid as a leader by his party and by the country. If he has been absent from his place, it has been felt that the hour of need would find him there, a leader in the forefront of the battle. . . . And ' now, when the day of disaster threatens us, instead of a fiery protest, we hear a whimper about the large number of protectionists in the House, and a pitifu l cry to the more moderate of them to be as merciful as possible. A few days after this flogging had been administered to him, the right honourable gentleman assumed another attitude, and is thus reported in the same newspaperI can tell the Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Morning Herald that they judge me rather hastily if they think I have abated any of my zeal or devotion to the cause of liberty of all kinds, including commercial liberty. There is not much sinking of the fiscal in that utteranceThe plain fact is that I have been battering at Australia to go in for free trade, and Australia has not done it. I have travelled day and night all round Australia in endeavouring to persuade the people of Australia to 'have the common sense not to fetter themselves. I have had battle against that sort of lunacy all these with the result that there have clamouring to be taxed. Now that the Tariff is coming on, I am going to fight it as hard as I can. All this shows that the honourable member for East Sydney is, more than any one else, responsible for the re-opening of the Tariff question, and he and his supporters ought question ? to be the last to fix the responsibility on others. Some complaint has been made as to the height of the duties under the posed Tariff. The extent of the duties is, we all admit, due to the operation of Braddon section, which places upon the Treasurer the obligation to raise four - the revenue that is required for Federal purposes.",58
635,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,What has the Braddon section to do with the rates of duty ? - Mr JH CATTS - The Braddon secsimply .tion has to do with the amount of revenue which is raised from protective duties.,59
636,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Certainlj, but not with Sydney the rates of duty proposed.",59
637,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The Braddon secDuring a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise, not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. This, as I say, compels us, as a Federation, to raise four times the revenue we require^ or, in other words, it compels the Treasurer to so mould the Tariff that it will produce, say, £[10,000,000 when £'2,250,000 would suffice. On this question, however, the leader of the Opposition has no policy. ' Although the right honourable gentleman is aspiring to the leadership of the country, he has really no definite policy as to the financial relations of the Commonwealth and of the States. Some years ago, on 27th May, 1898, the right honourable gentleman, dealing with the Braddon section, was thus reported in the Sydney Daily TelegraphThis provision of Sir Edward Braddon is an abominable blot on the Bill . issue Yet last December he was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald as stating that one plank of the policy which he placed before the electors was an extension of the ope. . . ration of the Braddon section.",59
638,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Did I understand the honourable member, a few moments ago, to to say that during the last Federal elecyears, tion he was never asked a question regardbeen more people ing the Tariff?",59
639,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I said that I had not been asked a question on the Tariff during the election.,59
640,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Then , presumably, the honourable member did not discuss the",59
641,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"During the last few weeks the leader of the Opposition was prochallenged by the honourable member for South Sydney as to his present attitude in the connection with the Braddon section. The right honourable gentleman was quite indigtimes nant, and in the Sydney Morning Herald of 3rd September, 1907, I find that he saidMr Watson's statement that I am in favour of the perpetuation of the-Braddon clause is untrue. Over and over again I have said the contrary. I have pointed out that the people in the different States can get the return of a fair share of the Customs revenuej while altering the clause to free it from the absurdity of compelling the Commonwealth to raise £n when it only wants £1. MT. HUTCHISON - This is. terrible. Would it not be better to get on with the Tariff?",59
642,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The honourable member has had his say on the Tariff. I was prevented from addressing the Committee when I wished to do so, and I propose to have my say now.",60
643,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,It seems that the honourable member was not prevented.,60
644,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The honourable member for Parramatta thought he 'had prevented me, and boasted of it in the House. The right honourable member for East Sydney was quite indignant that the honourable member for South Sydney should have said that he was in favour of perpetuating the Braddon section, although, at the elections, he made it one of the planks of his platform that he would support the continued operation of the section. No matter what side of the controversy is raised, the right honourable gentleman can claim that he has spoken to the contrary. If he is taken to task for assuming one attitude, he is able to point out that he took up the other attitude. Honourable members opposite, who are so loud in their professions of free-trade, refuse to adopt a policy of direct taxation, yet they are in favour of raising, through the Customs House, four times the revenue necessary for Federal purposes, and that means protection. Mr. Carruthers, of New South Wales, who has had a good deal to say about the Federation, its alleged extravagance,, and the work of the Federal Parliament, has also had something to say on this question. I find that a little time ago, according to the Daily Telegraph"" He urged his hearers to read carefully clause 87-Braddon' s clause-whic h had been so distorted as to unfairly influence people into opposition. That clause was the clause which would give free-trade a chance in the Federal Parliament. It would make Customs taxation unpopular, for by that means four times as much revenue was raised as was really required."" He supported the section, not because he believed in raising so much revenue through the Customs House, but because he believed that its operation would make the Federal Parliament so unpopular to the States that there would be a revolt against Federation. It is certainly a most vicious provision which compels the Commonwealth Parliament to raise revenue for the States whilst it relieves the States Parliaments of taxation responsibility. It enables the States Parliaments to take credit, for surpluses to which they have no just claims, whilst it places upon the Federal Parliament the onus of imposing taxation which may be regarded as severe. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Sydney Daily Telegraph have been making a great outcry against the Tariff, but the secret of their opposition to it is disclosed in the following statement, which appeared in the Daily Telegraph last weekAs the Tariff stands, its burden upon the newspapers of the Commonwealth points to something like ^50,000 a year. I may say that one of my reasons for supporting such items is that, while they will not fall heavily upon the working classes of the community, the wealthy newspaper proprietors of the Commonwealth will have to pay £[50,000 a year towards the revenue.",60
645,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Is the honourable member not aware that it will fall heavily upon some small newspaper men in the country districts ?,60
646,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It will not affect them to the same extent, and I prefer taxation which will affect the wealthy proprietors of newspapers to taxation upon the necessaries of life of the working classes. According to the Sydney press, was there any necessity for the great outcry against the Tariff so far as the city of Sydney is concerned ? Under the heading of the ""Lyne Tariff,"" the Sydney Morning Herald says thatThe city will pay for it in the increased cost of living, and will get back perhaps more than its loss in increased wages. Thus, according to the Sydney Morning Herald, the Lyne Tariff will operate to the advantage of the city of Sydney. I admit that this newspaper previously contended that the Tariff would - operate to the disadvantage of Sydney, but that was when it was appealing to the working classes in that city. When it appealed to the country people, it tried to show that the Tariff would benefit the city of Sydney.",60
647,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,What does the honourable member think about it?,60
648,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"We now know that it will take annually ,£2,000,000 more out of the pockets of the people than did the old Tariff.",60
649,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I do not think that we should raise any more revenue than was raised under the old Tariff. According to statistics I have seen, it would appear that Sydney was largely benefited by the operation of the old Tariff. I find that, from 1901 to 1906 the number of factories in New South Wales was increased by 916, and the number of hands employed by 22,212. During last year, 1905-6, the increase in the number of factories in that - State 'was 138, and in the number of employees 5,383. In Victoria during the same year the increase in the number of factories was 143, and in the number of employ6s 4,275. The increase in the number of factory employee's during last year was greater in New South Wales than in Victoria, and it would seem that under a protectionist Tariff New South Wales was benefited to a greater extent than Victoria. In Victoria the total number of factory hands employed is 67,544, and in New South Wales the number is 77,558, or over 10,000 in excess of the number in Victoria. Although at the recent elections I was not asked any questions, I issued a manifesto, in which I made a statement which, perhaps, was not very definite, but which was as followsA l l tariff proposals should be treated on their merits and as a business proposition, with a proviso that in the event of an article of manufacture being protected the workmen engaged in its production should be protected as well as the 'manufacturer. The fallacy that the manufacturer only reaped huge fortunes at the people's - expense, and that a system of importation provided against huge incomes being made before .goods reached the consumer, has been entirely - exploded by the Sydney, Morning Herald, which 'showed recently that iri Victoria, the home of manufacturers and protection, the importers enjoyed laiger incomes than manufacturers; the ,latest figures from the income tax returns showing the taxation paid being :-Importers , an average of £ \ $ n s . each; primary producers, £ \ $ 6s. 6d. each; manufacturers, £ g 14s. id. each. It is obvious, therefore, that to assist importing rings by free-trade, or manufacturers' rings by protection may be each detrimental to the people unless hedged about by such safeguards as will ensure an advantage to the community and workman as well as to the employer. The logic of the position is that if an industry has to be assisted or subsidized by the State, the .State should conduct it, so that the whole people 'who provide the assistance should reap the benefit and not a few favoured individuals. If , on the cither hand, an importing policy gives the undue advantage to the importer class, and importing rings stand between the consumer and his goods, the people through the State should <;o-operate to preserve to themselves the advantages of free importation. As a member qf the Labour Party, I was pledged at the last general election to a referendum on the Tariff question. Here again, there has been in New South Wales considerable - misrepresentation, coming : Mr J. H. Catts. largely from Mr Carruthers. In the Daily Telegraph of the 10th ult., Mr. Carruthers is reported to have said I have on several occasions, in public ad- dresses, clearly and distinctly charged Mr Watson and the Labour Party with an avoidance of their pledges in connection with the Tariff. . . First, the Federal fiehting platform of the Labour Party (copy of: which I have before me as I write) contains the following, viz -:- Item 4, Tariff Referendum, which is explained in the general platform to mean as follows :4. Referendum of Commonwealth electors on the tariff auestion when the report of the Tariff Commission has been completed ; the party to give effect to the decision of the referendum vote. This, therefore, is what Mr Watson and the Labour Party were pledged to, and this is what the electors were deluded into believing would be given effect to, viz., a vote of the electors on the Tariff, and effect given to that vote. Mr Carruthers overlooked the manifesto issued on 5th October of last year, and printed in the Sydney Morning Herald, over the signature of the honourable member for South Sydney, chairman of the Federal Labour Partv, and the honourable member for Yarra, secretary to the party in connection with this very proposal for a Tariff referendum. It set forth thatThe Labour platform proposes that the fiscal policy of Australia shall be settled by a. direct vote of the people themselves. Our intention is that this settlement shall be made speedily and decisively, free from the confusion and distraction of other issues. A Royal Commission is at present inquiring into the effects of the' existing Tariff, and its report will doubtless be followed by a complete revision of duties by Parliament. This being accomplished, the question of confirming or rejecting the revised Tariff should be submitted to a referendum as soon as' practicable, and thus insure freedom from Tariff alteration for a reasonable period. That is the attitude taken up by the Labour Party in connection with the Tariff referendum, and which was clearly and distinctly placed before the people' in October last, prior to the Federal elections. I may say at once that. I am strong neither on free-trade nor protection. I do not think that the great problem which confronts Australia and .other, countries today is so much one as to increasing production or - wealth as it is of securing a more equitable distribution of the wealth that is already produced.",60
650,Mr LIVINGSTON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,How would the honourable member divide it? ,61
651,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"On e means of providing for a better distribution of our increased wealth is that embodied in' the new protection policy of the Labour Party which has been submitted to us today. The free-trader argues that he will increase the wealth of-the country by a system of free imports which will encourage primary industries. The protectionist on the other hand says that he desires to increase the wealth of the country by protection, through the Customs House, which is designed to* encourage local manufactures.",61
652,Mr WILSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Whic h principle does the honourable member advocate ?,62
653,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I repeat that the great problem before us today is one not so much of increasing the wealth bf the country by either free-trade or protection as it is of securing a better distribution of the wealth already produced.,62
654,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"How would the sicknoss honourable member do that? Would he ' The CHAIRMAN take away the wealth from those who ready possess it? - Mr JH CATTS - I would secure the Chair? more equitable distribution by means of Conciliation and Arbitration Courts, by system of new protection, and by other methods that are calculated to secure better wages for the workers. Mr Coghlan places die private wealth of Australia day at about £[1,200,000,000, but he adsir, mits that some forms.bf wealth are' not included in that calculation. Mr Nash, the financial editor of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, who is regarded as an auWales, thority, estimates the total private wealth saysof Australia today at something like £[4,000,000,000. According to Mr Coghexistent lan's estimate, the average wealth. of the average community is £[250 per head of the poputhe lation, while according to Mr Nash's estibenefit mate it is equal to £ 1 , 0 0 0 per head population. The private wealth of New South Wales is put down at £[375,000,006. It is stated by the Statistician of New South Wales that one-half of that wealth is held by less than 3,000 individuals, and not properly arrange for his housing ac fhat nearly 20 per cent, of the owners of reside, outside the State. From this would appear that the wealth of New South Wales per head of the population is about £ 2 7 5 . The fact that it is so great is out to those in the old country ducement to come to Australia. Then again, last year the increase of wealth in New South' Wales amounted to to £[13,000,000, and I have no doubt .that was correspondingly great in all the year Staites, since prosperity was general. ,Mr. JOSEPH COOK - The honourable member's statements' are not received with the cheers with which they were met when he uttered them on a public platform.",62
655,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Every one knows that in this House and elsewhere the honor- able member is noted for the cheap sneers and sarcasm in which he indulges.,62
656,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I am always misunderstood.,62
657,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The increase in the wealth of New South Wales last year, amounting, as I have said, to £""13,000,000, is a huge sum, but the consequential benefit to the people is not what it should have been. We find that in New South Wales £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 00 0 per annum is spent on charities and on pensions.

In yesterday's issue of the Sydney Daily Telegraph there appears a leading article on the housing of the poor, in which it is shown that the average working man can1 it commodation. Having regard to the great it increase in our wealth production, it is startling to learn that, in a young country like this, the average citizen cannot proheld vide a decent home for himself, nor make as an inprovision against sickness.",62
659,Mr LIVINGSTON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Whose fault is that? ' Mr JH CATTS - We are certainly blame for allowing the increased wealth it in New South Wales, amounting in one to £[13,000,000, to go into the pockets of the few, whilst the great majority receive no benefit from that increased production and the good seasons we are now enjoying. Instead of trying to increase our wealth by free-trade or protection, we ought rather to turn our attention to a better distribution of the immense wealth which is already being produced.",62
660,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Meantime , we have to consider this Tariff. . Mr JH CATTS - I hope that in the Tariff we shall make provision that part of the benefits which are supposed to arise from it, will pass into the pockets of the workers and the consumers generally, instead of into the pockets of one particular class. For that purpose, the party to which I belong have submitted a scheme of new protection, which the leader of the Opposition today admitted to be the first of its kind introduced, so far as he knew, into any Parliament in the world.",63
661,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,He did not say that it was going to be successful.,63
662,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The right honourable gentleman said he sympathized with its objects, that deficiencies were found in working out every reform, and that experiments had to be made before absolute success could be reached.",63
663,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Did he say that he was going to vote for these duties on the strength of it?,63
664,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I do not know that he went that far. . If he did, he would say it in such a way that when he came to the items he could very conveniently wriggle out of the statement he had made. The Labour Party has introduced a new protection system, and propose to carry out the scheme as follows-That, with a view to insuring fair working conditions in protected industries, duty stamps (of a value to be determined) should be affixed to all protected' goods not bearing the Commonwealth trade mark. The Commonwealth trade mark may be applied to goods which are manufactured under conditions as to the remuneration of labour prescribed by an industrial award, decision, determination or agreement under any industrial law (Federal or State), or in of which a resolution has been passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, or regulation issued by any competent authority, declaring that the conditions as to the remuneration of labour are fair and reasonable.",63
665,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Tak e it as read.,63
666,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It is not I , then, that detain honourable members. If I talked against timeas the honourable member for Lang does on hundreds of occasions, there might be some reason for him to interrupt me now. The scheme proceedsIn fixing the amount of stamp duty to be levied on specified goods, consideration to be given to the degree of protection afforded by the Tariff, the average cost of labour involved, and the value of the article affected. Then we propose to protect the consumer in the following manner1. That, with a view to protecting the consumer, a permanent commission be created to inquire into and report upon the prices charged for locally produced goods, having regard to the cost of raw materials, wages paid, hours worked by employees, rate of import duty and other essential factors. 2. That such commission be empowered to use the resources of the Statistician's"" office and the Customs department to facilitate its inquiries, and be also authorized to employ expert officers to prosecute special investigations. T,. That, in the event of such commission reporting that unfairly high prices are being charged in respect of goods the product of aprotected industry, and recommending the reduction of the import duty, the Governor General may, on resolution of both Houses, reduce the duty to the extent recommended. I was very pleased to hear from the Acting Prime Minister today that he had very largely followed the scheme outlined by the Labour Party.",63
667,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,He knew he had to.,63
668,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I do not say that at all. It is the duty of the Opposition to say anything, and generally to mean nothing. The Acting Prime Minister, in setting out his scheme, followed that outlined by the Labour Party to a large extent by stating that the Excise duty was to be imposed along with the Tariff, and that half the amount of duty was to be chargeable by a stamp duty upon those goods which were not manufactured under fair and reasonable conditions of labour, the exemption to be made to those who pay fair and reasonable rates. It is to be applied by affixing the Commonwealth trade mark, which is referred to in the Labour Party's scheme, to goods which are manufactured under those conditions. It will be most advantageous to Australia as a whole to know from the trade mark or respect union label-o r whatever honourable members like to call it-affixe d to goods, that those goods have been made under fair and reasonable conditions, and are not the product of sweated factories.",63
669,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,- The new protection' can only be imposed after the duties have been voted.,63
670,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Exactly .,63
671,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I presume that the honourable member is going to support the duties and the new protection.,63
672,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The honourable member need not be too eager in his presumptions. When the items are reached I shall take up the attitude which I think best. I do not feel called upon now to make a statement which the honourable member will make use of afterwards. A new tribunal is to be set up on lines similar to those suggested in the Labour Party's scheme, consisting of what is termed a Board of Excise. Three members are to be appointed, and the Acting Prime Minister states that the Chairman is to be a gentleman of legal attainments. as a rule, it is better to keep the purely technical man off Boards which inquire into conditions of labour, I appreciate the value of having as Chairman of that Commission a highly-trained legal gentleman who would be able to dissect evidence. So long as he has the assistance of experts in the trades, I do not see that any disadvantage can ensue to the great masses ot the working people. The powers which will be given to the Board have not been dealt with, in detail, but the House will be able, when considering the question, to fix the detailed conditions under which the Board shall work. I hope that when that time comes we shall exclude lawyers from advocating the claims of either side before the Board, and also provide that there shall be no appeal from the Board's decision. In all bhese cases the decision of the Board which hears the evidence ought to be final. To enable those who are wealthy enough to pay for legal assistance to appeal from the decision of the Board which hears, the evidence to some other tribunal, on purely technical grounds, always results disastrously to the working man.",63

Mr JH CATTS:-In that State there were only two classes of candidates-thos e who fought under the banner of the Labour Party, and those who declared themselves to be anti-Socialists. The employers did not support the Labour candidates, and, of therefore, I can only assume that they supported the anti-Socialists.",64
687,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The honourable said member got more support from the emplovers than did his opponent.,64
688,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,My opponent was the chairman of the Importers Association of Sydney. I am quite sure that the imto be porters accorded him their support.,64

I hope that then at the next' elections he will again contest the electorate which I represent, and that the result will be - equally satisfactory to me. The honourable member for Echuca has referred to the constitutional aspect of the new protection proposals, and it is significant that the employers, who have plenty of representatives in this House, have already taken up a very firm attitude in that connection. The Sydney Daily Telegrafh of 4th September, 1907, records that the Employers' Council recently agreed to the following motionThat this Council strongly protests against the stated intentions of the Federal Government to attempt to obtain what is called "" n e w "" protection by regulation of wages, conditions of labour and prices of goods on the ground that the .Commonwealth Parliament has no constitutional power to deal 'with these matters, such measures as the Excise Tariff - Act being plainly in contravention of section 55 of the Constitution. This Council also considers that the passage of such illegal enactments is misleading io' the public, and' wishes to point out that it has already involved and must lead to further and almost endless litigation, thereby causing heavy law expenditure in order to prove their invalidity. Who attempts to prove their invalidity but the Employers' Federation?",64
691,Mr JOHNSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"When I moved last year that the increased measure of protection granted to the agricultural implement industry should be disbursed amongst the employees in that industry, the party to which the honourable member belongs voted against it.",65
692,Mr JH CATTS,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Eac h member of the party to which I belong is at liberty to adopt an independent attitude upon the fiscal question. Consequently it is idle for the honourable member to endeavour to impose upon me with a wolf and lamb story of that sort. What was done bysomebody else upon this question is no concern of mine. The Employers' Federation have indicated that they intend to test the validity of the new protection. Evidently they desire increased duties for their own benefit, and are disinclined to allow their operatives to participate in that benefit. If I did not think that we can bring this new protection scheme into operation I should not be in favour of protecting industries at all.",65

What is the basis upon which the people of Australia are willing to bear these burdens though the rates of. duty may be varied? We know what has happened in America.

If revenue has to be raised through the Customs House, I would rather see it raised by means of duties upon silks and satins than upon such commodities as tea. If we are to have ad valorem duties on such goods as jewellery, I would rather see them imposed on the more expensive kinds than first have heavy duties upon alarm clocks. I do not believe in a policy which would raise revenue from those who are least able to bear it . That is why I do not believe, as a general principle, in raising revenue through the Customs House.

If we are going tain our White Australia policy and keep out the coloured races, we should go to logical extent of that principle. decide not to allow coloured men to come into Australia to undercut our producers, and to work under conditions to which do not subscribe, we ought not to allow their goods to come in and compete with those produced by our workmen. In other words, if we stop the coloured man from coming into Australia, we should be pretude of items. pared to give our own workmen sufficient protection to enable them to compete with the products of coloured workmen in other titude of sins. parts of the world.",67

735,Mr THOMAS BROWN,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"To my mind, it covers a multitude of sins, It consists of hundreds of items, some of minor, and others of major, In the latter class come the tobacco duties, to which . reference manuwas made by the honourable member the for Angas. We are informed that a number of tobacco factories which recently were in full work are now closed because of the uncertainty respecting the action of Parliament in reference to the Tariff, and that a large number of workmen are, therefore, Another important item is the duty on wire netting. Wire netis an article of vital necessity to many with of our primary producers. So far as one can judge by the' opinions already expressed, a large number of honourable mem! bers, although pledged to protection, feel f that they cannot support a duty upon it, so that probably the Committee will either destrike off the duty or largely reduce it. In New South Wales a considerable of imported wire netting, some of which, was brought in by the State Governparts ment, is now being withheld from use pending the decision of this Parliament in regard to the duty. But if a large number of growers are to save their crops, they must very speedily fence their holdings with wire netting. Importers and users alike are now in a state of great uncertainty hy reason of our delay. Therefore, I join with the honourable member for Angas in urging upon the Government that these aind other items of major importance, shall be dealt with before items of minor importance. If the Government deal first with items of major importance, they will consider the best interests of the country, and will provide for the passing of the Tariff with the least friction possible. am prepared to support the Treasurer in dealing with the Tariff in sections, so that when this House has passed a section it may be forwarded to the Senate for,consideration, with the result that the utmost expedition will be obtained, and this troublesome piece of legislation settled as speedily as possible. Mr. JOSEPH COOK' (Parramatta) [9.42] - I should not have risen had I not wished to say a word or two about the new protection proposals outlined by the Treasurer. But before doing' so, I wish to ask him what is to be done in regard to part VI . of the Tariff. I understood him to say that he had alternative proposals to make in regard to the production of iron, to encourage which he was determined to impose a duty or to grant a bounty ",67
736,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,That is so.,68
737,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"He also said that the Prime Minister favours the granting of a 'bounty in preference to the imposition of a ""duty, inasmuch as iron enters into the composition of so many articles that it would be undesirable at the present time to increase the cost of so universal a raw product. He proposed first of all to deal with it by way of a bonus. He has in his Tariff a division which is to be conditioned by a report from the Executive to Parliament, and I presume the passing of a resolution concerning it by Parliament.",68
738,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I did not say that. What I said was that I should try first to get an Iron Bounties Bill passed, and if I failed, I should f all back on divisions VI . A and VI . B of the Tariff.",68

He has already told us that it will deal with most of the items in those two divisions, and therefore we practically know what it will contain.

748,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Not until we get to division VI . A . Mr. JOSEPH COOK' - Is it the intention of the Government, when we get to that division, to susoend the consideration of the Tariff while he attempts to put through the Iron Bounties Bill?",68
749,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Perhaps we may not be able to put the Bill through; but' we shall ask the Committee to say whether we are to have bounties or Customs duties.,68
750,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"That is practically the same thing. May I remind the Minister, that when he has taken the opinion of this House on the Bill , the other House will have to be consulted. Does he intend, to take the opinion of the Senate concurrently ?",68
751,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,As soon as the. Bill is passed here it wil l go to the other House.,68
752,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Is the consideration of the Tariff to be suspended until the other House has passed the Bill ?,68
753,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The member will find that the Bill , if passed here, will be dealt with one way or the other in the Senate before we get to the end of division VI . A .",69
754,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I very much doubt that. I should think that the Senate will have good ground to delay the consideration of the Bill until it knows exactly what we are doing in regard to Customs duties on metals and machinery.,69
755,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,If it becomes necessary a division can be postponed until the Bill has been dealt. with one way or the other.,69
756,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,That is a practical proposition. The honourable gentleman always gets suspicious when we are asking for information. think that we are trving to play a trick upon him. It is an absurd notion for him tc get into his head. I understand when we' get to the division relating to metals and machinery he will introduce Iron Bounties Bill .,69
757,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Ver y likely it will be introduced before then.,69
758,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I am not pressing the honourable gentleman to make a definite engagement because I know that ber applies to me. that must depend upon circumstances. I understand his intention to be that when we get to division VI . A he will postpone its man. consideration pending the passage or otherwise of the Iron Bounties Bill . ',69
759,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I look upon that division as part and parcel of the Tariff. I shall pive the Committee an opportunitv, the honourable member for Cook. if it desires, to deal with, the question bounties, and if it does not adopt that method then we shall have the machinery in the Tariff for putting on the duties.",69
760,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Whil e the. Bill fence. is being considered the honourable gentlecertainly man will suspend the consideration of the him. iron duties.,69

The right honourable gentleman is in the same position as are other honourable members. He requires more light on the subject. I wish to say as emphatically as I am able, that we should not only have particulars of the old protection set before us iri a schedule, but we should, at the same time, have before us particulars of the new protection also set out in a schedule. Each is supposed to be supplementary to.the other. As they have, been - outlined by the' Acting Prime Minister, they represent the two halves' of the same sphere. Mr F.ISHER - But the Constitution provides that they must be introduced and dealt with separately. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I am not talking of that, ibut of the necessity of having .the protectionist proposals of the Government fully before us before we begin to - consider the details. I wonder why these proposals could not have been stated in k schedule or laid before honourable members in the form of a Bill?",71
814,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,-They wil l be - and-by.,72
815,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,When ? The honourable gentleman has already told us that that will be done after the Tariff has ibeen dealt with. - Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I did not say it - would be done after the Tariff is dealt - with. I said that the proposals would not the finally dealt with until after we had - dealt with the Tariff. It is probable they will be submitted to the House during the'consideration of the Tariff. The orable member is very unfair.,72
816,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It takes a long time to get this information.

Some things are so obvious that it is unnecessary to state them. So far have been able to follow the proposals of the neAv protection, as outlined leader of the Labour Party, in a much Excise Acts do. more lucid way than they have been outlined ' today by the Acting Minister",72
823,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The leader of the Labour Party did not outline them as applied to the Tariff.,72
824,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The Acting Prime Minister has said today, only in a very much worse way, what the leader of the Labour Party said the other day. So far as I am 'able to apprehend the situation, the honourable' gentleman has submitted a. very imperfect and incomplete statement of the whole question. As the honourable member for. North Sydney said, this is evidently the sugar-coating of the protectionist pill which the government are byasking the Committee - and the country to swallow. All our medicine today is sugarcoated; but honourable members who take sugar-coated pills are aware that very often their effects last long after the sugar-coating ^s dissolved. I make the bold prediction that the sugar-coating of this new protection will have dissolved within a short time after the attempt is made to apply the policy practically to our industrial life. that The more I consider the matter the more I fai l to"" see how such a scheme can be honworkable so long as human nature is what it is. I therefore believe, that when the sugar-coating has been dissolved it will be found that the old protection will , remain with whatever it may have in store for the workers and consumers of the communitv. We have been told that an Excise Bill is ""to be brought down, and that those who do not subscribe to the new protection, those l who do not pay fair wages, and sell their to be productions at a fair price",72

826,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I am paraus - phrasing what the honourable gentleman did. Those who do not subscribe to the protection will have to pay an Excise duty of one half the amount of the Tariff,72

In the event of the Board re' porting that fair prices are not being charged to the consumer, I am trying to get from the Minister the extent of the remedy he proposes to apply. orable gentieman says now that the only remedy he has ' in contemplation is a reduction of the Customs duty on the article.",73

The necessity for asking them a proof that the matter has not been put before the Committee - It has been submitted in a way which has only mystified honourable members. that a great deal more information be required before the new protection is put into practical operation. Sir WILLIAM LYNE member should not bellow about it so,73
841,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I direct the tention of the Labour Party, whose this is supposed to be, to the fact that Minister says that we' should not talk about it too soon, or, I presume, until get a long way on with the of the Tariff.",73

I am anxious only to know what is in the mind of the Government.,73
843,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I am not going to be catechised about it at the present time. another I have given the honourable member and the Committee a. great deal of information.,73
844,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"The honourable gentleman has made a statement which I Ex- am sorry to say does not amount to much. Par- I say that there will be the greatest posown sible difficulty in carrying out the proposals bf the Government, either .with regard to wages or with regard to prices. It is open the to one of the difficulties pointed out in confair nexion with the last Excise proposals of only the Government, and which was proved to hon- be only too real, and is bound to follow Cus- in connection with any proposals of this kind. When we set out to regulate prices we must be logical, reasonable and effective, and in controlling them there on? must be some stipulation as fo the quality of the article on which a particular price 'is fixed. Take the case of harvesters. The Excise Tariff (Agricultural Machinery) Bill provided that the price should be reduced to £ 6 5 per machine.",73
845,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"And that is the price this year.

852,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Of course they do; that is the point I am making. There"" is nothing in the Act to prevent these people regulating the value of their machine to the price which the Government compel them to charge. Unless the Government by Statute guarantee to the consumer that the quality of the article will be maintained that must necessarily occur. All this talk about reducing prices is mere moonshine. The Government might compel manufacturers to sell at a cheaper price, but at the same time they would afford them an opportunity to make a cheaper machine, and give them a monopoly ot the market in which to sell that machine. I should like to see that point met by the Acting Prime Minister 'in connection with these new proposals, otherwise they will never be effective. I fear that when Ministers set out to try to regulate all the prices and all the labour of the community they will Undertake a job the complexity of which would baffle a man much superior to any ever born upon this planet. I know of no three men who are wise enough and capacious enough to grasp, and control, and harmonize all the industrial occupations of the country, as well as to attend to all the ramifications of the distribution of the country. In dealing with the question of regulating prices one has only to look at a statement made by the Prime Minister himself when discussing this question at the Imperial Conference a few weeks ago. The honourable gentleman went on to sayand I quote these remarks because they are very appropriate to the matter now underconsiderationMarkets vary everywhereand in speaking of markets he referred, of course, to pricestuid under - circumstances, too many even to indicate, merchants are accustomed to sell sometimes in - good and sometimes in only indifferent markets. That is a very pregriant. statement; showing that the Prime Minister, at least, has an appreciation of the difficulties which we have to face when we set out to control' the prices to be charged in the various markets of Australia. Prices differ in everv State,- and for reasons which are peculiar to every State - I go further, and say they differ widely within every State- ' and in almost every town bf-every 'State. - - Mr Mauger - The fact that they differ will show that there is no combination. Tariff. 4031",74
853,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I am not speaking of a combination. The Government set out to do more than inquire whether or not a combination exists. They set out to guarantee to the consumers that they will not be charged excessive prices. They cannot do that unless they have such machinery as will enable them to follow the goods into every town and every hamlet of Australia, so as to know precisely what the consumer pays at the point where he parts with his cash. The honourable member knows that the cost of goods at the end of a railway line, or on a railway line, may be 20 per cent, less than it is 20 mile's inland, whither the goods have to be conveyed by carriers.",74
854,Mr MAUGER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,That fact will be considered.,74
855,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"It will have to be if the Government are' going to fix the price to the consumer; but, inasmuch as they cannot by any machinery known to us, follow all these ramifications of trade in their details, they will never be able to guarantee that the consumers will have to pay only a fair price. The honourable member, and, indeed, the Government, admit that, under their fair price proposition, all they need do is to make inquiries in the cities. That, I believe, was the statement made the other day by the honourable mem1 ber for South Sydney, when discussing this matter.",74
856,Mr MAUGER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,He was speaking of manufacturers.,74
857,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"There is a great deal of difference between manufacturing goods and' selling them in a wholesale way and retailing them to, the consumer. The Government give no guarantee to the consumer when they simply take care that the goods which leave the manufacturer's hands at a reasonable price shall be sold to the consumer at a reasonable price. One of the complaints most loudly uttered in connection with this very Tariff is that prices are unduly inflated and raised to the consumer, and that neither the manufacturer nor the Tariff has anvthing whatever to do with that increase. Clearly, if the Government are to give any relief to the consumer, as they set out to do by this machinery,' they will have to follow the goods to the point where he begins to take delivery in return for his cash. That is a task which cannot be compassed by any three men or 300 or 3,000 men throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Therefore this proposal will be'a practical nullity when an attempt is made to put it into force.",74
858,Mr MAUGER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,The honourable member is building up a wall and knocking it. Parliament down again.,75
859,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,NO ; he is trying - Mr WATSON to knock some one else down..,75
860,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I am not building any w all ; I am trying to look at the facts as they appear to me. We cannot protect the consumer until we know what the consumer is doing at the point where he parts with his cash and gets his goods. fixing them. If the Government confine their operations to the manufacturer in the city, and merely inquire whether or not there is a combine there, we shall have no guarantee that pose he wiil get them at a fair price. Government will have something more do before they can fix prices and wages. Might I remind honourable members that the industrial conditions of Australia by no means uniform.",75
861,Mr FISHER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,-Unfortunately .,75
862,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Unfortunatel y tells or otherwise, there is the fact - For stance, it has been brought to light by the reports of the Tariff Commission that gineers in Western Australia receive an average weekly wage of 12s. more than is paid to engineers in Victoria. I suppose that there is a variance again between the wages received by the mechanic in Viclegitimate toria and those paid to the mechanic Tasmania. What are these three men to do with regard to fixing the general rates of wages all over Australia? While there is this huge difference in the wages paid for the same kind of work in Australia there is a common Tariff operating all the Commonwealth. The man in Western whole continent. Australia, who pays 12s. a week more than is paid in Victoria, will .same Tariff protection as is afforded to the man in Tasmania, who pays £ 1 a week less than he does.",75

869,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"And , therefore, it is simply quibbling with terms to say that the Commissionwill have no control overprices.",75
870,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I said that it would not attempt to regulate prices in the sense of,75

I supi t would indicate in its report the exThe tent to which they are extortionate, and, to therefore, would indicate unmistakably what is a fair price, and we should hebound to accept its recommendations. How are otherwise can it be said that the Commission will act, if not in the direction of regulating prices ? It must do so. It cannot say that a price is extortionate unless it us to what extent it is extortionate. inBy so much' as the price is extortionate, just so surely and accurately will it indiencate to us what a fair price would be. Therefore, if we are to act upon the Commission's reports, it follows that it wiU actually, if not technically, fix prices.",75

878,Mr WEBSTER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,Canno t we discuss these details when we get the Bill?,76
879,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"f h e honourable member may do so if he chooses, but I want to tell him very plainly that these seem to be insuperable objections to carrysuccess ing out the scheme.",76

It would take an army of employees, and then they would not do it. It would be the easiest thing in the world for the whole of the traders and manufacout turers of the continent to evade the utmost watchfulness of any three men who are lawsgiven the task of operating over so large area. I , therefore, predict that this business will break down the moment come to apply it in practice over a continent such as ours. You cannot do it even in a State with all the means you have at command. What is happening in Victoria? You cannot stop sweating. You minimize it, it may be, with infinite effort, infinite labour, infinite vigilance, with a great deal of goodwill and altruistic sentiment to boot, but there is still an abundance of even in this State.",76

I decline to shut my eyes and swallow the scheme has been bad. in the belief that by some mysterious process-som e miracle-it is going to be operative. The one thing that will be operative will be, not the new, but the protection. I am afraid that the workers either. of this country will live a long while before any new protection comes home to fection. them in their domestic conditions from any such proposals as are now put before us. Already we have done our very best in conof nexion with other matters to make some modicum of this scheme apply, and, after trying it , we have, to-night, to confess its failure.",76

889,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"I know that it is not. But any proposal which means the constant hauling before the Courts throughthe length and. breadth of Australia of men who will not voluntarily obey these I will not put it in that way at all an of men who may mistakenly break these Excise laws, and plead that they cannot help you themselves, is not going to be of much benefit to the workers, of this country. I should f ar rather leave it to some-tribunal your which would get away from lawyers and law courts, as of infinitely more benefit to the workers than those Statutes which can only be interpreted in a Court of law. So far, our experience of trying to protect the workers of Australia has not turned out it as it should have done. As the honourable member for South Sydney knows, I supported willingly and cordially the Bill for the establishment of the Arbitration Court of New South Wales. I do not believe that be very it has been a success at all.",76

898,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"No man criti- cised that Bill more legitimately and strongly that the present the Opposition. He was the man in that Parliament who pointed out that the very thing of all others that ought not to be done was to involve the workers of the country in the meshes of the law. I voted for the Bill in the belief that it would bring capital and labour together in harmonious relations. But instead of doing that, it has acted as a wedge between these two forces, and I say, without hesitation, that the feeling between them today is more rancorous and bitter than it was before the Court was set up. A man is blind who does not see that.",77
899,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,I think that the man who says it is prejudiced. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I do not think that I am at all prejudiced.,77

Underlying all these proposals for the application of the new protection by a machinery method-by the appointment of three Commissioners-ther e is the false assumption that conditions throughout Australia are fairly equal. That is precisely what we know they are not.

902,Mr FISHER,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"Will the task be more difficult than that of paying our civil servants higher rates when they live in certain localities? Mr JOSE PH COOK - It will be infinitelv more difficult. In connection with our Public Service we have laid down the rule that officers doing the same work shall be paid the same salary, plus a living allowance for climatic reasons only.",77
903,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,There are reasons which operate.,77
904,Mr WATSON,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,There is the cost of living as the result of expensive haulage.,77
905,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,"In the case of Western Australia, but that is about all. the lawyers I believe that the living allowance is fixed at a uniform rate. We do not pay an officer in Victoria a different salary from that paid to the officer in New South Wales leader of who discharges the same duties, although one the cost of living may be dearer in one State than in the other. But to regulate the payment to our civil servants, we have had to unify conditions generally andbroadly. That is what we cannot do in connection with industrial matters under our Constitution. I have some other observations to make, but I shall reserve them until another occasion. We are, I understand, to have these proposals crystallized in a Bill or memorandum. Which is it to be ?",77

909,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERCENTAGES OF CUSTOMS DUTY COLLECTED TO VALUES OF GOODS IMPORTED,It may be. Shall I sav that it is mutual again ? Whatever the Treasurer says the honourable member for Gwydir says ditto. Everybody knows that the honourable member is tied to the coat tails of the Treasurer.,77

We shall have to wait, I presume, to ascertain in what form the proposals of the Government will be embodied in a Bill .

I do not see my way to give my adhesion to the principles^ of the new protection until they have been placed in a concrete form before us, and until we are able to get to close grips with the proposals of the Ministry.
