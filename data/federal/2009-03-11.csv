1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Harry Jenkins) took the chair at 9 am and read prayers. NA Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Singapore and Indonesia,17
2,The SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS,"For the information of honourable members, I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Singapore and Indonesia, 28 October to 8 November 2008. In commencing my remarks, I extend my sincere thanks to my fellow delegation members: the deputy leader of the delegation, the member for Mackellar, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop; the shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, the member for Murray, the Hon. Dr Sharman Stone; the member for Newcastle and chair of the public accounts committee, Ms Sharon Grierson; and the member for Blair, Mr Shayne Neumann. All delegates were enthusiastic participants in the visit, and each contributed significantly to the purpose of the delegation visit in a spirit of bipartisanship and goodwill. I thank them all for their contribution. The bilateral visit to Singapore formed the first leg of our journey, from 28 October to 1 November. The warm reception received from the parliament and government of Singapore left us in no doubt as to the continuing strength of our relationship with this important regional partner, and the visit vided an excellent opportunity to renew and reinforce these ties at all levels. Discussions with the Singaporean ministers and officials addressed topics of great relevance and timeliness, including water resource management, industrial relations, defence and security, scientific research and development, air services and the global financial crisis. Deledone gates found the frank and informative discussions on the financial crisis with representatives of the Monetary Authority of Singapore to be of particular benefit, while all were impressed by Singapore's innovative and highly coordinated approach to water supply and management. While in Singapore, the delegation visited Kranji War Cemetery, where over 2,500 Australian war dead are buried or commemorated. Delegates laid a wreath at the Singapore Memorial in honour of those who lost their lives. All were moved by the stark beauty of the site and by the great sacrifice made by men and women of all ages and nationalities in the defence of our region. The delegation's visit to Indonesia began with a friendly Sunday soccer match in Jakarta between staff of the Australian embassy and a team from the local newspaper Rakyat Merdeka. Delegates were ably represented on the field by the member for Blair, who, being a Queenslander, was prepared to brave the tropical heat and soaring humidity. Despite his best efforts, however, Rakyat Merdeka ultimately triumphed-four goals to three. During its time in Jakarta, the delegation was very cordially received by the President of the Republic of Indonesia, His Excellency Dr Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and the Vice President, His Excellency Jusuf Kalla. Discussions with the head of state and his deputy addressed a range of topics of bilateral significance, including efforts to very combat climate change and the important pro- role played by parliaments in maintaining strong connections between countries. Valuable talks were also held with Indonesian foreign minister, Dr Hassan Wirajuda. The delegation also attended the 20th anniversary of the Australia-Indonesia Institute at which foreign minister Wirajuda made the key speech acknowledging the valuable work by the institute in building the relationships between our two countries. At a parliamentary level, the delegation had informative discussions with the three speakers of the Indonesian parliament and with members of the Committee for InterParliamentary Cooperation of the House of Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia. This was a valuable opportunity to learn about the Indonesian parliamentary system and to discuss the many elements of parliamentary life shared with our Indonesian counterparts. Delegates who had previously visited Indonesia noted that the relationship had strengthened significantly in recent years-a view shared by a number of our hosts. Australia's assistance to Indonesia in the wake of the 2004 tsunami and the losses suffered by both nations as a consequence of the 2002 Bali bombings were identified as factors that had served to deepen the friendship through shared awareness of tragedy. The very ability to raise and discuss difficult topics, such as the execution of the Bali bombers and Australia's travel advisory in relation to Indonesia, was in itself seen as a positive aspect of the relationship. The final leg of the delegation's journey took us to the province of Central Kalimantan in Borneo, where we were able to take a first hand look at some of the outstanding work being done under bilateral initiatives such as the Indonesia-Australia Forest Carbon Partnership and the Australia-Indonesia Basic Education Program. The delegation was impressed by the excellent flagship rehabilitation work being carried out in an area of previously cleared peatland forest in Sebangau National Park and by the labour of love being undertaken by the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, which is reintroducing captive and orphaned orangutans to the wild. The chance to attend the official opening of Katingan Hilir 5 Junior Secondary School in the village of Kasongan Lama was a highlight of our visit. The new public school, constructed under the Australia-Indonesia Basic Education Program, can accommodate up to 240 students. It significantly enhances the educational opportunities for less well-off children in the Katingan District, which has had a lower-thannational-average secondary school enrolment rate. In closing, on behalf of the delegation, I wish to thank the Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore, Mr Abdullah Tarmugi, and his staff; the speakers of the Parliament of Indonesia, Dr M Hidayat Nur Wahid of the MPR and his staff, Mr HR Agung Laksono of the DPR, and Dr Ginandjar Kartasasmita of the DPD. I would also like to thank Mr Doug Chester, Australian High Commissioner to Singapore, and his staff, including Dr Lucinda Bell; Mr Bill Farmer, Australian Ambassador to Indonesia, and his staff, in particular Dr Stephen Barraclough, Jeffie Cane and Emma Wilson; the delegation secretary, Ms Vivienne Courto; Fiona Way from the PRO; and our AFP liaison agent, Wayne Smith. On a personal note, I would like to thank my senior adviser, Christopher Paterson, for his guidance. I commend the report to the House.",17
3,Dr STONE,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I rise to add my comments to those of the Speaker, as one of the delegates on the official parliamentary delegation to Singapore and Indonesia from 28 October to 8 November last year. The overall impression left by this time away was that our near neighbours share very common concerns with us in Australia and that this regular face-to-face communication between the government members of Singapore, Indonesia and Australia and also their senior officials is important. We were treated with great friendship and respect wherever we went. We really do appreciate the hospitality that was extended to us. At all times we felt that we were working together in a region of the world which is very challenged by climate change, by ecosystems under great stress and by the issues of urban congestion, traffic, water needs and the like. At all times our exchanges were friendly and frank, with no topics out of order and with everybody willing to explore and talk about issues that ers might imagine are too delicate to even address. In Indonesia, we travelled to central Kalimantan to observe the enormous challenges of rehabilitating burnt and drained peat based rainforest zones. This is an enormous area. has been described as the ‘lungs of the world', and it is under challenge regularly from fires. We are pleased that Australia has been providing some funding not only to try to help rehabilitate this area but also for technology, information and intelligence transfer. This journey away from Java, to a region far from the Indonesian capital, and one of the most remote of the Dayak villages, also gave us a unique appreciation of the challenges of the distances in Indonesia. The tyranny of distance is often described as an Australian challenge alone, but it is also very much a challenge for Indonesia. They have to provide employment, health and education services to places where, in this case, only boat access is possible. When we reached this village, the Speaker participated in ceremonies and services in ways which were very much appreciated by the village headman. The hospitality extended to the Australians at that Dayak village left us a lasting impression of shared humanity and a shared interest in the basics of life-access to education, health, good food and a healthy ecosystem. The delegation allowed us to meet with like-minded, recently elected and veteran members of parliament and the parliamentary leadership in both countries. We were, as the Speaker has said, particularly honoured to meet with the President of Indonesia, His Excellency Dr Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Vice President, His Excellency Jusuf Kalla. Meeting with the speakers and deputy speakers of both countries' parliaments was also a great honour. An objective of the delegation was to reothnew links between Australia and Indonesia and Australia and Singapore, and their national parliaments in particular. We also aimed to gain an appreciation of contemporary political, economic and social issues, to review the bilateral relationships between It Australia and Singapore and Australia and Indonesia with a view to furthering growth in trade and investment with Singapore and, finally, to gain a greater appreciation of the strategies being adopted by Singapore and Indonesia in dealing with the global economic situation. In Singapore, we also focused on their sustainable potable water to strategy-an issue that challenges us in most of our capital cities-and in Indonesia, as I said, we gained an insight into the work of AusAID and some NGOs in relation to providing new schools in needy areas and also the peatland rehabilitation in Kalimantan. Singapore is Australia's largest trade and investment partner in ASEAN and our fifth largest trading partner globally. More than 1,300 Australian companies are operating in Singapore, and our investment in Singapore is approximately A$17 billion. My youngest daughter and her family are now resident in Singapore, and I have been there very rewith cently. I am in awe of how they are managing, despite the global downturn, to keep confidence in their business sector and to work actively and positively towards their downturn being very short. Singapore is committed to maintaining regional political and economic security and enjoys access to Australian military training and land and base facilities for exercising. This has helped to forge close strategic and long-lasting relationships. This was discussed in detail with our Singaporean counterparts. Of particular interest to me were the industrial relations and man-management issues relevant to the one million guest workers who are a feature of Singapore's construction, outdoor maintenance, and domestic and childcare sectors. Given that Australia has just initiated its first pilot of a guest worker program, Singapore's experience was very informative and relevant to us. Singapore, as a small city nation, has also been challenged to capture and recycle its population's water needs. While the technology to treat sewage to potable standards is not new, the way that Singapore has debunked preconceptions about the desirability of mixing treated effluent in their reservoirs and making it a very clean, sustainable potable supply provides, I think, a lesson for the rest of the world, particularly for Australia. The education of their school population about the need for them to recycle and use all of their water was very interesting and gave us valuable lessons about how we need to progress in Australia with using recycled water for potable needs as well as industrial use. In Indonesia, we travelled from the capital, Jakarta, to central Borneo, or Kalimantan, and we were able to share in the joy of opening a new school, funded by the Australia-Indonesia Basic Education Program. The opening of any school is a joy-but particularly so when it is in outback Kalimantan. It was a special privilege to be there and to see the facilities. These are facilities which in Australia would still be considered very basic; however, with the students' willingness to learn and teachers who are totally committed, there is no doubt that the education outcomes of that school will be excellent. I think all Australians should be proud that that program is continuing. Our Indonesian counterparts did not hold back their concerns about Australia's travel advisories and the fact that they continue to be in place in relation to travel in Indonesia. They were concerned about their continuing impact and that some tourists do not look beyond the official advice. In the case of the education program, it meant that there was less capacity for teacher exchanges, or indeed student exchanges, between Australia and Indonesia. I know this is a work in progress in our government's ongoing diplomatic work with Indonesia. I also want to talk briefly about the challenging work involved in the peatlands, or what were tropical rainforests, in what they like to call the ‘lungs of the world' in Kalimantan. It is distressing to see that recent pressures with palm oil prices have led the Indonesian government to rethink some of their targets for the further clearing of rainforest in this area-this has been reported in the last few days. We were hugely encouraged by the efforts of the locals and our AusAID funded NGOs, who were trying to find new ways to deal with the ongoing draining of these peatlands-the draining which has led to the drying out of the peat which in turn has led to its great vulnerability to fire. I also have to say that the orphaned orangutans tore at our heartstrings. We could all have taken them home. There were about 500 or 600 of them. They are a challenge to rehabilitate in what remains of the forest there. I left that delegation with a renewed understanding of how important our cross-party relationships are. As Labor and Liberal members of that delegation and with the Speaker as our leader, we worked absolutely as a team. We were committed together to building these relationships. I think that is always a very important part of such delegations, and one that worked particularly well on our delegation to Indonesia and Singapore. I want to thank our Speaker, who was a superb leader who often had to participate in ceremonies which were very foreign to him, in Dayak villages and other places involving eggs and assorted other activitiesanthropologically, very interesting! He did us proud. I know we left both Indonesia and Singapore with mutual respect and a greater understanding as a result of this delegation. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report. Leave granted.",18

5,Dr STONE,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I move: That the order of the day be referred to the Main Committee for debate. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (INTEGRATED PUBLIC NUMBER DATABASE) BILL 2009 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with amendments. Ordered that the amendments be considered immediately. Senate's amendments(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (line 15), after “a person”, insert “(the discloser)”. (2) Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (lines 22 to 28), omit paragraph 285A(1)(c), substitute: (c) the emergency management person has given the discloser a written notice stating that the disclosure the purpose of the information, or the contents of the document, being later used or disclosed for either or both of the following: (i) for a purpose connected with persons being alerted to an emergency or a likely emergency; (ii) for the purpose of reasonable testing of whether, in the event of an emergency occurring, persons would be able to be alerted to that emergency. (3) Schedule 1, item 2, page 4 (after line 28), after subsection 285A(1), insert: (1A) A notice given as mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) may cover one or more disclosures (including each disclosure in a series of disclosures under an arrangement between the discloser and the emergency management person). (1B) A notice given as mentioned in paragraph (1)(c) is not a legislative instrument.",21
6,Mr ALBANESE,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy introduced amendments in the Senate in relation to the bill yesterday, and these amendments were passed by the Senate. The proposed government amendments will make minor changes to the bill to strengthen the protections on the disclosure of information from the IPND. They will require specified emergency management persons to give a written notice to the discloser of IPND informationcurrently Telstra, as the IPND managerstating that they will use or disclose the information only for emergency warning purposes. The written notice approach provided in the proposed government amendment will provide confidence to the IPND managerTelstra, at the moment-that it may disclose is for IPND information to a prescribed emergency management person. This greater certainty is likely to speed the release of IPND data as well as to provide greater protection that it is being provided to the right person. This approach will also reduce the need for the IPND manager to expend time verifying the legitimacy of a request for IPND data in an emergency. The written notice process in the proposed government amendments has been tailored to fit with the existing provisions in the bill and to minimise potential delays to the release of IPND data in an emergency. The proposed government amendments will also add a clause to clarify that a single written notice will be able to cover a series of disclosures. This will allow an emergency management person to receive regular updates of IPND information. This arrangement is similar to arrangements currently in place that allow copies of the IPND to be used for 000 and law enforcement purposes. I commend these government amendments to the House.",21
7,Mr BILSON,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"The opposition supports these amendments and commends the government for embracing these sensible measures to protect against unintended disclosure.

NA Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the Republic of Serbia and InterParliamentary Union 119th Assembly 2008  sent the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Republic of Serbia and to the 119th Assembly of the InterParliamentary Union held in Geneva, Switzerland, 4 to 18 October 2008, and I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.  delegation, as it was the first Australian parliamentary delegation to visit the Republic of Serbia. As such, a major objective was to establish relations with the new Serbian parliament. This was achieved through a series of valuable and informative meetings held with the speaker and vice-speaker of the national assembly, with ministers, secretaries of state and political leaders. Serbia is a young democracy, and the delegation was impressed by the continuing efforts to develop and enhance democratic traditions. The delegation considers that Australia could provide assistance in strengthening parliamentary democracy by sponsoring exchanges of parliamentary staff and/or officials through AusAID programs or through the Australian parliament. The delegation was also impressed by the younger, welleducated, progressive and professional generation of ministers and political leaders that it met. They have great dedication and confidence in the future of their country and see membership of the EU as the way ahead. Two major issues were constantly raised during our meetings. The first was the move towards membership of the EU, which has strong support politically and within the population. The harmonisation of laws being undertaken across ministries to meet European requirements has the added result of bringing strong benefits economically and socially to Serbia. However, disappointment was expressed that the Dutch parliament continued to block further progress by refusing to ratify the EU Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, including all possible efforts to arrest and transfer indictees, is an essential element of the agreement. Serbia has been cooperating fully with The Hague Tribunal and European requirements by arresting and transferring to The Hague many people, including Radovan Karadzic. The delegation did not find evidence of any reluctance to pursue the two remaining indictees, including Ratko Mladic. The second major issue related to Kosovo. The delegation gained a deeper understanding of Serbia's position on the issue of Kosovo's independence and Serbia's perspective on the region. Serbia regards Kosovo as an integral part of its identity and remains very determined not to recognise Kosovo's independence. Significantly, Serbia chose to pursue its strong objections through diplomacy and the rule of law, which saw Kosovo's independence referred to the ICT by a United Nations vote during the delegation's visit. Serbia is very aware of its former image and is very keen that its commitment to and utilisation of international legal procedures will enhance its new image, emphasise its emerging democratic status and gain international respect. In addition to adopting proEuropean policies, Serbia remains committed to regional cooperation. It is actively involved in a range of regional organisations and initiatives. Serbia is in a position of strength within the Balkan region and is a key to stability in the region. It is important that the world community encourage and support a democratic and proWestern Serbia. The delegation also met with a range of people from across a broad spectrum of society. The delegation considers that there is significant potential for increased cooperation or bilateral agreements across many sectors. Trade is at very low levels and offers scope for development. The scientific, technological and educational sectors are areas where exchanges of information and expertise could provide significant benefits and development. In education the greatest potential exists at the tertiary level and especially in cooperation with research and the opportunity for student exchanges to pursue graduate or postgraduate study and research. The environmental and resources sectors also provide potential for assistance, especially in the areas of environmental protection and waste management. Culture and the arts are areas that could also benefit from Australian support and assistance, financial or otherwise. A highly developed and sophisticated artistic scene in Serbia is led by a number of extremely motivated and dynamic people. While artistic and theatrical troupes receive full support from the Serbian government, there is limited opportunity to travel, due to expense. The success of the delegation's visit was due to the dedicated work of many. I would like to thank Mrs Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic, Speaker of the national assembly, and all our Serbian hosts. Meeting Madam Speaker proved particularly invaluable, as both Madam Speaker and the delegation were attending the following week's IPU meeting in Geneva and both countries are members of the Twelve Plus geopolitical group at the IPU. I would especially like to thank Ambassador Claire Birgin, Melanie Davies and all the staff at the Australian embassy, who performed such an outstanding job in arranging such a comprehensive program of meetings, not just at the political and governmental levels but also with senior representatives from the educational, scientific, religious, artistic and cultural fields. To compile such program in a relatively short time frame is testimony to their professional capabilities, dedication and enthusiasm. Moving on to the Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting, a large section of time was devoted to the panel discussions on the subjects before the three standing committees. I was honoured to deliver the draft report and introduce the panel discussion on the subject considered by the First Standing Committee: ‘Advancing nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, and securing the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-TestBan Treaty: the role of parliaments'. It was a lively panel discussion, with some 50 speakers representing many countries contributing to the debate and a number of others who had wished to contribute not being able to do so by the expiration of the discussion time. Considerable interest was generated by the draft report, with a range of issues being raised and many comments being made during the debate. These have been taken into consideration as the report has been redrafted and a preliminary resolution prepared for submission and finalisation at the next IPU meeting in April 2009, which, Mr Speaker, you will lead. The issue of admitting Palestine to membership of the IPU and the necessity of amending IPU statutes and rules to permit this to occur had been postponed from the previous IPU meeting in Cape Town. When the question to amend the IPU statutes and rules was put at the Geneva meeting, a rollcall vote was taken, with Australia voting to oppose the change. With the rule changes having been agreed to, the question to accept Palestine as a member passed on the voices. Australia also opposed this question, though a formal rollcall vote was not taken. The issue of Palestine is a highly complex one. The delegation had been briefed on Ausa tralia's position regarding the situation with Palestine and the Middle-East and upheld this position in exercising its vote. The delegation considered that the proposed amendment of the IPU statutes and the admission of Palestine was highly inappropriate, and it was not consistent with the IPU's own statutes, which state that the function of the IPU is to represent parliaments of sovereign nations. Although the amendment was argued to be specifically drafted to admit only Palestine, the delegation considered that it would set an unhelpful precedent because it may encourage other non-state entities to pursue similar representations and was clearly politically motivated. Australia's position is to recognise Palestinian aspirations for statehood and to strongly support a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian issue, based on the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people to a state of their own and Israel's right to live in peace with secure borders. The delegation did not consider that the course of action being proposed through the IPU would advance this position or enhance the peace process. Australia maintains an active membership of both the Twelve Plus and Asia-Pacific geopolitical groups. In the Asia-Pacific group, Australia suggested that the group build on recent reforms by instituting an elected position of secretary for a period of three years, which would provide secretarial support and assistance to the chair-which rotates. We considered that this proposal would allow the development of skills, expertise and continuity. The proposal is being considered by the working group and will be further discussed during the next IPU meeting. The Australian delegation was delighted that Mr Zha Peixin of China assumed the chair of the Asia-Pacific Group, as he is also the Chair of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group. The delegation has pledged its support and commitment to working closely with Mr Zha in advancing the interests of the Asia-Pacific Group within the IPU. This meeting elected a new IPU president for a three-year term. The Australian delegation gave strong support to the candidacy of His Excellency Agung Laksono, the Speaker of the Indonesian parliament. Although Mr Laksono was not successful at the election, he expressed deep appreciation for Australia's support. The delegation was concerned at the position of the Pacific nations and some of our smaller Asian neighbours. In particular, representation at the IPU Assembly by Pacific countries was limited. Samoa was represented by a single delegate without any support, and Papua New Guinea, who also had a single delegate, lost its voting rights. Timor-Leste is a newly emerging nation and is still finding its way as a participant in international institutions. The delegation had bilateral meetings with representatives of Timor-Leste to discuss issues of mutual interest. The delegation considers that Australia and New Zealand must play a greater role in supporting the Pacific and neighbouring countries, especially to encourage these countries to engage with the IPU and to ensure their views are heard on the international stage. Finally, I would like to thank Alison Purnell, our DFAT adviser, who once again provided professional advice and assistance to the delegation during the IPU meeting. Alison, who has been our adviser at a number of recent IPU meetings, has now moved on in DFAT and we wish her well in her new posting. I would also like to thank Angela Robinson, of the Office of the Ambassador for Disarmament, for her specialised knowledge and expert advice on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty matters. I would also like to thank the delegation members-in particular, the honourable member for Hughes, Danna Vale, the deputy leader, for her support and continued involvement in both the IPU and Serbia; Senator the Hon. Judith Troeth; and Senator Claire Moore, who joined the IPU delegation. Last but not least, I would like to thank the unflappable Elton Humphrey, who was secretary of the delegation and who did an outstanding job. I commend the delegation's report to the House.",24
9,Mrs VALE,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-It was indeed a privilege and an honour to have been part of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the Republic of Serbia and to the 119th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Geneva, Switzerland that took place between 4 and 18 October last year. Initially, I wish to record our for the many officials and advisers who provided their professional expertise and assistance to us and who made this delegation such a success. Ambassador Claire Birgin and Mrs Melanie Davies and the excellent staff of the Australian Embassy in Serbia provided sound advice and professional expertise. In Geneva, I acknowledge the work of Mrs Alison Purnell of DFAT; Mrs Angela Robinson from the Office of the Ambassador for Disarmament; the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade here in Australia; Mrs Caroline Millar, the Ambassador for Disarmament; and Mrs Anda Filip, the IPU Director for External Affairs, for their guidance and professional assistance. I also wish to thank my delegation colleagues-the member for Chifley, the Chief Government Whip, and senators Judith Troeth and Claire Moore-for the excellent cooperative spirit in which this delegation was undertaken and which contributed in a positive manner to its success. There were several important reasons for an Australian delegation to Serbia. These included the need to establish formal relations with the new Serbian parliament, to have discussions on bilateral trade, to strengthen commercial relations and to discuss the possibility of bilateral healthcare agreements. We also wanted to expand the potential for increased cooperation in education between our two nations. We also wanted to take this opportunity to gain a better understanding of Serbia's concerns about Kosovo's independence and Serbia's cooperation with the Hague tribunal, as well as Serbia's reforms as it works towards membership of the European Union. We also sought to gain an appreciation of the situation of Serbian ethnic minorities, which include a large population of refugees from Croatia, Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina, as appreciation well as the Romana people. Our visit was the very first Australian parliamentary delegation to the new Republic of Serbia, and we were able to participate in high-level meetings with the speaker and vice-speaker of the national assembly, with ministers, secretaries of state and various political leaders. The delegation was impressed with the efforts being made by the leaders of this vibrant young democracy to develop and enhance democratic traditions, and we considered that its efforts in this regard could perhaps be better acknowledged at an international level. Serbia's ministers and political leaders are a new generation; they are young, they are energetic, they are professionally qualified, they are progressive and they are focused on a future for Serbia as a member of the European Union for its economic and social success. Having said that, I note that Serbia is also aware of the importance of regional cooperation and is actively involved in creating positive relationships with regional organisations and initiatives. Serbia certainly holds a position of strength within the Balkan region and is a key to stability in that region. One of the main issues of concern at the time of our visit was the independence of Kosovo, and the delegation benefited from understanding the history of the relationship between these two countries. Serbia regards Kosovo as an integral part of its identity as a nation and is determined not to recognise Kosovo's independence. However, in seeking to address this situation, Serbia has wisely committed to seek recourse through international legal institutions and procedures and, in so doing, is gaining welldeserved respect amongst the international family of nations. At the many high-level meetings with ministers and political leaders, the delegation pointed out that Australia would welcome the return of the Serbian Ambassador to Australia. Indeed, it is pleasing to note that shortly after our visit the Serbian ambassador returned to Australia. The report records three recommendations that were made by the delegation after this visit. They include the suggestion that through AusAID we sponsor exchange programs for parliamentary staff from the national assembly of Serbia and/or other government officials to assist in strengthening Serbia's fledging parliamentary democracy. Another recommendation is that Australia facilitate opportunities for our tertiary educaThat tion and research institutions for cooperation with research; exchanges of academic and research personnel; and graduate or postgraduate study in Australia. The third recommendation provides for support and assistance for cultural visits to Australia by Serbian artistic and theatrical troupes. We believe that the implementation of such recommendations will assist in providing for the development of a positive working relationship between our two nations and will achieve the objectives of the delegation to the mutual benefit of both countries. The delegation also attended the 119th assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Geneva, assemblies which provide an opportunity for worldwide parliamentary dialogue on political, economic, social and cultural issues of international significance. There are now 154 members of the IPU and eight associate members. The IPU supports the work of the United Nations and cooperates with regional interparliamentary organisations as well as with other like-minded international intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations. Australia is an active member of two geopolitical groups within the IPU: the Asia-Pacific Group and the Twelve Plus Group. Of the highlights of our participation in the IPU in October last year, mention must include the fine leadership that was provided by the Chief Government Whip, the member for Chifley, not only in his capacity as delegation leader but especially in his role of corapporteur presenting the draft report to be considered by the first standing committee at the 120th assembly of the IPU in Addis Ababa in April this year. The topic of this paper is Advancing nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, and securing the entry into force of the Comprehensive NuclearTest-Ban Treaty: the role of parliaments. topic is one in which Australia has had an abiding interest for many years. The delegation report also makes a strong recommendation that the Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs request the Centre for Democratic Institutions to investigate ways for Australia to encourage Pacific countries to become more involved in international fora, especially the IPU, and I note the recommendations that were already made by the Chief Government Whip in this regard. Again, I acknowledge the leadership of the member for Chifley and the positive contributions, spirit and work of the delegation by Senators Claire Moore and Judith Troeth. It was a privilege indeed to have been a member of this delegation, and I commend the report to the House. NA Public Works Committee Report",27
10,Mr BUTLER,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 72nd annual report of the committee and also the committee's first report for 2009, relating to the Enhanced Land Force Stage 1 Facilities Project. Ordered that the reports be made parliamentary papers.",29
11,Mr BUTLER,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The annual report, as the House would be aware, is required by the Public Works Committee Act and outlines the committee's work over the calendar year 2008. In total, over the course of that year, the committee investigated 19 proposals totalling $1.8 billion and recommended those proposals to the House. The committee was also notified of 63 works under the threshold limit of $15 millionknown as medium works-for investigation that totalled $330 million of expenditure. The annual report is a slim, attractive volume, which only outlines some of the issues that arose for the committee during the course of the year. That is because the public information presented to the committee, at its many public hearings and through the written submissions provided to it, is widely available, particularly through the committee's website, which is well advertised on the APH website. For that reason we have not reported in great detail the various inquiries conducted by the committee and instead have redirected people who want more detail on those inquiries to our website. I also table the committee's first report calendar year 2009 on the Enhanced Land Force Stage 1 Facilities Project. This project is particularly dear to the heart of the member for Herbert, I am sure, given that the vast bulk of it occurs in Townsville. The project is proposed by the Department of Defence and is valued at $793 million, with construction taking place at 11 locations around Australia, with nearly half of that expenditure occurring in Townsville. The project flows from the Enhanced Land Force strategy for the defence forces commenced by the previous government and adopted by the new Rudd Labor government. It will see the ADF increase by about 3,000 personnel by the time of its completion, through a range of initiatives, one of which-the Hardened and Networked Army initiative, the HNA initiative, at Edinburgh-was considered by the Public Works Committee last week. That would see the 7RAR Battalion relocated from Darwin to Adelaide after being converted to the 2nd Mechanised Battalion. This particular project deals with another aspect of the ELF initiative, particularly the relocation of 3RAR from Sydney to Townsville and its conversion from a parachute battalion to a light infantry battalion, as well as the expansion of a number of training and airlift facilities around Australia to take account of the significant increase in ADF numbers. The committee has recommended that the House agree to the project proceeding as a significant project for the Australian Defence Force and as a project that will provide employment in many regional areas during construction. The statutory criteria under the Public Works Act are clearly satisfied, and we recommend that the project proceed as quickly as possible. I would like to thank all members and senators on the committee for their work in relation to the ELF Stage 1 inquiry, and parfor ticularly my Deputy Chair, Senator Troeth. At the occasion of presenting the annual report for 2008 it is also important that I place on record the gratitude of the committee for the secretariat support that this committee receives week in and week out. It is a very hard working committee that is required to travel widely around Australia to consider various capital works projects proposed by the executive government. On behalf of the committee, I place on record our gratitude to James Catchpole, the secretary of the committee; Siobhan Leyne, the inquiry secretary, who makes these things tick; and also other staff of the committee: Narelle MCGlusky, Gaye Milner and Tarran Snape. I commend both reports to the House.",30
12,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report is very significant to Townsville. There is $385 million of infrastructure and other flow-on effects. There are a very large number of housing units that will be constructed in the city and also Single LEAP accommodation at Lavarack Barracks. It comes at a time when the economy is somewhat depressed and it will underpin a very vibrant construction industry in the city. However, I have risen this morning specifically to alert the House, the committee and Defence on something that is perhaps most unsatisfactory. In the committee's report that has been presented to the parliament today, Defence evidence to the committee is quoted in section 2.34: All of these [ELF] locations are sophisticated regional centresof course, that is the case for Townsvilleand we anticipate that local companies will be very competitive just due to geography. I think we all accept that. The comment goes on: … and I can assure the committee that many local companies have registered interest in many of construction packages. I know that for a fact. The committee then responded by saying in section 2.35: … the Committee also acknowledges the concerns of submitters regarding the importance of stimulating local economies and welcomes the levels of local employment expected by this posal. As a member of the committee, I certainly support that. However, concurrently with this approval process, Defence invited local contractors to register an interest in being invited to tender in relation to two of the packages. One was a $61 million to $76 million package in Townsville for base infrastructure and civil works. There were four companies invited to tender, three from Brisbane and only one from Townsville. In relation to the $19 million to $24 million Joint Logistics Unit North Queensland facilities, again, three outof-town contractors were invited to submit a tender and only one local. More disappointing than that were these letters that I have received from a tenderer who did not get an invitation. This tenderer is the largest local builder in the city. He could easily do the job, he is fully qualified in everything required by the Commonwealth and Defence, but he did not even get an opportunity to tender. Defence's letter states: Defence regrets to advise you that, following the evaluation of Registrations of Interest, your submission was not successful and you will not be invited to Tender for the role of Head Contractor. I just ask Defence: how could you not invite the most capable tenderer in the city of Townsville to tender on some of these construction packages? Why did you invite somebody from Adelaide? Why did you invite somebody from Brisbane? It is our local people who deal with the local Defence Force. We are a garrison city. We live, work and play together. How could you not give the the opportunity to tender to a clearly very capable business? Why did you just wipe them out? I put Defence on notice that I am extraordinarily angry that their actions were different to the evidence that they gave to the committee, and I put them on notice that the next time that Defence come before the pro- committee-and that will happen with Enhanced Land Force Stage 2 later in the year-I will be expressing my concern about what they say to the committee and what they do in practice. I am very disappointed on behalf of our construction companies in Townsville and I think that all of us, particularly the government, will have the view that local contractors should have the opportunity to do Defence projects to protect local jobs. Corporations and Financial Services Committee Membership",31
13,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," Mr Speaker has received a message from the Senate informing the House that Senator Williams has been appointed a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services for the committee's inquiry into financial products and services in Australia. NA BILL 2009 Cognate bill: NA NA BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 February, on motion by Mr Albanese: That this bill be now read a second time.",32
14,Mr TRUSS,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,"While it has been agreed that the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009 will be dealt with in a cognate debate, they are quite different in nature and the areas in which they deal, so I would like to take each of the bills separately and respond to them in that way. The first is the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009. This bill amends the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to create a board for Australia's civil air regulator, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The bill also makes some technical amendments to improve its enforcement powers. These include improving CASA's capacity to oversight the safety of foreign carriers flying to and from Australia, amending the automatic stay arrangements for reviewable decisions and creating an additional offence of negligently carrying or consigning dangerous goods on an aircraft. CASA is a statutory authority, established in 1995 under the Civil Aviation Act 1988 with a mandate to regulate Australia's civil aviation sector to ensure its safe operation. Australia's record of aviation safety is world class, and there is no doubt that CASA is entitled to take some credit for this admirable performance. Yet, in many ways, CASA has been a troubled regulator. Its task is not an easy one, and it is dealing with a sector that is diverse and characterised by fractious elements and strong personalities. It has been subject to strident criticism, personality conflicts, industry complaints and seemingly endless reviews. The reviews include the 1999 audit of CASA by the Australian National Audit Office and its follow-up audit three years later; Tom Sherman's report of May 2001 into two incidents involving the then CASA director of aviation safety; the Ted Anson 2002 report into CASA's governance arrangements; the December 2007 Aviation Regulation Review Taskforce; the ATSB-CASA review conducted by Mr Russell Miller; and the 2008 inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport into the administration of CASA. In addition, the report of the Queensland coroner into the 2005 Lockhart River air crash looked at CASA's regulatory oversight in the context of that tragedy. Plainly, CASA has been closely scrutinised as a regulator. It is also a regulator that has experienced significant change. This mainly arose out of the decision by the previous coalition government to abolish its board in 2003. This decision, implemented by the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2003, placed the federal minister in more direct control of CASA. Following the passage of this legislation, CASA embarked on a prolonged period of reform. The Labor Party and most elements of the aviation industry supported the decision by the coalition government to abolish the board of CASA. In fact, the member for Batman, in his capacity as shadow transport minister, appeared on AM on 19 November 2002. I quote him, although I am sure that the now Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism, who is sitting at the table, will remember these words well: For too long, in terms of CASA, we had a board in place which was a bureaucratic layer that contributed nothing. In many ways we had a lot of do-gooders without a lot of aviation experience. Abolishing the CASA board effectively means that CASA is more accountable for aviation safety, so we all appreciate that the buck stops and starts with the Minister. Mr Martin Ferguson-That's what I said after the Lockhart report.",32
15,Mr TRUSS,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,So the coalition government decision,33
16,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,The minister will have a chance,33
17,Mr TRUSS,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,"I have no intention of misrepresenting the minister, and if you follow the remainder of my remarks",33
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,The Leader of Nationals will not respond to those interjections.,33
19,Mr TRUSS,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,"you will note that I am not making any criticism of the Labor Party or the shadow minister at the time. He was stating the view at the time that was held by the Labor Party, by the government and indeed by the aviation industry generally. Mr Martin Ferguson-It was in the subsequent events where we had problems.",33
20,Mr TRUSS,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,"I am coming to subsequent events. So the coalition government's decision had the full support of the then opposition. The question therefore is: will the establishment of a small expert board of five members appointed by the minister, as proposed by the government, make CASA a better organisation? The government argues that CASA is a far different organisation from what it was in 2003, and I agree. According to the government, CASA is therefore now ready for a board. I guess you could equally argue, since it is doing much better than it was in 2003 without a board, that is also a case for keeping it that way. If you do not wish to take the assurances of the government at face value, particularly regarding something as important as the state of Australia's civil aviation regulator, you can turn to the findings of the last Senate inquiry into the administration of CASA. This inquiry took 61 submissions from the aviation sector and took evidence from a significant number of witnesses, many qualified to make informed observations about the effectiveness of CASA. The Senate inquiry established that CASA, under its chief executive officer, Mr Bruce Byron, has made progress in the way it is doing business. It has remodelled its structure to be more responsive to industry and has made an effort to change its defensive culture. At a working level, some submissions noted this improved approach. CASA has also attempted to change its arrangements to enhance its approach to engaging industry. There are, nevertheless, issues that bothered the Senate inquiry. The inquiry expressed concerns that some in the aviation sector feel CASA senior executives are not approachable enough. Some submissions expressed an unease that CASA's risk based safety philosophy was at the expense of a more prescriptive regulatory approach that leaves too much responsibility with the airlines to ensure their own safety standards. CASA has experienced an enormous staff turnover since 2003. While this is characteristic of an organisation trying to change its culture and way of doing business, the Senate inquiry noted that CASA appears to lack adequately trained technical staff and seems to lack a clear plan for managing its training needs. The inquiry also heard many complain that CASA's regulatory review program seems to have made limited progress in the last three years. Although that progress has been handicapped by inadequate resources in the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing, some also argued that there were times when regulations were interpreted by some field officers in an inconsistent way. So clearly CASA faces a number of significant challenges. It can be argued with some justification that the reform process has been implemented too slowly and that the burdens and responsibilities placed upon CASA's chief executive officer are perhaps too great. I also note that the majority of submissions to the Senate inquiry, in contrast to what occurred prior to 2003, argued for the reinstatement of a CASA board. Qantas suggested the current governance structures are not delivering consistent policy and the responsibilities of the CEO are too broad. This point was supported by the Australian and International Pilots Association, which stated that a board would improve the capacity of the CEO to make the tough decisions needed to regulate the industry. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association argued a board would help CASA implement safety guidelines. The Senate inquiry in a bipartisan conclusion recommended that the Australian government strengthen CASA's governance framework by introducing a small board of up to five members to provide enhanced oversight and strategic direction for CASA. CASA faces an immense task in regulating an industry that is complex and assuming a greater role in Australia's economic life. must deal with an industry characterised by strong personalities, conflicting opinions and elements that often resent the hand of regulation. It is an industry where the consequences of a failure in safety can be catastrophic. The industry has been famous for internal conflicts and an unwillingness of the various sectors to agree and work together on issues of importance. CASA is often the point of focus and blame for issues when in fact there are wider industry issues involved. CASA has certainly responded in a positive way to the concerns about the way in which it has operated. It is a very much better organisation today than it probably has ever been. But I think everyone would acknowledge that it still has a lot more work to do. I would also say that it probably will never be perfect. There is an expectation that CASA will keep our skies safe, and that is its job. But if it acts too heavy-handedly to enforce safety requirements then there will be complaints about it interfering in the legitimate role of business and the right of people to fly. In reality, to try and put together a satisfactory regime that can deal with all those sorts of issues is indeed a challenge. You can also argue that, given the difficulties of the task, an organisation which both makes and enforces industry regulation should be a part of a department and answerable to a minister and not a board. I appreciate that these are issues that were dealt with in the Uhrig report, but there are issues about whether or not it is appropriate for a board to be responsible for enforcing industry regulation which it also has a responsibility to make. CASA certainly does not have an easy job and there are no easy answers as to the best way to approach aviation regulation. I consider that Mr Bruce Byron made an outstanding contribution as CASA's CEO over the past five years. His was a thankless It and difficult task, yet he made significant progress in placing CASA on the path to be a world-class regulator that can work with the industry in a rigorous, responsive and effective way. He was well regarded across the sector, an honour achieved by few in the aviation business. I am not saying that the job is complete, but Mr Byron made a very credible contribution. CASA is a better organisation than it has ever been, and I wish Bruce good health and every happiness as he moves into retirement. I also wish the incoming CASA CEO, Mr John MCCormick, all the best as he assumes his duties from 1 March this year. His extensive background in aviation will serve him well as he continues the challenges in regulating a key industry. Significant progress has been made. Mr Byron has put in place a spirit of reform and hopefully moved significantly to change the culture of CASA. Mr MCCormick must now build on those reforms and take them to the next level. In terms of the best model of governance for CASA, the opposition has accepted that the incoming CEO may appreciate the support of a board in his demanding position. Out of respect for the views of industry, recognising the efforts of CASA to reform and acknowledging the conclusion of last year's Senate standing committee inquiry into CASA, we are prepared to support this element of the government's legislation. We do so, of course, on the condition that the government manage the appointments of the board properly. It is to be an expert board. It tion. is not a place to dump Labor mates looking for a reward. I call upon the government to make smart, apolitical appointments. Appointing people who have regulatory experience, who understand community consultation and who command the respect of the aviation sector will be a key criterion if this board is to be successful. Let me say past CASA boards have ended in tears. Both the previous government and the government before that had unhappy experiences with the board of CASA. Hopefully, we have all learnt from those lessons and, when the government sits down to appoint the members to this board, they choose wisely-they do not seek to try and have every sector of the industry represented, so that each sector has a voice on the board, but they have people there with expertise and with skill. They are going to have to be people who have the respect of the aviation sector. But, in reality, not every possible skill that is needed in the industry will be able to be included on the board. What we will need is capable people who are apolitical, have the respect of the industry and are therefore able to deliver a good outcome. I turn to some of the more technical elements of this bill. The changes improve the enforcement powers of CASA. One such change is improving CASA's oversight of foreign carriers. This bill inserts a new section in the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to enable CASA to consider the effectiveness of air operators and relevant foreign regulatory authorities when assessing applications authorising the operation of foreign registered aircraft flying to Australia. This is consistent with what occurs in Europe and the United States. It seems a sensible way to improve aviation safety, since it is a regrettable truth that some foreign regulatory authorities are not as rigorous as our own. This amendment has the support of the opposiThe second significant technical change contained in this bill is to amend the automatic stay provisions of any decision by CASA to suspend, change or cancel various types of certificates and permissions in circumstances short of serious and imminent risks to air safety. Under section 31A of the that Civil Aviation Amendment Act 2003 and associated regulations, if CASA decides to suspend, vary or cancel a permission-such as an air operator's certificate-it must first give a show cause notice to the affected holder. This is to allow the subject of the direction to make a case as to why it should not apply. Section 31A provides that any such decision by CASA does not come into effect until the end of the fifth business day after CASA gives notice. During this period, the subject of the notice may apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for review of CASA's decision. If they do so, the stay or suspension of the notice will continue until the Administrative Appeals Tribunal makes a decision, or until 90 days after CASA originally notified the holder of its decision-whichever comes first. Essentially, the current arrangements give the AAT 90 days to deal with an application. This bill removes the 90-day stay provision and requires those subject to a notice by CASA to apply to the AAT on a different basis. According to item 16 of schedule 3, under proposed new section 31A(4) of the bill, if those subject to a notice choose to sition. ask the AAT for review, they must make the request for an order under subsection 41(2) of the Administrative Appeals Act 1975. According to page 16, paragraph 12 of the explanatory memorandum, this means that the AAT will treat such appeals on an expedited basis. I can only assume this is because a request lodged on this basis is a much narrower one. It involves requesting the AAT to make orders to extend the stay, not a general merits review of CASA's decision, as is currently the case. I am advised by the office of the minister that, in practical terms, this means the suspension of a notice by CASA outside the automatic five-day period will be considerably shorter than the 90-day period. It will be, according to this advice, no longer than about a week. It does seem a concern if CASA issues a direction to an air operator due to poor safety practice, only to have that order suspended for a lengthy period. The opposition is prepared to support this amendment, although we will be watching to see how it actually works in practice. We call on the minister to give an assurance in this place that the AAT will, in fact, treat any decision regarding a CASA direction in the shorter period promised. With the abolition of the 90-day limit, we would not want to see that lead to longer times in delay in dealing with these issues, rather than shorter. The third and final significant technical change proposed in this bill is addressing the legal gap in the treatment of the consignment of carriage of dangerous goods on an aircraft. At present, this offence is dealt with on the basis of intent or recklessness. This seems unduly narrow, since the most common reason for this offence is negligence. Including negligent carriage or consignment of dangerous goods on an aircraft will enable a more tailored and appropriate prosecution. The amendment has the support of the oppoThis bill contains a set of legislative changes to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 that should enhance the regulatory effectiveness of CASA. The key changes improving CASA's ability to assess foreign carriers, modifying the automatic stay provisions and including the offence of negligence in the consignment or carriage of dangerous goods seem sensible administrative amendments. Reinstating the CASA board is more controversial. But, under the leadership of Mr Bruce Byron, CASA has made significant progress. A board may therefore now be appropriate and help CASA address some outstanding issues. But, I add again, boards have ended in tears in the past and will again if the government does not make sensible choices about the board membership. I turn now to the second of the bills being dealt with in this cognate debate, the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009. Again, the coalition will support the bill, which is designed to enhance the independence of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and the safety of Australian transport. The ATSB is well regarded in Australian transport and indeed around the world and is staffed by people with considerable expertise. It was created by the then coalition government in 1999. The creation of the ATSB was part of a push to separate the responsibilities involved in maintaining the transport safety apparatus from those of ensuring that safety investigations were carried out by a body that was independent. This independence was entrenched by the passage of the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003. Before the passage of this act there was nothing precluding the secretary from giving directions to the ATSB. Under the new arrangements, the head of the ATSB was not subject to direction from the secretary of the department in the exercise of his powers. ATSB investigations are conducted on a no-blame basis. These investigations rely on the independent and impartial assessment of the evidence available. If an investigation were subject to outside pressure, whatever the source, the ATSB's effectiveness in discovering the simple facts of an incident without fear or favour would be reduced. As it stands, the ATSB remains separate from transport regulators and industry participants, and it is operationally autonomous within the department. Thankfully, it has not faced conflicts of interest or external interference. The ATSB's objectivity is closely linked to its independence, and it is critical that this independence be protected. Transport in Australia has an enviable safety record. This is due in no small part to the vigilance of industry participants and the regulatory and investigative regimes. The effective and independent functioning of the ATSB has been an important contributor to this exemplary safety record. Past results, however, do not mean that improvements cannot be made to ensure that Australia maintains its impressive record in transport safety. Over the years, governments from both sides of politics have contributed to positive developments in transport safety. In October 2007 the then Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon. Mark Vaile, announced that a review would be conducted into the relationship between the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. This review was headed by Mr Russell Miller AM. The review came in response to concerns raised during the investigation of the Lockhart River air crash of 2005 and was designed to identify potential improvements in Australia's aviation safety regime. It is worth pointing out that the Miller review repeatedly and explicitly noted that the ATSB: … is, in practical terms, separated from normal departmental governance and treated as essentially autonomous. The Miller review went further and declared that the Transport Safety Investigation Act: … provides that the Executive Director is not subject to directions from the Minister or the Secretary in respect of the exercise of any of the Executive Director's powers under the Act. … … … The powers make the Executive Director and departmental officers assigned to the ATSB effectively autonomous, not only in relation to undertaking investigations and their resultant reports, but also in relation to the broader range of powers and responsibilities under the TSI Act. Given this, it seems clear that the ATSB is seen as being autonomous in the execution of its duties. Indeed, there is no suggestion in the Miller review that the independence of the ATSB has ever been compromised, nor have I ever heard allegations from any quarter that the ATSB is anything other than independent. At the same time, despite the autonomy granted to and exercised by the ATSB, it remains a division of the department. As a result, the theoretical possibility remains that the independence of the ATSB could be seen to be compromised in the future. Amongst its recommendations, the Miller review proposed the option of an alternative governance structure for the ATSB which would move it out of the minister's portfolio and enhance its administrative independence. This bill therefore is the result of some of recommendations contained in the Miller review, which was launched by the then coalition government. This bill will establish the ATSB as a statutory body in its own right rather than keeping it as a division of the department. This will make the ATSB visibly separate from the department. Aside from being more independent at an organisational level, becoming a statutory authority will mean the ATSB will have direct control over its own budget and personnel matters under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Public Service Act 1999 respectively. At the moment, decisions on these matters are made by the department. I would hope that no government would ever seek to apply pressure on the ATSB by manipulating its personnel or its budget, but I suppose that risk still exists even after this legislation. There is no evidence that such pressure has been applied in the past nor, for that matter, that anyone intends to apply it in the future. Still, it is important that pearance of independence be backed up by the reality of independence. Giving the ATSB a free hand will ensure that these criteria are met. Australia is a party to a number of internaby tional aviation conventions, including the Chicago convention, which stipulates that accident investigation authorities: … shall have independence in the conduct of the investigation and have unrestricted authority over its conduct. Under current arrangements, although remaining a departmental officer, the head of ATSB is not subject to direction in the exercise of his duty. This actually goes beyond what is required under Australia's international obligations, so we are there already. Under the arrangements proposed by the bill, this will not change. The minister will retain the the capacity to provide his views on the strategic direction being taken by the ATSB, and the ATSB must have regard to those views. Under the legislation, the ATSB will be a statutory authority in the minister's portfolio, and it is entirely appropriate that the minister's views on the strategic direction of the ATSB should be taken into account. Taking the minister's views into regard does not, however, mean that the ATSB is taking direction with respect to the execution of its core functions. The provisions in this bill do not permit the minister to micromanage an investigation being carried out by the ATSB, and they do not compromise Australia's compliance with our international obligations. The internal structure of the ATSB will be that of a commission headed by one full-time commissioner, who will also be the CEO of the agency and whose role will be analogous to that of the executive director now. The chief commissioner will be supported by two part-time commissioners, with the prospect the ap- of more commissioners being appointed should the need arise. All appointees will be required to have a high level of expertise in some area relevant to the ATSB's function. Given the importance of the work carried out the ATSB, it is important that the head of the agency have the support he needs, and a commission structure such as the one proposed in the bill can achieve this. The bill will also require the ATSB to cooperate with other agencies or individuals that have functions related to improving transport safety. This includes the transport safety authorities of other countries. This is explicitly spelt out in the legislation and is appropriate amendment. From time to time there has been friction between the ATSB and other transport safety agencies. The Miller review examined the relationship between the ATSB and CASA and suggested that, while the relationship between the two organisations is working well at an operational level, there is tension in the relationship. The Miller review highlighted a number of instances where significant tensions existed between the two organisations. The Lockhart River crash was one of those instances. In the course of the investigation the Queensland State Coroner reported: … I have detected a degree of animosity that I consider inimical to a productive, collaborative focus on air safety … Given their differing roles, it is not surprising that there might be some tension between investigators and regulators. Furthermore, creative tensions can be a positive force. Professional disagreement can lead to better outcomes in the end. The tensions present following the Lockhart River crash, however, went beyond the constructive tension that one might expect. The clauses in this legislation that have established the ATSB as a statutory authority require the ATSB to cooperate with other agencies that seek to improve transport safety. These clauses need not compromise the ATSB's operational independence and they do not require the ATSB to deviate from its no blame approach to investigations. Explicitly spelling out the need to cooperate with other agencies and individuals will underscore the ATSB's core function, which is to improve transport safety by means that include communicating with relevant sectors of the transport industry, the public and other transport safety agencies. The bill gives the ATSB the capacity to delegate its powers under the act, and such a delegation would be very similar to current an provisions that allow for the executive director to delegate power. The bill also authorises the ATSB to require individuals, organisations or government agencies to provide a written response within 90 days of a recommendation being made to take safety action. This authority is aimed at ensuring that the safety recommendations issued by the ATSB are given the attention they are due. We cannot expect the ATSB to fulfil its duties in ensuring a safe transport environment without requiring that other agencies and industry participants take note of its recommendations. Australia depends on a robust transport sector. Aviation, rail, road and maritime transport have all done a great deal to contribute to the economic and social development of Australia. I am happy, therefore, to lend my support to this bill also. (Time expired)",33
21,Mr TURNOUR,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today to support the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009. These bills came out of reforms from a range of different reports, as the shadow minister for transport has mentioned, such as reports from Senate inquiries. They also came out of the green paper last year and Minister Albanese's moves to establish a national aviation strategy. It is fundamental that we are now moving down this track for the first time, pulling together a national aviation strategy and pulling together all the different components of aviation that are so important to Australia generally but particularly to regional areas. These reforms are particularly important in terms of improving safety and making the operations of CASA and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau work more effectively and efficiently. These two bills enable CASA to establish another small member board. We heard that one was abolished back in 2003, but the legislation will re-establish that board. There are some other, technical changes in relation to the operation of CASA that I will come to. Also, the second bill will establish the Australian Transport Safety Bureau as a statutory agency within the portfolio of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Aviation is critical to Australia but is particularly critical to regions like Tropical North Queensland, the Torres Strait and Cape York. My electorate of Tropical North Queensland is a very diverse region that is dependent on aviation. For many people living in capital cities, aeroplanes may be something they get on to go on holidays, whether it is in Australia or overseas, but for people living in the Torres Strait, for example, aviation is the only way that they can get around to visit their families; it is the only way that they can get mail and the paper. It is a critical part of their lives and it is a critical part of their ability to live normal lives, in the same way the motor car has become so critical to many people in mainland Australia. Similarly, communities in Cape Yorkwhether they are remote Aboriginal communities or communities in Weipa and Cooktown, which are more strongly nonIndigenous communities-are very dependent on aviation. There are extended periods when the roads are closed and road traffic cannot get into those areas, and they are highly dependent on aviation. The economies of Cairns and Port Douglas are driven to a large extent by tourism. The industry is estimated to be worth more than $2 billion in the region and we have more than 30,000 jobs directly and indirectly dependent on the industry. More than two million visitors a year come to Cairns. Some drive but the vast majority of them fly there either through domestic airlines or through international airlines. We are an international gateway. The importance of aviation can be no greater than in the region that I represent, the region of Leichardt. It is great to be here today supporting this legislation because it is particularly important that we maintain strong safety within our aviation sector-our international aviation sector, our domestic aviation sector but particularly our general aviation sector. One of the critical issues in general aviation that is still ongoing in my electorate is the grounding of Aero Tropics, which happened on 27 June last year, late on a Friday afternoon. Aero Tropics has since gone into receivership and I understand is now going into liquidation. Aero Tropics was selling the tickets and was the branding of the Transair aircraft which crashed at Lockhart River in May 2005, a crash in which 15 lives were lost. It was the worse aviation disaster in about 40 years. Aero Tropics has been mentioned as being the operator of the airline that crashed. The crash is quite famous and has been mentioned by many speakers today. As a result of that crash, there has been a real drive from the community, other sections of government and the opposition at the time of the crash-the Labor Party-to see changes and improvements in safety. Senator Jan MCLucas was particularly involved in this, and Australian Story covered it recently. This legislation will enable CASA not only to establish a board but to take action more quickly to ground airlines they have real safety concerns about. Tragically, people died in Lockhart River, but Transair continued to operate for an extended period of time. Part of the reason for that is that within the current legislation it is actually very ficult for CASA to quickly ground airlines they have concerns about. And we experienced this situation again last year with the grounding of Aero Tropics. It was grounded late on a Friday afternoon. I did not find out about it until late on Friday afternoon, and then only indirectly. I can understand from CASA's point of view that they are only about safety, but people were expecting planes to arrive on Saturday morning and they were not going to show up because CASA had grounded the airline. As I am the federal representative up there, people were starting to ring up my office to ask what was going on. There was a certain amount of confusion as a result of the way that grounding was handled. I understand that CASA wanted to do the right thing, and they did do the right thing in grounding that airline, but it resulted in Aero Tropics going through a process that effectively got them up and flying again. Some of the details of the provisions in this legislation will enable CASA to more effectively and more quickly make decisions that ground airlines they have real concerns about. This will put certainty into the community-which is very important-and it will enable us also to move on much more quickly in terms of getting replacements if that is what needs to happen. Because the reality is that from June last year there has not been an RPT-a regular transport service-up and running in the Torres Strait. Part of the reason for that is the delays that have taken place as a result of Aero Tropics getting up and flying again and then subsequently being grounded again. The operator of Aero Tropics was out communicating to his customers and clients that CASA were effectively treating him unfairly-that CASA were behaving irresponsibly. As the local member, I sought to work with the minister and work with the operator to deal with these difissues, but I would talk to the operator and hear one thing and then talk to the minister's office and have further briefings back but hear a quite different message. We need to establish within CASA the ability for these issues to be resolved much more effectively. We need to give CASA the ability to work much more effectively in taking action against airlines that need to be grounded, because there was a hell of a lot of confusion created in the community and a hell of a lot of anger and mistrust that developed between that community and CASA. I facilitated meetings between some of the community leaders and CASA through the minister's office and I think we have bridged that. I would like to thank the minister for the support that he has given to me and for the work that CASA has done. But I can assure you that when your plane has not arrived and you need to get to a medical appointment, or you are just wanting to read the paper and you are out on an outer islands community-and you are actually getting communicated to by the airline operator who is telling you one thing and CASA is not telling you anything-you start to think that CASA is effectively being a bit of a bully and is acting inappropriately. But when they finally did ground the airline-and it has not become public, but I am sure over time it will as these investigations go on-it was found that there was an imminent safety risk. That risk was not to people in the numbers that we saw killed in the Lockhart River crash, but there was a significant safety risk that could have seen people die again in the Torres Strait. And that would have been a tragedy not only for those families and for CASA but for everybody in this House. It is we who are responsible for introducing legislation that ensures that people in communities like mine can get on an aircraftwhether it is a little twin-engine or singleengine light aircraft in the Cape York and Torres Strait or an A380 aircraft out of Sydney-and feel comfortable and confident that they can fly safety. That is clearly not working under the rent system because it again took CASA an extended period of time before it could finally ground Aero Tropics. On grounding Aero Tropics, eventually they did become financially insolvent and have gone into liquidation. But until that happened, nobody else was particularly interested in coming in and taking up those routes. We were lucky enough to work with the minister and the minister's office to get West Wing Aviation quickly back into Cape York after the grounding on 27 June, and we were able to get the mail services running up there. But I stress again that in Torres Strait we are still in a situation where there are no regular transport services. People on the outer islands of the Torres Strait are ter services to fly them around, and most of them cannot afford that. So it is basically government officials, and people being transported by government, who are getting around. That is the only way that people are still getting around out there. These changes are bread-and-butter issues for those communities. We are now seeing West Wing look into operating in the Torres Strait, but it took months for them to even seriously look at that because of the toing and froing that went on as a result of CASA's inability to effectively ground this airline. Changes within these bills will make that possible and will prevent such situations as occurred after the Lockhart River crash where Transair continued to operate for a period of time. As I said, we currently have the situation where it took a number of months before Aero Tropics was finally grounded in the Torres Strait. We did get a decision on that; Aero Tropics became unfinancial and insolvent and we can now see another operator coming in. We have West Wing working-and I continue to work with CASA and communicate with them about the approval to them as an operator in the Torres cur- Strait-and I am making sure that I am getting proper briefings and that the government is doing all it can to support this new airline that wants to come in. But it is too long. It is eight months, and we need to get an airline back into the Torres Strait. Mr Lindsay-A great Townsville-based airline!",39
22,Mr TURNOUR,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,"They are a great Townsville-based airline under Mr Collings. They have been expanding quite widely, and I have had a chance to talk to him as well, but we do desperately need them back up there working. They are providing a good service into Cape York after taking over from Aero Tropics. So this legislation is critically important to my region, particularly to those relying on charisolated communities. I think the establishment of the board was a recommendation that came out of the Senate inquiry following the Lockhart River crash. By creating an expert five-member board, the bill will strengthen CASA as a safety and oversight agency. The members of the board will not be appointed to represent sectional interests but will be charged with improving safety for the Australian community. This board will not be involved in the day-today running of CASA but will function at a tactical level by assisting CASA in managing the extraordinary growth of aviation and technological changes in aviation in Australia. The board will decide on the objectives, strategies and policies to be followed by CASA and ensure that CASA performs its functions efficiently and effectively. When you ground an airline, particularly in isolated communities, it is most important that you operate within the law and do what you need to do. You need to be able to communicate with the community effectively about what is happening and why, because people depend on these services. I hope that is an issue that the new board takes up. It is certainly an issue that I have spoken to CASA directly about. I know that CASA responded to this when we spoke to them through the minister's office. One of the changes for CASA is the automatic stay provision. I have talked about the difficulties when grounding an airline. This legislation will make it easier to keep unsafe operators out of our skies. Currently, when CASA has made a decision to suspend or cancel operators who have been found to be unsafe, the routine application of an automatic stay has meant that these operators can continue flying for months. The examples that I have given highlight that. Under the existing legislation, most decisions of this kind are automatically stayed for five days, and for a further 90 days thereafter if the person affected by the decision lodges an application for review in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal within the initial five-day period. If the tribunal is unable to hear the appeal within 90 days, it may extend the stay until it is able to do so. I mentioned Transair as one practical example but Aero Tropics is another practical example. This legislation will enable CASA to move more quickly and effectively to ground airlines. As I have said, this will improve safety, but it will also ate certainty for those local communities. This legislation also closes a loophole in relation to the negligent carriage of dangerous goods on board an aircraft. The carriage of dangerous goods is a major safety issue potentially putting lives at risk. This legislahave tion will include the offence of negligent carriage or consignment of dangerous goods. This will ensure that lack of care in the duty of carriage and consignment is addressed. It will also clarify and refine CASA's investigative powers and bring its search warrant procedures in line with the current Commonwealth criminal justice procedures. This legislation will also have some technical changes that will ensure better oversight of overseas carriers. I have spent most of my time talking about general aviation today because it is such an important breadand-butter issue for people living in the Cape, the Torres Strait and the Gulf. But, as I also mentioned earlier, aviation is critically important to the community of Cairns and Port Douglas, which I am very proud to represent here. International aviation is very critical to driving our tourism economy and bringing visitors there, as is domestic aviation. This legislation will greatly improve CASA's ability to apply oversight to foreign airlines flying into Australia. When deciding whether to allow an airline to operate in Australia, CASA will now be able to take into consideration a broader range of issues, including the conduct of that airline in their home country and other parts of the world, and the level of oversight by civil aviation authorities in the airline's home country. This legislation will ensure that airlines that operate out of foreign countries and end up flying to Australia receive adequate oversight outside Australia; otherwise an air operators certificate will not be issued. So this legislation will strengthen CASA's ability to oversight foreign carriers coming to Australia, cre- which I think is particularly important. As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, these changes are part of our national aviation strategy. We are looking very much at the local tourism industry and local businesses and towards the white paper. There been a number of submissions made by tourism operators and other businesses in my region. We certainly want to maintain the competitiveness of Cairns as an international destination, but, sadly, following changes that took effect last December, we saw Qantas cut flights out of there. I will continue to work with the minister's office and with local industry to do all we can to continue to maintain Cairns as an internationally competitive airport for people to come to. We will be looking to work with the minister on some of these issues. The other part of this legislation involves changes to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and strengthening its independence. Creating it as a statutory authority will outside the department, ensuring that there is no conflict of interest so that it can properly investigate accidents when they occur and make sure that there is full transparency in investigations. This is particularly important because when accidents happen, tragically, people generally lose their lives. You can have a car accident and you may not lose your life, but generally when planes come out of the air, people often die, and this is tragic. Following the Lockhart River crash, we saw the campaign of Shane Urquhart, whose daughter, Sally, tragically died in that crash. When you have a department or authority, like CASA, that is overseeing air transport safety in this country, it is particularly tant that there is an independent statutory authority that is undertaking an investigation so that there clearly is independence. I know that Mr Urquhart has welcomed the changes that are coming with this legislation. He would obviously like to see more things happen and more support and funding into these organisations. The government is very serious about improving safety. It is a critical issue in my electorate, but it is also a critical issue for the nation. I congratulate the minister for the work that he is doing in this area. thank CASA for their support and advice to me on this issue. I will continue to argue strongly and work hard for my local community. We desperately need to get West Wing up and flying in the Torres Strait so that we can return air services to those communities. But, fundamentally, those communities want to know that they can get in a plane safely, and that is what this legislation will do-it will improve and increase safety through changes to CASA and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. I highly commend these bills to the House.",42
23,Ms LEY,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,"I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Civil take it Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009. The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 will create a small, expert board of five members for CASA, Australia's independent aviation safety regulator. The new board will include CASA's director of aviation safety and provide high-level direction to the organisation's regulatory and safety oversight role. The legislation also improves CASA's ability to oversight foreign carriers flying into Australia, strengthens the provisions for preventing operators from continuing to operate services where CASA considers it unsafe for them to continue and closes a gap in the current legislation by introducing an additional offence of negligently carimporrying or consigning dangerous goods on an aircraft. The Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009 seeks to reinforce the independence of the ATSB by establishing it as a separate statutory agency with a full time chief commissioner and two part-time commissioners. Under the proposed changes, the ATSB would have operational independence from the infrastructure department with respect to the exercise of its investigation powers and the administration of its reI sources. Clarifying the ATSB's independence as the national safety investigation agency was a key recommendation of the 2007 Miller review. The legislation also gives the ATSB new powers to compel agencies and operators within the aviation industry to respond to its formal recommendations within 90 days, giving the public greater confidence that the lessons from past accidents will be acted upon in a timely manner. I do not wish to speak about the changes to the ATSB. I have always found it to be an exceptional organisation, managing, as many do, on limited funds and producing worldclass results in its output. It is certainly in demand for its expertise all around the world. I would like to confine my remarks on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill to two things-firstly, the performance of CASA over the last five years and my passionate belief that unless there are changes very soon we will see an immediate decline in general aviation. The previous speaker spoke about general aviation, but he was actually referring to regular public transport services. I mean general aviation, the flying, training and light charter sector of Australia's aviation, and I have serious concerns about its future. I would also like to raise an issue was raised with me only yesterday and which I am currently exploring-that is, a submission that the Sydney Airports Corporation made to the government's green paper about regional airline slots into Sydney Airport and some concerns that they may be the architects of those slots. The access and the costings may be changed to force or encourage regional airlines that service my electorate and many other regional areas, particularly in New South Wales, such as Rex, to land at Bankstown, which is something that has come up before. I do not see it as government policy, but it is being raised again and I think it needs to be addressed. On the matter of CASA, prior to speaking on the bill today I contacted many people that I know in the aviation industry, an industry that I was involved in myself many, many years ago. I was disturbed and distressed to hear their reports. I know that if we look at CASA and its role we would have to say, ‘Well done for keeping Australia's skies safe.' I do not want to detract from that, because if CASA sees its role, and government sees its role, as primarily doing that then it has achieved that and achieved it well. But if you look at the performance of the organisation in terms of its operation, its process and its relationships, I hear that it is lacking in leadership and it has no accountability. The important thing about a board is that it will now be accountable to this board. People have described the last five years of CASA as a total disaster, with no clear objectives, no engagement with industry, and as a situation where general aviation now has almost no chance of survival. I think five years ago it had a limited chance of survival, but now-and I see this around me, too-in regional areas its chance of survival is pretty dismal. I must say that I have heard reports that in the last four to five months CASA has made that an attempt to re-engage with industry-I think this concerns particularly its testing and checking procedures-but the point is that if CASA treats a small general aviation operator in the same way that it treats Qantas it will price that operator out of existence. I know there are other issues. They concern the age of aeroplanes-we do have an ageing aircraft fleet-the cost for the average person to learn to fly and to get into GA, the cost of fuel, landing fees and charges at local airports. These expenses were not there in 1982, when I learnt to fly. I believe that CASA has a role in mentoring and engaging with general aviation-and not just for general aviation's stake, which is important to understand. The travelling public will think: ‘That's good. People like to fly. It's a great hobby or occupation and maybe it can lead to something more, but it's sort of separate from what we're doing here in the big airlines'-but it is not. And no more clearly was this demonstrated than the recent accident in the States where an extraordinarily experienced pilot carried out a landing on a frozen river and everybody got out of the plane. I am in no way suggesting that every pilot that flies an airline around the world is going to have that level of experience, but it does indicate that, where experience exists, the people on that aircraft can have confidence, and that the most important people in any aircraft are the pilot and the co-pilot. That is the role of general aviation-to train people so that, when they do get into those positions, they have sufficient experience of the real world in aviation to meet any contingency. Where you have a lack of expertise in pilots you make up for it with flight management systems, with almost automated buttons that you press to take off, land and taxi-it is not quite like that, but when I see modern aircraft I am amazed. You can, to a certain extent, make up for that lack of expertise. But unless we have a strong general aviation sector that feeds pilots to the next level of regional airlines like Rex, feeds them to the next level of bigger domestic airlines, carriers like Qantas and Virgin, and then of course to international airlines, we will have pilots pulled very rapidly through the system and we will have the situation, as we did recently-and ironically the global financial crisis and the reduction in demand probably means that this effect is now being slowedwhere the pilot had 3,000 hours flying time and the co-pilot had 1,500 hours. Yes, they have done the training. Yes, they have spent all that time in the simulator. Yes, they are very smart and they are very good people. But they do not have the depth of experience. I believe that CASA have killed general aviation. They would probably say, ‘Well, it wasn't our role to support it and it wasn't our role to mentor it. Our role is keep the skies safe.' Yes, that is their No. 1 role-but they could also have carried out these other objectives; it would only have enhanced the status of the organisation and the job that they have to do into the future. I do not seek to make these remarks in a political sense because I am talking about five years ago, but I am desperately concerned about the state of genthat eral aviation and its survival. Now people who would like to pursue a career in aviation are simply priced out of it-as are the flying schools; I heard of another one closing the other day. Its operator said to me, ‘I can't work in a not-for-profit organisation any longer.' I understand that. He said he would need to not only upgrade his 30-year-old aircraft but also face the costs of complying with CASA's requirements, which would be extremely onerous. I think I have mentioned in this place before other flying schools who have wanted simple things-for example, to put an aircraft on their AOC that they already had and that was well known to CASA. The cost of actually achieving that transfer of one line on a piece of paper is in the thousands of dollars. Renewing your instructor rating takes half a day-to have the person come down from CASA and do the testing and the checking-and costs $1,600. The costs are enormous. Again, CASA would say, ‘Well, it's not our job to understand the costs of a small regional based general aviation operation in training and charter,' but it needs to understand the effect that its actions have on those organisations. Those who are interested in aviation now are simply going to get into the recreational aviation type of flying, which are not VH registered aircraft. They are managed by a completely separate body and therefore do not link in closely to CASA. They are allowed to regulate themselves. That will be a fun, hobby type activity but I do not think it will lead easily into training pilots for the future; and that is the problem. The other remarks I would like to make concern regional aviation slots into Sydney's airport. I received an email yesterday from the Broken Hill City Council. It read as follows: You will be aware that Sydney Airport Corporation Limited (SACL), in its recent comments on the Federal Government's Green Paper on aviation policy, made a strong submission that regional air services should be relocated to Bankstown and/or the current quarantined regional slots at Sydney airport should be released to the larger airlines. Council is completely opposed to such a suggestion and submits that SACL have an obligation to continue to provide access to Sydney Airport for regional passengers as a condition of purchase of the original lease from the Government. Council requests that you make urgent representations to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services to ensure that regional airline passengers retain dedicated access to Sydney airport and the regions remain “open for business” at this time for regional communities. I note the minister at the table, so that is part 1 of my submission to the minister. This has been a long standing issue between Sydney Airport Corporation and Regional Express. Going back to parliamentary debates in New South Wales between 2003 and 2004, the issue was raised quite often. A previous minister in this place, John Anderson, replied to concerns that were raised in September 2004 as follows: We have a long standing policy of guaranteeing regional airline access to Sydney Airport which includes not only quarantined slots through the Sydney Airport Demand Management Act but also access to adequate terminal apron facilities. This policy is non-negotiable and will be enforced if necessary. If that were still the government's policy, I would take comfort. I call on the government to emphasise to regional commuters that that is still its policy. I have reviewed the submission that Sydney Airport Corporation made in response to the government's aviation green paper to see what they actually said. Certainly they made the following point: Price controls have not been subject to review for a decade. They continue to operate to hold prices for regional users at artificially low levels, cause cross subsidies from other airport users and act as a disincentive for investment in regional facilities. The extent of the pricing distortion is evidenced by the fact that the cost of operating a regional aircraft through Sydney Airport is now significantly lower than at Bankstown Airport. For example, a Saab 340 aircraft carrying 20 passengers … would incur landing and terminal charges at Bankstown Airport that were 31% higher than at Sydney Airport. Cost is always a factor but I honestly do not think any regional passengers want to land at Bankstown airport. The issue is not the cost to the aircraft of landing at Sydney versus critical landing at Bankstown. Many passengers simply would not travel if the aircraft landed at Bankstown. An upgrade would be required there. Obviously the runway length and pavement strength is sufficient but an upgrade would be required for terminal facilities, for security, for fire measures et cetera. That would be enormous. So what I am saying to Sydney Airport Corporation is: you may feel you are stuck with the regional ring-fence and you may not like it but it is something that, I believe, you are going to have to live with. If we look at the number of regional passengers that are coming into Sydney, we see that it is not as big as the number of international passengers. The submission that SACL makes talks about the dollars that Australia receives notionally from international travellers versus regional travellers. Of course it is going to be a lot more from an aircraft that contains 200, 300 or 400 people. It makes the point that it is a major contributor to the Australian economy. For every 747 that arrives at Sydney airport $1.8 million is contributed to the Australian economy and every A380 contributes $2.2 million. The submission says: It is therefore in Australia's national economic interest to encourage more international flights Australia. Maybe it is; but not at the expense of regional flights and not at the expense of access to Sydney for the citizens of Australia's regional cities such as those in my electorate of Farrer. When one reads these type of submissions it is almost as if there are two worlds: the city world and the country world. I have never accepted that there is. There is a significant interlocking of those two groups and if we freeze out regional travellers from Sydney then we do so much more to exacerbate the city-country divide-and I do not think that is what anyone in this place would want to see happen. The regional airlines flying in and out of Sydney airport at the moment include Air Link, which is a member of the Rex group, which flies from Sydney to Mudgee, Bathurst, Dubbo, Coonamble, Walgett, Lightning Ridge, Bourke and Cobar. Rex flies from Sydney to Albury, Ballina, Broken Hill, Dubbo, Grafton, Griffith, Lismore, Melbourne, Merimbula, Moruya, Narrandera, Leeton, Orange, Parkes, Taree and Wagga Wagga. It is an issue of enormous significance for us in western New South Wales that the government does not accept the views of SACL and increase the cost of landing or decrease the timeslots available or the access into Sydney airport or do anything to encourage regional airlines to relocate to Bankstown, with all of the problems that that would involve. It is extremely important that that does not happen. I am pleased that the minister was here to listen to the first part of what I said and hopefully he now has that on his radar screen. For a community like Broken Hill, the airline is everything-it is for every reasonably remote community, but Broken Hill is quite a large town and it is only serviced by Rex. The flight in and out is a major part of the to activity of the town, because if you miss the aircraft there is often not another one and the flights are often completely fully booked. When they run late you have all the ramifications that anyone who has a flight running late or who misses a flight has-it is tiresome and a nuisance et cetera. Multiply all that by more when you are in Broken Hill. If it happened to me in Albury, I would just jump in the car or drive to Melbourne or get the next flight or change from Rex to Qantas or Virgin et cetera. But in Broken Hill you cannot do that. Rex services the town and if you miss the flight you do not have any other options, because it takes hours to drive to anywhere where there is another one. You basically have to cancel what you were going to do. So it is important that the end result, after the white paper, is not that regional airlines have to fly into Bankstown or that services are reduced because demand is reduced. Remember, I do not believe that many passengers want to go to Bankstown. The public transport is not nearly as good as it is at Mascot. Anyway, why should regional Australians have a second-class service? Why should we not be able to fly into Mascot airport to do a day's business in the city, just like anybody else? It is extremely important and I appreciate the opportunity to raise that in the context of this debate. In summary, I return to the matter of CASA and its board. Clearly, from my previous remarks, I am in support of a board. I do not think ministerial accountability was the right way to go. I think that put too much pressure on the minister. There were good arguments for and against and many of them were made by the Leader of the Nationals in his earlier speech. My personal view has always been that accountability to a board makes an organisation like CASA be more accountable, and we clearly need that when we look at its troubled history. The board needs to be skills based, and I note that it will be. It desperately needs to have people that have a depth of experience in both general and regular public transport aviation in this country. I know that you can have a good mix of skills on a board and sometimes there are skills that may not be aviation related, but where possible I really believe that we need to have the two together. Everyone who has experience in an industry thinks that they understand the industry and that people who have not worked in it do not. I know that. Sometimes it is useful to have a perspective from right outside an industry. But I do believe that CASA has suffered in the past by having a leadership that has not had the depth, breadth and strength of experience in aviation-not just the airlines. So I look forward to the appointments on that board and I look forward to a brighter future for CASA.",44
24,Mr BUTLER,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009, which are being debated together. These bills reflect the Rudd Labor's government's commitment to a strong and safe aviation industry. I enjoyed listening to the previous speaker's analysis of this matter, particularly in relation to regional airlines' access to Sydney airport. As someone who flies from capital city to capital city, I do find it frustrating to queue up at Mascot behind a couple of small prop jets with maybe 12 or 20 people in them while several jets with hundreds of people in them are delayed. As a capital city dweller or a city slicker I have railed against those regional jets holding up much bigger groups of passengers travelling from capital city to capital city or, indeed, from overseas. So it was interesting to hear that particular perspective even if it was not directly related to the contents of these bills. There are a number of obvious reasons why this government is so committed to reform in this area to ensure that a strong and safe aviation industry continues to serve Australia's interests over the next not only few years but couple of decades. It is a critical industry for our country, most obviously because we are an island economy. Airline links to the rest of the world are very critical for not only our lifestyle but our economic prosperity, especially in areas of particular interest to me such as tourism but also for freight. So it is important as an island that we have a strong, safe, vibrant aviation sector, and these bills go towards that end. As a large continent, it is also very important for internal domestic reasons that our aviation industry remains strong and safe. It is important in ways that smaller, more densely populated countries in continents with sophisticated rail and road networks do not really understand. The previous speaker spoke about the capacity to substitute an air trip for a road trip if the schedule does not suit. But in many parts of this continent, unlike much of travel within the US or Europe, particularly Great Britain, there is simply no alternative to air travel. So it is very important that Australians have confidence in a strong and safe aviation industry. It is an industry which is a very large source of employment. They are secure and well-paid jobs, by and large, in the aviation industry, which employs around 50,000 Australians. It is an industry which, particularly in our region, the Asia-Pacific region, is experiencing very significant growth. In spite of the global recession and the downward pressure that the economic turmoil we are experiencing at the moment is placing on international air travel, particularly leisure travel and business travel, the Asia-Pacific region, particularly around China and India, but not exclusively, is experiencing very strong growth. That poses a range of opportunities for Australia, including its tourism industry, but it also poses increased competition for our airlines and airlines from the region which fly to and from Australia. Increased competition in the sector always places if not pressure then at least the perception of pressure on things like maintenance, quality of service, security and safety standards. As I say, if there is not pressure then there is at the perception of pressure and the need for increased public confidence that those very important aspects of aviation are not being sacrificed in order to deal with the increased competition which the aviation industry is facing in the Asia-Pacific. The government are-as are all members of this House, I am sure-committed to setting a very strong platform for this industry over the coming 20 years and more. As with so many areas of reform undertaken by this government, we have set about a very detailed consultation process with the community to ensure we do that right. Firstly, in April 2008 the government issued an issues paper intended to stimulate debate within the community about the need for reform in this area. It was a paper that attracted over 290 submissions, indicating a very high level of interest in the community not only from big players in the aviation industry but also from ordinary members of the communitycommunity groups impacted by the activities of airports and suchlike. After consideration of that issues paper December 2008, the government, or the minister particularly, issued a green paper which contains a number of proposals which will be the subject of ongoing discussion over coming months but also some proposals highlighted for early action which are the subject of these bills. As I just foreshadowed, there is intended to be ongoing discussion over the course of this year about a number of the issues raised in the green paper, with the government intending to issue a white paper later in 2009. There has been very strong support from stakeholders in this industry, including the big players, for this very considered, consultative approach to reform of aviation. There has also been strong support for these bills. The first bill is the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009. It largely deals with the govleast ernance and powers of CASA. The recommendations are largely drawn from a unanimous Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport report in September 2008 but also pick up a number of issues foreshadowed in the green paper that followed that Senate report a couple of months later. There are four components to the bill. The first component, as the previous speaker and other speakers have indicated, reintroduces a board to the governance structure of CASA, a board that was abolished in 2003. After that abolition, the sole decision-making authority within CASA lay with the chief executive officer, who also holds the statutory office of Director of Aviation Safety. CASA is a hugely complex and self-evidently important organisation within Australia. It employs some 600 staff and has responsibility for some of the most critical elements of community safety that we know of. The green paper describes the role of CASA much better than that I could. Just to highlight the breadth of responsibility that in this chief executive officer has in a strategic sense as well as in a day-today management sense, the green paper says on page 52: CASA oversees the activities of over 42,000 licensed industry personnel (including pilots, Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineers and Air Traffic Controllers), over 13,000 registered aircraft, more than 850 general aviation operators, more than 40 airline operators, over 700 maintenance organisations, more than 170 certified aerodromes, more than 130 registered aerodromes, and 26 air traffic control (ATC) facilities including major ATC centres in Brisbane and Melbourne. CASA has a complicated dual role, being required to work constructively day-today with the industry it regulates, but also needing to take firm regulatory action against industry where necessary to ensure safety. The Senate report I referred to earlier that reported in September 2008 heard overwhelming support from the industry for the reintroduction of a board structure into CASA. Certainly it is no reflection on the chief executive officer, who does a very outstanding job, but nevertheless all the key players that I have been able to research and which gave evidence to the Senate committee have indicated their support for a board structure. For example, going to that committee report at paragraph 2.99: … Qantas submitted that the current governance structures are not delivering consistent policy direction and that the current responsibilities of the CEO are too broad. They supported the concept of the reintroduction of the board structure. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association was also said to be supportive of this. Paragraph 2.101 said: The committee heard evidence from a number of witnesses suggesting the re-establishment of the CASA board would have benefits for the governance of the organisation. AOPA told the committee that it considered the reintroduction of a board would provide a level of accountability for the CASA CEO and senior management. The union for Qantas pilots, AIPA, also supported this approach. At paragraph 2.103 it says: Captain Ian Woods from AIPA told the committee that, in his opinion, the re-establishment of a board would give CASA the ability to operate independently, with confidence, and in the public interest. Lastly, but not least, the Australian Sport Aviation Confederation, ASAC, said in paragraph 2.104 that it also supported the reintroduction of the CASA board. Although much of the green paper contains proposals for discussion leading up to the issuing of a white paper later this year, the green paper did foreshadow the intention of the government to act on that unanimous Senate committee recommendation before July 2009, which is how we find ourselves debating these bills today. Within these bills, the government is proposing to introduce a five-member board. It is very clearly intended not to have members that represent sectional interests of the aviation industry but to have members with broad skills and experience relevant to the job. The job of the board will be to set the strategic direction of the organisation of CASA. The chief executive officer will properly be an ex-officio board member, responsible to the board for the performance of his or her duties and responsible to manage the day-today operations of the organisation that I outlined earlier from the green paper quote. The legislation also deals with concerns within the industry that were highlighted in the issues paper and the discussions that followed that-concerns in the industry that the automatic stay provisions involved in safety investigations have become overly lax. The bill provides now that those automatic stay provisions will last for a maximum of only five days and that any extension of those provisions will only be able to be approved by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The third component of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill reflects the identification in the green paper of the need to tighten CASA's oversight of foreign operators. I talked in my introduction about the growth of competition within our region, which reflects-or is reflected by, depending on your perspective-a proliferation of new airlines within the region, including some low-cost and some more mainstream operators. From a tourism and consumer perspective, this is a good thing. Increased competition is driving down airline prices and, to quote an ad, ‘democratising air travel' for many people within a region that is-not before timefinally becoming richer. But the Australian community, Australian travellers and the Australian aviation industry need to know more about what these aviation operators have in their safety backgrounds. We need to know more than simply what those operators do while they happen to be in Australia, and this bill does that. The bill will now allow CASA to take account of a number of factors not currently within its purview: firstly, the conduct of those operators offshore, not just when they happen to be within the Australian jurisdiction; and, secondly, the level of safety oversight provided by the overseas equivalents of CASA within the home jurisdictions of the various airlines that now come to Australia. The fourth and final component is that the bill closes a loophole in offences that are designed to protect the sector-and passengers, for that matter-from the carriage of dangerous goods. The act now contains an offence dealing with the carriage or the consignment of dangerous goods on aircraft. To close a loophole, this bill adds a further offence that deals with the negligent, as opposed to the wilful, carriage or consignment of dangerous goods on aircraft. It is self evident that this is an important loophole to be closed. The second bill is the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009. It is also directed at improving or increasing public confidence in the safety regulation of the aviation industry. In a nutshell, the bill delivest ers greater independence to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, which is currently an independent statutory agency run by a chief commissioner and a number of part-time commissioners. The level of independence currently in the act has been regarded by most in the industry and by this government as insufficient. The Miller review in 2007 recommended greater independence, and this bill delivers that, as was foreshadowed in the green paper. The bill removes the bureau from any direction from the government, except that the minister can direct a particular incident to be investigated. Independence in this area is a core element of public confidence in an investigation authority, and this bill improves and solidifies the public confidence in an already outstanding bureau. I add for completeness that the level of independence contained within this bill is an element of the Chicago Convention on Civil Aviation and so reflects our existing international obligations. In summary, these bills together constitute a very significant advance in improving public confidence in our aviation regulation. There is more to come. The minister, and the government more generally, is still engaged in a detailed consultation process arising out of the matters raised in the green paper. As I indicated earlier, we will see a white paper issued later this year that no doubt will contain a number of other important recommendations for reform in this area. The government is committed to a vibrant, safe and sustainable aviation industry well into the future, and these bills go a long way towards delivering that objective. I commend them to the House.",49
25,Ms MARINO,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,"Forrest) (11.21 am)Safety and security are the most important issues for Australia's aviation industry, and Australian travellers rightly expect the highstandard from regulators to trainers, from air traffic controllers to pilots and from attendants right through to maintenance crews and security staff. The bills before the House, the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009, seek to improve governance of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and establish the Australian Transport Safety Bureau as a statutory agency. The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 will mainly amend the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to reintroduce a board to govern the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and make improvements to the aviation safety regulatory regime under the act. In December 2008 the government released the national aviation policy green paper, Flight path to the future. The paper was the result of an industry consultation process and will serve as the foundation of a white paper due in late 2009. The matters covered in Flight path to the future were wide-ranging in scope, including aviation safety issues, and I note that the government stated that it would strengthen safety issues as well as strengthen the Civil Aviation Safety Authority by its retention as an independent statutory agency with responsibility for aviation safety regulation. The government intends to reinforce CASA's governance arrangements. That includes establishing a small expert board to guide the organisation and to recommend enhancements to CASA's approach to regulation and surveillance of airlines. It will also strengthen CASA's regulatory powers to inspect and regulate the operation of international carriers to ensure safety standards are met. It will update the regulatory powers and enforcement provisions in the Civil Aviation Act 1988, ensuring the effective management of future safety risks as well as giving CASA the necessary powers to deal effectively with operations that do not meet safety standards. The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 strengthens CASA's capacity to access information on suspected safety deficiencies through self-reporting by operators, affirming the obligation on AOC holders to notify CASA immediately of any failures in safety compliance and ensuring CASA's penalty provisions provide a balanced and effective range of responses to breaches. The government is seeking to implement these commitments through the bill. A further commitment by the government following the release of Flight path to the future is to strengthen the independence of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau as a safety investigation agency as part of a statutory agency within the infrastructure portfolio working under a commission structure. This commitment is provided through the associated bill, the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009. Aspects of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 dealing with the CASA governance have also been influenced by the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport into the administration of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and related matters. Recommendation 1 was that: … the Australian Government strengthen CASA's governance framework and administrative capability by: - introducing a small board of up to five members to provide enhanced oversight and strategic direction for CASA; and - undertaking a review of CASA's funding arrangements to ensure CASA is equipped to deal with new regulatory challenges. As I said previously, safety is the most critical issues to passengers and all others involved in the aviation industry. Recent incidents involving Qantas simply reinforced basic safety issues to both passengers and airlines. In fact, these incidents were reported in the January 2009 edition of the European based Flight International magazine in its incidents and accidents listing. Under the category of ‘significant non-fatal incidents worldwide' the actual events listed were the loss of electrical power in a Boeing 747 approaching Bangkok airport in January, the onboard explosive decompression over the Philippines in July and the unexpected drop in altitude for those aboard an Airbus A330 flying over north-west Australia in October 2008. These three incidents involved over a thousand people. Fortunately, all survived, but each incident reminded us why we cannot take air travel safety for granted. The government has introduced these bills but conversely has apparently cut the number of armed air marshals by 35 to 40 per cent. These are the specially trained people who have secretly protected Australian passengers and aircraft with great effect since September 11. This was a $55-million-a-year program. I also understand that the government halted the terrorism awareness training program known as Operation Hawkeye, due to have been implemented at airports right around Australia in 2007. In fact, it was reported in the Australian on 24 February: Airport staff, including front-counter ticketing officers, baggage handlers and cleaners, have not been given basic terrorism awareness training, despite it being a requirement under federal laws brought in after the September 11 attacks. The article quoted counterterrorism expert Nick O'Brien, of Charles Sturt University's centre for policing, as saying: Considering al-Qa'ida is still interested tion as a target … there is nothing wrong with awareness training if it is being provided by the AFP or aviation authorities. The expansion of aviation transport, especially into regional areas, enhancing tourism and regional economies, is extremely important. The Western Australian government has a new tourism campaign, launched recently, ‘Holiday at Home'. It has, by recent accounts, received overwhelming support. A recent survey indicated that Western Australians believe that, in the current economic circumstances, they should be holidaying at home instead of overseas. Many of those will be holidaying in our state and in my part of the state, rediscovering local world-class destinations and enjoying the convenience and value for money of holidaying at home while injecting much needed income into regional economies. It is not surprising, however, that total inbound visitor arrivals are estimated to drop by 4.2 per cent in 2009. Tourism operators and their employees in the industry will continue to be hard hit because the government has failed to support the industry during the global financial crisis. The coalition, when in government, delivered additional support for the tourism industry to assist during times of global crisis. The support included the $79 million tourism recovery initiative, the $10 million SARS recovery package and a special $8 million funding boost for the former regional tourism program to help regional communities increase tourism sales. The Rudd government, in its first budget, introduced nearly $1 billion of new tourism taxes this year, including a 24 per cent increase in the passenger movement charge. This saw the charge increase from $38 to $47 and is an extra cost to airlines, agents, tourism operations and flying travellers. This has hit the aviation industry at a time when it is already struggling with rising costs and economic uncertainty. in aviaShould the government implement all 84 recommendations of the Beale report, that would impose an additional $1 billion in taxes on the tourism industry over the forward estimates, which is of even more concern. That would be $2 billion of new government tourism taxes in two years. Tourism is a key economic driver for Western Australia, generating 80,000 jobs and injecting $7 billion into the economy, with over $2 billion of this spent in regions like my own. With over 483,000 Australians employed in the sector, I believe the government should explain how the $2 billion of tourism taxes will help tourism operators keep their doors open and retain Australian jobs during this period. Regional tourism is hurting. In the south-west in my electorate during the Christmas holiday period, forward orders and bookings were down by a record 10 per cent. Over summer the Busselton, Dunsborough and Margaret River areas are traditionally packed with holiday-makers. These are very difficult times indeed for regional tourism. In the Augusta Margaret River Times on Friday, 23 January the CEO of the tourism association, Francine Burton, confirmed what operators feared most: a 10 per cent slide in visits during the peak January period. And visitors who did come were spending less. Jobs, jobs and jobs in the tourism industry require visitor growth, staff training and infrastructure projects such as regional airports, rail and road upgrades, particularly the Bunbury Outer Ring Road, the Perth to Bunbury highway, a dual highway to Margaret River and the Perimeter Road. I commend the launch of the WA government's marketing campaign aimed at keeping those tourism dollars in the state. It also targets travellers from the eastern side-this side-of Australia as well as Singapore, one of Australia's largest tourism markets. The federal government's first budget provided an eight per cent decrease in total tourism spending, including a $5.9 million funding cut for Tourism Australia, and the Australian Tourism Development Program was cut by nearly half, from $29.9 million to just $16 million. In addition to the increase in the passenger movement charges, passport fees jumped by four per cent and visa application fees rose by $25. A regional airport is very important to my south-west. Currently there are no domestic scheduled services for the holidaying public at any of the airstrips in my electorate. Air movements are serviced by local charter aircraft and privately owned planes. A regional airport facility located in this area would indeed enhance tourism numbers to the region, both of interstate and overseas visitors. It is interesting to note that the 2007 statistics for general aviation in Western Australia, excluding major airlines and regional airlines, showed 1,384 active aircraft flew a total of 394,300 hours. They show 145,300 hours were spent on charter, 110,500 were spent on training, 81,700 were spent on undertaking aerial work involving surveying, photography, mustering and ambulance transport and 30,200 hours were spent on private business. Population growth is increasingly strong in my south-west. It is one of the three fastest-growing regions in Australia, and major infrastructure works are needed for future economic growth in the region. As I have stated before in this House, the population of the shire of Busselton increased by over 7,000 people from 1996 to 2006, an increase of 43 per cent. Over the same period, the state population grew by only 15 per cent. The Busselton shire has a strategy to cater for an additional 11,000 to 12,000 people over the next 15 to 20 years. An expanded airport service will be a necessity to cater for the extra activity in the region. The shire has also identified that the Busselton airport needs to be upgraded and expanded to become a regional airport with domestic services to attract workers and tourists from Perth and interstate. Of course, any expansion would have to deal with avoidance areas, residential estates, sensitive rural activity and noise factors. Currently there are 25 aircraft housed at Busselton airport, and training aircraft regularly take off and land. The Royal Flying Doctor Service conducts regular training and patient pick-ups out of Busselton. In fact, the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Western Australia is kept very busy throughout the whole state and needs to be strongly supported to continue providing invaluable services to remote and regional areas. In 2006-07 the RFDS travelled over five million kilometres, flew over 16,000 hours, transferred over 6,000 patients, conducted over 1,600 clinics and made over 24,000 telehealth calls. In my electorate in the 2007-08 year, the RFDS transferred 768 patients from south-west hospitals, including 493 from Bunbury, 104 from Busselton, 61 from Manjimup, 47 from Collie, 28 from Margaret River, 19 from Bridgetown and eight from Augusta. As a result, we need to have continued investment in regional aviation infrastructure to ensure these and future services are aligned with the needs of regional Australians. The problems at the Perth domestic airport are an example of planning and expansion that have not kept pace with growth. As Geoffrey Thomas reported in the West Australian on Monday, 2 March: Rapid passenger growth, congested air space and big demand from mining companies' fly in, fly out workforces have combined to turn Perth Airport into Australia's most disjointed and dysfuncCASA's tional, with the worse record in the country for late departures … with only 64 per cent of flights leaving on time. … … … Thirty minute-plus delays are not uncommon. Airservices Australia, the government operator of the air traffic control system, has completed a major review of airlanes into the Perth Airport area in an effort to minimise delays. The 61 per cent growth in movements of large aircraft in the past five years has exceeded all expectations and is at the root of the problems at the airport. In 200708 the airport was bulging, handling 9.17 million passengers, which is a 73 per cent leap in just five years. That is four times more than the population of Western Australia. I am also concerned that the green paper makes no mention of flying clubs and instead places its emphasis on training with universities. Beatrice Thomas reported in the West Australian on 18 February that the WA aeroclub warned that flying clubs are under threat from the government's proposed reforms aligning flight schools with universities and also that pilot training could be compromised by the move. The president of the aeroclub, Jack Gregor, said clubs already affected by the slump in the aviation industry would suffer if stripped of training income and believes that practical tuition is better served by flying clubs. It is very important that the government responds to stakeholders in the aviation industry to ensure that the local flight schools and aeroclubs continue their practical, hands-on training. The green paper proposed a five-member board, as I said earlier. That board would appoint the CEO. However, I notice that, on 16 December, the minister announced a new CEO. Flight path to the future examined regulatory powers and industry interactions and considered options for voluntary and mandatory aviation safety reporting requirements, as well as increased penalties for regulatory breaches. The task force recommended that the current reform process be completed by 2011-12. As has been said in this House previously, there is widespread support within industry for the new CASA board that will assist the organisation in managing growth and trends-trends such as low-cost carriers-as well as facilitating effective interaction between the regulator and industry. Continuous technology and other changes taking place in the aviation sector will require governance arrangements that ensure CASA is equipped to monitor and drive the safety outcomes. The new board is expected to facilitate better relations across agencies with safety responsibilities as well as assist with of the industry's and other related stakeholders' strategy input. The bill also states that CASA is not intended to represent sectional interests but is intended as a governance board working for overall safety benefits for the Australian community. It will involve striking a balance between the competing needs of different industry sectors and operating at a strategic level supporting CASA's role in regulation and safety oversight. It will not be involved in day-today activities. The bill also strengthens and improves CASA's enforcement powers across a number of areas, including that of negligence in carrying dangerous goods. It extends the period of enforceable voluntary undertakings to redress identified safety deficiencies from six months to one year. The bill contains a number of changes to CASA's investigative powers and its search and seizure procedures to bring them into line with current Commonwealth criminal justice procedures and practices. It extends powers to allow CASA to use search and seizure powers under chapter 7 of the Criminal Code. Giving CASA the ability to exercise more effective oversight of foreign aircraft operations will significantly enhance CASA's ability to impose requirements on holders of AOCs and other permits authorising the operation of foreign registered aircraft into and out of Australia. This will ensure the provision of more information about their ability and willingness to satisfy safety requirements. I am pleased that the government has accepted the recommendation of Mr Russell Miller to clarify the ATSB's independence as the national safety investigation agencysomething that received strong support from industry. I strongly support this civil aviation amendment and transport legislation. However, I do call on the government to fund the the integration air marshal program.  rise to speak in support of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009. Before I do so, I thought I would declare any possible conflict of interest for the benefit of the House. The first declaration is that I, too, have a general aviation airport in my electorate-Archerfield Airport-and have a long family history with that airport. In fact, I think my grandfather drove bulldozers there back in World War II when the American air force was based there. Also, I live in Moorooka and used to live in Tarragindi, and nearly every single plane that goes into Brisbane Airport coming from the south flies right over my electorate. In fact, when I used to live in Tarragindi, they seemed to fly right over my bedroom. Also, as a member of parliament, obviously, I get to inspect a lot of airports-mainly Brisbane and Canberra airports, but we do wander around the country a bit and see a lot of airports. I turn now to the legislation before the House. I will firstly say that, although it is not perfect, Australia's aviation safety record is the envy of the world. In Australia, aviation accidents and fatalities are extremely infrequent, and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau found that air travel is the safest travel option in Australia. As I said, we do have a very, very proud history. If we look at Qantas, the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services, it has a proud record-a record known round the world, in fact. I take your mind back to the movie Rain Man-I am talking about the movie Rain Man, not the former environment minister, the member for Wentworth, and his cloudseeding experiment but the movie Rain Man that had Dustin Hoffman in it-where there was that famous exchange between Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman. Tom Cruise was playing the character Charlie, and Raymond was played by Dustin Hoffman. I will just quote that exchange, which was a very popular piece of footage on Qantas in-flight movies but which was not shown on any other airline's in-flight movies. The Tom Cruise character, Charlie, says: All airlines have crashed at one time or another. That doesn't mean that they are not safe. Raymond, the autistic brother, says: Qantas. Qantas never crashed. Charlie says: Qantas? Raymond says: Yes, never crashed. Charlie says: Oh, that's gonna do me a lot of good because Qantas doesn't fly to Los Angeles out of Cincinnati, you have to get to Melbourne! Melbourne, Australia in order to get the plane that flies Angeles! Do you hear me? Then Raymond's response is: Canberra's the capital. 16.2 million population. And then Charlie lets go. That exchange illustrates the proud history of safety in Australian air transport. Not only does this safety record ensure that there is greater peace of mind for frequent flyers; it also helps boost confidence in related industries like tourism and freight, so that, when we do a pitch to the world, we are able to do so with a lot more substance. But unfortunately we have not been without incident. Only last year, Qantas passenger aircraft were involved in three significant incidents. Maybe the Rain Man of today would not have that exchange. Thankfully, serious accidents were avoided and no-one was badly injured or killed. However, last year 38 people died as a result of air transport, general aviation and recreational aviation activities. Air safety is something we should never take for granted and something which should remain a top priority for industry and for government. No matter how good our aviation record is, Australia must strive to do even better. Government and industry must work together to ensure the Australian aviation industry remains one of the best and safest in the world. The Rudd government released the national aviation policy green paper Flight path to the future in December last year. I know this paper involved a broad consultation process with industry, and they received a number of submissions from all around Australia. I especially noted some submissions from aviation interests in my electorate, particularly those people connected with the Archerfield Airport. I would like to particularly mention them: the president, Lindsay Snell, who has taken me for an inspection of Archerfield Airport in his helicopter; the exto Los ecutive officer, Ross Steele, who works tirelessly for the Archerfield Airport Chamber of Commerce; the vice-president, David MCGRATH; the secretary, Clement Grehan; and the treasurer, Des Harrison. All of these people are pilots connected with the Archerfield Airport in my electorate and they do fantastic work. Brisbane's secondary airport has long been a magnet for aviation enthusiasts and continues to provide a base for pilot training, freight and weekend pilots such as the office holders that I mentioned. The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 implements a key policy of the green paper: to strengthen Australia's civil watchdog, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, more popularly known as CASA. The bill gives CASA greater powers to enforce safety standards and improves the governance of CASA by establishing a CASA board. The board will provide strategic oversight and direction for air safety and will ensure that CASA performs effectively. The five-member board will be appointed by the minister for terms not exceeding three years. However, the minister will still be limited from directing CASA on certain matters to ensure that decisions are made in the interests of air safety, not political interest. The board will also consider the future directions of air safety and the implications of new technologies and other changes in the industry as they come online. As I said previously, this bill also strengthens CASA's power to enforce air safety standards. For example, a new offence of the negligent carriage of dangerous goods will be created. This effectively closes a loophole to ensure that carriers take appropriate care when transporting dangerous goods on an aircraft. The bill also gives CASA greater powers relating to overseas based operators who are flying to Australia. Before allowing a flight to enter Australia, CASA will be able to take into account the conduct of the air operator and the level of safety oversight provided by civil aviation authorities in other countries. This measure will help build confidence that aircraft enterures ing Australian skies comply with appropriate safety measures. These extra powers will also ensure that CASA can take reasonable steps to enforce air safety while not placing an unnecessary burden on the industry. In addition to the increased powers and better governance for CASA, the government is also committed to boosting the independence of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. The Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill will establish the Australian Transport Safety Bureau as an independent statutory authority from 1 July 2009. In his 2007 review, Russell Miller recommended that the government address the independence of the ATSB and clarify its role as the national safety investigation agency. These amendments will achieve this. The position of executive directors will be replaced by commissioners appointed by the minister. Apart from having matters referred for investigation, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau will be able to exercise its powers without any interference. Travel is such a vital and important part of modern life, particularly in a nation like Australia that is such a large continent. As a Queenslander, coming from the most decentralised state, I am particularly passionate about air travel and transport in all forms. Whether we are travelling to work, to visit friends or just for fun, everybody has a right to expect that their journey will be a safe one. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. I accept, and I think we can all acknowledge, that sometimes accidents happen and sometimes people make mistakes, but it is our responsibility as a government to ensure that we do whatever we can to keep our roads, rails, skies and waterways safe. It is also our responsibility to ensure that mechanisms are in place to thoroughly investigate breaches of safety, that dodgy transport operators are held accountable and that measare put in place to ensure that mistakes do not happen again. Any smart society knows that you learn from your mistakes rather than keep repeating them. These bills work together to improve transport safety for everyone. I thank the transport minister for his commitment to improving transport safety and his work in introducing these bills. I commend the bills to the House.",52
26,Mr KATTER,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 and the cognate bill and to vent my extreme anger with CASA, which I think is a disgraceful organisation that takes no responsibility for responsibilities it is supposed to be exercising. In the case of bananas, I hope we will prosecute the public servants responsible personally, because we just cannot go on having government in Australia like this. Karumba is a little town of nearly a thousand people who were completely cut off during the floods, being some 15 kilometres from the nearest land. The nearest town was three hours away by a glorified dinghy; that was the only way for nearly a thousand people to get out of that town if they broke a leg or had a heart attack, because there is no airport, because thanks to privatisation no-one is looking after the airport and the airport fallen into disuse and cannot be used anymore. So there is no way of getting in or out except by helicopter. There are no helicopters in the area that have CasEvac stretcher facilities, so if people had a heart attack-as you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Washer-or a broken limb, there was no way we could transport them out except in a glorified dinghy, for a journey of nearly three hours across raging, crocodileinfested floodwaters up to Normanton. After being venomously attacked in the media, the state government-they must be condemned-eventually put a helicopter there, but the helicopter had no stretcher facility. After being venomously attacked again, the government gave us a stretcher facility. But when the helicopter was put there-and this was the second week of what became two months of Karumba being cut off in this way-it had no night-flying capacity. There are very few choppers in Queensland that do have night-flying capacity, and this is not a problem. I use helicopters a lot and the arguments over safety are absolutely, totally spurious. If you ascend 50 or 100 feet above Normanton, you can see Karumba. You can see it during the day and you can see it at night. Even though it is three hours away by boat, because you have to follow the river, it is only about 35 or 40 kilometres as the crow flies. You can clearly see it, so the arguments about deep holes and disorientation and all of that rubbish are enormously spurious. In addition to that, the helicopter has an instrument that tells you whether you are horizontal, so if you have a GPS and an instrument that tells you whether you are horizontal or not and if you can see the lights of both towns then any argument that says that the helicopter cannot be used at night is spurious. I rang up three of the leading helicopter operators in Queensland and asked them has about it. They said: ‘Why wouldn't you be allowed to do that? Sure, you need a night rating'-and these people do not have night rating-‘but why would anyone refuse you the right to do that?' I said, ‘CASA is point blank refusing to give it.' At this very moment those people up there-a thousand Australians-have been deprived of that right and possibly of their life. If anyone dies there, let there be no doubt I will be in Slater & Gordon's office so fast all you will see is a blur of speed for me to get in there and sue these people. The clause says that in an emergency the helicopter can be used. But who is to say it is an emergency? All we wanted from CASA was for them to say that there was an emergency situation there. The chopper pilot, according to CASA, was going to risk his life. But he is now risking his life, according to CASA, and his job because the onus and burden of proof shifts to him to prove why he should not be prosecuted. They made it quite clear that they were not going to declare an emergency situation at Karumba. These people are drunk with power. Dick Smith needs to be put back in charge. Dick Smith used the phrase ‘affordable safety'. For people sitting down here comfortably in Canberra, it might be very nice to make it impossible to have an aeroplane crash; that would be very comfortable for them. My grandad put a lot of money he could not afford into a little company called Qantas because it might just have been a matter of life and death for us to have aeroplanes operating. They may not have been really safe but they were a hell of a lot better than having nothing. My father, a wonderful man, said that if ever on earth he had met a saint it was ‘Flynn of the Inland'-the Reverend Flynn-who instituted the Royal Flying Doctor Service. We do not know how many lives they saved, but they went out in little aircraft that in today's terms would be very unsafe indeed. They risked their lives to save lives and they saved hundreds and hundreds of lives, and to my knowledge they never lost an aeroplane. I will come back to my own family's experience-and I do not have to go any further than my own family's experience, living on the frontiers of Australia for four generations on the Katter side. My uncle-who I never, ever saw; he died before I was bornwas injured in a football match, and there was a previous car accident. He was in very desperate straits and, because my grandfather was perspicacious enough to know that you could get an aeroplane to fly him to Brisbane, after some phoning around-this is back in the 1920s-they got an aeroplane. But by the time they got the Qantas aeroplane to come across from Longreach to Cloncurry it was really too late. By the time he arrived in Brisbane it was too late. That is the difference with ‘affordable safety': it is our decision if we wish to have situation where it may not be safe. But we have no aeroplanes. At Ingham, we simply cannot get in or out because there are no light aircraft left in North Queensland. They have all been closed down because of the cost structures that have been imposed principally, they tell me, by CASA. The privatisation of the airports has created another huge problem for aviation affordability in Australia. There is no use us saying that the planes may not be safe, because there are no planes at all. If you break a leg on a cattle station, too bad for you; you just have to die. You may have something that might be a headache or it might also be an aneurism in the brain and you might be about to die. The famous Saxby case, which down through the years got an awful lot of publicity, was just such a case-there was a kick in the head at the rodeo and a headache. You cannot justify sending a Royal Flying Doctor Service plane a thousand kilometres every time a person gets a headache. I defended the Royal Flying Doctor Service in that situation. But the fact of the matter was that the man had brain damage and died. If there had been a light aircraft in the vicinity, he would have been flown out by that light aircraft and he would be alive today. It was that sort of case. The doctor said, ‘If this man had been flown out when the owners of the station requested him to be flown out then that man would be alive today.' I am saying that Dick Smith's concept of affordable safety is where we should be at. To demonstrate the towering hypocrisy of CASA, I can tell you that I sent two letters to them concerning an aviation company in North Queensland. To my knowledge, there was not one single thing done about that airline-not a single damn thing. I do not think I even got the courtesy of a telephone call from CASA. There was evidence there of a series of conduct that was not in line with a what I would expect from an airline in terms of safety. So, for the only problem I had in that area, CASA was not there at all; they might as well have been on Mars. The other case is the case of the helicopters. They tortured our mustering helicopters. They imposed all sorts of conditions that were almost impossible to meet. If they had got away with it at the time, it would have doubled the cost of mustering in the cattle industry in Australia and achieved absolutely nothing in the way of safety. It concerned fatigue. I have lost some very close friends in chopper accidents, so I take a very keen interest in chopper accidents. Having had cattle all of my adult life, almost since I was a kid-just me, not my parents-obviously it is a matter that concerns me greatly. The mustering industry-not necessarily the cattle industry-is one of the major industries in the electorate that I represent. Out of seven accidents-before this controversy with CASA arose, which I will come to in a moment-not a single one had the slightest, remotest element of fatigue associated with it. It just so happened that all seven cases the bloke had had a very long and adequate night's sleep-and there was no-one sharing his sleep, if you get my drift. There was no fatigue element, yet these people were going to go out and impose a regime that would have nearly doubled the cost of mustering cattle on the big runs in the areas I represent-not to achieve a single iota of extra safety. Worse still: they were acting out of complaints by one company against another company. So they acted at the behest of a big corporate company against an owner-operated company in North Queensland. The point I am coming to is that I have written to CASA again and again. I have had personal meetings with them to plead with them to put electrical powerline sounders on helicopters, because five of those seven deaths were the result of helicopters running into powerlines. That is the gravest of dangers that continues for any helicopter operator. Whether he is a tourist operator or a parachute facilitator or a crop duster helicopsafety ter-whatever the hell he is-the greatest danger is powerlines. It is a very simple device. When you come close to a powerline, it starts shrieking and tells you: ‘Hey! Stop! Stop where you are. Don't go any further, because you are about to run into a powerline.' The cost of these units is $5,000. If you are paying a couple of hundred thousand dollars for a helicopter, $5,000 is not a lot of money one way or the other. Purchased in bulk-through a government contract, of course-I would say they would probably be under $3,000. But CASA has not done one single thing to put the sounders in. There will be friends of mine who will die in the next five or 10 years as a result of the irresponsibility of these people. These are the same people who said: ‘You can't take the chopper into Karumba.' I will tell you why: because in they get a big buzz out of the power. They get a big buzz out of deciding who will live and who will die. It made them feel really powerful. It was the only reason that this occurred. The remarks I have just made are unassailable. There is nothing in the regulations that requires an electricity transmission line sounder on helicopters-nothing at all. I have spoken to hundreds of mustering pilots over the years, and they all say: ‘Yeah, it would be a good idea, but I don't do it, Bobby, because I drive very safely.' These blokes all consider themselves bulletproof. They are blokes who are roughriders in rodeos and play rugby league football. The chopper pilots are a pretty good mob. They are my mob, and I know them all well. They are people who are of the very essence of the business that they are in. They love the sense of adventure and excitement-and, of course, they believe they are bulletproof. Take the example of safety belts in cars: all of the opinion polls that were taken before belts came in said people did not think they should be compulsory. But no-one put them in voluntarily; that had to be done by the government. It is a similar situation here. So I would plead with the minister. I do not like the increased search and seizure visions. These are people who have clearly demonstrated-in the case of Karumba-that they like throwing their weight around and having their power. People are terrified of them. Every single person involved in aviation in Australia is absolutely terrified of them-and quite rightly so. They literally have the power of life and death, and they have the power of taking your income away from you as well. We have reached a situation in North Queensland where we really have to ring up probably a week in advance now to get aeroplanes, because there are no aeroplanes left. We had five charter operators working out of Townsville, and now we have effectively one-that is all. Where we had maybe 20 charter planes there, we might now have two or three at the most. People tell me-not necessarily people in Townsville-that CASA has imposed such heavy cost burdens upon this industry that they no longer can operate, and ‘If we charge what we have to charge to make a quid, there'd be no business out there; no-one would use us.' That is the reason behind the ridiculously high charges, but they have to charge like that to meet the requirements. These people have no reason to tell me lies, and they did not say these things with any vindictiveness towards CASA-far from it. I said to them, ‘Costs have doubled over the last seven or 10 years'-or whatever it was; it might have been three years-and they said, ‘Mate, the costs of meeting the regulations these days have exploded; they've skyrocketed.' People in the country, where I come from, will die if we do not have aeroplanes. It has become almost impossible to have aeroplanes. I would say that, when I was elected to parliament, we had 100 or maybe 200 aeroplanes in country North Queensland-if I could use that expression. I doubt whether we would have 15 or 20 now. Why have they progone? The price of an aeroplane has not increased all that much. The price of fuel most certainly has, but that is not a huge item in this case. And the wages for pilots have hardly moved much at all, unfortunately. There are rules. Rules are made for the guidance of wise men and the obedience of fools, and every single person who has lived under a regime of rules will know that that is a very, very true thing to say. But this has a different dimension to it. When you know that people's lives were placed at risk at Karumba due to something which cannot be described in any other way except pedantic arrogance, you know that that is a group that needs to be called into question. CASA are there to deliver safety for people. How conscious are these people of safety when a thousand human beings were left for three hours in tiny, glorified dinghies, in raging, crocodile-infested floodwaters, thanks to their decision-which not a single operator in Queensland thought was anything more than ridiculous? When I rang people, they could not understand why I was ringing them. One person said, ‘How could it be dangerous? Are there storms around?' I said, ‘No. If there are storms around that is a dangerous situation, but I'm not talking about storms; I am just talking about an ordinary, star-lit night.' He said, ‘Well, why wouldn't you do it?' And I said, ‘Because they won't give us a clearance. The bloke has to risk his job', andaccording to them-risk his life. We all know that there is no risk to life over and above what is the normal risk with a helicopter. We know that, but they are now told that they risk losing their job if they go in and rescue someone. I am sure that, if called upon, those young chopper pilots-decent, terrific people; exciting people to be with, actually, in every respect-would have gone in and risked their jobs. I do not think that they would have been risking their lives, but I think that they most certainly would have been risking their jobs. That stress was put upon them by CASA. I see no reason to praise this organisation-none whatsoeverand I see every reason to condemn them. (Time expired)",59
27,Mr CHEESEMAN,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,"Today I rise to speak on the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009, and I look forward to this opportunity. These bills are important in their detail, but the overall context is also important. The bills are also important for my electorate of Corangamite, in Geelong. I will get to the detail of the legislation in a minute, of all let us look at the context surrounding the bills. The bills show just how much attention we give our airline industry. They show that in Australia we are constantly trying to improve and refine our aviation industry. We are constantly trying to make our airline industry and air commuting safer. We are vigilant about improving regulation and governance arrangements in the industryand so we should be. Obviously, this is an industry where there are risks and where accidents can be catastrophic. I think if you sit back and look at this legislation in context for a minute, you will see that it says a lot about our whole approach to aviation. It says we have the very healthy attitude that we can always do better. We are constantly searching for excellence in the running of this industry. That is certainly what this government is about. I think if you look at the attitudes behind this legislation, you will see why Australia has one of the safest and most efficient aviation industries in the world. I want to put on the record that I am proud of the Australian aviation industry's record, particularly on safety. In the first instance, I will go to some of the detail of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009. This bill puts in place the government's national aviation policy green paper commitment. This commitment was about establishing a Civil Aviation Safety Authority board and enhancing CASA's ability to take critical additional actions around safety. The board that is proposed to be established will be a small expert board, responsible for CASA's strategic oversight. We will have the best in the business on this board, with an appropriate mix of very high-level skills. It will support the Director of Aviation Safety in managing CASA. The director will retain responsibility for the normal day-today debut first cision-making processes. There are a number of things in this bill that will help CASA's ability to take necessary safety action. These measures include creating an offence for the negligent carriage of dangerous goods; extending CASA's powers to regulate foreign operators; amending the automatic stay provisions in relation to CASA's power to prevent an unsafe operator from flying; and bringing CASA's investigation powers into alignment with the Criminal Code. This bill will further enhance CASA's governance arrangements. The CASA board is not intended to represent the sectional interests of the aviation industry. It will be a high-level, very skilled and knowledgeable strategic body. It will not be directly involved in the day-today activities of the authority. Whilst to a certain extent these roles are undertaken today, this structure very much clarifies the situation. There will be very clear structural governance arrangements. The director will manage CASA under the board's strategic guidance and will be responsible to the board. Another important aspect of this bill is what is termed the ‘automatic stay provisions'. In the past, I believe, CASA has been hamstrung by automatic stay provisions, which nullified CASA's ability to suspend dodgy operators. Without naming names, in my electorate we have had at least one operator whom I believe has taken enormous risks, and I would go as far as saying that this operator defines the word ‘shonky'. Passengers, pilots and the public were all put at risk by this operator, who was expert in using legal loopholes to continue with very dubious operations. CASA had a lot of difficulty in dealing with this operator ing decisive action where necessary. Partly, this was due to the regulatory difficulties within the various acts. I think the new regulation will help CASA deal with these types of outfits. Amendments in this bill are proposed to the automatic stay provisions. This will ensure that any extension beyond five days of a CASA decision to vary, suspend or cancel certain civil aviation authorisations is the result of an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a stay and the AAT's determination on that application. The effect of this amendment will be to ensure important safety related implications of permitting a stay to continue beyond a five-day period only occur if a stay order from the AAT is sought. This would minimise any incentive, on the part of civil aviation authorisation holders or other affected persons, to unreasonably delay a determination of the matter on the merits by the AAT. I think that is an important step forward. The other important aspect of this bill is regulatory oversight of foreign based operators. The bill strengthens CASA's regulatory oversight of foreign based operators flying to Australia. It ensures CASA has the ability to satisfy itself that all operators flying into Australia are receiving adequate safety oversight outside Australia. That is a crucial power. This is obviously a difficult area and one which will need ongoing close monitoring to see whether these regulatory changes actually achieve what we have set out to achieve. The changes in this area allow CASA to take a broader range of issues into account when considering whether to allow a foreign operator to fly into Australia. They enable CASA to take greater account of the conduct of air operators in their home and in other jurisdictions as well as the level of safety oversight provided by civil aviation authorities in other countries. This is another and in takimportant step forward. The other major aspect of this bill is about carrying dangerous goods. The bill closes a loophole that controls the carriage of dangerous goods on board an aircraft. This is a major safety issue. The inclusion of an offence for the negligent carriage or consignment of these goods makes sure that any lack of care by carriers and consignors is adequately addressed. Finally, when we are talking about the aviation industry and there is a politician from the Geelong region speaking on this issue in this chamber, one might expect some of the detail related to the establishment and development of Avalon airport within Geelong. I will get to how the detail of this bill relates to Avalon, but first I would like to, again, put on the public record the importance of Avalon. As you are probably aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Washer, the future development of Avalon airport, both for domestic aviation and potentially for international carriers, is critical to the future of my region. It is critical for tourism operators, who are already one of the major drivers of our economy, particularly along the Great Ocean Road. If Avalon is opened up to international carriers, tourism will go to a whole new level in my region. Thousands more people will be employed in the tourism sector if Avalon goes international. There is nothing more significant to tourism in my region than the future of Avalon. Avalon is also important to a range of other industries, particularly industries trading overseas and high-tech industries, because goods can be brought in or exported much faster, more efficiently and much more safely. Goods can be exported or imported on time. What happens to Avalon will have a big bearing on our region's whole future. I think all ministers in this government are now aware of the importance of Avalon. This bill, I believe, is another little step in the future development of Avalon. One of the key issues with the future development of Avalon is, of course, security. Avalon, if it is opened up to the world, will become another part of the Australian border. This bill, by degree, improves border security by providing better governance arrangements in the aviation industry. It makes the governance of the aviation industry more robust, safer and more secure. The bill also gives us greater control over foreign airline operators. This will surely also add to the confidence we can have in security. Of course, the activities we are dealing with are not just decisive in security; they will all play their part in giving us confidence in the overall system. The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill shows this government's commitment to aviation safety. In yet another important area of public policy we are taking decisive action to strengthen the nation's safety agencies and their oversight of the aviation industry. Circumstances have clearly changed since the decision in 2003 to abolish the CASA board. Since then, a substantial amount of organisational reform has been undertaken in CASA, and the way that CASA interacts with the aviation industry has evolved. This legislation recognises that evolution. As I said, the bill is just another example of why Australia has the safest, and certainly one of the most efficient, airline industries in the world. I will now make a few comments about the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009. The bill amends the Transport Safety Investigation Act 2003 to establish the Australian Transport Safety Bureau as a statutory agency within the meaning of the Public Service Act 1999. The agency will be established with a commission structure and will come into being on 1 July 2009. The intent of this amendment is very simple. It is to strengthen the independence and clarify the role of the ATSB as the national safety investigation agency. It clarifies the relationship with CASA and puts in place arrangements to ensure independence in the investigation process. This change did not come out of any whim. It was the result of some careful consideration and, in particular, a review in 2007 by Mr Russell Miller AM. Mr Miller found that there was room for improvement and clarification in the relationship between the two agencies at a governance level. This issue was also addressed in the national aviation policy green paper, released on 2 December 2008. It is crucial that, where accidents or incidents occur, investigations are independent of the parties involved in an accident, including transport regulators and government policymakers. It is a way of avoiding conflicts of interest and external interference so that the findings of any investigation are completely beyond question. The amendment is also completely consistent with the Convention on International Civil Aviation, which states: The accident investigation authority shall have independence in the conduct of the investigation and have unrestricted authority over its conduct … The ATSB will also have operational independence with respect to exercising its investigative powers and functional independence with respect to the administration of its resources. The Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009 again demonstrates this government's commitment to aviation safety. It demonstrates Labor is committed to scrutinising and improving all areas of our aviation industry. Labor is taking decisive action to strengthen the nation's safety agencies and their oversight of the aviation industry. I commend these bills to the House.",64
28,Mr ZAPPIA,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak in support of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009. These bills implement the government's national aviation policy green paper commitment to establishing a Civil Aviation Safety Authority board and to enhancing CASA's ability to take necessary safety action. With respect to that, I note that the primary functions of the board will be: deciding on the objectives, strategies and policies to be followed by CASA; ensuring CASA performs its functions efficiently and effectively; and ensuring CASA complies with directions given by the minister under section 12B. Enhanced safety will be achieved through this legislation by implementing four specific actions. Firstly, an offence will be created for the negligent carriage of dangerous goods on board aircraft; secondly, CASA's powers will be extended to regulate foreign operators; thirdly, the automatic stay provisions in relation to CASA's power to prevent an unsafe operator from flying will be amended; and, fourthly, CASA's investigative powers will be brought into alignment with the Criminal Code. Whilst Australia's aviation industry has a very good safety record, the government needs to maintain a watchful eye on the existing legislation relating to the aviation industry in Australia. It is an industry that employs roughly 55,000 people across the nation. Last year, according to the latest figures I was able to obtain, there were some 48.8 million passenger movements within Australia. There were also 23.5 million international passenger movements at airports in the major city and regional airports in Australia. That is a lot of people using aircraft services. Interestingly, last year 38 people died in aviation accidents in this country, and the year before the figure was 23. It might be coincidental that the number has increased and, when one looks at the number of people killed or injured in aircraft accidents compared to, perhaps, those killed in road accidents, the number is pretty low. But, for people who fly, there is always that concern. The loss of any life is huge, and if it can be avoided then so it should be. Also interestingly, in the year 2003, there were 4,856 incidents reported that related to the aviation industry. In 2008, the figure was 7,833-a fairly substantial increase. Likewise, when it comes to serious incidents, in 2003 there were six reported and in 2008 there were 64. I acknowledge that that may well be a result of the better reporting procedures put in place in 2003.It does not necessarily imply that there was a dramatic increase in the number of incidents and serious incidents-it may well be that the reporting arrangements are much better and that, as a result, we are therefore able to better track what is happening. It may be that; but I do not know for certain, and I do not think that anyone else does either-it may also be the case that there has, in fact, been an increase in the number of incidents that have been investigated by the relevant authorities. In recent times, hardly a week has gone by when we do not hear or read about an aircraft incident in some part of the world. Regrettably, when a serious accident does occur, the number of lives lost is often substantial. Even more regrettable is that most of those accidents might have been avoided if additional safety precautions had been taken. Any action, therefore, that can be taken to ensure a greater level of safety for aviation passengers should be implemented. Aviation travel has become a necessary and frequently used mode of travel by commuters, and we are likely to see aviation passenger numbers increase in the years ahead. I heard the member for Port Adelaide make a reference to that in his address earlier on, and I believe is absolutely right when he talks about the trends in the aviation industry worldwide. Simultaneously, many of those carriers are likely to be foreign owned airlines, as the airline industry becomes more globalised and more competitive. While competition provides passengers with cheaper prices-and we have seen a substantial reduction in some airfares-it also inevitably leads to costcutting by the carriers. That cost-cutting can sometimes jeopardise the safety standards that are expected of the aviation industry. With the global financial recession, one can only expect that the aviation industry will also face additional financial pressures and, in turn, that those will lead to further costcutting. That cost-cutting may well lead to cost-cutting in areas relating to safety. For example, the screening of goods-and, in particular, dangerous goods-that are taken on board aircraft has not always been as thorough as it should have been. I suspectand I do not have any particular evidence of this-that there would be many examples of products taken on board aircraft where, had the authorities been aware that those goods were being taken on board the aircraft, they would never have been allowed. Under this bill, negligence by the carriers in allowing dangerous goods on board an aircraft will become an offence, thereby creating a greater level of responsibility by the carriers. In other words, in the future, negligence will no longer be a defence from prosecution. Importantly, under this bill, CASA's powers will be extended to include foreign operators. This is a critical change the CASA's authority, because, presently, there is little control over the maintenance and safety standards applied by foreign airlines-yet they fly into Australia and carry Australian passengers. We have absolutely no control, really, with respect to those airline services' maintenance standards in the he countries in which they are based. I note that this provision is consistent with actions taken in the European Union and in North America with respect to these issues. Of course, the ideal situation would be that uniform aircraft safety legislation would apply across the world. If that legislation was in place, there would be an obligation on all countries and on all governments to enforce the provisions of that legislation. I also very much welcome the provisions in this bill which bring CASA's investigative powers in line with the Criminal Code. Investigating the cause of aircraft incidents can be a very difficult task. Therefore, providing CASA with both the investigative tools required and appropriate penalties to impose where breaches are established can only improve compliance by the carriers and improve safety for passengers. I point out that that particular provision of the bill contains a number of changes to CASA's investigative powers and search and seizure procedures to bring them into line with current Commonwealth criminal justice procedures and practices. It will also extend powers to allow CASA to use search and seizure powers under chapter 7 of the Criminal Code. I welcome the introduction of those provisions. Parafield Airport is a general aviation airport located adjacent to the electorate of Makin, which I represent. It is located just north of the city of Adelaide and was established almost 80 years ago. I am very familiar with the airport and with the safety concerns that have been raised with me by residents living in the area surrounding the airport over many years-because, prior to being a member of this place, I was the Mayor of the City of Salisbury, which has jurisdiction over the area in which Parafield Airport is located. Over the years, it would be fair to say that I have received numerous-probably hundreds-of representations from residents about aircraft safety issues relating to Parafield Airport. Those concerns arise because of two specific factors. Firstly, over years, the residential development has encroached on land in very close proximity to the airport. While the airport was always there, and while the new homeowners were aware of the proximity of the airport to their homes, the fear of a mishap and of an aircraft crashing into a residential area is always there among some homeowners. Added to that is the fact that there has been a substantial level of commercial and industrial development on the airport land itself in recent years, bringing aircraft activitiesparticularly take-offs and landings-much closer to where people work or shop. The second concern is that much of the airport activity-and I am referring to the flying activity at the airport-is related to a flying school, where, logically, many of the aircraft are being flown by trainee pilots. The safety record of the airport and of the training school is very, very good, and I believe that the safety concerns raised may not be warranted. But, whether they are warranted or not, they are nevertheless real in the minds of many of the residents who have raised them with me. Therefore, any additional action that we can take as a parliament to improve aviation safety will put their minds at ease and will certainly be welcomed by those residents. If those residents know that the provisions relating to airport safety have been strengthened, they will then at least have some peace of mind and will know that every possible precaution is being taken to ensure that a mishap does not occur and that their safety is not being placed at any risk. In respect of flight safety and accidents, I refer to a comment I made when we were debating the Safe Work Australia Bill. One of the matters that I believe is sometimes overlooked is that many of the people who work in the airline industry-and I referred to some 55,000 earlier on-are obviously onboard these planes. Ensuring that we have the the right regulations in place to ensure their utmost safety is also an issue of safe work practices. For them it is a work safety issue because they are employees and their livelihoods depend on working within the aviation industry, whether it is onboard the plane or at the airport itself, where many of the accidents occur. If for no other reason, there is certainly a good argument to ensure that we protect those who work within the industry and that we do whatever is possible to ensure their safety. These amendments complement other legislative changes to aviation safety that have already been introduced by the Rudd government and bring additional peace of mind to aircraft passengers, to airline staff and to the broader community. I commend both of these bills to the House.",67
29,Mr ALBANESE,INVESTIGATION AMENDMENT,"Grayndler-Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (12.40 pm)-in reply-The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2009 and the Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill 2009 will strengthen Australia's aviation safety regime and honour a pledge I made when releasing the government's aviation green paper late last year. I thank all members who participated in the debate for their input to this legislation. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority will have its governance enhanced by the creation of an expert board to provide high-level direction of the organisation's regulatory and safety oversight role. The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill will also make changes to improve CASA's oversight of foreign carriers flying into Australia. The bill strengthens the provisions for preventing operators from continuing to operate services where CASA considers it unsafe for them to continue. Finally, it closes a gap in the current by introducing an additional offence of negligently carrying or consigning dangerous goods on an aircraft. I have noted the comments from the shadow minister for transport, who expressed some concern about the nature of appointments. Let me assure the shadow minister that the appointments to this board will be in accordance with the highest standards. We need to make sure that these appointments are not political. I was surprised, given the number of former staffers of National Party transport ministers that I run into in official positions, that the shadow minister made those comments. I am sure that those comments apply to people when they come up for re-appointment as well, given the shadow minister's expression. Indeed, we need to make sure that right across the transport sector we have the best possible appointments to official positions, but there is nowhere where this is more important than in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The Transport Safety Investigation Amendment Bill reinforces the ATSB's independent status by establishing it as a separate statutory agency with a full-time chief commissioner and two part-time commissioners. It will also give the ATSB new powers to compel agencies and operators within the aviation industry to respond to its formal recommendations within 90 days. The amendments in these two bills strengthen public confidence in the safety and reliability of air travel. I commend the bills to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

32,Mr ABBOTT,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"Warringah) (12.46 pm)This is very important legislation and it is quite appropriate that it be given plenty of scrutiny by this House. I know that it is very important to the government. The government would not have brought this forward without very strong reasons which seem good to the government, but the opposition has a wide range of questions and issues which it thinks need to be taken into account before this Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009 and cognate bill are finally dealt with. Australia is obviously in difficult financial circumstances right now, and these bills are part of a range of legislation which the government has put before the House to try to deal with those circumstances. The government is to be commended for the seriousness with which it has taken the current financial circumstances, but it is to be condemned for the fact that so much of the response is about spending money rather than undertaking continued long-term reform that will strengthen the economic base of the country. It was the British Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan who said, back in the late seventies, that you cannot spend your way out of a recession. What you can do, though-possibly, not certainly-is reform your way out of a recession. That is the problem that this government has. It has turned out to be much better at spending moneymoney which has been accumulated by the BILL 2009 careful husbandry of former Prime Minister John Howard and the member for Higgins, Peter Costello. It has turned out to be much, much better at spending that money than actually doing the hard yards of reformreform which the former government never BILL 2009 shirked. So far, I regret to say, this is a government which has not taken any hard decisions. It is not a tough decision to spend money that someone else has accumulated. That is, in fact, a very easy decision because there is absolutely no-one who will ever object to government money being spent on them or their particular cause. So that, in a nutshell, is why this legislation deserves the important scrutiny of this chamber. That is why a significant number of frontbenchers from the opposition will be forensically analysing the legislation in the course of this debate. I have had great pleasure in trying to at least contextualise the position of the opposition in the debate that we now intend to proceed with.",71
33,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"It is a little bit of a shame-despite the valiant attempts of the contribution we have just seen-that the shadow minister could not make it down here to actually outline what the opposition's position is in relation to this legislation. But it is not surprising, really, that the opposition is not quite sure where they are in relation to responding to this legislation, because they are in a mess. They are not quite sure where they are in responding to the economic crisis that is engulfing Australia and the rest of the world. They are not quite sure where they should be in relation to the issue of Work Choices, and they are even all over the place on the question of who should actually be their leader. So it is not surprising that we have had the kind of contribution that we have just seen there, one that has had to be done on the run and one where the shadow minister himself could not make it down to talk to this particular legislation. The Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009 and cognate bill are important pieces of legislation, and they mark a stark contrast between the approach to government adopted by the Rudd government and that of the previous government. This approach is about working and cooperating with the states to get better outcomes for all Australians. It is not about trying to stand over the states. It not about trying to have money conditional on them adopting a particular philosophical approach-which we saw all too often under the previous government. This is about sitting down, cooperating and coming up with clear objectives and clear ideas that are going to help all Australians in a wide range of areas. It is about delivering on the important promise that we made, going into the last election, that we would look to end the blame game with the states. This legislation is a terrific example of the concrete steps this government has taken to do that by sitting down and cooperating, by clearly defining roles and responsibilities, and by making sure that there are fair and sustainable financial arrangements between the states and the Commonwealth. With this bill there is a focus by all the parties in these financial relations-the federal government and the state and territory governments-on long-term development and enhancement of government service delivery. We will see enhanced public accountability through simpler, standardised and more transparent performance reporting by all jurisdictions. There will be a stronger fort towards the achievement of outcomes, efficient service delivery and timely public reporting. These bills will bring other positive aspects as well: reduced administrative and compliance overheads; stronger incentives to implement economic and social reforms; ongoing provisions of the GST payments to the states and territories, equivalent to revenue received from the GST; and the equalisation of the fiscal capacities between states and territories. The national specific purpose payments will be spent in the key service delivery sectors. Of course, when we are doing this, we are talking about schools, early childhood, health and disabilities, vocational education and housing. In my electorate of Dobell on the Central is Coast, we enjoy a great lifestyle. It is probably one of the country's best, with some beautiful beaches and coastline. We have large areas of natural and pristine national parks, and we are very close to Australia's biggest city. But like many growing areas, we are still in need of better services; we still have some way to go to achieving those. This bill is about trying to coordinate and provide better services in those key areas of schools, early childhood, health, disabilities, vocational education and housing. In Dobell that our schools need upgrading. Early childhood facilities need to be expanded. Health services are in higher demand. In fact, Wyong Hospital has the fifth busiest emergency department in New South Wales, and Gosford Hospital has the seventh busiest. So we have very busy health facilities and a growing population. At the last election the Rudd government committed to establishing a super GP clinic in my electorate. I know, from talking to constituents, that they are all eagerly awaiting the announcement of the successful tenderer for that, and we are expecting that to happen any day now. Such a facility has been earmarked for the area where ef- the demand for health services is highest. In this case it is in the fast-growing suburbs of the Wyong shire in the northern part of the Central Coast. Hospitals and their busy emergency departments are getting busier and, with an ageing population, these health facilities are coming under increasing pressure because of what is still a low per capita number of doctors compared to many areas of New South Wales. We have important issues relating to water infrastructure that need to be addressed. In the last election the Rudd government promised to construct a pipeline between the Mardi Dam on the coast and the largest storage dam, the Mangrove Creek Dam, in the mountains behind the Central Coast. This sort of infrastructure is vital for the Central Coast. We have experienced the full effects of the drought. In fact, we were down to less than 13 per cent of our water supply. Even with a heavier than usual period of rain in last 12 months, our dam capacities are still only 31 per cent. The Rudd government is working with the local council on this issue to make sure that solutions are worked out cooperatively, that they provide outcomes that benefit everyone on the Central Coast and that they help to secure the water supply for all the citizens there. The Council of Australian Governments has developed a new integrated approach to improving health outcomes for all Australians and improving the sustainability of the Australian health system. The agreement identifies the long-term objectives of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. Those objectives are: prevention so that Australians are born and remain healthy; primary and community health so that Australians receive appropriate high-quality and affordable primary and community health services; hospital and related care so that Australians receive appropriate high-quality and affordable hospital and hospital related care; aged care so that older Australians receive appropriate high-quality and affordable health and aged care services; patient experience so that Australians have a positive health and aged care experience which takes account of individual circumstances and care needs; social inclusion and Indigenous health so that Australia's health system promotes social inclusion and reduces social disadvantage, especially for Indigenous Australians; and sustainability so that Australians have a sustainable health system. These are important and very worthy objectives that, by sitting down and working together, the federal and state governments have been able to reach agreement on. Part of this bill is about making sure that these sorts of important long-term goals, which are so vital to ensuring that our health system functions properly, are enacted and put into place and that we have both those levels of government workthe ing together for a common outcome rather at than working in silos, with the public losing as a result. In the area of disabilities, we have made many improvements but there is still a long way to go. Recently in this place I spoke about our local disability groups and how they regularly give accounts of the struggles faced by many people with disabilities and their carers in my community. Transport is a major problem for people with disabilities. Finding a job is still a major challenge in many ways for people with disabilities. The Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services spoke to a number of groups on the Central Coast recently and told them how important it is to fight for fairness and equity for people with disabilities, at both a local and neighbourhood level. This fight is ongoing, and we intend to persevere. But the smooth delivery of funding to the states and territories in this area on an ongoing basis will help make that fight easier. That is partly what these bills will do. These bills help provide the appropriation for the Commonwealth to make an ongoing financial contribution in the following vital areas-that is, health care, schools, skills and workforce development, disability services and affordable housing. In my electorate on the Central Coast, we have 46 schools in total, 38 of them government schools. Can I say there has been an overwhelming positive response from the school community about the Rudd government's stimulus package, which will go a long way to improving much-needed educational infrastructure on the Central Coast. All of these schools will be able to upgrade their facilities and in doing so will create local economic stimulus, giving tradespeople much-needed work, not to mention improving the school facilities for teachers, students, P&C groups and other organisations that use them. I have said before in this place that, if were designing a stimulus package for my electorate, it would be exactly the stimulus package that the government announced earlier this year. In my electorate of Dobell, one of the key areas that the stimulus package has a major effect on is retail, and employment in the retail sector is larger than in any other sector. We have a disproportionately high number of people employed in retail, so clearly that is something that is directly affected by the stimulus package. But the other interesting thing about my electorate is that we also have a disproportionately high number of tradesmen and tradeswomen, who both work in the electorate and commute to Sydney. Providing this kind of stimulus package, which addresses the infrastructure requirements of schools and makes sure that the local tradespeople have the opportunity to work on the 46 schools in my electorate, is absolutely vital for the seat of Dobell. The seat of Dobell has traditionally been affected by unemployment disproportionately, by more than the national average. In fact, youth unemployment has gone close to 20 per cent in my electorate, and the unemployment rate is already in the area of seven per cent, which is much higher than the national average. It is vital that areas like this, which more susceptible to economic downturns, are addressed properly and squarely by the stimulus package, and that is exactly what the stimulus package does for my electorate. I have had nothing but people saying to me, ‘Thank God the federal government has done something.' What we have done in terms of the stimulus package in this particular bill and the way in which we are cooperating with the states stands in such stark contrast to those sitting opposite. Those sitting opposite find it very hard to come up with a coherent position because they are so wracked with division. At the moment so much of their energy is you being occupied by negotiating who is going to be leader and who will be on the rival frontbenches that they have completely forgotten their obligation to the Australian public in looking at and addressing the financial crisis that we find ourselves embroiled in because of what is happening overseas. So it does not come as any surprise that there is such a stark difference between the government benches and the opposition benches in this particular issue. And what do we get from the opposition in relation to any of the positive steps that this government puts up to stimulate jobs, to make sure the economy is cushioned as best we possibly can from the global financial crisis? At the moment, what we get is the Turnbull threestep. We have all heard it. It starts off with: ‘We support the government's position.' They then raise some doubts about the government's position as the backroom dealing on who is going to be leader hots up in the Liberal Party room, and then they get to the final position of objecting to or opposing the government's legislation. This opposition has not supported substantially, for any length of time, for anytime more than a few days, any of the positive initiatives that have been put up by this government, and in my are electorate people are saying, ‘Which of our schools is the Leader of the Opposition saying won't be upgraded? Which of our people who need the economic stimulus are going to miss out? Is it going to be pensioners who will miss out? Who is going to be missing out if the opposition have their way?' They are very disturbed at the approach that is ing taken by the opposition, who are spending too much time navel gazing and worrying about who sits where on their front bench rather than dealing with the issues that confront the economy and the world generally. This government, though, in stark contrast, is about providing solutions by both short-term stimulus and long-term structural changes. This particular bill goes to both of those issues. Most particularly, though, this bill is important because it provides a dramatic change in approach from the previous government. Previously, the former Howard government's engagement with the states was minimal. They took a position of dealing with the state and territory governments which said: ‘We have a proposition. Take it or leave it. There is no room for discussion. There is no room for compromise. If you have different objectives, that is just tough. This is the way that we are going to operate.' How can we get the best outcomes for all Australians if we have two levels of government that do not share a common view as to the outcomes that they want to seek in service delivery? It has been absolutely vital us to sit down and reach agreement with the states and territories on a whole series of issues of service delivery. It was vital because not only does it put resources into the areas where they are required but it makes sure that both levels of government are working to a common purpose. If that is not to be the case, then clearly resources are going to be wasted. Outcomes that may be sought by the Commonwealth may well not be able to be achieved if different outcomes are sought by the state and territory governments. This cooperative approach with the state and territory governments is so important to making sure that we get better delivery of those vital services. The National Affordable Housing Agreebe- ment provides the framework for the parties to work together to improve housing affordability and homelessness outcomes for Australians. Parties to this agreement are committed to: providing direction on a range of measures including social housing assistance to people in the private rental market, support and accommodation for people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, and home purchase advice; working towards improving coordination across housing related programs to make better use of existing stock and underutilised government assets, and achieve better integration between housing and human services, including health and disability services; and, of course, the very important goal of reducing the rate of homelessness. This agreement is ongoing and may be amended as necessary by the agreement of the Council of Australian Governments. This is a very worthy goal to have. It is one that is backed up in this bill by financial commitment. It is one that has been backed up by the government's stimulus package in providing public housing and it is one that I would think all members of this place would for want to support-making sure that people who are sleeping rough have some chance of having a roof over their head is absolutely vital. In any society that describes itself as a civilised society these kinds of initiatives need to be at the top of our agenda. But this is more important than that, because not only does it help achieve these morally important issues for our culture and our country but it also provides that stimulus in terms of providing work in the building sector that is so vital to making sure that we are cushioned from the worse effects of the global financial crisis. Again, to further emphasise the difference in approach, this is something that is agreed between the states and the Commonwealth. This is not something that is imposed without discussion; this is something that has been negotiated so that we have a common set of values, a common set of aims and a common set of goals. That is the only way that we are going to be able to achieve change in relation to these important issues: by making sure that in terms of service delivery across these vital areas we sit down and cooperate with the states and territories and we reach agreement. By reaching agreement we have common goals and outcomes and we can then make sure that they are adequately financed. I commend the bills to the House.",71
34,Mr MORRISON,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"The Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009 and the Federal Financial Relations (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2009 provide a set of new arrangements for organising Commonwealth payments to the states and territories. They do that in principally three areas: general sistance, which includes most importantly the GST payments; the national specific purpose payments, which replace the Commonwealth-state agreements on programs such as housing; and national partnership payments, which I interpret as being a scaled-down sion of the former national competition ments. Like many government bills which come before the House, they pretend to great reform and revolution, but on closer inspection they amount to little more than bureaucblame racy creep. But this is typical of this government because their popularity stems from never having to make a hard decision since they have occupied the treasury benches for just over a year now. They have never had to make a hard decision because all of the decigreat sions that have been taken have largely been about doing popular things such as throwing money around. The hard decisions come when you have to make tough decisions on these issues and do unpopular things, but we are yet to see this government do one unpopular thing. In our last budget in government, in 200708, the coalition allocated almost $42 billion for the states in the form of the GST. More significantly, this involved a windfall of $3.2 billion that would never have been received without that tax reform. I make mention of that because it was a hard decision, when it comes to federal-state financial relations, to introduce a GST-to introduce a major and radical overhaul of our tax system that previous governments had failed to do and did not have the stomach to do. That being in place enabled money to flow to the states and territories with a growth tax, something they had been after for many years, like never before. The fact that these revenues have been, frankly, squandered by the states since the GST was introduced is another story. The good voters of Queensland will have the opportunity to cast their opinion on that in a revenue as- very short period of time. If you believe the Treasurer when he introduced these bills, you would think that the reason for the manifest failure of the states in their financial management had nothing to do with their incompetence but rather had to verdo with the way the payments were being pay- made-there was some administrative problem that needed to be overcome to ensure that states actually exercised some sort of financial responsibility. The Labor Party will anyone, and anything and everything, to avoid taking any accountability for their own financial recklessness; they will even blame blame itself. When you cannot blame anything else, why not blame blame. Hence we had the ‘blame game'. This became the rhetoric of the government as to the reason why hospitals were falling over and schools could not be funded. It was not the fault of the state governments; it was the fact that people used to blame one another. Of course, without blame there is no accountability; and that is why the government fears blame so much. The GST shows that you can lead Labor to the waters of economic responsibility but you cannot ever make them drink. Labor may be changing the colour of the envelopes in which the cheques are going to be sent to the states under these changes, which is fine, but they can hardly claim this as any great reform. Perhaps when coming to these measures they should have taken up one reform from their Labor colleagues in New South Wales and Victoria. I used to hear them constantly talking about removing the sunshine subsidy of GST payments to Queensland and other states. Strangely enough, when Labor came to power-after hearing them all talk about it; it did not matter which premier it was in New South Wales or Victoria, they would all make the same criticism and call on the coalition in state parliaments and in federal parliament to overcome this terrible injustice-at a federal level they fell silent. This bill does not address the sunshine subsidy problem that was highlighted by previous Labor premiers. In paragraph 1.10 of the explanatory memorandum it says quite clearly: The Commonwealth will distribute GST payments among the States in accordance with the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation pressed in GST revenue sharing relativities. So there has been no change. Perhaps this is because in Labor's new system of collusive federalism, as I like to call it, the Prime Minister is happy to simply wave away the obligations of states to cut taxes, in particular, and renege on their GST undertakingswhich were made some years ago in the introduction of the GST. We saw that recently when the Prime Minister sat down with the state treasurers and said, ‘You know all of those business taxes that you said you were going to cut as a result of getting this GST money, well, you just don't have to do it now.' We are in an economic downturn. Of course, it would be better for business to be paying less tax rather than more tax. But instead of taking the hard decision of making Labor mates in the states cough up on their commitment of cutting taxes, they simply waved it away. One Friday afternoon they just waved it away and said ‘not a problem'. It is not a very hard decision to let your Labor mates in the states off the hook of having to reform taxes. The second area of this bill relates to specific purpose payments. I mentioned before the former Commonwealth-state-territory funding agreements, which covered a range of areas including health, schools, disability services and, in my area of shadow portfolio responsibility, housing. This bill provides for $1.2 billion to be spent in 2009-10 under the National Affordable Housing Agreement recently completed by the Commonwealth, states and territories, succeeding the previous agreement for Commonwealth-state housing between 2003 and 2008. The annual funding provided in this bill for the new Commonwealth-state agreement is in effect an additional $50 million in real terms compared to the last year of the previous agreement. So it is not a very significant change. The new agreement incorporates the Supported Acas excommodation Assistance Program, which was previously subject to a separate agreement with the states and which focused on providing crisis accommodation and support to people who were homeless or at risk of homelessness through 1,300 provider organisations, largely not-for-profit and charitable organisations, which I am sure we in this place would all agree do a tremendous and very worthy job. The new agreement must address some serious issues in the management of the public housing stock by its state and territory agencies. During the period of the previous agreement around $4 billion over five years was spent in real terms on the construction of new public housing dwellings. Despite that $4 billion investment, the total number of dwellings actually declined by over 10,000. In fact, there were 10,146 fewer dwellings as a result of an investment of over $4 billion in expenditure of new money on new construction. It is therefore of concern that in this agreement-the NAHA, as it has colloquially been known-the states have still been left to run their own show in terms of how the moneys under this agreement are to be deployed. I think it is a legitimate criticism that coalition's previous agreement failed to spoonfeed the states and territories on how they should manage their budgets. In hindsight, billions of dollars were provided to states and territories for these initiatives the dwelling stock was allowed to deplete. That is because there were no specific requirements in the agreement to allocate funds between capital costs and maintenance and operating costs. The social housing sector made the point to the government that this sort of discipline should have been included in the new agreement-and, frankly, I think it should have, but it has not been. So as a consequence we are going to continue to write cheques to the states, providing them with no real guidelines on how they have to manage their stock. As a result, I think we can expect the states to continue their form. Of particular concern is that under the former Supported Accommodation Assistance Program there was a requirement for matched payments from the states. Under the new National Affordable Housing Agreement there is no such requirement for matched payments from the states. So again we are writing cheques to the states and territories this new era of collusive federalism and, frankly, not asking them to stump up in return in the same way, particularly in the area of homelessness, as we did previously for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program. Public housing accounts for around five per cent of households in Australia, which is less than three per cent of the residential construction industry. I make that point because I think it is important that we understand what is emerging as a key difference between the Labor government and those on this side of the House in terms of public housing and our housing policies more generally. The coalition is committed to providing people and families with a pathway to the become self-supporting in private accommodation. That is our goal. Our goal is to see people be able to take responsibility for their own housing needs in the private sector market, which, frankly, 95 per cent of the popuand lation currently does. We need housing policies that address the housing needs of all Australians, not just those who unfortunately and for a whole range of reasons have to rely on the state system for their housing needs. We need housing policies that address everyone's needs and put a roof over everyone's heads. In the majority of cases this means ensuring that people are simply able to hold their own in the private housing market. It is of significant interest that, despite the fact that the number of dwellings declined by more than 20,000 during the period 2003-08, the number of people on public housing waiting lists across Australia in that period, most of which was under the coalition government, declined by more than 30,000. So we had a contraction of stock yet we also had a contraction in the number of people who were waiting for public housing. The lesson in these figures is this: the best way to put Australians in homes, especially in in their own homes, is to give them a job. Over two million jobs were created under the coalition government. The best way to keep them in their homes is to give them sustainable increases in their wages. Over the term of the coalition government we had a more than 20 per cent increase in real wages compared to a fall in real wages under the former Labor government. So you give them jobs; you give them wages that grow in real terms; you increase their wealth, which rose to the highest level on record under the former government; and you enable them to step up and take responsibility for their own housing needs wherever possible. Our objective should be to have fewer clients in public housing, not more. Our objective should be to ensure that people can escape the clutches of social and public housing and be self-sustaining in the private market. We want to see fewer clients not more, just like we want to see Australians have jobs not redundancy payments, which is the focus of another debate in this place here at the present time. There will be those for whom social housing will be a permanent requirement, and no-one in this place doubts that. We owe it to those Australians to ensure they are not competing for services with those who can take control of their own housing future. Our objective must be to ensure that the experience of social housing is a temporary one, an opportunity to regain some stability in their lives, rebuild their confidence and move on. The final area that this bill covers is the area of partnership payments, and there are quite a few that address the housing sector. There are four such agreements. They deal with social housing, homelessness, Indigenous housing and the government's $6.4 billion public housing cash splash. Social housing and homeless agreements were both supported by the coalition when they were introduced-there were no questions, they were absolutely supported-along with the $150 million Place to Call Home initiative. They were all worthy initiatives. The social housing program provides capital funding of up to $400 million over two years to build new, affordable housing. The partnership on homelessness provides $318 million over four years from the Commonwealth. Again, this was welcomed by the coalition when it was announced in November and then curiously reannounced just before Christmas. The third partnership agreement is for remote Indigenous housing, providing almost $2 billion over 10 years or $835 million over five years. Again, this agreement was supported by the coalition. The proposal was first announced in November 2008 and in this place just a few weeks ago when the Prime Minister addressed the House on the status of the Closing the Gap initiative. It involves building 4,200 new houses and upgrading a further 4,800 other houses to tackle overcrowding in remote Indigenous communities. This is a very worthwhile initiative. However, according to COAG, the agreement provided for under this bill was to have been completed by 1 January this year. So it was disappointing that eight weeks after that time that agreement still had not been signed. When you look at the agreement you will see that all of the states and territories signed up in December. The only one not to have signed up for that agreement was the Prime Minister, whose signature was dated February-and I understand it was towards the end of February. So for around eight weeks this agreement sat on his desk. This agreement has now been completed; however, it highlights again why Australians are increasingly sceptical of the torrent of announcements and sentiment from the Rudd government. It is because time after time they fail to meet their own benchmarks and timetables for delivery. This comes on top of the fact that a few weeks ago the Northern Territory government claimed they had barely broken ground on the 750 houses they were responsible for delivering with the federal government as part of the Northern Territory intervention. While the Rudd government now claims to have built 80 of these houses-we are not quite sure where they are, for what purpose they were built or if they were even for Indigenous people at all-that is pretty poor progress, even if you accept it at face value. Of 750 houses promised in September 2007, at their best guess 80 have been built. If the government could only build, on their own figures, 80 houses in remote areas in the 16 months since the election, I do not know how we can believe they will now build 20,000 public housing dwellings across Australia in the less than two years they have allocated spend the $6 billion on new public housing. Too often the Rudd rhetoric is not matching the Rudd reality. Whether it is jobs, funding or houses, once Labor-or local government, for that matter-have made the big announcement, they seem to think the job is done. What the Australian people want of this government is not to make hairy-chested announcements and big populist gestures but to actually get on and do the things they claim to be doing. In total the coalition has now supported almost $3.5 billion in social housing initiatives announced by the government since they were elected in November 2007. That is a lot of money. It is a serious amount of money and it is going to address a very serious problem which the coalition shares the government's concern regarding. That does not include the $1.2 billion also annually provided under the affordable housing agreement. Labor then tried to accuse the opposition of not having any interest in addressing social housing needs in this country because we chose to draw the line at spending a further $6.4 billion on public housing which will not be delivered in that time frame and which will not provide an economic stimulus. We draw the line and we say no. This package fails to stimulate additional investment, it fails to address the very real needs in the private housing market and it is incapable of delivery by the states. I would not trust the Premier of New South Wales to take out the bins, let alone build 9,000 new houses in about 18 months. He is simply not capable of it and neither is his government. I think gambling billions of dollars of taxpayer debt on the ability of states to deliver this program is reckless and irresponsible. The package focuses only on public housing and ignores private housing needs. In doing this, the government have overcapitalised their stimulus by failing to leverage adto ditional investment in residential construction, beyond direct public expenditure, and thereby maximise the potential boost expected from a proper stimulus measure. $6 billion would pay for more than 280,000 new home construction grants. That is twice the number of annual housing starts each year. Today's housing finance figures released just a few hours ago show that loans for new housing construction increased again by 2½ per cent in January, following a much larger 9.9 per cent increase in December. However, the number of commitments in January are still fewer than a year ago. In addition, the proportion of first home buyers taking on housing finance commitments rose again to 26.5 per cent in the latest figures in January, the highest on record, eclipsing even July 2001 after the initial grants were introduced by the coalition government. Today's figures highlight the need for the federal government to increase their focus on stimulating construction in the private housing market, where more than 95 per cent of Australians live and more than 95 per cent of housing construction workers have a job and are at risk of losing them. On 30 June, the government's first home owners grant will expire. The program has so far produced some good results. I am happy to concede and applaud that. It has the potential to do even better if the scheme is modified to provide a greater emphasis on building new homes rather than buying just existing dwellings, which accounts for around 90-plus per cent of the funds that are being spent on that initiative. Under Labor's plan, this can only be achieved by driving Australia even further into deficit and debt. Their failure to set aside funds as part of the $6 billion cash splash on the public housing program was reckless and irresponsible because it failed provide for the extension of these grants which actually can make a difference to private housing. Australia cannot afford for Labor to allow their social agenda on public housing to override their economic responsibility to do what is right for the Australian economy. It is time to get some balance back into their housing program policies and acknowledge the urgent needs in our private housing sector. Finally, I would say this: when this package was put together and we went through Senate estimates, the government had no idea how much it would cost or how long it would take; they simply rang the state governments and said, ‘Do you think you can deliver this?' and the response was Obamaesque with a ‘Yes, we can'. They cannot deliver in less than two years what they could not deliver in eight years of spending on these programs. So we rightly highlight that the stimulus package for public sector housing will be unable to be delivered by the states and as a result should be directed towards private housing. (Time expired)",76
35,Mr BUTLER,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"I guess that, given the previous government's record on federal financial relations, it is no wonder that contributions would seek to focus on justifying why the opposition voted against the biggest stimulus to social housing since the Second World War rather than dealing with the details of the Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009 and the Federal Financial Relations (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2009, which involve the most significant overhaul of federal financial relations-the financial architecture of our Federation-since the Whitlam government. This government is utterly committed to ending the blame game in the federal system and stopping the buck passing that has dogto ged our state and federal government relations for far too long. This government-and also while in opposition before the election-is very clear in its view that the federal financial architecture is fundamentally broken. These bills seek to take the first steps in fixing that architecture. Exhibit A in that breaking down of the federal financial architecture is the constant accretion of section 96 payments, or specific purpose payments, that have become so numerous, so varied in their forms and so detailed as to be completely incomprehensible to most commentators and observers. There was, it is to be noted, some reform to our federal financial architecture with the ANTS-A New Tax System-that surrounded the GST, but there was no serious attempt at all during that process to grapple with the broken specific purpose payment system. These bills implement an agreement by COAG in March 2008 and subsequently in November 2008 to undertake that very important reform. The Rudd Labor government came to government having talked about these issues for a considerable period of time before the November 2007 election and with very clear expectations from the public that reform would be undertaken. We have delivered that quickly-in March 2008, within only weeks of being elected, the Prime Minister delivered an agreement at COAG that fundamentally overhauled federal financial relations this country. These bills implement that agreement in very large part. The first element of that March 2008 agreement was to rationalise-long overdue-the specific purpose payment system, firstly with the objective of combining agreements to a smaller, more comprehensible range of agreements; secondly, to institute much clearer demarcations of responsibilities between the different tiers of government; and, thirdly-and perhaps most importantly-to focus on performance and outputs from those agreements, rather than the tendency within SPP agreements to focus on inputs, particularly from state governments, and with those performance benchmarks to be assessed by the independent COAG Reform Council. The second element of the landmark March 2008 agreement was to introduce national partnership payments-payments intended to reward incentive and reform undertaken by state governments. It is very important to note, particularly given the contribution about these issues of the previous speaker, the shadow minister for housing, that this type of payment is not subject to principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation as the shadow minister-notably from New South Wales-described it, the ‘sunshine subsidy'. Horizontal fiscal equalisation is a principle to which the Labor Party unashamedly adheres. It is a principle that redistribPrime utes money among parts of the Federation according to the capacity to raise revenue and the need to spend money. Under horizontal fiscal equalisation, the Commonwealth Grants Commission takes account of differences between states in revenue raising capacity and their different spending needs and readjusts grants accordingly. It is beyond comprehension, other than for base political purposes, to understand why a member of this federal House would have a problem with that principle as a general in proposition, with only this exception: that COAG agrees, and the Prime Minister and the government very much agree, that reform-based incentive payments such as are included within the national partnership payments should reward states that are first movers in reform. In the area of national partnership payments, states are treated on the merit of their contribution to reform or to a particular program. This is an important exception to the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation which, given the previous speaker's contribution, I want to reiterate as a fundamental platform of Labor government. The third element to the COAG agreement in March 2008 was that COAG retain the general revenue sharing framework adopted in 2001 after the introduction of the GST. Firstly, there would be no conditions placed by the federal government on states about how they spent that money and secondlyagain-the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation would apply to the distribution of those funds. Essentially, the Rudd Labor government adopted the system in relation to the the distribution of GST money introduced by or, the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins. Since that landmark agreement in March last year, very significant work has been undertaken at the COAG level between the Minister and premiers, between other ministers and between officials of the different tiers of government, particularly on the reform of the specific purpose payment system. These bills implement that framework adopted at the March 2008 meeting, adding detail which has been worked on over the subsequent months and agreed at the COAG meeting on 29 November last year. This is the most significant overhaul of specific purpose payments since the provision in the Constitution section 96 began to be used broadly in the early 1970s under the Whitlam government. Under the November 2008 agreement and these bills there will now only be five specific purpose payments: firstly, for health care; secondly, for schools; thirdly, for skills and workforce development; fourthly, for disabilities; and, fifthly, for affordable ing. Each of those five specific purpose payments will be subject to a separate national agreement between the federal agreement and each of the state and territory governments. Each agreement, for the first time, clarifies very specifically the roles and responsibilities of each tier of government. In my previous life I dealt on a number of occasions with the specific purpose payment systems governing home and community care, or HACC, and other areas of disabilities. Frankly, it was a minefield, not only in working out quite what the moneys were intended to do but in working out what the responsibility was, in my case, of the South Australian government and what the responsibility was of the Commonwealth government. Commentators, stakeholders and governments have for years complained about the indecipherability of specific purposes payments as they have existed until now. This legislation and the agreements made at COAG in November 2008 make a fundamental reform to that system. Each of the five SPP agreements importantly include performance benchmarks and outcomes. Those, as I said earlier, will be assessed by the COAG Reform Council and, for the first time, will be published annually in a very significant advance in the transparency of government in this country. The fourth significant reform to the system of specific purpose payments is the removal of very detailed conditions previously imposed by the Commonwealth governments on states. These were more usually related to state inputs rather than to more meaningful outcomes or performance benchmarks that might actually impact on Australians. Now the states will choose how to spend the money, provided that the money is spent in their particular areas, such as health care or disabilities as the case may be. But they need housto spend that money bearing in mind the benchmarks that will be assessed on an annual basis-and the assessment will be published-by the COAG Reform Council. The other significant reform contained in this legislation is the introduction of national partnership payments. The November 2008 COAG meeting agreed on a number of payment systems, and, importantly, given the debate in this place this week, at the COAG of 5 February 2009 the Nation Building and Jobs Plan was also the subject of a separate national partnership payment agreement. As I indicated earlier in my contribution, these payments are not subject to the redistributive principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation. These payments reward states who work hard. The claim has been made by a number of states-particularly the bigger states, such as Victoria-for many years that reform based payments should not be subject to horizontal fiscal equalisation. Our government has heeded those calls in this part of the legislation. These payments will be the centrepiece of a new wave of microeconomic reform in areas which for too long have been neglected by the federal government. Earlier this week I was very pleased to see the announcement by the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Child Care, Maxine MCKew, of the national partnership payments for early childhood education. Under that agreement $955 million will go to states between now and 2013 to implement one of the centrepiece promises that the Labor Party made before the last electionnamely, that the Commonwealth had a place in ensuring that all four-year-olds in Austraform lia had 15 hours a week of preschool education in the year leading up to school, wherever they lived. I come from South Australia, a state that has taken preschool education very seriously in any event, but I know that there are many states in the Federation that have underfunded particularly four-year-old education but also perhaps the area of noughtto year-olds in their state generally. For too long the Commonwealth has sat on its hands and done nothing while there has been such a variable contribution to the education of our four-year-olds. We know from recent research that those five years are the most portant years in the development of a human being's brain. This is just one example of many national partnership payment agreements that have been the subject of debate and ultimately agreement at the COAG level which will deliver very significant reform to our country. Finally, the Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009 deals with appropriations. It is an appropriation bill, and it appropriates an tra $6 billion or so over the next five years for the national specific purpose payment agreements that I referred to for things like fixing up our hospitals and delivering extra services to those Australians with disability. How those opposite, after the Howard government stripped money year after year from our national health system, can complain about our attempts, transparently put before the people before the November 2007 election, beggars belief. This is the government's implementation of a very clear commitment to the people before November 2007-that we would fix the hospital system, that we would make life better for those with disabilphy, ity in Australia and that we would deliver a proper system of child care and preschool education to Australian children. In conclusion, this is a very significant reof our federal financial architecture. It significantly improves the transparency of payments between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. This will be a very good thing for where people complain-and, in many cases, rightly complain-about the service delivery undertaken by state governments. For the first time, those state governments will be accountable against performfive- ance assessments by the COAG Reform Council that will be published and available to all Australians. These payments, particularly the national partnership payments, set the foundation for a new wave of microeconomic reform and a new wave of quality serim- vice delivery for Australians. I commend COAG for the work that they did between March 2008 and November 2008 in putting together a very significant overhaul of their financial relations, and I commend the legislation to the House.",81
36,Mrs MOYLAN,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"I am very pleased as a Western Australian to have the opportunity to speak on the Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009 and the Federal exFinancial Relations (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2009. I want to make it very clear that I am committed to a federal system. I recognise that all is not perfect in this system of government and that it is a bit of a movable feast because we are changing as a nation. Like democracy, our system of government is not perfect, but it is probably the best that we can offer in terms of robust debate and robust competition in delivering the very best services to people throughout this vast continent. That is one of the great benefits of a federal system. We live in a very vast continent. Each of our states has its own geograand life for citizens in the states varies quite markedly. That is why I believe that the state governments are the best people to determine the priorities that will govern their states. We have in the public gallery people from probably all over Australia. I do not think that they would be well served by having government administered centrally. Indeed, that is not what this legislation seeks to do. seeks to have a new cooperation in terms of how we manage this great country of ours. The problem is: many Australians see any reform process with a degree of cynicism because we have heard it all before-that is, the federal government announcing that they are going to manage something because it is not working as well as it should be. While this legislation does seek to have new cooperation between the state and federal governments, I think it is still highly prescriptive. It is the federal government calling the shots and saying to the states: we will hand over buckets of money to you but you will do certain things. I hope that we will continue to robustly debate these matters in this place, because it is through the fires of robust debate that we come to good policy positions. We should never be afraid of that process, no matter how difficult it may get sometimes. I know sometimes the public see this as a very combative exercise, but it is from the fires of robust debate that we come forward with the very best options for governing Australia in the 21st century. The government have described this legislation as a new direction with modern federalism. The reform manifesto is filled with the discourse of a new era of cooperation. Indeed, it would seem that our Prime Minister has been extolling the virtues of such collaboration between federal and state governments for many years. Behind the rhetoric of cooperation, the reality is clear: state and federal governments are no longer peers. When the drafters of our Constitution began to imagine the shape of Australia's Federation, they pictured something vastly different from what we are operating under today. They pictured strong states that could hold their own against the federal government. They created distinct areas of responsibility. It If they ever imagined that there would be a vertical fiscal imbalance, I am quite sure they never would have imagined it would be as pronounced as it is today. When we talk about modern federalism, we are essentially discussing the funding arrangements between the levels of government. Since the federal monopolisation of income tax, state governments have been reliant on federal grants to fulfil their constitutional responsibilities. The resulting vertical fiscal imbalance has gradually given the federal government increased power in areas that once were the exclusive domain of the states and territories. I sometimes think that we in this place set the states up to fail in that duty. We sometimes forget that the states have a vested interest in delivering best practice to their constituency because their ultimate report card is when they go to the electorate and seek re-election. The essence of this legislation is that it will reform the system of funding to the states and territories. There will be three tiers of funding. Firstly, the federal government will distribute collected GST revenues to the states by general revenue assistance in accordance with the principles of horizontal fiscal equalisation. Secondly, all existing tied grants or specific purpose payments will be summarised as payments for key human sector services such as health care and schools. Thirdly, new national partnership payments will be made to those states that reach the incentive targets of service delivery and adopt social and economic reform as laid out by the federal government. So what we have is a bit of a pea and thimble trick: nothing is changing in essence. It is encouraging to see the government continuing the work of those who went before them and engaging in constant renewal of our federal system. The introduction, indeed, of the GST under the Howard government provided funding for the states, which has been a very significant move forward. It has gone some way to restoring some balance in terms of fiscal relations between the levels of government in Australia in recent times. Any attempts that are made to make the system more efficient will be welcomed. There is no doubt about that. I think everyone will welcome that. But, by setting goals that virtually say one size fits all, we are moving from the states the capacity to be innovative and creative about how they solve the many service delivery challenges that they are confronted with today-and probably more so at the moment, with the global financial troubles that beset us. Again, it is a welcome move to see the existing system of tied grants which had been implemented gradually over time in accordance with various developments now being modernised. It is also pleasing to see that the state and territory governments who received this money will have some flexibility in how they spend the money. As I said, it is flexibilit ity that will enable innovation to flourish and provide an opportunity for governments to learn from the successes and failures of others as they try to find the best way forward to deliver to their constituencies. However, it would seem that while this bill gives budget flexibility with one hand it is also taking it away with the other. As I said, it is the old pea and thimble trick; it does not really fool anyone. The sometimes coercive nature of specific purpose payments will potentially be replaced by the national partnership payment, and you have to look at that and say, ‘Is it really that much different to what we've been doing?' The key aspects of the bill that I have concerns about relate to the requirement that specific purpose payments are subject to reporting requirements and the national partnership payments require that the state adopt ‘new projects of national importance' and meet national benchmarks. So I suppose it depends on how these new projects of national importance are determined. Are they determined by the federal government, the state government or in partnership? If it is a true partnership, that has to be a positive move, but I have a great concern about policies that are developed in this place, on a reone-size-fits-all basis, for a continent that is so vast and whose peoples are so diverse. I think it does remove that capacity to be innovative. These measures do demonstrate a number of disturbing trends in the view of the government toward federalism. Firstly, it makes evident the federal Labor government's newfound understanding of the depth of incompetence of their state Labor counterparts. Secondly, it reveals the desire of the federal government to assume a custodial power over the states. By making the states accountable to big brother federal government, will no longer be the role of the state voters to hold their elected state representatives to account. But dictating how the states spend is not what cooperative federalism should be about. Perhaps, as the government tend to do, they have forgotten where the money comes from. It is the taxpayers' money, and they are distributing money that is not their own but the money of all Australian taxpayers. It is therefore only proper that the taxpayers are the monitors of how that money is spent, and that means giving the states maximum capacity to determine their own policy direction and for the voters to monitor that to see whether the states are delivering what the citizens want. At the end of the generally four-year terms for the states the ultimate sanction is that a party loses government if they have not done the right thing. The old argument of duplication of services is not necessarily one that cannot be better managed. If there is duplication of services, I think we will find it is because the federal government have taken over or encroached more and more on the areas of the state governments. There is one way to fix that, and that is to go back to the drawing board and to more clearly delineate the responsibilities of state and federal governments. I do not think that it would be too difficult to come to an agreement about just where the demarcation lines are, but it does need to be addressed because things have moved on since the Federation was first established. Back in 2005 the current Prime Minister gave a speech entitled ‘The case for cooperative federalism'. I have to say that, apart from some of the laughable ideological diatribe that was expressed in that speech, a few important things were said. Some of the more credible things that came from the then shadow minister for foreign affairs, trade and international security were when he said: The challenge for a future Labor government will be to rebuild the Federation. And it is my argument that the Federation can be rebuilt based on the principles of co-operative (rather than cive) Federalism. He went on to say that there needed to be a ‘culture of political cooperation and collaboration as opposed to confrontation and coercion'. What is important about these statements is that they again truly highlight the level of inconsistency between what the government says it will do and what it actually does. One needs only to look at health care or education to see that this government is much more comfortable with coercion than with cooperation. While the Prime Minister came into office promising to end the blame game, he threatened the states that if they could not agree on a national reform plan for public hospitals the federal government would seize control. This does not sound like mutual collaboration to me. This government also came to power promising an education revolution. What they did not mention was that, whilst the Bastille they will be storming is that of state control, the federal government's stimulus package will further demote the responsibility of states. Money will be dished out to schools, with the Deputy Prime Minister having the exclusive rights to any credit for work done. This is despite the important role that states and territories have in administering education and despite the fact that the money used to fund this does not yet exist and, if it did, it would not belong to the federal government anyway. As I said, this is money contributed by all Australian taxpayers. Just last week we heard that the federal government would expand their control over vocational studies. What will the next coercive tactic be to bring the states on board with federal policy? For many people the precise problem with federalism is that there is no clear demarcation as to responsibility. During the aforementioned speech from coer2005, the Prime Minister quoted former Queensland Premier Wayne Goss saying: It is unacceptable from the point of view of the consumers of government services that we should let confusion reign as to which level of government is responsible for particular government programs. The design of the national partnership payments is likely to further complicate this issue. How can a member of the public hold government accountable when it is not even clear who a policy belongs to?",84

38,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. I fer the Prime Minister to the fact that Austration's lians mostly ignored his call on them to spend, spend, spend his December cash splash of 10 billion borrowed dollars. What does he say about this month's 13 billion borrowed dollar cash splash? Should Australians worried about losing their jobs and confused about government policy spend, spend, spend or save against the risk of a Rudd recession?",88
39,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It must have been a rough time indeed yesterday in the Liberal Party party room. The Leader of the Opposition raises a question which goes to the link between the government's economic stimulus strategy on the one hand and employment and jobs on the other. The question, in particular, that he raises is the extent to which our provision of payments to pensioners and to carers and our provision of support to first home buyers have a material effect on the economy and jobs. Obviously the Leader of the Opposition, in his search for evidence, has not gone to today's housing finance data, produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Let me read this to him, because it goes directly to a key element of the economic stimulus strategy which he raises in his question and which was supported by him then and opposed by him subsequently. What we see today from this data is that the ABS shows that the proportion of first home buyers seeking finance approvals has jumped to 26.5 per cent. This is the highest proportion since the series began in 1991. Let me quote Joshua Williams, the economist of TD Securities, who says: The increase in housing finance numbers in January for owner-occupiers was the fourth consecutive monthly increase and suggests that the cumulative falls in mortgage interest rates and increase to the first home owners grant have been successful in luring more potential buyers out of the woodwork. re- I would also draw the Leader of the Opposiattention to the following: the number of owner-occupied housing finance commitments increased by 3.5 per cent in January after increasing by 6.7 per cent in December. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Would you draw the Prime Minister's attention to the question and ask him to provide a relevant answer.",88
40,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,88
41,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition asked a question about the impact of the Economic Security Strategy which we launched last October, and he asked for the evidentiary link between it on the one hand and employment on the other. That is precisely what the Leader of the Opposition had contained within his question. I provided an answer which he is uncomfortable with, as it is based on fact. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Prime Minister obviously was not listening to the question. The question was: should Australians spend, spend, spend or save against the risk of a Rudd recession? That is the question.",88
42,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition will acknowledge that there was a long preamble before that last part of his question.,88
43,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The package which the Leader of the Opposition is attacking was a threefold increase in the first home owners grant, which was part of the package introduced by the government in October called the economic stimulus strategy. That is the package which the Leader of the Opposition has attacked repeatedly in the House. Mr Turnbull interjecting",88
44,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh, he now makes a distinction for that aspect of the economic stimulus strategy which he, having supported it, then opposed but is back to supporting.

45,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think the Leader of the Opposition,89
46,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition will ignore that. Mr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Prime Minister, playing as usual to recession? the cameras, asks these rhetorical questions and then, when I seek to answer them, objects. He cannot have it both ways.",89
47,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. There is no provision for the Leader of the Opposition to respond.,89
48,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So the spending therefore undertaken by first home buyers in terms of their decision to take the threefold increase in the first home owners grant and go out there and spend their money on a new house is demonstrated in the figures which have been released today through the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Therefore we have the number of owner-occupied housing finance commitments increased by 3.5 per cent in January. The value of housing finance commitments increased by 0.7 per cent in January. The value of owner-occupied housing finance increased by 2.3 per cent. The proportion of first home buyers seeking approvals jumped to 26.5 per cent. Owner-occupied commitments for the construction of new homes rose 2.5 per cent in January, following a 10.4 per cent increase in December. I would draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to these core facts. He attacks the economic stimulus strategy launched by the government. A core component of that strategy dealt with the direct cash support to first home buyers to encourage them to go out and buy a new home. The data today demonstrates that is what they have been doing. The reason he doth protest so much is that he knows the data undermines his entire argument. Economy",89
49,Mr RAGUSE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on recent updates to the global economic outlook and the implications for Australia's response to the global,89
50,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would draw the attention of members of the House to a statement overnight from the director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique StraussKahn, which reported the sobering news that the IMF is further revising down its global growth forecast for 2009. Mr Strauss-Kahn has said that growth in 2009 is now predicted to be less than zero for the first time in the IMF's history. He said: The IMF expects global growth to slow below zero this year, the worse performance in most of our lifetimes. He goes on to note that the global financial crisis might now be called the great recession. This sobering report from the director of the IMF follows the report in the last 24 to 48 hours of the head of the World Bank and the World Bank itself also predicting that global economic growth in 2009 would, in fact, go below zero. These two sobering reports on the state of the global economy remind us of the dimensions of the challenge with which Australia is presented by the global economic recession. Again, it is like a global economic cyclone approaching this country. It started in America. It has come through Europe and it is now affecting all economies around the world-a synchronised global economic downturn with all countries and all sectors within those economies being hit at the same time. Those opposite may argue that it is within the power of any single national government to prevent a cyclone from crossing your shores. You cannot give that undertaking. What you can do, however, is take prudent action to reduce the damage, to reduce the impact of that cyclone on Australia. That is what we have done through the government's economic stimulus strategy. The alternative, argued by those opposite, is to do nothing and therefore expose all Australian families to the full force of the storm. That is the difference. We say we can cushion the impact of the storm. Those opposite say: ‘You're on your own. Look after yourselves. Look after your own circumstances. You're on your own.' In fact it entirely underlines their philosophy in industrial relations as well: go out there and fend for yourself. It is the law of the jungle. The government's Economic Security Strategy hinges on three core components. First is the stabilisation of financial markets, the cornerstone of which is the provision of a government guarantee for all Australian deposit holders for the first time in Australia's history not just as a necessary ingredient for stability in financial markets but, on top of that, as a necessary ingredient for confidence in the economy as well. Then there is shortterm stimulus, which has been the subject of questions already by the Leader of the Opposition-providing payments to families, payments to pensioners, payments to carers, payments to veterans, payments to farmers, payments in order to provide support to Australians who are under stress and challenge because of the impact of the global economic recession; but at the same time providing support to employment in the Australian economy in the consumption sector of the economy, in retail, which employs 1½ million Australians. Thirdly, there is long-term stimulus as well: Investing in our Schools, the biggest school modernisation program in Australia's history; investing in 20,000 new units of social housing; and investing in energy efficiency to ensure over time that we have ceiling insulation in every single Australian owner-occupied home right across the country, bringing down greenhouse gas emissions but also stimulating the local economy. Together with investments in roads, rail and ports, this is long-term infrastructure which comes off the back of necessary stimulus also in the short term. As part of the its economic stimulus strategy, the government today will start making the payments of $950 back-to-school bonuses and $900 single-income family bonuses to help support families through the global economic recession and at the same time support jobs in the Australian retail sector, a sector which employs 1½ million Australians. I note that a report today by Access Economics notes that 53c in the dollar of the stimulus will be outlayed in 2009, with 74 cents to be outlayed by mid-2010. Access goes on to say: Australia's stimulus may be a smaller share of our national income than the United States equivalent but it has the potential to do more in the short term. Access goes on to say: History may mark the first week of February in 2009 as an important building block in Australia's eventual economic recovery. Tuesday, February 3 saw a big interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank and an even bigger stimulus package from the federal government. Both these measures will lift the spending power of households through 2009 providing important support for retailers against the tide of rising unemployment and consumer caution. Those are comments from Access Economics in their report today. It is not just institutions like Access which have spoken in support of the government's economic stimulus strategy. We also have statements from other organisations, including the National Farmers Federation. The National Farmers Federation stated: The government's $950 tax-free bonus for all drought affected farmers-reaching some 21,500 farmers in need-will be a much-needed fillip to families and regional economies. Mr Anthony Smith- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The Prime Minister should answer the question concisely. He has been going for six minutes.",89

What surprises me most on the part of those opposite-and I see the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry nodding in this direction-is: how could the National Party stand in this place and vote against a $950 payment to drought affected farmers?

53,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How could you, Paul, vote against a $950 payment to drought affected farmers? What has happened to the National Party of old standing up for people in the bush and standing up for those who are droughted-except in this case, because the politics of this overall debate do not suit them. Once again they have tapped the mat, yielded to the Liberal Party and said, ‘No, we are going to stand opposed to a payment to 21½ thousand drought affected farmers.' Well, we on this side of the House say to you over there in cocky corner, ‘Shame, shame, shame.' If you go to the other elements of the government's strategy, it is not just short-term economic stimulusMr Anthony Smith interjecting",91
54,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Casey does not have the call.,91
55,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The nation-building plan which the government has announced, and the economic stimulus strategy which the government is implementing, are each designed to provide support for jobs and to build long-term infrastructure. In the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, for every dollar of short-term stimulus that we provide by way of payments to of order. The point of order is on relevance. The Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer and, in fact, the member for Fremantle have all made submissions in the past about questions being no longer than four minutes. The Prime Minister is now approaching double that time. It is provocative to the opposition. How can we be expected to listen to this toxic bore throughout question time? You need to take action.",91
56,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat.,92
57,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think what is provocative for the opposition is what the National Farmers Federation says: that the government's $950 tax-free bonus for all drought affected farmersOpposition members-Boring!,92
58,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That bonus, that is reaching some 21½ thousand farmers in need, and which those opposite say is boring, will be a much-needed fillip to families and the regional economy. I do not think that drought affected farmers would find it that way. The reason those opposite find it so provocative is that every significant peak industry organineed sation in Australia is getting behind what the government is trying to do to provide extra stimulus to the economy. Mr Costello interjecting",92
59,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Higgins is interjecting again. Come on down the front, Pete, because I gather that is where you were yesterday in the party room. Come on down the front-in that seat or that one, I am not sure",92

61,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, well, it was an interesting exchange, I understand, in the Liberal Party party room in terms of whose idea their most recent of order. Without wishing to press a point, we now have the Prime Minister talking about matters about which he knows absolutely nothing, instead of on a question of our economy. It is now nine minutes",92

63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Sturt does not assist his case.,92
64,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have particularly appreciated the member for Sturt's interjection, because I think we all know what happened in the Liberal Party party room yesterday because we all read this morning's papers. And we heard a number of them at the doors as well, but I am sure these will become subjects for debate by the end of the day.",92
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will return to the question.,92
66,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government's economic security strategy deals with short-term stimulus by way of payments to Australians who support in order to boost employment in the retail sector, as well as investment in infrastructure and investment in housing in order to provide long-term support for our economy. Our overall approach to this is a clear-cut strategy for the future, and I would say to those opposite that it is about time that their approach to the global financial crisis was to engage in a serious economic strategy for the future rather than, as they are currently engaged in, a political strategy with one objective: to take as much political advantage as they can out of the economic crisis. Those opposite should get serious in contributing a positive idea for the debate. The nation expects it of you. Employment",92
67,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the guarantee given today by his Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government that neither the government's industrial relations changes nor its bungled emissions trading scheme will cost a single Australian job. Does the Prime Minister agree? Will the Prime Minister now offer the same guarantee that not a single Australian job will be lost because of these policies? Mr Robert-How about your policies?",92
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Fadden is warned.,93
69,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, because what I can guarantee to him is that Australians will not have redundancy payments stripped away from them. That is because we intend to produce fair industrial relations laws. The government's projections of unemployment are in the economic outlook. Mr Turnbull-I rise on a point of order, on relevance. The question was about jobs, not redundancy payments.",93
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is responding to the question.,93
71,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Anyone who is concerned about unemployment in this country today is concerned about redundancy payments. What is the difference? We on this side of the House stand up for their rights to redundancy payments. Those who supported Work Choices want to strip them away. The government's position on future unemployment projections is contained in the government's economic outlook, published in February. NA The Speaker (2.21 pm)-I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from Uganda led by the Speaker of the Parliament of Uganda, the Rt Hon. Edward K Ssekandi. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Economy",93
72,Mr BIDGOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline for the House the economic rationale for the stimulus payments that will begin flowing tomorrow, and how they fit into the government's comprehensive economic strategy?",93
73,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dawson for his question because he is certainly very interested in these stimulus payments that are flowing through to families in his electorate, where many people will deeply appreciate the additional assistance that they are going to receive. Families around Australia will begin receiving bonuses of up to $950 as part of our Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Over 1.2 million families across Australia receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A will begin receiving a back-to-school bonus of $950 for each eligible school-age child. That will certainly be very welcome by very many parents in this country, including those in the electorate of Dawson. This will assist something like 2.8 million school-age children with the costs of the 2009 academic year. And from today, over one million families who rely on one main income earner will also begin to receive the single-income family bonus of $900. All families eligible for Family Tax Benefit Part B when we announced the Nation Building and Jobs Plan will receive this bonus. The remaining Centrelink bonuses to eligible farmers and students, which the Prime Minister was talking about before, will begin to be paid on 24 March. And, of course, we have a tax bonus for 8.7 million working Australians, who will be paid from early April. These bonuses are a key part of our efforts to support jobs by strengthening demand in the economy so that companies can afford to keep on and employ workers because there is sufficient demand in the economy. These payments are not a substitute for other direct government investments. Something like well over two-thirds of our Nation Building and Jobs Plan constitutes investments in schools, roads and houses. But these payments are very important; they are our best way to support jobs and growth until these investments kick in later this year to further stimulate demand in our economy, given what is occurring in the international economy-that sharp contraction of demand. So we have a two-stage process: payments to families to boost demand right now, and investment which flows through the economy to leave a lasting benefit for the nation. This approach has been endorsed today by Access Economics, who have had this to say: These measures will lift the spending power of households through 2009, providing important support for retailers against the tide of rising employment and consumer caution. It is the case that businesses are doing it tough and, without these payments, things would of course be even tougher. Of course, that is why the business community is supporting these payments so strongly. You had Greg Smith, the Managing Director of Clive Peeters, say this in February in relation to the Economic Security Strategy: It was quite phenomenal, really. Our suppliers expected it to be an average Christmas but sales were so strong that it left the industry short of supply. This is boosting demand. You can see that in the consumer confidence figures today, you can see it in the retail sales figures in December and you can see it again in January. But this is a very important point: our main priority remains direct investment, which is why, for every dollar in cash payments, we are investing more than $2 in schools, roads and houses. That is an investment which is not supported by those opposite. They do not understand the importance, in the face of this global contraction, to support demand, to strengthen demand in our economy. It was not always the case that they had such an approach to this investment. Back in 2001 the member for Higgins had a lot to say about strengthening demand in the economy. He said this at the International Monetary Fund in 2001: We must consider the risks that entail from waiting for hard evidence of the magnitude of the global slowdown. He said: We are experiencing a synchronised slowdown for the first time since the early 1980s. And he went on to say this: Insufficiently vigorous policy may result in a deeper and longer global downturn. That is what the member for Higgins said in un2001. Of course, it is a different story in 2009. The case for investment now is clear. It is supported by the IMF; it is supported by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve; it is supported by business in this country. But it is not supported by the Liberal Party, whose only approach is to sit and to wait and to see. Of course, what that will do is impose costs on this country that we can ill afford. We on this side of the House understand the need to support demand and jobs in the Australian community. Employment",93
74,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to comments made by his Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government this morning on the Steve Price Morning Show. I quote: Steve Price: The restaurant industry today is predicting 1,000 restaurants will close and two and a half thousand jobs will disappear if this industrial relations change becomes law. Albanese: They were all going to disappear over various other issues from time to time. Does the Prime Minister agree with his own minister that 1,000 restaurants are due to close and thousands of jobs are to disappear no matter what the government does, or is this just the risk of a Rudd recession?",94
75,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for North Sydney asked a question about the impact on the retail sector, and restaurants in particular. Can I simply say to the member for North Sydney: his entire political attack and his leader's attack on this government has focused expressly on consumption payments which we have made as a government to support retail, including the restaurant sector, to boost the 1½ million Australians employed within that sector. We have a course of action; you have a plan of opposition. Employment",95
76,Mr TREVOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion. How does the Fair Work Bill provide greater job security for Australian workers and are there any obstacles to the government implementing these protections?",95
77,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Flynn for his question. I know that he is deeply interested in ensuring that there is fairness in Australian workplaces and that there is an end to Work Choices. In the leadup to the 2007 election, the Labor Party campaigned that if elected we would get rid of Work Choices and replace it with our Forward with Fairness plan, published in documents like this-this is the policy implementation plan-from August 2007. In these policies we promised two things very specifically. We said that every Australian worker would be able to rely on National Employment Standards and that those National Employment Standards would deal with redundancy-that is, that people would be able to get redundancy pay and no-one would be able to have that stripped away from them. Of course, one of the principal vices of Work Choices is that it meant that people could have their redundancy pay stripped away with not one cent of compensation. Very specifically in this document we said that we would institute an ability for good workers, people who have proved themselves, to make an unfair dismissal claim, and we said in our policy, very specifically in this document, that we would make special arrangements for businesses with fewer than 15 employees. Two promises, one on redundancy and one on unfair dismissal, are contained in the Fair Work Bill. This is a government that believes in making a promise and then delivering it. I am asked about any obstacles to the delivery of these promises. Mr Speaker, can I say that I thought last December that perhaps the Liberal Party had seen the light and would enable the government to deliver these promises. In particular, I remember reading the front page of my Australian newspaper on 13 December last year. I read these words: … Labor took a proposal to change the unfair dismissal laws to the election and won … So we must respect that. A government member-Who said that?",95
78,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Who did say that? I repeat: … Labor took a proposal to change the unfair dismissal laws to the election and won … So we must respect that. The Leader of the Opposition said that, which just means it is even more amazing that the Liberal Party yesterday went to war in its party room on whether or not to continue to support Work Choices. And the Leader of the Opposition emerged from that war in the party room, the war of which there is a blow-by-blow description in today's newspapers, at war with himself, because, despite saying those words, of course now it is a claim of the Liberal Party that we should change our unfair dismissal laws in the Fair Work Bill to make it easier for workers to be sacked. They emerged from the war in the Liberal party room talking about amendments to the Fair Work Bill, but they studiously avoided answering the question: if their amendments are not accepted, what happens next? Do they vote for the Fair Work Bill or do they vote to keep Work Choices? Well, fortunately, there is one honest man in the Liberal Party. I know it is a controversial call and I apologise to my colleagues if I have got it wrong, but the one honest man in the Liberal Party is a senator for South Australia, Cory Bernardi-he writes a good newsletter, as I understand it. Today the one honest man in the Liberal Party, Cory Bernardi, said this: ‘If we can't fix the legislation we are right to vote against it.' Well, when the Liberal Party emerged from its party room yesterday at war with itself and with no clear position about what it was going to do next, how is it that Senator Bernardi today can be so certain of what the Liberal strategy is? Maybe, just maybe, the Liberal strategy was worked out at La Rustica last night when the shadow Treasurer, the salesman for Work Choices, had dinner with the member for Higgins, the architect of Work Choices. Maybe the Work Choices strategy of the Liberal Party was worked out then, or just maybe they were having dinner to discuss their support for the Leader of the Opposition. Employment",95
79,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. As the minister refused to answer the question I asked her yesterday, I ask her again: will the minister guarantee that no jobs will be lost under the Fair Work Bill, or will she come clean with what the job consequences will be of her industrial changes, particularly for workers in the restaurant and catering sector?",96
80,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow minister for his question. I would ask him at some point to perhaps tell the House: when was it that the Liberal Party in government released economic modelling of Work Choices? When did that happen?  der with respect to the process of the House, the opposition asks questions and the government answers them. It has become a habit for the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister to ask us questions. If they want to relinquish government, we will facilitate that.",96
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sturt will resume his seat. There is no point of order.,96
82,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker; and I am awaiting the next edition of Senator Bernardi's newsletter. But on another point, when was it that the Liberal Party in government released economic modelling of Work Choices? Oh, that is right; it did not! It did not release economic modelling of Work Choices. Now it is time that the shadow minister just came clean and admitted that all of this twisting and turning is to find an excuse to stay in the embrace of Work Choices and to vote for a continuation",96
83,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I refer you again to sections 88, 89 and 90 of the standing orders. Disorder will occur in this House when ministers will not tell the public how many jobs they are going to lose and come up with all the rubbish of the last",96
84,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor will resume his seat. There is no point of order. The question has been asked.,96
85,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I cannot wait till the member for O'Connor gets his turn to be Leader of the Opposition. They are going to be good days! On the shadow minister's question, can I also say to the shadow minister: if the shadow minister and his current leader and the member for Higgins and the member for O'Connor and whoever else seriously believe that Work Choices created jobs then they should have the political courage to come to the dispatch box and say that they still believe in it and they are voting it. Nation Building and Jobs Plan  is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. How are community representatives responding to the government's infrastructure plans to support local communities, businesses and jobs today and into the future?",96
86,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moreton for his question. The Rudd government are indeed delivering our $800 million Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, the largest local infrastructure program in Australia's history. We said it would support jobs, we said it would support local economies and we said it would make local communities even better places to live in. So it is no surprise that we have had mayors and community leaders, government members who voted for the package and Independent members who voted for the package lobbying for particular projects in their local community. But here today we have again heard the opposition say that the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan is a waste of money-that it will not create a single job and that it will not achieve anything in terms of stimulating the economy. Indeed, when members from that side of the House arrive in Canberra they are pretty consistent on this. The member for Gippsland went out on 26 February and held a little doorstop interview. There he attacked the package and called it a ‘very low quality spend of taxpayers money'. That is pretty consistent with what we have heard today, yesterday and last week-and what we heard during the debate on the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. But they are a bit different when it comes to their electorate. The very same member for Gippsland for has written me a letter supporting a $3.25 million proposal from that very program. In this letter he says, and I quote accurately: In the context of the goals for your economic stimulus package, the project will be labour intensive and stimulate local jobs and the wider economy. You are right, Member for Gippsland; you are absolutely correct. He says one thing in Canberra and another thing in his electorate. But he is not alone. Stephen Parry, who I understand is a Liberal senator from Tasmania, has said the following about a project: Not only is it an environmental initiative but this project would have immediate benefits in addressing the global economic crisis by injecting funds into the municipality for the rollout of the infrastructure. But it is not just them. I have had letters from the member for Maranoa, the member for La Trobe, the member for Paterson, the member for Canning, the member for Tangney, the member for Bowman and the member for Bradfield. Some have got really carried away-the member for Wannon has written me three letters for three projects. He understands the reality, which is that the Nation Building and Jobs Plan is good for jobs and is good for local economies. Of course, you have to look at the detail of what they actually do rather than what they say, because they are pretty tricky. They are tricky when it comes to Work Choices, which they cannot break away from; they are tricky when it comes to climate change, where they say they want action but they oppose the CPRS; they were tricky when it came to saying all of last year that they wanted to give extra money to pensioners, but now they are out there bagging the December stimulus package and not associating it with the extra money that went to pensioners, carers and veterans. You have to actually look at what they do. We saw an example of it again today when we had two questions asked relating to the forum that I hold regularly with the member for North Sydney on the Steve Price program. On the first one they did not throw in a quote at all, so you know that that has no credibility. On the second oneMr Hockey-Read it out!",97
87,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And I will read it out. Steve Price said this, accurately: Well, the restaurant industry today is predicting 1,000 restaurants will close and 2½ thousand jobs will disappear if this becomes law. Then I went on to say: Well, they were all going to disappear over various other issues from time to time as well and … it didn't happen. STEVE PRICE: Well, hang on. The restaurant industry is sayingALBANESE: Well … STEVE PRICE: … they are going to lose 1,000 restaurants and 2½ thousand workers. ALBANESE: Well, absolute nonsense. Absolute nonsense. STEVE PRICE: That's not going to happen? ALBANESE: We operated as a country, as a nation, with a fair industrial and balanced industrial relations system pre Work Choices for a century. In many of the IR issues we were ahead of the world. We operated fairly, people were employed and we have nothing to fear from a fair balance in the workplace. ‘We have nothing to fear from a fair balance in the workplace'-and indeed we don't, which is why the Australian people at the last election voted for a fair balance in the workplace. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table my copy of the transcript and I ask that the Leader of the House does it with his. You table your transcript!",98
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. Mr Anthony Smith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, the minister was quoting from a transcript. I ask that he table it.",98
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Was the minister quoting from a document? Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I am happy to table the pages of the transcript which refer to the direct quotes. Emissions Trading Scheme",98
90,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to a paper by the head of US President Obama's National Economic Council, Lawrence Summers, who expressed concern about expenditures for climate change in economies where per capita income is in decline. Does the Prime Minister share the view that now is not the time to be introducing new taxes on Australian businesses through an emissions trading scheme, especially when those costs will not apply to their international competitors?",98
91,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the National Party's question goes to the policy position of the Obama administration on climate change. I would simply draw the Leader of the National Party's attention to one fact: the Obama administration has committed itself to introducing an emissions trading scheme as a cap and trade system. They have indicated that as their policy approach. We on this side of the House welcome the fact that now in America-one of the single largest emitting countries in the world-we have a government and an administration prepared to be part of the global climate change solution and not simply to be part of the global climate change problem. Our approach is always to be balanced and to ensure that our approach to emissions trading ensures that our economy and our jobs are looked after and that we do the right thing to ensure that the next generation of Australians have a planet and a country which can be comfortably and profitably inhabited given the impact of climate change on water, given the impact of climate change on drought, given the impact of climate change on natural disasters and given the impact of climate change on severe weather events. I would have thought that the Leader of the National Party would be seized of that as well as the importance of acting to preserve jobs and to support firms through the difficult challenges presented by the global economic recession. We on this side of the House welcome the fact that the administration of the United States of America is now signing up to be part of the global solution and is not being part of the problem. Economy",98
92,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,2.50 pm)My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. What reform challenges does the government face arising from the December quarter national accounts figures? Does the government accept proposals that it revisit policy approaches of the recent past?,99
93,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wills for his question. The government does face very big economic challenges and these have been underlined by the December quarter accounts figures, which show amongst other things a very big drop in business inventories and a very big increase in household savings, all of which suggest that there was a major shock to confidence in the quarter, particularly in October, and that is reflected in surveys of business and consumer confidence. The data also does give some indication of the early impact of the government's first stimulus package, but I would emphasise that that of course only impacted on the last three weeks of the 13 weeks of the quarter. That therefore means that much of the impact is now occurring and will continue to flow into the course of this year. I note that the data that shows the impact of the first home owners grant extension that the government determined last year adds to the evidence indicating that the decisions to stimulate activity taken by the government last year are beginning to have a significant effect. As always, the crucial question we have to ask here is: what would be happening were it not for that stimulus to the Australian economy? There are some arguing that we should be returning to the policy approaches of the recent past. The most prominent of these has of course been the member for Higgins, who has been haunting TV studios, hounding radio producers and chasing anybody who might be remotely connected with the media up hill and down dale, arguing that we should return to Work Choices, scrap any suggestion of a carbon pollution reduction scheme and restore the Howard government's economic policy generally. I note he is claiming credit for the fact that he made a statement in October 2007 suggesting that the Australian economy was soon to be hit by a tsunami coming from a collapse in the global economy. He is now claiming this as the basis for why he should be listened to as the great economic seer and the person who would lead us into the promised land. Like all soothsayers, astrologers, myth makers and snake-oil salesmen, the member for Higgins wants us to take note of some things that he said some time ago that vaguely turned out to be accurate and ignore some of the other things. I note that roughly at the same time he was also urging Australians to put their money into superannuation, up to $150,000 a year under his new tax-free rule. He said, ‘Put all your money into superannuation.' There are now a lot of people out there regretting taking his advice, borrowing money in order to put money into superannuation. At the same time as he was purportedly telling people there was a huge tsunami on the way, he was telling people to put their money into superannuation. He is yearning for a return to the past-yearning for a return to Work Choices, inaction on climate change and inaction on infrastructure. I was on a TV program with the member for Higgins last week. He was asked why he was choosing to stay on the back bench. His answer was that it gives him time to reflect. How do you like that? That is the purpose of being in this parliament-reflection! It is kind of like this is an ashram or something where we all sit around and say ‘om' and reflect, or an ashram in Armadale in the seat of Higgins with old Swami Costello and his acolytes reflecting on the state of the world. Mr Randall- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. What do ashrams and swamis have to do with the question?",99
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Canning will resume his seat. I will listen carefully to the minister's response and I remind the minister of his obligation to refer to members by their parliamentary titles.,100
95,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My apologies, Mr Speaker. Sadly, every few weeks the media gets a little bit bored and out pops the member for Higgins-will he, won'the, what did he say in that phone call, who is he supporting in a preselection, who is running for the local council and where does he walk his dog? All that kind of stuff comes up. I am sorry to say this to the Liberal Party but is all a waste of time. We know you are having great difficulty making up your mind on whether you want to go back to the past or not and whether you want to support Work Choices or not",100

98,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government does not believe that Australia should return to the recent past. In fact, our economic policy is focused on making up for the mistakes of the recent past, for 10 years of soft options, for 10 years of minimal economic reform, for 10 years of inadequate investment in infrastructure and skill, and with one big agenda at the end. The big agenda was to attack working people's rights in the workplace. We are also about restoring the rights of working people in the workplace. We are going to proceed with our reform agenda and we suggest that the member for Higgins gets out of the road of the Liberal Party getting with the strength and understanding that the Australian people are moving on from the Howard era. They have a very different agenda and a very different set of economic needs which this government is delivering. Emissions Trading Scheme",100
99,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware that, following the government's white paper, Macquarie Research issued a downgrade for Energy Developments, a green energy company that would now miss out on credits for its clean energy? Is the Treasurer aware that the primary basis for the downgrade, dated 26 February this year, is the emissions tradthis ing scheme and the risk that investment and jobs will be lost? Will the Treasurer assure the employees of the company that Macquarie Research is wrong and that their jobs are safe under his scheme, or is this just risk of a Rudd recession?",100
100,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the shadow minister for his question. I cannot believe the hide of the shadow minister. They do not have a policy at all. We have a white paper, we have legislation in the parliament; they have no policy whatsoever. On 23 February the Leader of the Opposition said in the Australian that he stood for deeper cuts to Australia's emissions. On the same day we had the shadow minister for infrastructure say that stood for smaller cuts to Australia's emissions. Of course, we also had Mr Robb earlier than that calling for a carbon tax and had Senator Brandis saying there was no action at all. Confusion reigns supreme. fusion reigns supreme when it comes to the CPRS and climate change more generally. Mr Hockey-Confusion? Tell us about the terms of reference for your committee.",101

They are so confused they are running around the place stabbing each other in the chest. They are so confused. What do we have when it comes to climate change? We have the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, we have legislation which has been put out in the public by the responsible minister and we have a path of action which will deliver certainty to Australian business. That is what Australian businesses are looking for from the Rudd government. We have an approach to reduce emissions by setting a price signal. We have a renewable energy target and we have a commitment to energy efficiency. What do they have on that side of the House? Absolutely nothing. The hide of the shadow minister to get up and ask that question. We want the to give the Australian people certainty; you should give them certainty by supporting our legislation in the Senate.",101

105,Ms BIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Education, Employment and he Workplace Relations and Social Inclusion. What steps through the education system is the government taking to stimulate the econwe omy during the global financial crisis?",101
106,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Con- Cunningham for her question and know that she has devoted a lifetime to working in the education and skills area. The Rudd Labor government obviously has set as one of its highest priorities delivering the education revolution we promised the Australian people at the last election. In these difficult economic days, with the global financial crisis and global recession bearing down on our economy, we have determined that in terms of stimulating the economy there is no better investment than investing in education and training. We made a decision on 3 February this year, when we announced a range of initiatives to assist households and stimulate the economy, that education would be at the top of the list. Through our Nation Building and Jobs Plan the government will provide a back-toschool bonus of $950. These payments are going out to 1.5 million families with over 2,760,000 children aged four to 18. This back-to-school bonus is to help those families with the costs of returning kids to education and training at the start of this yearand, obviously, every family knows that those bills come in when children return to school. This back-to-school bonus was, of course, designed to provide immediate short-term support to those families and to provide an immediate short-term stimulus to the Australian economy. Of course, it will be followed with our unprecedented historic investment in schools right around the country. Indeed, when we consider the Rudd government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan, the single biggest area of investment is in the nation's schools. Mr Haase-You sound so genuine! Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-What about those without a job?  computers in schools? How are the computers going?",101
107,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course we have members opposite interjecting because they opposed these payments to families and they oppose this investment in schools. They oppose schools around the country being upgraded-that is, they oppose $12.4 billion of investment in primary schools. They oppose $1 billion of investment in science and language centres for secondary schools. They oppose $1.3 billion of investment in our national school pride program. These programs are there to make sure that children in this country are learning in 21st century facilities, but these programs are also there to ensure that there is support for jobs right around the nation.",102
108,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As members in this House know or, at least, those members who support their local schools know, schools are in communities right around the nation. Even very small communities have a primary school and consequently these programs will enable capital and infrastructure development in schools right around the country.  all, Julia? We just want you to deliver a program!",102
109,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The members opposite might call out and might moan about this package but the great truth is they voted against it. Had they been the government, none of these payments would have flowed-no payments to assist families with the costs of going back to school, none of these big investments for schools right around the country, no investments in trade training centres and no investments in the digital education revolution. This is a government that is not only delivering what it promised but is delivering an historic new investment in schools right around the country. Members on this side of the House are proud of it, members on that side of the House would prefer to see local schools go without new facilities and local tradespeople go without work. Special Air Service Regiment",102
110,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Defence. Will the Minister for Defence confirm that he told this House on 25 February that not one special forces soldier has been financially disadvantaged by the SAS pay debacle, and I quote: No special forces soldier in this country has a debt against his name because of the way in which Defence has implemented the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal's decision-end of story. Does the minister stand by his statement?",102
111,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me take the Leader of the Opposition through the history for his benefit. When this matter was first brought to my attention, I immediately put a stop on any recovery action. Then on 18 February, by way of a Chief of Army directive, we extinguished all debts. I then put in place a remediation plan, which is ongoing. I then appointed an independent mediator to liaise with families who might not be prepared to come forward and talk to senior Defence leadership and/or me. I then appointed an independent auditor of order. This is a very serious question very serious matter because it goes to a statement the minister made in the House. The opposition has asked him whether he stands by that statement. That is all we have asked.",102
112,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Is the point of order on relevance? ,103
113,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At 45 seconds into the answer I think the Minister for Defence is addressing the matters raised in the question. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of orderMr Hockey-He said that after that, Albo!",103
114,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for North Sydney will leave the chamber for one hour understanding order 94A because I warned you earlier on. The member for North Sydney then left the chamber. Mr Albanese-Are you going to apologise before you go?,103
115,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Leader of the House will let things go. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order goes to disthat ruptive conduct. It is quite clear that the Manager of Opposition Business and others opposite have a clear strategy to disrupt question time by moving frivolous points of order. Mr Haase interjecting",103
116,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the House will resume his seat. The member for Kalgoorlie will withdraw. Mr Haase- Mr Speaker, I am astounded that you would ask me to withdraw such an accusation of one who is on the record as on a being in the gutter on every occasion!",103
117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I warn the member for Kalgoorlie! Will the member for Kalgoorlie withdraw? Mr Haase-If it pleases the Speaker, I withdraw, Mr Speaker.",103
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member knows that he has to withdraw without any condition. Mr Haase-I withdraw.,103
119,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point of order raised by the Leader of the House indicates a very difficult position for occupants of the chair because it is about perceptions of what the intent or otherwise might be of those who raise the points of order. I know that from time to time there are members who think that I might be a bit more charitable in the way in which I reflect upon the intentions of those raising the points of order, but on this occasion I do not believe that the intent of the point of order was disruption. I simply say to the Manager of Opposition Business that on this occasion, given the nature of the question, as practice indicates, one cannot expect a ‘yes or no' direct answer to the last part of the question when there were other matters introduced in the question. I think on this occasion it is clear that the Minister for Defence is being relevant to the question.",103
120,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I then appointed an independent auditor to ensure all of my directives had been followed and fully implemented. His work is ongoing. Last Wednesday I travelled to Perth and attended Campbell Barracks. After meeting with around 120 soldiers to talk about more general issues, such as the coming white paper, I met with around 30 soldiers and, in some cases, their partners to work through with them any outstanding issues. I will continue to work through any outstanding issues to ensure that the men and women of the Defence Force are getting all the support they need and deserve. I will leave it to the tinue to play politics with the men and women of the ADF. Education and Training",103
121,Mr SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Employment Participation. Will the minister update the House about how measures for students and those undertaking training will help to build Australia's productive capacity and address the skill shortage now and in the future?,104
122,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Longman for his question. I know he has a concern for students in his electorate and indeed for the unemployed who are undergoing training. The support that we can provide them in this time, of course, is critical. We must respond to the challenges confronting the nation now but we also need to keep an eye on what we need to put in place when the economy is in recovery. It was therefore critical that the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan be put in place to respond to the current global financial crisis, the worse global economic recession in living memory. It was also important that we put in place an element of that plan, the training and learning bonus, which has two components: a one-off bonus of $950 for full-time students on youth allowance and recipients of Austudy and Abstudy as of 3 February this year; and a temporary supplement to the education entry payment of $950 for the period from 1 January this year to 30 June next year. That is in addition to the $208 paid for those unemployed people undergoing approved training. The government has also changed the eligibility criteria, ensuring that we bring forward the capacity for people to access this payment within a month of being on income support rather than a full year. These are practical steps that have been put in place by the government and opposed by every memopposition to conber opposite. Every member opposite has opposed the support in their electorates for students and unemployed people who are undergoing approved training. These people are in need of such support. We know that students are doing it tough in some areas and need to maintain their skills for the future. They need to acquire the skills required by our employers. If the unemployed are undergoing approved training and we can provide the support and they can acquire the skills required by employers in this country over the medium term, then it is important that we have the support of this parliament. But, unfortunately, each and every member opposite voted against this particular initiative, and therefore I am sure they will tell the students and the unemployed-those out-of-work Australians-in their electorates that they did not support them with this particular initiative. This government is not only about responding to our immediate concerns but has also focused on providing assistance in the medium term to job seekers and workers affected by the current circumstances. The government's Productivity Places Program will continue to help Australians, both in and out of the workforce, by offering them the chance to train and to retrain in a multitude of different areas in need. Through the Productivity Places Program, since April last year the Australian government has allocated 711,000 training places, of which 319,000 places are dedicated to job seekers. This will ensure, of course, that Australian employers will have the particular skills that they have been crying out for for many, many years. The results in relation to the Productivity Places Program speak for themselves. Since April last year, there have been 88,000 job seekers enrolled in the Productivity Places Program. Indeed, 30,000 of those 88,000 participants have completed their training. Many thousands of those 30,000 had already found work as of the end of the month. I am happy to inform the House that the government will continue to provide training and employment opportunities in the coming months. This, of course, will help our nation come out the other side of the current economic crisis in very good shape. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition has not concerned himself with jobs. He has not concerned himself with supporting a particular plan. The only job the Leader of the Opposition is concerned about is his own job, which probably is a precarious job. The only job he has concerned himself with is, of course, his own job. Instead of concerning himself with his own job, the Leader of the Opposition should be working with the government to assist employers, job seekers and others in the community who are doing it tough. Biosecurity Australia",104
123,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is the Prime Minister aware that Biosecurity Australia's decision to allow the importation of Filipino bananas will cost 6,000 Australians their jobs and the economy $350 million a year? Does the Prime Minister agree with Biosecurity's proposition that 22 million cartons of bananas will flow in but not one single insect egg or microspore of bacteria will? Further, is the Prime Minister aware that in the last seven years Biosecurity has said yes to every single application and that such neoliberalism has now cost Australia, with equine flu and similar AQIS initiatives, over $2,000 million? Finally, could the Prime Minister advise, if the agency's policy is simply never to say no, could the Karumba Progress Association-or possibly a flock of galahstender for the Biosecurity contract?",105
124,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I also thank him for his advocacy on behalf of banana farmers. I know he takes seriously the challenges faced by that industry. Those challenges include continuing matters which must be dealt with in the area of quarantine. As the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry indicated to the House most recently, the government is seized of the challenges which are presented to the industry at present. As a result, various determinations have been made by Biosecurity Australia. Australia's Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine has made a biosecurity policy determination for the importation of bananas from the Philippines. Biosecurity Australia advised stakeholders on 3 March 2009 the policy determination had been made. Australia's Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine has made a policy determination in establishing a quarantine policy for the importation of bananas from the Philippines. This decision is in line with the final import risk analysis report issued last November. I again draw honourable members' attention to the fact that this regime was established a long time ago, under the previous government. Mr Truss-We never let bananas in.",105
125,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He who interjects most volubly, the Leader of the National Party, as the minister for agriculture reminded us yesterday, is the pioneer and perfecter of the scheme which is now being deployed. The Philippines will be required to demonstrate to Australia's satisfaction that the risk management measures can be achieved under commercial conditions on an ongoing basis, with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service involved in ensuring compliance on the ground. For the information of the honourable member, my advice is that the required quarantine measures include the following: first, potential exports only from areas that demonstrate low pest prevalence; second, registration of export blocks; third, inspection to detect the presence of any diseases; fourth, ongoing inspections of blocks and fruit, including by Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service inspectors; fifth, disinfection and fungicide spraying; sixth, mandatory preclearance arrangements with the presence and involvement of AQIS inspectors in the Philippines in applying quarantine conditions in the field, including in packing houses; seventh, auditing and verification by AQIS of systems and processes used by the Philippines to certify any exports; and, eighth, detailed data and documentation to be provided by the Philippines for consideration by Australia prior to any exports to verify and validate quarantine measures, underpinned by laboratory and field experiments in commercial trials. In answer to the honourable member's question, these are the specific quarantine measures which will be applied to the decision and policy determination which has been made by Biosecurity Australia. I also note to the House the response which was conveyed yesterday by the minister for agriculture in terms of the response from the government of the Philippines on this question. It has described our banana quarantine policy as very stringent, expensive and trade restrictive and claims it will delay any exports. The Philippine agriculture undersecretary is quoted as saying: If the conditions are that strict, no industry profit through exports. The reaction from the government of the Philippines to this stipulation and the conditions attached to it has been direct and critical of the government of Australia. I also say in response to the honourable member's question: I take very seriously the future of the banana industry in the country. It is a significant employer not just in the honourable member's electorate but also in parts of northern New South Wales and South-East Queensland. My father began life after the war as a banana farmer. I, therefore, through family upbringing and through relatives involved in the industry, know something of the challenges which are involved here. I would ask the honourable member to pay particular heed to the conditionalities attached to this importation determination and to the stringency associated with them. I am prepared, because I know the honourable member takes seriously the representation of industries in his electorate, to maintain a continued dialogue with him on this process as it unfolds. I accept absolutely the bona fides of the honourable member in raising these matters in this place, and I look forward to a continued discussion with him as these conditionalities are applied to the determination which has been made to Biosecurity Australia. This is an important industry for Australia's future which warrants the highest consideration on the part of our quarantine authorities and therefore, given the honourable member's obvious and legitimate interest in this industry, the basis for continued dialogue and discussion with me. I thank the honourable member. Nation Building and Jobs Plan",105
126,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Econcan omy. How is the government supporting small business now and into the future through the Nation Building and Jobs Plan?",106
127,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Franklin for her question and her strong interest in the small business community in Tasmania. The Rudd government has had small business firmly in mind in designing its responses to the global financial crisis. The payments under the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which will begin to flow to households this week, will quickly boost consumption and they will support small business in every community around the country. Let us be clear about this. Without these payments, things would be even tougher for small businesses. They would be under more pressure to cut their staff or reduce their hours. It is a pity that the opposition does not accept these basic economic facts. It is a great pity that the opposition voted against the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. But I am pleased to advise the House that the business community do clearly support the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, and their response has been overwhelmingly positive. I will just take a selection of two of the responses at the moment. The Council of Small Business of Australia said that it was a confidence boost for small business and that it would: … provide benefit to many small businesses and to the communities in which they live and operate. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia describes it as: … a timely shot in the arm for small business. These payments are a critical and responsible measure to support jobs and growth until the much larger nation-building elements of our plan kick in-our investments in schools, roads and housing. Let us have a look at those. Australia's 1.3 million tradies, our independent contractors, will be the big beneficiaries of these infrastructure investments, which represent more than two-thirds of the spending under the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. For example, tradies will be given work in the $14.7 billion program of Building the Education Revolution in every Australian school. Tradies will be installing insulation in 2.7 million Australian homes. Tradies will be engaged in the construction of 20,000 social and Defence Housing dwellings, and tradies will be working on improvements to the community infrastructure and upgrading the nation's roads with $890 million to be spent under this plan. Tradies will also join other small businesses in benefiting from our 30 per cent small business and general tax break, and that will provide a further stimulus to the economy-again, a point that is rejected by the opposition but supported by business organisations around the country. The NSW Business Chamber has described the tax break in these terms: NSW businesses will particularly welcome the $2.7 billion package of tax breaks for business. Again, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Western Australia said: CCCI believes the $2.7 billion tax bonus is an important and timely investment in the lifeblood of the Australian economy-small business. This is the tax break that the coalition voted against. The Australian Industry Group said: In particular, business welcomes the $2.7 billion investment incentive. The Combined Small Business Alliance of Western Australia said, with reference to the $42 billion economic stimulus measures: … in particular the small business and general business tax breaks, you and your government are to be commended for your initiative and your endeavour to address the nation's dire economic circumstances. Master Builders Australia said: The building industry is predominantly made up of small businesses which should benefit from the Government's $2.7 billion Small Business and General Tax break. The National Farmers Federation said: Further, the $2.7 billion tax break for small nesses … will be greatly appreciated by those small family owned farms. Finally, the Pharmacy Guild of AustraliaMr Ciobo- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am just wondering if he is going to mention Restaurant and Catering Australia, who say that their laws will destroy over 2½ thousand jobs.",106
128,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Moncrieff will leave the chamber for one hour. That is not a point of order. The member for Moncrieff then left the chamber.,108
129,Dr EMERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, Restaurant and Catering Australia did welcome the $2.7 billion tax break for small business which the coalition opposed. The Pharmacy Guild said: The Pharmacy Guild of Australia welcomes the tax break for small business. And: The measure comes at the right time to encourage community pharmacies to make productive investments … We are now moving towards the end of question time, and I notice that generally there is a question from the coalition when a survey of consumer sentiment comes out, but I note that we did not get one today. There is a pretty good reason for that: the survey of consumer sentiment was released not long before question time and it says, in part: On the face of this there is a surprisingly good result. It goes on to say: It may be that the index is now finding a base. Importantly, the Westpac Consumer Survey says: The big surprise came with the outlook for the economy over the next five years, which surged by 15.2 per cent. This could only be a strong vote of confidence that current policies busiare providing a strong foundation in the longer term. Current policies that the coalition voted against and continues to campaign against. There is Bill Evans of Westpac saying that this is a very good result and that we are doing the right thing by the Australian economy with this Nation Building and Jobs Plan. The tragedy of the situation is that the only jobs that those opposite care about are their own. Special Air Service Regiment",108

139,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I remind the minister of the need to refer his remarks through the chair. Zimbabwe,109
140,Mr SIDEBOTTOM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on developments in Zimbabwe?,109
141,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. Can I start on a sad note. Today, of course, is the funeral in Zimbabwe of Mrs Susan Tsvangirai, Prime Minister Tsvangirai's wife of 31 years, who was killed in a car accident on Friday. Over the weekend I asked our high commissioner to relay to Mr Tsvangirai, through his chief of staff, our deepest condolences at the death of his wife, and I am sure that sentiment is shared by all members of the House and by the Australian community. Mr Tsvangirai, of course, is Prime Minister of the so-called inclusive government. Australia's preference, of course, would be that Mr Mugabe walk off the stage, but like other nation-states we are forced to deal with the cards that are dealt. The fact that Mr Mugabe's presidency is ongoing is reflected by Australia's ongoing sanctions arrangements in both the financial and the travel area, which we are not proposing to disturb. By our view that, whilst to date Australia has rendered humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe, particularly in the food and health area so far as cholera is concerned, given the desperate need to rebuild Zimbabwe's social and economic fabric, the time has come for Australia to render additional assistance. Some might say that we are now moving into areas that go beyond strictly humanitarian assistance, but I think that, provided we take the appropriate balance of circumstances into account, we can render Zimbabwe development assistance and help to build their capacity and to support Mr Tsvangirai at what is a very difficult time for him and the people of Zimbabwe. I spoke to Prime Minister Tsvangirai in the middle of February and indicated that to him. As a consequence, I have indicated today that Australia will provide an additional $10 million of development assistance to the people of Zimbabwe. Five million dollars of that will be in the water, water sanitation and water infrastructure area and $5 million in the health area. The water contribution-the $5 million for water-will be made through UNICEF. Recently Zimbabwe's local authorities took control again of responsibility for the water infrastructure, and UNICEF dealing direct with local authorities, in our view, minimises the prospects that that money will be diverted for insidious purposes by Mr Mugabe or his associates. Secondly, so far as the $5 million for health is concerned, this contribution will be made through the United Kingdom Department for International Development, or DFID as it is known. The health system of Zimbabwe has collapsed and they are in desperate need of finding health professionals and health workers. DFID has recently introduced a program where they provide health workers and professionals with additional incentive payments. As members would appreciate, being on the salary of the government of Zimbabwe in the health area is not a reliable income. So we will contribute, through the United Kingdom Department for International Development, $5 million for payment incentives or incentives to health professionals and workers to rejoin what is effectively a collapsed Zimbabwean health system. We will look for further opportunities in the future to see what additional assistance we can bring by way of development assistance and capacity building, particularly in these social areas-health, water, water sanitation, education, food and agriculture-and we will do that bearing in mind the risks which are attendant upon the Zimbabwe situation given Mr Mugabe's ongoing presence. I conclude where I started. I think that, the day of Mrs Tsvangirai's funeral, we send our deepest condolences to the Prime Minister. We wish him well at this difficult personal time but we also wish the people of Zimbabwe all the best for the future as they seek to rebuild their society, their economy and their social infrastructure. Mr Rudd- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",109
142,Mr RUDD,ZIMBABWE," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I join with the comments just made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the death of Mrs Tsvangirai. All members of the House, I believe, share a deep concern about events in Zimbabwe. All members of the House have seen the extraordinary developments in internal politics in Zimbabwe in recent times. Some years ago the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition and I were in Zimbabwe in the lead-up to parliamentary elections. The violence that we saw on that occasion and that has ensued since then has been meted out, in particular, on members of the Movement for Democratic Change, led by Mr Tsvangirai with great courage, great commitment and great resilience. This extraordinary tragedy involving his wife is something for which I believe all members express not only their sympathy to him but also a deep sense of concern about his welfare and the arduous responsibilities he now faces in seeking to bring some level of normality to the political administration of Zimbabwe. The people of Zimbabwe deserve much better than history has dealt them in the last decade plus.",110
143,Ms JULIE BISHOP,ZIMBABWE," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: the opposition joins with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister in expressing its deep sympaon thy to the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, Morgan Tsvangirai, on the tragic death of his wife. We extend our deepest sympathy to the Prime Minister and his family. As the Prime Minister indicated, Mr Tsvangirai has had an extraordinarily difficult time over many years as the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change. After many years struggling against the regime of Robert Mugabe he finally took his place as Prime Minister, and to have this tragedy occur-the death of his wife-was indeed an extraordinary blow. The opposition joins with the government in sending our deepest sympathies to the people of Zimbabwe and the Tsvangirai family. NA",110
144,Mr GRIFFIN,MR JACK ROSS," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I wish to speak briefly on the 110th birthday of Mr Jack Ross. There are some 375,000 veterans from all conflicts in Australia today. Some 115,000 are from World War II and around 49,000 are from Vietnam but only one is from World War I, Mr Jack Ross, who some 90 years after the end of the conflict that was meant to be the war to end all wars has today celebrated his 110th birthday. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",110
145,Mr GRIFFIN,MR JACK ROSS,"Mr Ross is a resident of the seat of Bendigo and is known well to the member for Bendigo, Mr Steve Gibbons. Steve says he has known Jack since he was a young bloke-he was at his 100th birthday. Jack is the last of over 400,000 Australians who enlisted in the Great War. He enlisted at the age of 18 in January 1918. He did not serve overseas because, at the time his training was underway-thankfully for all of those who were left-the war finished. We should remember at a time like this that some 61,000-plus Australians died in that war and some 156,000-plus were wounded or taken as POWs-that from a population of fewer than five million. He was the last of the generation that gave so much at a time when a country needed it. He was part of that generation which was the first of the ANZAC tradition. Jack is an unassuming man, so I am told. He has not been fussed by the kerfuffle that is occurring around his birthday. He has been concentrating on spending the day with family and with close friends, and for that he has certainly earned our respect. But I believe we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge in this chamber that this is a very special milestone. As I understand it, according to the Minister for Health and Ageing, he is also Australia's oldest man. I want to assure the House that it is something that I will not achieve. Mr Keenan-We'll make sure of that!",111
146,Mr GRIFFIN,MR JACK ROSS,"I would like to say on behalf of the entire House that I am sure that is the case. I would also like to say: Jack, happy birthday. It is a day that I am sure you will enjoy with your family and your loved ones. It is something that I am sure you will remember into the future. I want you to know that we remember here in this place and throughout this country what your generation did. We remember it as the commencement of the ANZAC tradition. We see it in line with what has occurred subsequently and with those who have served in World War II, Korea, Vietnam and those serving today in places like Afghanistan. You have our respect. You have our best wishes for the future and our acknowledgement and deepest debt for what you did as part of a generation that gave so much so long ago.",111
147,Mrs MARKUS,MR JACK ROSS,"Greenway) (3.41 pm)Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I rise to support the Minister for Veterans Affair's remarks. Such a milestone is worthy of not just our attention but also our recognition. I acknowledge firstly Mr Ross's service to a nation not just during the First World War but also during the Second World War. I extend to Mr Ross our very best wishes for his 110th birthday. In contrast to the minister's comments, I would hope that I would reach that milestone. Mr Ross's experiences over 110 years, no doubt, would be vast and varied. I am sure he has seen many changes in our great nation over that period of time. As the minister has mentioned already, Mr Ross enlisted at 18 in the AIF in January 1918 and, I understand, trained as a wireless operator. Mr Ross is our last connection with a generation of men who served selflessly, willing to lay down their lives for our freedoms. He knew of the massive casualties and deaths that had occurred on the battlefields of Gallipoli, Palestine and the Western Front, yet he still signed up-willing to go to the frontline and lay down his life. During World War II he served as part of the Volunteer Defence Corps. Now, as has already been mentioned, he lives in Bendigo. I acknowledge his daughter Peggy, son Robert, his four grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. Together let us acknowledge with pride the service and great Australian spirit of Mr Ross.",111
148,Mr RUDD,MR JACK ROSS,"I understand that the Leader of the Opposition will join me in a few remarks as well. What an extraordinary day. It is 2009 and we have with us this last living connection with the extraordinary events of the World War. I would like to join with other honourable members in simply saying to Jack Ross: happy birthday from the Australian Parliament and the Australian people. It is not just that Jack Ross put on the uniform of Australia as a member of the first AIF and that he is with us still today. up for the second one as well. He was a member of the Australian Volunteer Defence Corps second time around. It is an extraordinary story of the calibre and fabric of that generation of Australians. So, on his birthday, we salute him, and through him we acknowledge this extraordinary human bond with the events which so much shaped the Australian character in the battlefields of Western Europe and on the beaches at Gallipoli.",112
149,Mr TURNBULL,MR JACK ROSS,"On indulgence, I join the Prime Minister, the minister and the shadow minister in conveying very best birthday wishes to Jack Ross. One hundred and ten not out! That is a very big score in anyone's language. The generation that defended Australia in the Great War was the greatest generation for the greatest war our nation has ever fought. None of us who have been around Australian country towns can fail to be amazed at the war memorials there and the enormous lists of names-name after name, often of brothers, and sometimes three brothers, all dead. It was an extraordinary toll that this nation paid in the First World War. It was a price paid in blood. It made a nation of Australia. Our national identity was forged in that war, and it was forged with the courage and the perseverance of men like Jack Ross. He is the last of that generation and as we salute his birthday-as we salute your birthday, Jack-we salute all of his comrades; all of our grandfathers, fathers and great-grandfathers that served in that war. We salute all of those men and women who were First so brave. So many of them-like you, Jack-served in the Second World War as well. They were brave in two wars, defending Australia and making us the nation we are today. We are humbled by your service. We are in awe at your longevity, and we congratulate you on your 110th. Well done He also saddled and happy birthday. NA",112

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",113
157,Mr ROBB,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is an issue of great consequence for all Australians, yet it requires judgement and great common sense, especially in the difficult times that the country is now experiencing. Sadly, however, on the question of climate change this government is legislating for certainty-the certainty of unemployment. The loss of tens of thousands of jobs will be directly attributable to the government's flawed emissions trading scheme if it goes ahead. We all know that we best tackle climate change from a position of economic strength. It is no different for our nation it is for a family. If a family or an individual wants to install a solar panel or a water tank to make a contribution to the climate, they cannot do it without a job or money in the bank. They cannot do it if they are not in a strong financial position. The same is true for Australia as a nation. Our ability to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will be negligible if our economy is under severe financial pressure, if unemployment is high, if people do not have jobs, if debt levels are high and if investment is stalled. It requires people in jobs, it requires businesses to be performing strongly and it requires a cashed-up economy. If we get this emissions trading scheme wrong, not only will it do untold damage, it will also see the collapse of support for any future scheme designed to tackle carbon dioxide abatement. Everyone agrees that as a country producing only 1.4 per cent of the world's carbon emissions, there is no Australian solution to climate change. There is only a global solution. Everyone agrees that only coordinated global action will put a price on emitting or storing carbon dioxide. Only global action will have any impact on reducing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. For this reason, the design of any Australian emissions trading scheme must be responsive to the existence, or the absence, of a global agreement. If an emissions trading scheme does not take account of what is happening, or not happening, in other countries then the design of the scheme is deeply flawed. Such a flawed design will seriously damage the competitive position of many of our industries and will see Australian jobs, investment and CO2 emissions being exported to countries where no price is being imposed on carbon. The government's white paper on emissions trading is deeply flawed in this way. Our economy will be badly afthan fected. I agree with Bob Brown that a badly designed scheme is worse than no scheme at all. Before the election, the Prime Minister promised to introduce an emissions trading scheme which would lead to deep cuts in CO2 emissions in our economy but which would not disadvantage Australia's export and import competing industries. This promise was repeated again and again by the Prime Minister in the lead-up to the election. He said that he would not disadvantage any of our export or import competing industries when he introduced a scheme, and the scheme would lead to significant and deep reductions in CO2 emissions. These were the expectations that were created and these were the promises that were given. This was the mandate that he had to tackle climate change in this country. Of course, that promise was repeated by many colleagues in the lead-up to the election, but since the election not one member of the government has dared to repeat that promise. They have not uttered the words that they will not disadvantage export and import competing industries. As it has turned out, the government's proposal is immensely complex. Of all the 50 or 60 industries that have come through my door, every one of them has a different scheme; every one of them has a different deal that is invariably unsatisfactory and invariably crippling. This is not a scheme to design one price of carbon; there are 50 or 60 or 70 or 100 prices of carbon because every scheme is different for every industry. This is a disaster. This government is in disarray on this program. This has been a mess from day one. This government scheme would seriously disadvantage our export and import competing industries and cost thousands of jobs. It will kill investment yet not produce any meaningful reductions in CO2 emissions. It fails on all counts. Under the Rudd scheme, from year one Australian export and import competing industries will be effectively taxed an extra $2½ billion that they cannot pass on as they are price takers. This is in the face of a ise not to disadvantage export and import competing industries. Of the $12 billion that will come into the government coffers in year one, 44 per cent will come from trade exposed industries, but less than 25 per cent will go back to those industries as free allocations of permits. The difference is over 20 per cent, or around $2½ billion. With our economy approaching recession-the Rudd recession-and much of it in recession already, jobs in many sectors will come under severe pressure with the introduction of this scheme. For many export and import competing industries in Australia, the design of the government's emissions trading scheme will act like a reverse tariff. For these industries, we will be the only country in the world to effectively impose a carbon tax, a tax on industries that are price takers, a tax on industries that have no capacity to pass on costs not faced by their competitors, a punitive tax on industries that the Prime Minister promised not to disadvantage-$2½ billion in the first year. For example, Australia accounts for 0.6 per cent of the world's steel production, but we will be the only country in the world to impose a carbon tax in the middle of the biggest world recession since World War II, according to the IMF. Even in Europe, all of the industries are covered until 2012 and there is serious talk of extensions for them all. Yet, we are talking about 2010 and a $2½ billion tax immediately on all of our export and import competing industries. For many industries, a price of carbon of $25 per tonne of CO2 accounts for 50 per cent of their profits in good times and up to 100 per cent or more of profits in bad years. We could see a situation where companies will have to borrow to pay for their permits. Think about it: companies will have to borrow, in some cases, millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars to pay for their prompermits. What banks in this current climate will lend tens of millions of dollars to pay for permits in the midst of the biggest credit crunch for 80 years? What is more, if we move too far ahead of the world, any cuts in Australia's emissions will not necessarily have a global impact. Our aluminium and zinc industries produce 50 or 60 per cent less CO2 than similar industries in China and other countries. If we impose this tax and industries then move offshore, we could see a dramatic increase in global emissions. Not only will we cripple jobs in this economy, not only will we stymie our ability to rebound out of the recession that is coming, but we will in fact contribute to higher CO2 emissions around the world. To rush the introduction of this scheme without knowing the outcome of the December 2009 global environment summit in Copenhagen, without knowing what President Obama will do and when-in fact the only budget allocation in the US system we have already seen for this is in 2012, some two years after we are supposed to be introducing it-and without knowing the impact of the global financial meltdown on our real economy is reckless in the extreme. We will meet the Kyoto target by 2012-one of only five countries in the world to do so. There is no need to rush into this if it is not ready. The government scheme is in disarray. Individuals who take action will make no contribution. Any families or any individuals who make contributions to reducing CO2 emissions will find that it only increases the capacity for industry to increase their emissions. The Treasury modelling was months overdue. It took no account of the financial crisis. It assumed that all other countries in the world were part of the global scheme. It was a useless piece of work. It is being used by the government purely as propaganda and as a prop to carry forward and not take any account of the discussions and negotiations that they have been having with industry. It is self-serving, it is misleading and it is sponsible. The government does not know if there are better approaches, because they forbid Treasury to look at other approaches. That is why we have had to set up a Senate select committee with the Greens to explore other approaches and complementary measures, and to see what else could be done in an effective way to reduce CO2 emissions without causing enormous damage to our economy. The Rudd scheme involves generating permit revenue of nearly $12 billion from year one-a massive increase in taxation. This will see a huge administration set up to churn billions of dollars back through the economy with the government picking winners as to who gets compensation and who does not. No wonder the Minister for Finance and Deregulation is here. He will have responsibility for another $12 billion of administration. We need to know how the government will effectively manage the churn that will take place of billions of dollars back through the economy. The government will be picking winners as to who gets compensation and who does not. I predict that in the years ahead there will be no new resource projects in Australia that will get off the ground without companies coming cap in hand to the minister to get a quota of free permits from the government to make their investments competitive. It will foster a nanny state, a mendicant attitude. Already we are seeing investments being shelved by global companies which cannot believe that Australia would introduce a scheme with so much uncertainty, so much cost and so much disadvantage compared with our major competitors. Already we are seeing investment being killed. When things in the world turn around, companies will look to invest heavily. However, they will not pour money into a jurisdiction where there is a cloud hanging over irrethe long-term competitiveness of various projects and various industries. Australia will miss any upswing that is coming after what we are going through. We will lose a generation of investments. We are in the process of killing investments already with this proposed scheme that the government is putting before the parliament. In many cases, also, the best placed companies to develop and fund the migration to cleaner energy processes, including renewables, are the big emitting companies themselves. Putting a big hole in the balance sheets of these companies will kill this opportunity. Stripping billions of dollars out the balance sheets of companies to compensate households and to put money back into free allocations for some companies will strip the capacity of other companies and their balance sheets to do any meaningful migration to a more effective technology within their plants. The government have little or no understanding of what is important in terms of investment in our resource sector and what has been important over many decades in the very strong position we have held as a country. On top of this, the government have made little or no attempt to consider the impact of the global financial meltdown on the capacity of companies to either administratively or competitively cope with the transition. If they had bothered to meet meaningfully with chief executives, they would have seen the great fear of companies as this financial meltdown has evolved, their great fear about their physical capacity to introduce what is going to be one of the biggest structural changes in Australia's history into their operation in the middle of the worse financial meltdown in 80 years. You know it, Gary. You know it yourself. This is an impost which is going to cost Australia dearly in jobs, investments and finance. The government's scheme is in disarray. It is rushed and bungled. It is deeply flawed because it has been rushed to suit a purely political timetable. The design is not flexible enough to cope with the financial meltdown. The design of the Rudd scheme fails on all counts. It will cost jobs, tens of thousands of jobs. It will kill investment, which means future jobs, and it will do very little, if anything, to reduce CO2 emissions. No-one outside the government supports the scheme. Industry opposes it. The green groups oppose it. And there is substantial dissension within the government's own ranks, within caucus of and within cabinet, in opposition to this. With the design of the government's emissions trading scheme, this government is legislating for unemployment. (Time expired)",113
158,Mr COMBET,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Charlton-Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change) (4.03 pm)Of course, it is not the government's policy position that is in disarray here; it is the coalition. Let us just start at the most practical level about the issue of jobs in the context of the current economic environment, because no-one can take the coalition seriously after they voted against the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan. Just consider what the coalition voted against. There was $12.2 billion for one-off cash payments to eligible families, single workers, students, drought affected farmers and others to support domestic demand and consumption in the economy that supports jobs. They voted against it. There was $14.7 billion in Building the Education Revolution for investments in education throughout the country, new infrastructure in every school to provide much-needed maintenance and new facilities-$14.7 billion that will support jobs in every community throughout this country. The coalition voted against it-against practical job initiatives. There was $6.4 billion to build more than 20,000 new social and Defence houses, practical investment in job creation throughout the country in the midst of the global financial crisis. The coalition voted against it. There was a temporary business investment tax break for small and general businesses to buy eligible assets worth more than $1,000, which will support job creation in the small business sector and support small business at a difficult period of time. The coalition voted against it. There was $2.7 billion for free ceiling insulation for 2.7 million households, acknowledged throughout the household insulation sector in the economy as something that is going to immediately create jobs. The coalition voted against it. There were significant increases funding for local community infrastructure and local road projects. The coalition voted against them. They voted against all of those job creation measures. Neither can they let go of their commitment to the Work Choices legislation, another piece of legislation that was a job destroyer. The attack on protection against unfair dismissal alone led to many people losing their jobs. They are a coalition that cannot be taken seriously on economic issues and on job creation. If they need any guidance to understand their current position in the polls, they need look no further than their position, confusion and their disarray on the Nation Building and Jobs Plan that the government has prosecuted and the support for jobs throughout the economy; on industrial relations; and on climate change. On that issue, let us get something straight, in answer to the previous speaker's submissions. The government has released the exposure draft for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. It has followed an extensive process of consultation over a considerable period of time with industry stakeholders. For example, I have only just finished meeting with the Australian Coal Association, but of course my colleague the Minister for Climate Change and Water and many other ministers in this government and departmental officials have been meeting with industry stakeholders, environment groups and community organisations over the last 16 months to formulate the detail of this proposal, which is revealed in the exposure draft released by the minister yesterday. A balance has been struck in transitioning this economy to ultimately lower emissions technology as well as protection for the environment. This is an issue in relation to which leadership is needed, not carping, and where tough decisions have to be taken. This government proudly stands by the work that has in been done in the development of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and in particular all of the work by the minister. We as a country need action on climate change to protect the environment and to encourage investment and jobs in lower emissions technology and the renewable energy sector. We need to support jobs in important industries that are severely impacted upon by the effect of climate change, like agriculture and tourism, we need to support jobs in emissions intensive industries as the economy transitions to lower emissions technologies and we need to show leadership in the international their community on this issue. That is why the government has actively pursued the development of policy responses to climate change, and in particular the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We will not as a nation achieve anything on this issue by doing nothing at all. The problem for the coalition fundamentally stems from the fact that they do not believe the science. It is accepted that 13 of the 14 warmest years on record occurred between 1995 and 2008. Australia has experienced warmer than average mean annual temperatures for 17 of the last 18 years. And yet they cannot accept that. The average temperature in Australia has increased by 0.9 degrees Celsius between 1910 and 2007 and it is projected to increase by one to five degrees Celsius by 2070 compared with 1990 levels. This is science that the coalition cannot accept. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has predicted that if we do not act on climate change then exports of key commodities will fall by up to 63 per cent by 2030 and up to 79 per cent by 2050-that is, if we do nothing then we are going to lose jobs in those key parts of the economy. The CSIRO also estimates that if temperatures rose by just two to three degrees then almost all of the Great Barrier Reef would be bleached, putting $4.9 billion of tourism at risk-that is a lot of jobs that would go by doing nothing. The CSIRO has also estimated that if temperatures rise by just two to three degrees then 80 per cent of Kakadu's freshwater wetlands will be lost to rising sea levels. This is just some of the entific evidence and the conclusions that have been drawn that the coalition seems to struggle to accept. The underlying issue is this: if we take no action as a country, there are huge consequences for employment, economic activity and investment in this country-and action we must take. But we do not see anything from the coalition in terms of a policy response to this. Let us not forget the fact that for 12 years no action was taken by the Howard government in response to climate change. The Howard government spent more on taxpayer funded advertising than they had budgeted to spend on tackling climate change over four years. The Howard government refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol. We have just heard the previous speaker, the shadow minister, nominate that Australia will meet its Kyoto targets. That is a pretty sound reason why the Howard government might have signed the Kyoto protocol. But no action was taken. They failed in 2003 to act on Treasury advice to introduce an emissions trading scheme",116
159,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,118
160,Mr COMBET,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"At least they seem to have come to life over there. They gagged top scientists in the CSIRO from reporting on the impact of climate change in Australia. There are very curious views held within the coalition. For example, Senator Joyce was quoted in the Australian newspaper on 14 January this year as saying: The view across the National party is that the reasons put forward to justify an emissions trading scheme are just a load of rubbish … Senator Minchin, leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate, has said: There remains an ongoing debate about the extent of climate change, about the extent of human activity's role in the climate changing. And later of course Senator Minchin made the observation: ‘Carbon dioxide I think is scinot a pollutant'. In a speech on 27 January this year Senator Bernardi said: But exactly what is causing climate change and what-if anything-should we be doing about it should remain the subject of debate. Plenty more quotes can be harvested but they all underline one thing: the difficulty that the coalition has in accepting the fact that we need to act on climate change-that there are sound scientific reasons why we need to act to protect the environment and to make the transition to a lower emissions economy. It is fair to ask what is the coalition's policy on this area, because it appears to be somewhat incoherent. The Leader of the Opposition, a former environment minister of course, is on the record as supporting an emissions trading scheme. We are now not sure whether or not that remains the case or what the Liberal Party's position on an emissions trading scheme is. But it appears from the MPI today that there is opposition to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Mr Robb, the shadow minister and the member for Goldstein, who spoke a moment ago, has posited a number of things. For example, perhaps a carbon tax might be the way to go. We do not know at what level the tax might be levied, what costs are involved, the complexity of it, what impact it would have and in particular how it is going to reduce carbon dioxide levels and carbon dioxide equivalent in the atmosphere. Mr Hunt interjecting",118
161,Mr COMBET,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We have an interjection from the member for Flinders, the shadow minister for the environment. He is also on the record as clearly indicating support for emissions trading scheme. In fact, to quote Mr Hunt from 17 July, he said: … we support the idea of emissions trading. We proposed it … Basically what they've done is they've dusted off the document that we had … That is an interesting contribution to the debate-and somewhat contrary to the MPI that has been moved today. The trouble with the coalition is that it is difficult to divine exactly what is going on. Some coalition members dispute the science. Some suggest a carbon tax is the go. Others support an emissions trading system. The shadow minister for climate change has indicated that perhaps 100 per cent of permits should be issued under an emissions trading scheme. I am not sure how you get a carbon signal in the economy out of that. We do not know what the coalition's position on targets is. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition has indicated that the five to 15 per cent target that the Commonwealth government has established is in fact a very significant target, yet others are suggesting, as we have heard in the contribution to date, that that target is far too stringent for the economy. So it is very difficult to divine exactly what the position of the coalition is. The trouble is that in this area important and strong leadership is needed to take action to deal with the effect of climate change. The coalition will face a very clear choice in the not too distant future as this legislation comes through the House and through the Senate. Will you support it or not? Easy question-we don't know what the answer is. For the government, there are very important foundations for the policy that is enunciated not only through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme exposure draft legislation but for many of the other initiatives that we have taken. I have pointed already to the scian ence. The policy responses include three main pillars, the first of which is the reduction of Australia's carbon pollution levels, and the CPRS is the key policy initiative to address that. Our long-term target is to reduce carbon emissions on 2000 levels by 60 per cent by 2050, and the CPRS has associated with it a medium-term target of reducing emissions on 2000 levels by between five and 15 per cent by 2020. In conjunction with that and in particular to provide investment in certainty in the renewable energy sector, we are establishing a target of 20 per cent of renewable energy by 2020 to be supplied within our electricity market. We are also driving a clean energy revolution with policies such as a $500 million Renewable Energy Fund, a $150 million Energy Innovation Fund and a $500 million national Clean Coal Initiative-extremely important initiatives to underpin employment in that key part of the economy. The second key pillar of our policy is to support adaptation to the impacts of climate change. This is especially important in agriculture and land management areas and tourism. We need to secure our future water supplies. We need to help coastal communities adapt. We are supporting our farming future by providing $130 million over four years to help primary producers adapt. We have established a $200 million Great Barrier Reef rescue plan and we are providing $8.9 million to support the Great Barrier Reef in the Climate Change Action Plan. The third pillar of our strategy to address climate change is to help shape a global solution. We have ratified Kyoto, something the Howard government failed to do. We are playing an aggressive and constructive role in global negotiations to establish a new international agreement. The Treasury has found in its modelling that countries that defer action face long term costs that are around 15 per cent higher than those that take action now. By doing nothing, which is the position of the coalition, more jobs will be lost. We must act to support jobs in lower emissions technology. We must act to protect the environment. We must act to support jobs. (Time expired)",119
162,Mr HUNT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This scheme in this form at this time as presented by the government will send jobs straight to Shanghai. This is a recipe, a plan and a proposal which will send Australian jobs with Australian workers straight to Shanghai and in so doing will achieve the unique double of sending emissions to a higher emissions environment and raising global emissions. Jobs will go to Shanghai and global emissions will go up. However, we had this presented as a choice between action and inaction. That is the false dichotomy which our friends in the government would present and that is the debate which they would want. But they are flat, dead wrong. It is not a choice between action and inaction. It is a choice between job-destroying action and the impression of activity on the one hand and job-creating action and real reduction of emissions on the other hand. That is the difference. We have a very clear plan. It is a plan of protecting the planet whilst protecting Australia. I will run through our four key planks. But I want to deal with the issue of jobs going straight to Shanghai first. To follow on from what Mr Robb, the member for Goldstein, has said, let me speak first about Sun Metals. I speak about them because they are on the record. Other companies have come to the member for Goldstein, the member for Groom, the member for Dunkley, the Leader of the Opposition and me but are not yet willing to speak on the record for fear of retribution. Sun Metals employs directly or indirectly 450 people in Townsville. They make zinc. They smelt zinc. What they have said is that under this government's scheme, because they will be competing against countries which do not have such a tax in exporting their materials to China, in exporting their materials to Asia, they will close and they will move their jobs to China. What will happen to those 450 workers in a global downturn? They will be unemployed. They will lose their jobs and the rest of Australia will have to pick up the price. And their jobs and their families and their livelihood will all suffer as a consequence. What will happen to global emissions? Sun Metals produces about one million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per annum. When Sun Metals moves to China, because of the different processes and the different energy supplies, global emissions will go up from one million tonnes to two million tonnes for the equivalent body of production. That is one company. Visy is also on the record as saying that they will move two Australian paper recycling plants, probably to China, under the government's emissions trading scheme. That is 160 jobs gone. The ludicrous situation is that we take our waste paper, send it to China, process it in China and it is then re-exported to Australia. That is truly an absurd exercise. We mentioned Energy Developments today. Energy Developments harvests the waste coal seam methane gas. It uses that gas. It will probably save, on present estimates, as much in the way of emissions as the government's entire $3 billion so-called energy efficiency program by 2020, unless of course the CPRS is applied to it. What we see from Macquarie Research's note of 26 February is: … the future is in the hands of the government. The headline is: CPRS outcome in June remains the key share price driver. Further down it says: ENE'sthat is, Energy Developments, earnings are: … under threat from a potentially poor outcome from the federal government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The risk is that the government implements the white paper. That is what happens to a renewable energy company under the scheme. What we see is the destruction of Australian jobs in zinc, paper recycling and clean energy companies. They should be ashamed of themselves. Everybody in this House who believes in lower emissions and Australian jobs should think of Sun Metals, Visy and Energy Developments, because these are real companies with real jobs which are really going offshore. What are the great flaws in their system? First, as the member for Goldstein set out, is the lack of a level playing field, which will see Australian firms burdened with a price that other firms in other countries are will see the export of Australian jobs and the driving up of global emissions when those jobs go to a lower emissions environment. Second, what we see is the absence of green carbon, and I will deal with that in more detail in a minute. It is extraordinary that green carbon has been utterly left out of the government's scheme. Whether it is Professor Flannery, Professor Garnaut, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Farm Institute, the Australian Industry Group or the Business Council of Australia, all have called for the inclusion of green carbon in the scheme, yet it is left out of the government's scheme. It is for one simple reasonthey are using last century's European model rather than this century's Australian model. That is the difference. They are using a 12or 13-year-old model which looks backwards and is not designed for Australia and does not maximise the savings of emissions we could make rather than using a model which would be right for Australia, which would save real emissions, which would improve our farms and soils and which would help Australia have lower emissions and to reduce those emissions at low cost. The third of the key elements is the issue of timing. We have always said 2011 or 2012 for the simple reason that we are on track. We are one of five countries to be meeting their target and we are already delivering. But to drive the price of carbon up and to impose an impost on Australian businesses that are engaged in trade prior to other countries is to place a millstone around their necks. That is what we see from our friends on the government bench opposite. What we have is a very simple proposition: we can protect the planet and Australia through four key planks or pillars. The first is that Malcolm Turnbull outlined a green carbon initiative. One hundred and fifty milnot and lion tonnes of CO2 which would not be saved under the government scheme can be saved. It is less than one-sixth of that which has been outlined by Professor Garnaut and it uses soil carbons, biochar, revegetation of mallee and mulga, and forestry. It uses the 11 different elements which Professor Garnaut himself outlined but on a far more conservative basis. All of this is excluded under last century's scheme, which they are trying to impose on Australia today. That is a disastrous model for emissions reduction, a disastrous model for costs within Australia and an extraordinarily lost opportunity for Australian farmers. Do not take our word for it; take the word of the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Farm Institute, WWF, ACF, the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and I can go on. The second element of our proposal is a very simple one: we put on the table over a year ago the concept of a clean energy revolution, terminology which we see has been appropriated. That is fine. But what we will do under the clean energy revolution involves two parts. On the one side there is demand reduction-50 million tonnes of CO2 from energy efficiency on a per annum basis by 2020. Again, this element is entirely excluded under the government system. If mums and dads make savings at home through putting solar panels on their roofs, will not make one gram of difference to the 2020 target under their system. Senator Wong set that out yesterday and conceded it. The other part of the clean energy revolution is what we will do with renewable energy, what we will do with clean coal and the two stations that we will build by 2020 as part of a broader clean energy revolution focused on solar, wind, tidal and geothermal energy. Then we turn to the emissions trading scheme and the flaws I have outlined. We have said that there is a role for a price for carbon but not one done in a way which drives our exports out of Australia, drives our export businesses offshore and destroys Australian jobs. That brings me to the last element, the fourth plank or pillar. That is, we must have a real global agreement with China, India and the United States with real incentives for protecting the great forests of the world. That is the difference- (Time expired)",120
163,Mr ZAPPIA,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As I rise to speak on this motion, I reckon it should really be ‘the adverse effects of the coalition's opposition to the government's emissions trading scheme on employment and the economy'. The question is not only, ‘Will jobs be lost if we act on climate change?' but, ‘How many jobs will be lost if we fail to act?' That is the question that needs to be asked. We see the climate change sceptics on the other side obviously oblivious to what is happening to the climate in the world around us today. Perhaps it is because they are too focused on their internal party room brawling to actually take any notice of the climate around them or what has been said by the scientific community. Just as members opposite ignored for years and years-over a decade-the plight of the Murray-Darling Basin and stood by, watched it its demise and did nothing, they similarly want to do the same when it comes to climate change. There is a real similarity between the two issues. If you go back to their position with respect to the Murray-Darling Basin you will find that the now Leader of the Opposition had a view about what ought to be done, the National Party members in New South Wales and Queensland had another view, then the National Party members in Victoria had a third view about what ought to be done and, when you went to my home state of South Australia, the Liberal Party members there had a fourth view about how the system should be managed-in other words, they could not reach agreement on what they needed to do so they did nothing. That is exactly what is occurring right now when it comes to the issue of climate change. If you look at their track record on this issue you see it changes by the day. A moment ago the parliamentary secretary quoted the member for Goldstein and others. I want to refer to-and I know that the parliamentary secretary did in his quotesSenator Cory Bernardi, from my home state, who on public radio on more than one occasion has spoken on this topic. On 27 January he made a number of statements which clearly indicate that there is real division within his own party about where they stand on climate change. So in the face of disunity you do nothing because you cannot reach any agreement on what it is you have to do. The Rudd government is not prepared to stand by and do nothing and jeopardise future generations in the face of overwhelming scientific advice. I refer to some of that scientific advice in the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. I quote from some very relevant parts in that report, and in doing so I point out that subsequent to this report being written the scientific community has in fact upgraded it and made it absolutely clear that these are conservative positions in the light of what is known today. The report says: - There is now no question that the climate system has warmed. - It is very likely that greenhouse gas emissions related to human activity caused most of the warming that has been observed since the mid-20th century. In their third assessment report in 2001, the IPCC had only considered it likely. Now they say there is no question- Global climate change over the past 50 years is extremely unlikely to have been caused by natural variability alone. - If greenhouse gas emissions continue at or above the current rate there will be further warming, and the changes that we will see during the 21st century would very likely be larger than those observed in the 20th century. It goes on to say: - Global sea level rose during the 20th century by 12-22 cm. By the end of the 21st century, sea level is projected to rise by 18-59 cmI could comment about that further in light of some of the evidence given to the Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts by some of Australia's leading scientists. I will come back to that if there is time. The report goes on to say: - The increases in greenhouse gases since 1750 are due primarily to emissions from fossil fuel use, agriculture, and land-use changes. In other words, from man-made activities, and- Extreme climate events such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall are very likely to become more frequent. Governments have a responsibility to act, and to act on the best possible advice they have before them. That is exactly what the Rudd government is doing. The risk to jobs and the Australian economy is to not act on climate change-to do absolutely nothingwhich is exactly what the opposition would have us do. I repeat what the parliamentary secretary said: jobs that already exist in this country are at risk; jobs like the 63,000 jobs associated with the Great Barrier Reef and the $5.8 billion industry it sustains in tourism, in recreation and in commercial fishing. Thousands of jobs are at risk, many of which we have already lost in the Murray-Darling Basin and in other agricultural areas. Those jobs are real jobs that are in place right now but which may be lost before our very eyes because we sat back and did nothing. The livelihoods of the people in Queensland are at risk, as we saw in recent times through floods and cyclones. Those extreme weather conditions have been predicted by the scientific community. They are not just something we should put up with and pretend we did not know were likely to occur. Those extreme weather conditions affect not only jobs but the future economic viability of this country. That is why we need to act, because if we do not there will be jobs at risk and there will be an impact on the economy of this country to the tune of tens of billions of dollars. On the flip side of that: there are jobs in transitioning to a green economy, and we have already seen those jobs created in a range of sectors. Just look at how many jobs today have been created in the solar panel industry. If you go around Australia and collectively add up those jobs you will see that they run into thousands. If you look at the number of jobs that in recent years have been created in the water and irrigation industries as a result of transitioning to a smarter economy, again, you will find thousands of jobs. If you look at the home insulation program that the government announced as part of its $42 billion package-which I might say members opposite opposed-4,000 jobs are expected to be created in that sector, if you listen to Dennis D'Arcy, the chairperson of the Insulation Council of Australia and New Zealand. He said: Clearly our members have a direct interest package which will create around 4,000 jobs… There are jobs already being created and there will be more jobs created as we transition to a green economy. With respect to transitioning to a green economy, Treasury modelling released in October 2008 demonstrated that economies that defer action face long-term costs that are around 15 per cent higher than those that take action now. In other words, for every day and every year that we delay, the cost to implement a responsible strategy will be more expensive. The Treasury modelling also says that the global market for environmental products and services is projected to double from US$1.3 trillion per year at present to US$2.74 trillion by 2020. Those figures were cited in a United Nations Environment Program Report in 2008. In other words, there is a huge industry out there waiting to be developed as a result of transitioning to the greener economy. Let me say that it is interesting that, in America, President Obama has committed to a scheme being implemented in his country. I want to quote him: … to truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save our planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately make clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy. He said that in February 2009. That was only last month. That is how recently he committed to doing something in the USA. It is also interesting to note that, whilst the opposition members say that we should be doing nothing and holding off, 27 European countries, 28 states and provinces in the US and Canada, and New Zealand are all looking at implementing, if they have not already done so, a similar scheme. They are prepared to take the lead on this, but we are being told that we should not do it. Well, that is not the in the position of the Rudd government, because the Rudd government is acting responsibly to ensure our kids and future generations are not left to clean up our mess. I want to make a couple of other comments in respect of comments made by previous speakers the member for Goldstein and the member for Flinders. They said that we are rushing the scheme. (Time expired)",122
164,Dr WASHER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would like to make it very clear that all the speakers I have listened to so far certainly agree that global warming is a major issue. It is not just global warming. If I could diverge for a second, the anthropogenic effects of CO2 are very dramatic, particularly in Antarctica in terms of acidification. Already the aragonite or calcite-type shells of the microscopic creatures are being dissolved, and the barrier is now rising rapidly to above one kilometre deep, which will affect the food chains of the krill, hence those of the whales, the seals and the penguins et cetera. The Barrier Reef was mentioned. There is no doubt that the concentration of ultraviolet light combined with warmer waters is destroying the plankton that work with the coral, causing coral bleaching. The Arctic is undoubtedly melting and Greenland is also having major problems. No-one disagrees with that, and the member for Makin must understand that. He is a friend of mine, and I want him to be assured that we empathise with the position. However, we have to remember that Australia now emits less than 1.4 per cent of CO2 equivalent emissions, and we need to work as part of a global action if we are going to have any definite effect and change things. The emissions trading system that you have, unfortunately, is flawed. I am not saying it would easy, but it is flawed. As already mentioned by the member for Flinders and I think by the member for Goldstein, it is counterproductive to what people do as individuals. Here, we need to empower not only governments on an international level but also individuals on an individual level. If an individual does things, it literally flows help the polluters in their credits. Our export and import industries will be affected. We estimate that from year one an extra $2.5 billion of tax will be put on them, and yet many of these industries are currently very efficient. For example, the aluminium industry in Australia and the zinc industry, which has been mentioned before, emit only 50 to 60 per cent of the CO2 equivalent here in Australia as compared to China. The proposed scheme involves generating permit revenue of about $12 billion from year one. New Zealand was mentioned by the member for Makin, and, Tony, I want to tell you that 100 per cent of the permits issued in New Zealand will be free until 201819. It is very much different from Australia. The problem of the $12 billion generated is now part of another government problem. The global financial meltdown must be considered, as the ability of these companies to source the finance to buy or borrow the $11.5 billion worth of permits, as the member for Goldstein mentioned, is problematic. It is made worse by the credit crunch but it is made far worse by massive government borrowing. When the government borrows and raises bonds of some $200 billion, no-one else can borrow the money. My money will come out of the bank and go into your bonds. The same bank will invest in your bonds. The pool of resources for private enterprise to borrow from is evaporating and already they cannot borrow. You have turned a fiscal stimulus into a fiscal disaster. Basically, this is the worse crunch that we have had in 80 years. The scheme that was proposed has got very little relativity to reducing the CO2 emitted, and a 20 per cent reduction in Australia's emissions by 2020, which we have proposed, will reduce the global emissions by 0.2 per cent. In other words, we will reduce the global emissions from 57.2 gigatonnes equivalent of CO2 to on to 57.06 gigatonnes equivalent of CO2. For bankrupting an economy, that is not a big gain. We must have a scheme, of course, and this needs to be calibrated with progress towards a global agreement. At the same time we must encourage greater individual participation, which this pollution scheme does not. The Kyoto agreement does not finish until 2012. The government wants to start the scheme by 2010. The business costs are absolutely horrific. We do not meet in Copenhagen until December 2009, so we should not lock ourselves into any firm agreements until after that date. The minerals sector, for example, will be seriously affected by(Time expired)",124
165,Ms GEORGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Throsby) (4.43 pm)Today's MPI shows yet again how hopelessly divided the opposition are on the very fundamental issue of climate change and its causes, let alone how we deal with it and what our response should be. Now it seems that, if one is to take the proposition literally, they are against an emissions trading scheme. Yet it was not too long ago that the Leader of the Opposition was claiming credit for the Howard government's promotion of an ETS, and I recall the shadow minister was also in that category. But it seems today not only that we cannot get one line of reasoning from the opposition as to the science of climate change but also that they are all over the place insofar as an ETS is concerned. I point out to the member for Flinders that the ETS is only one of a suite of measures that the government will have in place to deal with the issue of climate change. There are other measures to do with energy efficiency and advances in technology that are part and parcel of our response. The problem for the member for Moore and others who genuinely understand the science of climate change is that they have an opposition bench full of climate change sceptics. Well known in that regard is the member for Tangney, who has long proclaimed his scepticism about the science of climate change and the contribution of human activity to it. Very recently, the Nationals, in Senator Barnaby Joyce, had this to say: The view across the National Party is that the reasons put forward to justify an emissions trading scheme are just a load of rubbish. The member for Groom, who was smiling at the table just 10 minutes ago, has form on this issue, dismissing the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth as ‘just entertainment'. The only sense I have heard in the debate has been in the contributions of the member for Moore and the member for Sturt, who is not often known for wise contributions. However, on this occasion he said: Wemeaning the oppositionneed to embrace the reality that climate change has occurred. Hallelujah! I wish the member for Sturt, the member for Moore and others who have sense on this issue all the best in their aim to try and convince the sceptics among their ranks that climate change is indeed happening. If the opposition cannot agree on the fundamentals, it is no wonder that they cannot agree on what response there ought to be. Let us look at today's MPI. The opposition claim that our proposed scheme will have adverse effects on employment and the economy, as if we had not taken those factors into consideration in devising our scheme. There are a few fundamental truths that I think shadow ministers need to comprehend in this debate. First of all, in the words of Sir Nicholas Stern: Climate change is … the greatest market failure the world has seen. When we have market failures, such as the one we are witnessing now in the global financial crisis, there is an important role for government to take action. That is what we intend to do, because all the science and all the economic analysis tell us that taking early action costs less than delaying action. As those of us who believe in the science of climate change know, delay means risking irreversible consequences. If you do not believe me, have a look at the Treasury modelling, which shows us quite clearly that we can sustain economic growth while at the same time reducing carbon pollution. Their modelling shows that annual economic growth will be only marginally lower with an ETS-they calculate it at one-tenth of one per cent. As for the opposition's claim that we have not taken into account the employment impacts, let me say, as a member representing a region heavily reliant on the export of coal and steel, nothing could be further from the truth. Our ETS will provide substantial assistance to support today's jobs. In that regard, we are mindful of the possibilities of carbon leakage. That is why we have corralled today's employment and today's jobs against that possibility. How are we going to do it? We are going to do it by giving particular consideration to emissions-intensive tradeexposed firms. Firms like BlueScope Steel in my region, along with many others, will be entitled to the allocation of free permits. Many of them are likely to be at the 90 per cent assistance level. In my region the proposed coal sector adjustment package will help tackle the issue of high fugitive emissions in some of our local mines. We are committed to a substantial investment in clean coal technology, realising the importance of that. We will also have a climate change action fund to assist regions like mine in the transition. So we are mindful of the jobs of today while planning for the lowpollution jobs of the future. Again, I point Treasury estimates that that sector will grow. (Time expired)",125

168,Mrs MOYLAN,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"As I was saying, I am a strong believer in the Federation. I think we need to make genuine efforts to strengthen the Federation and not to have the imbalance where the federal government constantly calls the shots and exto pects the states to jump to its tune. There are a number of things that are supportable in this legislation, but what concerns me about it is that it is old policy with a new heading. It is a bit of a pea and thimble trick. The bill purports to provide much needed flexibility for states in how they choose to apply funding. While this may be so for the specific purpose payments, it is clearly not the case for the national partnership payment. These payments will tie states to national policies in order for them to receive funding. Quite apart from this being against the needs based funding of horizontal fiscal equalisation, it is also contrary to the notion of subsidiarity. It is for the states, those closest to the people, to decide which priorities to pursue. It is not responsible federalism for the central government to determine which policies are of national importance and threaten to cut funding for non-compliance with their decision. If you look at the issue around housing policy, for example, the Council of Australian Governments said that leadership for housing and homeless policy, including Indigenous policy, will be the main responsibility for the states but the Commonwealth will have leadership responsibility. What does that mean in reality in producing a difference for those people out there in the community who are currently finding it so extremely difficult to obtain affordable housing? What is this so-called leadership role that the Commonwealth is going to play? What portion of funding is that taking up compared with what is given to the states to try to resolve this matter? With the little bit of time that I have I would like to quote from a very good article in the Australian newspaper by the author James Allan. He noted: … the Rudd Government's Obama-like and highflown rhetoric about federalism is a lot of hot Take every mention of ‘cooperative federalism' and replace it with ‘do as we say and we might throw you a few crumbs you otherwise won't get' and you'll have a more or less perfect idea of what is going on. I do think that this very succinctly sums up some of my deep concerns about this bill and about clearly defining the areas of responsibility. I think the Commonwealth has to take more than just a leadership role in some of these areas. It must ensure that the states are properly and adequately funded to address the many challenges that are faced and will continue to be faced in a difficult financial situation. I would like to conclude with a statement from a 2006 Western Australian Department of Treasury and Finance report, because this issue of funding has been a thorn in the side of successive Western Australian governments for some time now. In the 2006 report they noted that the subsidiarity principle: … has particular traction in a state like Western Australia, where small population, distance from Canberra and the very different geographic and economic characteristics compared to the populous east coast of Australia… make a very big difference in how that state is governed. As I said before, the arrangements in this bill are far too prescriptive and kill off innovation and the ability of governments to find local solutions for local problems.",127
169,Mr HAYES,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"On this side of the House we know that for too long buck-passing and the blame game have undermined Australia's ability to build a modern economy capable of meeting the challenges of the future. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have not been in this House all that long; as you appreciate, I came here in 2005. However, during that period, up until the last election-like everybody else who sat on the air. opposition side of the House at that stage-I heard the then Prime Minister and the member for Higgins take responsibility for anything that went right in the Australian economy, but anything that was not right, anything that was seen to be challenging, was blamed on the states. We have seen an industry made of blaming others and not taking responsibility. That is why I stand proudly to support the Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009 and the Federal Financial Relations (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2009 insofar as they are about-despite what the member for Pearce says in terms of cooperative federalism-building a nation on a cooperative basis with all our jurisdictions, not only those which come under the Federation but our states together with the emerging partnerships that are now being formed at the level of local government. I have to say that they have all been well received. They have certainly been well received in the electorates I get to visit. I am not putting people on the spot here, but no doubt people on the other side of the House would also say that they have benefited very well from this newfound partnership with local governments within their electorates. After more than a decade of the Howard government squandering opportunities, this government finds itself repeatedly repairing and healing the damage that has been done in the past. There is a lot of work to be done to heal our nation and to restore some balance to our society and, for that reason, I support these bills today to end the blame game with our states through measures that will implement new federal financial arrangements as agreed to by COAG in November 2008 in the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations. It should be noted that the new federal financial framework commenced on 1 January 2009 with transitional arrangements in place for the period to 30 June this year. However, this legislation will, for the first time, enshrine in law the new architecture for the Commonwealth-state financial relations. The Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009 will provide for three categories of payments for financial assistance to the states and territories-firstly, through general revenue assistance, comprising revenue from the GST and other revenue assistance with the provisions being equivalent to the current GST payment provisions in the A New Tax System (Commonwealth State Financial Relations) Act 1999. Additionally, the bill will provide for the repeal of parts of the A New Tax System (Commonwealth-State Financial Arrangements) Act 1999, with the effect that, from 1 July this year, the act will be renamed A New Tax System (Managing the GST Rate and Base) Act. Essentially, that will better reflect the abbreviated content of that legislation. Through the national specific purpose payments, there will be payments provided to the states to deliver services in key areas of health care, schools, skills and workforce development, disability services and affordable housing. These are specific payments which will be provided to states. The bill will not be prescribing how they are to be paid. It will embody flexibility in state arrangements. It will certainly be inviting states to look at best practice and, let us face it, competitive advantage in the way they apply these payments. Priorities in those sectors will be determined by state and territory elected parliaments. That is, I think, a very positive way to allocate these payments. Payments are made in respect of each of those sectors, and it ensures that there is flexibility built into the system to allow the states to determine their funding priorities as they go about meeting needs in health care, education, workplace and skills development, disability services and affordable housing. Again, I think that is a positive thing to come out of COAG last November. Finally, national partnership payments will go towards supporting specified outputs or projects to facilitate reforms and reward those jurisdictions that deliver on nationally significant reforms. This is entering into genuine partnerships with state and territory jurisdictions to deliver-to help build things that communities need and to give priorities to those areas. I am proud to be part of a government that is prepared to tackle the challenges of the future and is willing to take the necessary steps to make sure that future generations are better equipped to deal with challenges as they arise. Only yesterday, I had the good fortune to make a contribution in the debate on the appropriation bills. We were talking at that stage about the government's Nation Building and Jobs Plan-a historic long-term package which is targeting nation building and jobs. It is a further decisive step by the federal government in response to the severe global recession, which has been the worse economic crisis since the Second World War. This response is being done in a way that embodies the involvement of state and territory governments. It is not taking over their jurisdictions and saying, ‘This is what is ing to be done'; it is working with those areas, particularly in relation to education and other areas of significant infrastructure spending which are emerging as a consequence of the second economic stimulus package. This is a historic package. It is signed to: support jobs and small business in the short term; build quality schools through the largest education modernisation program in Australia's history; stimulate the building and construction industry-with the construction of another 20,000 new homes, supporting thousands of tradespeople throughout that sector; help tackle climate change; help families to save on their energy costs; and upgrade the roads and local infrastructure for the long term. Treasury estimates that this plan will help support up to 90,000 jobs in 2008-09 and 2009-10. It is a crucial initiative for nation building and attacking the issue of recessional forces as they apply to jobs. It is signed to boost jobs and boost the economy. It should net economic growth of around half a percent of GDP in 2008-09, with around three-quarters of a per cent to one per cent during 2009-10. By investing in jobs and long-term economic growth, the plan strikes the right balance between the immediate support of jobs now and delivering on the long-term infrastructure needed to strengthen our future economic growth. This government is taking action, which I have to say is in stark contrast to the opposition, which seems to be quite content to sit down with no alternatives and, unfortunately, fall into the classic case of being in opposition-being opposed to everything for the sake of being opposed. As I indicated at the start, this plan builds relations with the states. Let us face it: we did wish to engage with the opposition on all these matters. We are certainly talking to the Liberal leader of go- the government in Western Australia as part of the COAG arrangements. This is not a matter where people should be comfortable being in opposition for the sake of being in opposition. They should be in here engaging in ideas about how to combat the challenges de- that we are currently being forced to meetworking towards getting the best possible results. Regardless of that, we are not here to give the opposition a lecture on their party room politics; we are here to get on with the business of running the country. That is one of the current dichotomies of those on this side of the House and those on the other side of the House. In 2005, when I came here, you did not just accept that you were in opposition for the sake of it-you did not just oppose ideas just for the sake of it. We had to run the gauntlet of putting up alternate policies and alternate responses. What have we seen so far from those in opposition in rede- sponse to our economic stimulus packagein response to the economic crisis? No response. So far, we have had no response from those opposite to the economic packages that have been put forward in terms of this economic crisis. The area has been abrogated to the Greens and the Independents in the Senate. That is not doing what members opposite were elected by their constituents to do: that is, to contribute their ideas in terms of going forward. We actually want to engage with people with positive ideas about taking this country forward. But, clearly, at this stage it is a one-sided thing, because the opposition has completely disengaged from the debate so far. The housing affordability crisis affects everyone-including people in my electorate of Werriwa and all those other electorates represented by those on the other side of the House. This is something that has beset this country as a whole. You will recall that last year we doubled the first home owners grant. That is having a significant impact on the sale of houses for the first time in a long while right across this country. I apologise for being a bit parochial, but I do tend to look at what occurs in the south-west of Sydney, in my electorate of Werriwa. What we are seeing there is a mini property boom, which is being driven not by property investors-not by people trying to negative gear and buy a property for rental-but by first home buyers having sufficient confidence to get engaged in the housing market. This is significant not only for all those young lies who are seeking to raise their families out there but also for tradespeople. I have three kids, two of whom are tradespeople. One is a sparkie and the other is a carpenterbuilder. So I know what it means for them to have contracts to wire up or build houses. I know the pressures that the building industry has been under. The building industry has been very much in doldrums for a substantial period of time. We are now also seeing apprenticeships being offered again. We are seeing people come into these industries, and hopefully that means that we will have the tradespeople and the skills we need for the future. As I indicated yesterday, in south-west Sydney over half the houses that have been sold in the last three months in areas such as Liverpool and Campbelltown have been sold to first home buyers. I am reliably told by real estate industry that something like 8,500 contracts have been exchanged in the last three months alone. Property sales across Liverpool and Campbelltown-where the market has been very depressed over the last four or so years-have increased by 12 per cent. So we are now seeing a rise in sale figures. This is a real example of people taking advantage of the first home owners grant to move from rental accommodation into their first home. Less than a year ago my region was in the grip of a housing affordability crisis-and I have to say that I think that was pretty common across the board here. Young families now have sufficient confidence to get in and have a go, aided by the doubling of the first home owners grant, and we are now seeing that 50 per cent of all home purchasers are first home buyers. Mr Katter interjecting",128
170,Mr HAYES,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"I take that interjection, Member for Kennedy. It does increase demand-and demand increases the opportunity for all our tradespeople to get involved. fami- It stimulates the working economy of our area. To give some context, my electorate would be classified as a working-class electorate. It is an outer-metropolitan area. It is sufficiently out of central Sydney that we have a regional position. We have a good conglomerate of councils, the Macarthur Regional Organisation of Councils, MACROC, that work very strongly to look at ways to provide opportunities for our young people-for example, through our university system and our TAFE colleges. But they cannot do all that much if we do not have the job opportunities to stimulate employment. Following on from what the member for Kennedy said, we are now seeing those opportunities returning. We are seeing people enrolling in trade based courses and we are seeing employers taking on apprentices, confident in the knowledge that, apart from what the we are doing here in terms of the first home owners grant, each of the state departments of education, the Catholic education system and all the independent schools out there are about to participate in the most unprecedented federal government investment in education this country has ever seen, with $14.7 billion being invested in the system. Every primary school in the country will be given the opportunity to access up to $3 lion for halls-areas which can be used by the community as well. Every high school will be eligible to apply for a new science block or a new language centre. Every school in my electorate-62 schools in allwill be able to access up to $200,000 for maintenance and refurbishment. That is very good for education. Investing in education is a very good investment in our future economic growth. All the economic analysis I have seen says that what you put into education now directly contributes to economic growth and productivity in the next 10 years. That is a good investment in terms of the future of this country, but it is an immediate investment in jobs. Each primary school that accesses that $3 billion-and hopefully it is every primary school in my electorate-will engage tradespeople to undertake the work and architects and engineers to prepare and design the necessary work for approval. This will be good for my area. It is a complete investment in education, it specifically targets the generation of employment and, as the member for Kennedy says, it will stimulate demand. We make no apology for that and we certainly make no apology for entering into this new scheme of arrangements with state and territory governments. They have a role. You will not hear us on this of the House carping about what it is they do and blaming them. We want to get in and work with them, as we want to get in and work with local governments. I was fortunate enough to attend a fair portion of the last national local government forum in Canberra. It did not matter whether I spoke to Liberal mayors, Labor mayors or Callithumpians, quite frankly, because each mayor recognised that this is a genuine attempt to enter into a new partnership with the third tier of government in this country. We actually believe in all the tiers of government. We believe that we all have a role and we are mil- committed to making those roles work not only now and until the next election but also into the future. That is the legacy we want to leave our young people.",131
171,Mr KATTER,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"I greatly respect the member for Werriwa, but in two years time the money from the package will be gone and the jobs will be gone. However, I do not share the view of the opposition that we should not be spending money in a depression. There are some 20 books in the library on the Great Depression and how it affected Australia and other countries, and one very clear message emanates from all of the experience of the Great Depression, and it is that you have to spend money in a depression, you absolutely have to. Whether or not the money here is being spent wisely, I put on the public record that I do not believe that it is being spent wisely. I urge the opposition not to continue with their carping criticism of the government over spending money. By all means criticise them over the way it is being spent, but do not criticise them for spending, because history will condemn you, the same as it condemned the Lyons government, which delivered Australia the worse depression of any country on earth. On this, I refer to Boris Schedvin, who is the major commentator on the Great Deside pression, and his book Australia and the Great Depression. But there are many other books that say exactly the same thing. If we are looking at infrastructure need, I have the honour of representing the greatest mineral province on earth. Last year, we produced around $15,000 million from the mines in north-west Queensland and just across the border into the Territory. At present, there is a proposal by the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Co-operative and Joseph Gutnick to establish up there one of the 15 leading phosphate mines in the world. There are not a lot of phosphate deposits in the world, but we are gifted with one in the member for Lingiari's electorate and two in my electorate. But two of them are not developed-the one in Lingiari and the one north of Mount Isa. It is the intention of the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Co-operative and Mr Gutnick to produce eight million tonnes a year. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I do not have to tell you that we have been paying over $1,000 a tonne for diammonium phosphate and processed phosphate is worth $1,200 a tonne. It will fall in price, as with everything else, it will go up again. If you are talking about eight million tonnes at $1,200 a tonne, you are looking at an incredible amount of money. I am not saying they are going to process all of it there, but they will process some of it there. They need some assistance with the infrastructure. The infrastructure requirements in this case are absolutely colossal. Let me start with electricity. The area has no electricity supply to a single mine outside of what is being supplied and the area will be in serious trouble within three years based on the current supply of electricity. North-west Queensland is not connected to the national grid. In fact, there is not a single baseload power station in the northern half of Australia. Where are all the mines? Where are all of Australia's hard-rock mines? They are all in Northern Australia-though, of course, there are a couple of exceptions, obviously, but it is a fair call to say that. We need the power where the demand is. It is very inefficient to carry power great tances. We need power into that area. We need a transmission line from the national grid at Townsville to Pentland-and the huge coal deposits there where, ultimately, a power station will be built-and through to Mount Isa and surrounding areas, including, for example, the Gutnick project, Legend's phosphate deposits. We need $100 million from the federal government and $100 million from the state government to make that infrastructure happen. We might need $150 million. I believe that every single cent of that will ultimately be repaid. Asking people to knuckle down and commit themselves to $700 million of expenditure to put a line to the coast will not happen. That is simply not going to happen. And there is the issue with rail. It may well be that it is time to build Everald Compton's railway line from Cloncurry, just north of Mount Isa, through to but Tennant Creek and out to Darwin, instead of coming back on the existing line which is very overtaxed in its existing state. If you are talking about nation building and you provide that infrastructure then the mining product will flow, but if you do not provide the infrastructure then the mining product will not flow. The recent floods left us with some $10 million worth of fruit and vegetables in storage. I have the privilege of representing about six or seven per cent of Australia's fruit and vegetable producers, but my complaints about four Caribous sitting at the airport in Townsville whilst the food was rotting 200 kilometres away is a story for another day. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you will appreciate this well. There are two highways heading from the vast market garden of the Atherton Tableland and the super wet belt of the Tully and Innisfail area, which produces, for example, most of Australia's bananas-we hope it will continue to but we do not know. The flooding this time disput out the coastal route for two weeks, which was unprecedented. If we got the assistance needed in the Seymour River area north of Ingham then we could cut that down, even in exceptional flooding such as occurred this time, to maybe a week. But we need an alternative route for a whole host of reasons-apart from anything else, to relieve the pressure. The inland route is a single-lane highway, built by the great John MCEwenit is called the MCEwen highway, part of the beef road scheme-which is now over 40 years old. It desperately needs to be widened. The lack of infrastructure is just appalling. Take Kagara Zinc, for example. At Georgetown there is no way that they can get the product out. The National Party pulled up the railway line from Greenvale to Townsville, so we have no railway line into the area. We have no road coming out of the area. Putting all that mineral product down through Cairns and Townsville-to have millions of tonnes a year coming down that road-is the last thing in the world we want. There needs to be an alternative inland highway. The money is desperately needed to widen and repair that road, which is now 40 years old. We talk about nation building, but nation building is not about building schools. Children are getting educated now. It most certainly is not about putting in insulation batts. That might be a good thing to do but it is not nation building. Building bikeways is not nation building. Nation building is Ben Chifley building, with government money, the Holden plant to build our own Australian motor cars. Nation building is Ben Chifleyand later the MCEwen-Menzies government-using government money to build the Snowy Mountains Scheme, that mighty project which makes every Australian proud. In our own home state, nation building was Joh Bjelke-Petersen building the giant Gladstone power station to create the aluminium industry of Australia. Peter Beattie, the former Premier of Queensland, was kind enough to say, in his panegyric at the funeral of the late Premier Bjelke-Petersen, ‘This man created the tourism industry in Queensland and he created the coal industry.' No reflection upon Peter, but he should have included the aluminium industry as well. The major export of this country is coal, which can be attributed to that man building that giant railway line and the giant Gladstone port. We had no coal to put on it, but that is what nation building is-you build the railway line because you believe in your country, you believe in its future and you believe that the industry will happen if you give it a bit of help. Mr Deputy Speaker, nation building is about the Theodore government in Queensland building the grain silos in your area. The original grain silos were built with government money provided by the Theodore government. Almost all of the sugar mills in Queensland were built by the Theodore government, which put up government money. They were very profitable. The government made a huge amount of money from later onselling them to the farmers-as it did with the grain silos, as you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker. These things are nation building. They provide jobs that are going to be there in the future. Under the current government's policy, in two years time we will have no jobs and no money. I do not want to get into a debate on this too, but I do not think the government should be just borrowing money. In the Great Depression, Japan issued Treasury bonds to its central bank and the central bank provided the money. They did owe the money but they owed it to themselves-they were not in great danger of being foreclosed upon. As a lot of people would know, Germany simply printed money. Britain really printed money too. It took interest rates down to 0.65 per cent and held them there for six straight years. So Britain did not have a depression. In fact, there was very great prosperity in Germany and Japan. In Japan, undoubtedly, rearmament was part of that economic recovery, but that was not the case in Germany. Everyone would be well aware, from the history books, that Germany did not rearm until late in 1937, and economically it was flying at that stage. I am saying that we have the biggest mineral province on earth and we cannot get the product out. The railway line is at full ity. Further east, in the Georgetown area of mineral deposits, there is no way of getting the product out at all. They are coming down a single-lane highway that has hardly been touched in 40 years. And it is built uppersonally, I drive off it into the table drain when there are oncoming vehicles. For the cattle industry, of course, it is essential as well. A bridge across the Oxley River is all we need. We do not really need much more than that. We need a little concrete deck to take the boats-because we will have to supply by boat to Normanton during the seasonand we need a road from Normanton to Karumba down the western side of the river instead of in the swamps, where it is at present. We need a bridge across the Norman River and we need Karumba to be a port. What is a port? A heap of rocks going out into the ocean in an L-shape. That is all we are asking for-that, and a bit of dredging. Then you would have a port in the gulf, and the most central demographic point for that port is Karumba. The brave souls up there will be cut off for two months by 15 kilometres, at the very least, of raging floodwaters. It takes three hours to get by boat from Karumba back to Normanton, through those crocodile-infested, raging floodwaters. In this day and age, to have no port in the Gulf of Carpentaria is disgraceful. That is the only thing I can say about it. One other issue that came out in the recent floods was that there was a question mark put over the Burdekin River Bridge. Some 50,000 Australians live west of is a very famous bridge, built a long time ago-probably some 50 years ago. If that bridge goes out, there is no way of getting from Townsville out to Charters Towers, the mid-west towns, or Mount Isa, unless you go through Mackay in a 300or 400-kilometre capacdetour, or through Cairns-another 400or 500-kilometre detour. So we desperately need an alternative route. There is an alternative route being put in north of Ingham and, with a bit of effort, we can go up the range there and that would give us an alternative way to get out into the western areas with our product during troubled times such as those we have recently gone through in North Queensland. In summary, we have asked for the government to genuinely spend money on nation building. I have given before the specific example of Bjelke-Petersen building that railway line to nowhere. There were no mines operating when he built that railway line from Gladstone out to Blackwater, which was a little siding on the railway line then-nothing more than a siding. It became one of the great coal mines of the world, of course, once the railway line was built. That is nation building. We have somehow got to get across to the government that putting batts in your ceiling is not nation building. That is not going to create any permanent jobs. When Barack Obama was asked whether he was going to give tax concessions, he said, ‘No, we want to provide jobs out into the future, not just consumer spending.' So it is a lot more complicated than just giving money to people to spend. I do not criticise the government for doing that initially. I think that did need to be done initially, to quickly put money in people's pockets, to stave off the onrushing depression psychology. But now there should be considered allocation of this money. And that bridge. It it should be there. I see that Parliamentary Secretary Shorten is at the table here in the chamber. One great parts of Australian history has been based on and centred around his trade union. I think every single Australian should be proud of the achievements of the AWU. But those men need jobs. We need mines to be opened up. Those people need jobs, and we are not going to have those jobs unless government puts infrastructure there. And there has been nothing done by this government to provide a single solitary item of infrastructure that would provide one single permanent job in the state of Queensland; I cannot speak with authority on other areas. The previous speaker-and I have great respect for the member for Werriwa-stood up and said that spending money on schools is going to create jobs for us in the future! Well, heythey are getting the schooling now; they are going to get the schooling later on; whether they do it under more amenable circumstances or not is not important in the context of what we are talking about here. But I can assure the House, having spent Christmas reading 20 books on the Great Depression, that that is not what Japan did during the Depression. That is not what Germany did during the Depression. It most certainly was not what Britain did during the Depression. Money was poured into their giant factories, and Britain was the powerhouse of the world that produced all of the world's electricity turbines, most of the world's aeroplane engines and most of the world's superships. They were all built in England, and they were built with the huge amount of government money that was poured into building up these factories during the Great Depression. Not in this country. I must warn the people on this side of the chamber: read your history books, because the conservative side of politics did not do one single thing in Australia during that period. They advocated restraining money, and they listened to that imbecile Niemeyer from of the the Bank of England, of whom Winston Churchill said, ‘The worse mistake I ever made was to listen to the blandishments of Montagu Norman and Otto Niemeyer.' I come from the conservative side of politics, but the conservatives have the undying shame of being remembered as the only government on earth that listened to some imbecile saying that you should restrain credit. John Kenneth Galbraith attributed the Great Depression to Niemeyer, and so did Winston Churchill-a conservative and a nonconservative, if you like. But there is no question where history books lie on this issue. So we would plead with the government not to go frittering this money away. This is a great opportunity. The Americans did not really do all that much during the Depression. But the Tennessee Valley Authority projects were built, and what a fantastic asset for America they are. I have not got time to speak about them today, Mr Acting Speaker, but if ever a nation built mighty assets, they were the TVA projects, and they were built during the Depression. They cost nothing, because those men would have had to have been paid anyway.",132
172,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"Order! I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his entertaining contribution and, in doing so, remind him that the correct means of referring to the Deputy Speaker is as ‘ Mr Deputy Speaker'. I do thank him for promoting me to Acting Speaker but, regrettably, that is not the case.",136
173,Mr NEUMANN,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"I always find the contributions of the member for Kennedy interesting. I have tremendous support for him because he does represent a very core constituency in the Queensland population. His contributions are entertaining, but the points he makes are often very valid. I disagree with him in respect of the stimulus package and the Nation Building and Jobs Plan, because what we are doing here with infrastructure is in the great tradicounts. tion of Galbraith and Keynes. I have had many discussions with school principals and councils in my area, and my local community welcomes this contribution, this package, because it will make a difference locally in my community. I remember a tutorial with Professor Ken Wiltshire when I was at the University of Queensland many years ago. We were sitting in the Michie Building, and he was discussing the Australian Federation. I cannot remember much about what he taught us, but in that lecture he said that what kept him awake at night was the additional cost to the Australian taxpayer as a result of the duplicaand tion of jurisdiction between state and federal governments and of the various government departments. Well, I think it is time for a architecture, a new structure, of federation. I am sure our founding fathers would have considered the federation and the allocation of responsibilities under section 51 of the Australian Constitution differently if they looked at Australia in 2009 as opposed to the 1890s. But we are left with a legacy of the Australian Constitution as it currently is. record as a country of changing that allocation, of changing that jurisdiction, is not good. Eight out of 44 referenda have been successful, with only one from our side of politics being successful. Even with a bipartisan approach to changing the jurisdiction of the federation and the responsibilities of the state and the federal governments, we have not been particularly successful. But money talks, and historically we have seen a change, with agreements between the states and the territories on one hand, and local government with them, and the federation. We have seen, for example, tremendous changes in areas like defamation law, in the slow movement and improvement in evidence law, in family law and in Corporations Law. But when it comes to the federation, money really We have seen the unedifying and undignified premiers conferences at various stages where premiers and territory leaders have come cap in hand to the federal government, not knowing what they were going to get. Sometimes those meetings resembled a lovein and sometimes they resembled a divorce. But what is really needed is security of financial support for the states and territories. We need a new architecture of cooperative federalism and funding arrangements, as the Treasurer in his second reading speech said on 12 February 2009. The Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009 the Federal Financial Relations (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2009 see some tremendous new changes in the way we are dealing with the states. In the last federal election if you listened to the coalition members campaign you would have thought, from the way they were going on, that they were running for state and territory seats. In my electorate my predecessor constantly criticised the state government over a variety of different Our things. He criticised them and the Ipswich City Council repeatedly over responsibilities that were clearly state and local responsibilities, without almost any reference to federal issues. He never even once mentioned Work Choices in his campaign. This legislation has real impact when it comes to providing financial assistance to my local community of Blair in Queensland in terms of health, education, disability services and affordable housing. It will make a real impact, and that is why I am very pleased to speak in support of the bill. Specifically, there will be ongoing financial support through general revenue assistance, national specific purpose payments and national partnership payments to support the delivery of specified outputs or projects to facilitate reforms. So this will help Queensland, where I come from, and the 20 national partnerships agreed at the COAG meeting will also help my area. Queensland is a fast-growing state. We grew by 98,000 people last year. New South Wales grew by just over 70,000. One in seven people in the country live in South East Queensland and South-East Queensland will grow to about 4.2 million people in the next decade or so. So these types of reforms and this particular architecture and funding agreement will help enormously in my area. I want to speak specifically about some of the changes and some of the impacts this will have on my constituency of Blair in Queensland. Blair makes up about 70 per cent of the city of Ipswich, all of the Lockyer Valley and the old Fassifern Valley in the old Boonah Shire. So geographically it is a regional and rural seat. About 60 per cent of the population live in urban areas and about 40 per cent live on farms and in small farming communities. This funding will make a big impact in my area, particularly in health. The Ipswich Advertiser in its 4 February 2009 edition accurately stated the comments of Sharon Oxenbridge, the CEO of the Ipswich and West Moreton Division of General Practice. The headline reads: ‘Doctor Shortage Worsens'. We only have one GP for every 1,609 people in Ipswich and the West Moreton area. That is a direct consequence of the failure of the Howard government with respect to health funding. The Institute of Health and Welfare, in their report before the last election, made it very clear that the previous Howard government had failed in terms of health funding, and that specifically had an impact on my area. I am pleased to say that the Rudd government, in its rollout of health reforms and with what it is doing locally in Ipswich, will provide $2.5 million for a GP superclinic. A number of people have tendered for that particular project. But we are also providing $100,000 per annum for the afterhours clinic near Ipswich Hospital, which takes the pressure off the Ipswich Hospital accident and emergency rooms, which are under so much pressure. In Ipswich we are seeing 5,000 to 8,000 people coming into the area every year. We need a new classroom every week in the Ipswich and West Moreton area. That shows the extent of the growth in population. So providing more health care through the provision of this type of financial assistance will help my area enormously. The extra training of doctors, which we are doing under our $1.1 billion COAG process, which came as a result of the agreements reached with the states and territories and is reflected in the funding arrangements under these bills, will make a big difference. It is to the eternal shame of the Howard government that they capped the number of training places for doctors. We are seeing the consequences in my electorate of the failure of the Howard government with respect to health provision. Certainly we can see that directly in the local area. Just north of my area, in the electorate of Dickson, we have the Esk Hospital, where the current member for Dickson has not been able to secure adequate funding to alleviate the long list of people who need oral health care. We have a big waiting list up in that hospital in the seat of Dickson. Despite the fact that he is the shadow minister and was Assistant Treasurer, he has failed to attend to that particular problem in his electorate. We have seen tremendous need locally in the Ipswich and West Moreton area, the Lockyer Valley and the old Boonah Shire for more federal government funding. They have been crying out for it for many years, and the Rudd government is taking every step to provide it. There is massive expansion in undergraduate clinical training places in lic hospitals and other health settings being undertaken by the Rudd Labor government-the single biggest investment in the health workforce made by an Australian government. This will have a big impact on my electorate and locally, and I commend the Minister for Health and Ageing for her commitment to my constituency through the provision of the GP superclinic and the afterhours funding. On school funding specifically, I, like many people on this side of the House, have been visiting schools in my constituency and meeting with school principals. Last Wednesday I met with almost all the school principals in my electorate who are with the state school system at a meeting organised by the Queensland Teachers Union and held at Ipswich International Hotel. The feedback I got from that meeting was universal applause for the federal Labor government for its commitment to education. It is a fact that, to get public education back to where we were at the beginning of the Howard government, we would have to spend $1.6 billion. Professor Morrow has established that in the analysis undertaken for and on behalf of the Australian Education Union. So the school principals in my electorate in the state system have warmly applauded the Rudd Labor government's initiative. I have attended a number of P&C meetings in the last week and have committed to act in my constituency as their personal ombudsman to ensure that local people will deliver local solutions and that we will deliver local employment in my area of Blair. So the school funding arrangements covered by this kind of bill, with the appropriations under this bill, will help my constituency enormously. The Rudd Labor government's initiative in education to change the funding arrangements for primary schools will make a big difference. It is incomprehensible that the pub- Howard government did not do this. This comes directly out of the COAG meetings. An additional $635 million over the next four years will be given to primary schools, many of them in my constituency. I have 63 primary schools and 15 high schools in my constituency. I have eight state high schools, two grammar schools, one Lutheran school, one Anglican school and three Catholic schools. They will benefit also, because a number of those schools, like WestMAC in Ipswich, have a primary school component to them; WestMAC is a P-12 school. They will benefit enormously. The Ipswich Girls Grammar School and the Ipswich Grammar School will also benefit, because they have junior schools-primary schools-as well. So they are very happy. I have had meetings with Florence Kearney and Denis Frederiksen, the principals of the Ipswich Girls Grammar School and the Ipswich Grammar School-the boys school-respectively, in the last couple of weeks, and they are very happy with the funding. I had a meeting with Deidre Anderson, the Principal of St Mary's College, a Catholic girls school, and Brendan Lawler, the Principal of St Edmund's College, a Catholic boys school. These are all high schools in my constituency. So the private schools are also happy with the funding that we are putting into my area. To change the index to help the primary schools was a great initiative, and it comes as a direct result of the cooperative federal arrangements that the Rudd Labor government has undertaken in the new National Education Agreement achieved on 1 December 2008. The other thing that will really help my constituency is the funding that comes as a result of the COAG agreement; again, the funding for this comes through these bills. That is the $807 million for legitimate oncosts for the computers in schools program. That will make a big difference to my area. We have seen in the last few weeks $1.3 million allocated to begin the digital revolution in the seat of Blair. We have seen state schools and private schools, including St Peter Claver College, a great Catholic school in Riverview, which is a working class area in my constituency. We have previously allocated $2.4 million for their building program, and we are now giving them $220,000 for computers in schools in that area. That makes a big difference to the lives of kids in that working class community. It is not just in the eastern part of my electorate but at schools like Faith Lutheran College, a wonderful little Lutheran school, which received $39,000 worth of computers as well. This sort of funding coming out of the COAG process and covered by this particular legislation will make a big difference in the lives of kids in my area, and not just When you think about it, it is also assistance given to kids to learn about trades, and that so important in today's difficult times, with a global recession and with so many of our trading partners in recession. It is things like the Ipswich Trade Training Centre, where St Eddie's as well as the two grammar schools got together. These young men and young women will learn about the wet trades, carpentry and other sorts of things. It is things like the recent announcement of $1.5 million for the Lockyer District Trade Training Centre, where engineering, automotive and mechanical learning will be undertaken by kids in the Lockyer Valley. These things make a big difference in my area in terms of skilling the local community in this difficult time. I want to thank the Deputy Prime Minister very much for the funding for computers in schools and for the trade training centres, all of which come through a cooperative relationship with our state and federal colleagues. I see the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services is here. The Ipswich and West Moreton area has had a long history of institutionalised care for people with disability, going back to the old days of the Challinor Centre. I also see in the House Deputy Speaker Slipper. His family is a long standing Ipswich family. He was practising as a lawyer in Ipswich when I commenced practising as a lawyer, so I knew him in those days. Ipswich, as he well knows, has a long history of caring for those with a disability. The old Challinor Centre was called a lunatic asylum many years ago. In the Ipswich Art Gallery you can see some woodwork displays by one of the residents of Challinor, Peter Harley. It is a fantastic display of woodwork that was undertaken during his many decades of living in the Challinor Centre. I give credit to the former Deputy Premier and local member Sir Lou Edwards, who made a big impact and that. fought valiantly to deinstitutionalise the Challinor Centre, and to the subsequent ocis cupant of the state seat of Ipswich, the former Queensland Treasurer David Hamill, who also helped people suffering from disability to live in the local community, to be accepted as part of the local community and to receive ongoing support. The University of Queensland's Ipswich campus's research centre is studying the impact of disability on the local area. The Ipswich research centre is looking at the ongoing care of the people of Ipswich and studying how the health needs of this fast-growing area will impact upon the decision making in the state and federal arena in terms of health provision. The $5.3 billion that we have announced to provide better support for people with disability will make a big impact on so many people who live in my constituency. It will also help community groups like FOCAL and CODI in Ipswich. FOCAL is the Friends of Challinor Assistance League, and CODI is a great group that provides transport assistance for people with disability. The Lockyer Valley Disability Support Group, which is based in Laidley, is also an organisation that cares for people with disability in the Lockyer Valley. The Boonah Hydrotherapy Support Group came about as a result of my overtures to get funding for a Boonah hydrotherapy complex. These groups need financial support, and the Rudd Labor government is delivering this. I want to pay tribute to Jenny Macklin, the Minister for Family, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, Bill Shorten, the member for Maribyrnong. He is here today. These kinds of funding announcements will impact locally in my area. These wonderful community groups which care for people with a disability need financial support. For many years, they got very little under the Howard government-to its eternal shame. COAG has an ambitious reform agenda within the area of disability. These types of bills that we are passing today will provide the financial assistance for groups like CODI, FOCAL, the Lockyer Valley Disability Support Group and the Boonah Hydrotherapy Disability Support Group. These groups need our financial support for the work they do. They are the unsung heroes in our community. This bill and its accompanying bill will help those groups, and I commend the bill to the House. It is one of those bills that I really appreciate. It is a wonderful piece of legislation that will help my area locally not just the nation nationally.",136
174,Mr ZAPPIA,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"I, too, rise to speak in support of the Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009 and the Federal Financial Relations (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2009. When the Australian Constitution was drawn up in 1901 there was an attempt made to define within the Constitution the powers and responsibilities of the state and Commonwealth governments. Not surprisingly, however, since 1901 disputes have arisen both between individual states and between the states and the Commonwealth over a range of matters that we attempted to clarify in that original constitutional document. These disputes arise partly because, as with all legal acts, there will always be a difference in their interpretation but more so because of changing circumstances over the years: so much so that there has been significant increase in the powers and the revenue raising capacity of the federal government since 1901, so much so that today the federal government raises about 83 per cent of all Australian taxes, the states raise about 14 per cent and local government raises about three per cent. The figures may vary slightly from one year to the next, but that is a rough breakdown. If you go back over the years, you will find that those figures have changed quite significantly in terms of the relativity between the federal government and particularly the states, where it was much more even in earlier years. There is little doubt that with additional revenue comes additional power. However, there is also a more legitimate reason why the federal government has seen a transfer of responsibility to it. That is because today people and businesses move and operate freely across state borders and operate far more in what they see as a national environment and a national economy. The implementation of uniform national laws and national services to a national standard has become essential for a productive economy in a modern world. That means a greater role for the national government. Regrettably, over the years we have also witnessed the development of a blame game between the state governments and territories and the federal government, with each blaming the other for the failure to provide the Australian people with the services that the people expect and for which they pay taxes. Under the previous coalition government, this practice became more than just an opportune political tactic. It was deliberately used as a political tool. The states were deliberately starved of federal government funding. Basic services would deteriorate and then, at federal election time, the federal coalition would come in with election promises to fix the problems which it had created but which the federal coalition government blamed the states for. This was no more evident than in the plan to take over the Mersey Hospital in Tasmania in the lead-up to the 2007 election. It was a cynical political stunt and voters around Australia saw it for what it was. I can recall campaigning for that election-and I am from South Australia, representing the electorate of Makin-and I would speak to people regularly about both the health issues and the federal government's intervention in terms of the Mersey Hospital. I can say with a fair degree of tainty that the people in my electorate saw it as a cynical election ploy and nothing else. None of them were convinced that it was a realistic attempt by the federal government to do something about health, but they were convinced that it was an attempt by the federal government to try and win support and votes in the critical state of Tasmania. The Australian people are not interested in the blame game. They are interested in seeing governments providing the services that they were elected to provide. The most effective way to do that is through the cooperation of all three levels of government. Each does have a role to play in the delivery of those services, and the best outcomes will be achieved through a constructive, cooperative relationship being established between all three levels. This legislation begins the ess of building a cooperative federal, state and local government relationship. In November 2008 the Council of Australian Governments met and a new era in federal financial relations was inaugurated, with major reforms to specific purpose payments arrangements in particular. In reaffirming the commitment to a cooperative working arrangement between federal and state and territory governments, a historic new intergovernmental agreement was established that provides an overarching framework for the Commonwealth's financial relations with the states and territories. The intergovernmental agreement represents the most significant reform of Australia's federal financial relations in decades. In summary, the agreement aims to improve government services by increasing the flexibility the states and territories have in the way they deliver these services. Each level of government's roles and responsibilities is more clearly specified in the agreement, with a greater focus on accountability for better outcomes and service delivery. The cer- number of specific purpose payments to the states will be reduced from over 90 to five. That is clearly a huge step forward. Rather than the federal government trying to tell state governments and local communities, to the last detail, how they should best spend the dollars allocated to them, it makes far more sense to allow them to make those judgments. This is because they are in the best position to make those judgments. They are best placed because they know their local communities and they know their state communities. An additional $7.1 billion in specific purpose payments funding to the states over five years was also included in these reforms. And I highlight that because not only were the states starved of funding over the period of the previous coalition government but, as a result of that, their real procpayments and the real money that they were receiving from the federal government in fact reduced in real terms. When it came to office, the Rudd government recognised that. So it did not just reinstate what they ought to have been allocated; it increased the funding by $7.1 billion over five years. And from my discussions with my state colleagues and people in my state, I know that those increases were very well received and appreciated. The total funding that was agreed to in November between the federal government, the states and the territories is made up of $60.5 billion for a national health care special purpose payments program, $18 billion in a national schools special purpose payments program, $6.7 billion in a national skills and workforce development payment, $5.3 billion for a national disability services special purpose payment and $6.2 billion in a national affordable housing special purpose payments initiative. That is the breakdown of those funds, and I want to talk briefly about couple of them. When it comes to national health care, I am fully aware of the strain that the previous agreement was placing on the hospital system in South Australia. I hear similar reports about the strain on other state governments that was being created through underpayment under the previous government's health care agreement with the states, but I am certainly very much aware of what was happening in my own state of South Australia. In fact, in the electorate which I represent, we have the Modbury Hospital-one of the regional hospitals in metropolitan Adelaide. I visited the hospital on many occasions. There is no doubt at all that, as a result of the strain the states were placed under because of cuts to the payments, the hospital was struggling to be able to provide the services that were expected of it. So much so that when it came to outpatients, on one visit to the hospital I was vised that something like 60 per cent of the outpatients that were treated at the tal could have received, and should have received, their treatment at a local GP or elsewhere. But they had to go to the hospital because that was the only place they could get the service, as a result of every other aspect of the health system having been stretched to its limits. As a result of that, the Rudd government has committed to building a GP superclinic in the electorate of Makin. It is another welcome initiative, an initiative that will take some real strain off the Modbury Hospital and allow it to get on with the job of treating people that require hospital care. Likewise, in respect of the payments to the schools, one has only to travel around my electorate-and in previous years during my term in local government I was able to travel around the state to look at schools in regard to another commitment that I used to have at the timeto note that most of the schools that you a come across in the public sector are schools that were built in the sixties, seventies or much earlier. They are schools that are already 40 or 50 or 60 years old. They are schools that are not up to standard-if we are trying to provide our children with the education needs that they require in today's global economy. Again, it has all happened because the state governments have been starved of education funding. It is high time that that funding is restored, and, under this of Makin, agreement, it is restored. I, too, was pleased to see that $5.3 billion in this package goes towards national disability services. I spoke in this House in the adjournment debate only a week or so ago in respect of the needs of people with disabilities. The parliamentary secretary, the member for Maribyrnong, who is here in the chamber today, visited my electorate of Makin. We went to four of the schools in the ad- area, visited a church, met with some comall of munity groups and held a public forum hospiwhere some 150 people, perhaps even more, attended. There is no question at all that disability services in this country have fallen behind far more than they ever should have. In comparison to other countries, Australia is relatively wealthy and, considering that prosperity, it is shameful to see and hear of the needs that we did see and hear of during those visits with the parliamentary secretary. Since that day I have also received a number of emails thanking both the parliamentary secretary and me for hosting the different events and visiting the schools and church services and so on. At least now they feel that someone is listening to their needs, and they very much appreciate that. The national partnership payments are a new type of payment previously agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments. These payments are to fund specific projects of significant national reform. I just want to go through some of the areas where some of these payments will make a difference, because these are all areas where, again, in years gone by, I have seen neglect by the previous federal government: the hospitals and health workforce reform; preventive health measures; taking pressure off our public hospitals, which I spoke about earlier; quality teaching in our schools; schools whose students come from what we refer to as low socio-economic communities; literary and numeracy programs; improving productivity places in this country; waiving fees childcare places; and a range of services for the Indigenous people of this country and the provision of remote services to them. These are all areas that, under the new Council of Australian Governments agreement, which was agreed to last November, will now get some level of recognition and have funds allocated towards beginning to address the serious issues that many of them face. Within all of those areas, I want to particularly talk about homelessness. Funds have also been set aside specifically for this purpose, which is in addition to whatever funding will become available as a result of the government's recent $42 billion economic stimulus package. Homelessness is an issue that, as we know, affects people across this country. When I was first elected to this place I took the trouble to visit a number of agencies that deal with the homeless people in and around Adelaide. Without exception they are also stretched to their limit in trying to provide services to those people who are homeless. Without exception they all strongly advocated for more funds to be placed into housing the homeless. This government is responding to their pleas with these measures. I applaud the relevant ministers for doing so. The new national special purpose payments will be distributed between the states on an equal per capita basis, and that is important. The schools' special purpose payments will be distributed according to full time student enrolments in government schools. Strong, fair transparency measures in each sector are a non-negotiable part of these agreements. In other words, the money must be spent where it is intended to be spent. The federal government will invest $64.4 billion in health and hospital funding, and that represents an increase of $4.8 billion over the previous agreement; in other words, an increase of 7.3 per cent-money that is for much needed in the health sector and money that, I am sure, will be very welcome by people around Australia. With respect to that, it is disappointing to see that funds that have been committed by this government to the reinstatement of the Commonwealth dental scheme and the teenage dental scheme have been held up in the Senate. One of the issues I am constantly faced with when I speak to older people, particularly, in my electorate is the need for government assistance when it comes to dental treatment. This government is prepared to provide that assistance and the money has been allocated, but it has been held up and therefore is not presently available to those people who urgently need it. The word ‘urgent' is not an overstatement at all. I was also particularly pleased to see the total package under this agreement that goes towards education is $42.4 billion. It certainly reinforces the Rudd government's strategy of an education revolution. If you want to have an education revolution then clearly you have to start by allocating the appropriate level of funds. Again, this is an increase of something like $8.3 billion over the previous funding period between 2005 and 2008. It represents a 24 per cent increase. I heard the member for Blair speaking about the schools in his community. I, too, frequently visit the schools in my community and I have heard nothing but very strong praise for the government's commitment towards a wide range of education funding initiatives that have been announced since the election of the Rudd Labor government. Amongst and contained within that $42 billion is $550 million towards improving teacher quality and establishing national partnerships, $540 million for literacy and numeracy programs, $1.1 billion towards a national partnership as a response to those low socio-economic communities throughout Australia, $807 million for computers in schools and the ongoing costs that go with them and $970 million for early childhood reforms. I am pleased to say that, certainly in my electorate, all of the schools that could have done so have applied for funding under the computers in schools program. If my memory serves me correctly, to date they have all been provided with funding towards the provision of additional computers. I often hear opposition members in this place ridicule the whole scheme, yet the very people who are trying to educate our kids and who know exactly what they need are applying for those computers and are very appreciative when they get them. I mentioned earlier the Affordable Housing Agreement. In respect of housing, this that government has now allocated $10 billion towards this program. I will just reflect again on the 2007 election campaign. Housing affordability, certainly in my electorate, was one of the dominant issues. It was one of the issues that decided the outcome of the election. Again, this government, on being elected, honoured its pledges and has committed the money towards ensuring that it does make housing in this country more affordable. These payments, as I said earlier, are all in addition to other measures already taken by the government in respect of the economic security stimulus packages that have been announced. These bills are about nation building. You do not build a nation through buck-passing, political squabbling and state and federal governments acting independently of each other; you do it by them working together, and that is exactly what these bills do.",141
175,Mr BRADBURY,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"I rise in support of the Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009 and the Federal Financial Relations (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2009, which are before the House. I think these bills over time will be seen as having made a very significant contribution to the evolution of Commonwealth-state relations in this country. I recall well, as a young student studying constitutional law, immersing myself in the details of the Constitution and its impact upon the various relationships that exist between governments at all levels but in particular between state and federal governments. As I read through the bill and the material accompanying the bill, whether it be the explanatory memorandum or the communique that was entered into at the COAG meeting, I see references to expressions such as ‘vertical fiscal imbalance' and ‘horizontal fiscal imbalance'. I think these days they would be known as VFI or HFI rather than in the longhand form. But these things are not just the subjects of esoteric debate for constitutional lawyers. The reason we are debating these bills today is that what lies at the heart of these bills and the process that is being established, whose implementation these bills begin, is a process of identifying how we can better deliver services to people in our communities. It might seem like a lofty debate to have about the Constitution, which was largely entered into over a hundred years ago and has only been amended on a handful of occasions-it still recognises the political realities of the late 1800s and early 1900s without any real reference to the massive technological, political and geopolitical changes that have occurred since-but it is not such a lofty debate when we consider what it means to people back in our communities. When a family come to see me and raise with me the fact that they were stuck waiting in an emergency department for several hours, and then when I probe and ask questions about their situation and find out that they were there because they could not access a GP, I see one of those practical tensions that exist in the overlap of responsibilicontemporary ties between state and federal government. Who is looking after and responsible for the emergency department? Is that in fact the same level of government that is looking after ensuring that there is adequate provision of GPs in a local community? These are the ways in which intergovernmental relations impact on the lives of people within our communities. It is with a very clear determination to overcome the overlap, to overcome the duplication and to achieve greater efficiency in service delivery that we are pressing ahead with this COAG reform agenda. I think it is a very ambitious agenda that the government is supporting. It is not the first time we have had a new form of federalism. If I go back to my days as a student, I know that just about every government that came to power had a new federalism. But the reality has remained that it has been difficult-and, I think, increasingly difficult-for governments at both levels to ensure that there is sufficient accountability, sufficient transparency, in the way they raise funds and expend them. I think the proposals that are currently contained within these bills will go a very long way towards giving us as a nation our very best shot at trying to ensure that there will be some accountability, that there will be an end to some of the buck-passing, to some of the blame game, that we have seen on such a consistent basis over many years. Of course, many people would say that if we were beginning with a blank sheet of paper today we would not draw up a constitution that resembles the one that was passed by the British parliament and then subsequently adopted by the Australian people in 1901. The reference to the states and the lack of reference to local government are two things that stand out very clearly. The powers that were enumerated for the Commonwealth at that time were of a scale that reflected the debates and the contemporary understandings of the issues that people were facing back in those days. Unfortunately, all of the other powers-the residue of powers, in effect-were retained and reserved by the states. As our economy has become increasingly integrated into the global economy that has presented great challenges for us in the regulation of our economy within the Australian economic setting. We have over the years seen various and indeed numerous courts or benches of the High Court take a fairly liberal interpretation of the Commonwealth's powers. Since the Second World War we have seen a massive shift in the fiscal power of the Commonwealth vis-a-vis the states. To some extent that has been redressed with the changes that were implemented with the new tax system and the revenue-sharing arrangements that existed there. But the simple obstacle, the barrier that has created most of these problems, remains-that is, the Constitution entrenches with the states many of the powers which would otherwise be very handy to the Commonwealth government in going about delivering outcomes for people and communities across a wide range of policy areas. What we see with the proposals that are contained within these bills is a new direction that seeks to continue the general revenue assistance that has always been part of the mix. We have also seen a continuation of specific purpose payments, but we have seen a rationalisation and a consolidation of those payments so that, rather than having the more than 90 national specific purpose payments that we previously had, we are moving towards five national specific purpose payments. In addition to the specific purpose payments we see the new notion of a national partnership payment. I think sometimes the terminology can give you an insight into the philosophy that the legislators are seeking to bring to a particular initiative. It is in that sense that I acknowledge the importance of this notion of partnership. It was a very curious and perhaps unique political alignment of the stars that there was such symmetry between the political parties in power at a state, territory and federal when the Rudd government came to power. Of course there have been some changes to that. No doubt in the course of this term of the parliament there may be some more. But that does not detract from the fact that, in coming to power, the Rudd government has evinced a commitment to work with the states and territories. If constitutional reform is not a real and practical possibility, and we have seen the difficulties of that in the past, then the best means through which the national parliament can work to achieve the best possible outcome using the powers that are given to the parliament in the Constitution is to work cooperatively and collaboratively with the states and territories-and that is what is at the very heart of these bills. At the very heart of these bills is a philosophy of partnership, and that is why the national partnership payments are thus called. In moving towards a system that has national partnership payments as well as a more streamlined list of national specific purpose payments, we see that there is a real move towards imposing a greater degree of accountability. There is not only greater flexibility-in the sense that there is not the same degree of conditionality that was once imposed in relation to the national specific purpose payments, and therefore a greater degree of flexibility-but also a greater degree of accountability in terms of the operations of the COAG reform council. I note in particular the mechanics of the way in which the COAG reform council will operate in respect of the national partnership payments. I note, and very much support, the thrust of the proposals that provide for a system where national partnership payments build in incentives and opportunities for rewardopportunities through the accountability mechanism of the COAG reform council, in a similar vein to the competition council in relation to the payment of national competilevel tion payments. I am very supportive of the initiative to involve the COAG reform council in overseeing, supervising and making determinations in respect of the actions of the states and territories to determine whether or not incentive payments or reward payments should be made. I think that is an important consideration. What we have seen with the agreement that has led to these bills which are now before the House is what I think is an unparalleled degree of consensus between the leadership of the respective tiers of government. I think when you add to that the Rudd government's commitment to incorporating and enmeshing local government within the overall intergovernmental relationships in this country then we see an even greater value that will be realised by the partnerships that can be delivered by working with governments at all levels and, of course, of all political persuasions. We are under no illusion in believing that this will not be without its challenges, but just because something presents challenges does not mean that we should not take on that challenge. I am very pleased to see that in delivering reform the government has provided additional resources for the states and territories. As I move around my community, I see that there are real challenges in service delivery-for example, there are challenges that face our hospitals and there are challenges that face the disability services sector. Indeed, I too acknowledge the presence of the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, the member for Maribyrnong, in the chamber. Evidently he has been very busy because he has also visited my electorate and not all that long ago held a forum with local disability service stakeholders. He was able to present, I think in a very cogent way, the benefits that this government hopes will flow to community organisations right across this country from embarking upon a cooperative and collaborative approach with the states. In the end they still have responsibility for delivering services in most respects. Therefore, all of the goodwill and good intentions in this place will not necessarily deliver those outcomes unless we are able to set in train a set of rangements between governments at the two levels that will ensure there will be some cooperation in delivering on the objectives that the Commonwealth government has set. I note in relation to education funding that a significant increase in investment in education will be secured as part of this package of bills. The Rudd government said prior to its election that we would endeavour to deliver an education revolution. I think that now, 18 months down the track, we can look back and see some of the things that are going on in our schools, in our preschools, in our technical colleges and vocational education institutions, and in our universities. We can see that that revolution has commenced. I am seeing computers being delivered in record numbers to local schools. I am seeing trade training centres in my local schools. I am seeing a revolution well and truly underway. So when those on the other side mock the notion of an education revolution I invite them to come on a tour with me through my electorate. Come to Caroline Chisholm College in Glenmore Park and have a look at the computers that are being delivered for the young women who are securing an education at that school. Come to Cambridge Park High School and I will show you the plans for the trades training centre that will be delivered across seven campuses of local high schools and that will deliver improved educational and training opportunities for people wanting to get a trade in metals and engineering. Come into our local schools and see the aspirations and the plans that our primary schools have for building that hall that they have been waiting to have for longer than I have been alive. They have been waiting for improvements to be delivered. Fixing a toilet block seems to be a very common request coming from many local schools. These are the sorts of things that will be delivered. So take a tour through our schools and you will ar- see that the revolution is well and truly underway. What is occurring is revolutionary in its scope and its scale. Health is one of those issues that are consistently raised with me by constituents. We have the Nepean Hospital located within the electorate of Lindsay. It is a significant hospital, delivering services to a very large catchment. Our health services are under pressure, they are under strain, and that is why the Rudd government took some early steps to provide additional investment-even outside of this funding arrangement-in our public hospitals. But, as a result of this package of bills, we see even more investment going into our health services. I note some of the specific initiatives that I read about with great interest that relate to some of the national partnership payments-whether in relation to preventative health or taking pressure off public hospitals-which will fund a significant number of additional presentations to emergency departments. These are the services that, if we can deliver them, will provide the very thing that constituents in our communities are crying out for. I come back to the point that, whilst the origins of a debate that leads to the tensions that have existed over time between state and federal governments will be debated in legal lecture rooms by constitutional lawyers all around this country, the reality is that the work that we are currently engaged in in passing these bills will have a very significant practical impact on communities such as my local community. It is in that vein that I support these initiatives. I restate the fact I think that this is a very ambitious set of proposals, but we owe it to the people in our communities to be ambitious, to try to shrug off the history of buck passing and finger pointing and to do our best to work with our colleagues at state and local levels to deliver better services in our communities. That is our hope. We are putting some serious money on the table and we look forward to the passage of this legislation and indeed to working very closely with our state and local government colleagues into the future to deliver better services to our local community.",145
176,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"In November last year the Council of Australian Governments agreed to a new framework for federal financial relations which provides a really first-class foundation for collaboration on policy development, service delivery and facilitating the implementation of economic and social reforms in areas of national importance. The Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009 is the legislative expression of this new framework, this brave new world. I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak to it and the related legislation. It appropriates funds to provide financial assistance to the states. Furthermore, it implements this government's reforms to modernise federal financial relations in accordance with a new financial framework agreed by COAG in the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations. In agreeing to the new framework for federal financial relations the Commonwealth committed to the provision of ongoing financial support for the state's service delivery efforts through general revenue assistance, including the ongoing provision of GST payments to be used by the states for any purpose; to national specific purpose payments to be spent in the key service delivery sectors; and to national partnership payments to support the delivery of specified outputs or that projects to facilitate reforms or to reward those jurisdictions that deliver on nationally significant reforms. The government has acted decisively to end the blame game with the states. This legislation enshrines in law new architecture for Commonwealth-state financial relations. The national specific purpose payments will support state service delivery in the areas of schools, early childhood, health, disabilities, vocational education and housing. In the area of schools, specific purpose payments will include funding of $18 billion that includes an additional $3.5 billion over five years. This is significant additional funding, and the member for Lindsay was quite right to refer to this government's additional investments in education. COAG's previous agreement to a new form of payment known as the national partnership payment will fund specific projects, such as ‘smarter schools', in the areas of quality teaching, low socio-economic status school communities, literacy and numeracy This new federal financial arrangement will underpin COAG's efforts to address the underinvestment in education of recent years which has significantly constrained Australia's productivity growth. In the COAG communique of November regarding the productivity agenda, it was acknowledged that high-quality schooling is essential and central to Australia's future prosperity and social cohesion. Back in 2003 the Chairman of the Productivity Commission, recognising the productivity miracle produced by the economic reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments, indicated that the best opportunities for improving productivity were by raising the performance and accessibility of our education and training systems, particularly given their importance in deepening Australia's human capital, on which innovation and economic growth will increasingly depend. The Productivity Commission chairman indicated that it is not just about the level of investment in education but also about how efficiently it is used. The reforms agreed to by COAG, and outlined in the communique, recognised that ‘the way education and training is delivered is critical to driving our future productivity and increasing social inclusion'. The new agreements for education and skills and workforce development set out reform directions, specific deliverables, roles and responsibilities. Under these agreements, the Commonwealth and the states will work in partnership to lift the quality of education and training and target resources to where they are most needed. This funding ensures that the states can allocate resources more flexibly while providing a set of definitive and measurable targets to provide the basis for accountability by governments to the community. The national agreements will contribute to outcomes such as: all children are engaged in, and benefiting from, schooling; - young people are meeting basic literacy and numeracy standards, and overall levels of literacy and numeracy achievement are improving; - Australian students excel by international standards; - schooling promotes social inclusion and reduces the education disadvantage of children, especially Indigenous children; and - young people make a successful transition from school to work and further study. COAG agreed that the National Education Agreement is critical to achieving the target set by them early in 2008 to lift the year 12 or equivalent attainment rate to 90 per cent by 2020, to have the gap for Indigenous students in reading, writing and numeracy within a decade, or to at least have the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 or equivalent attainment by 2020. The communique further outlined that the Commonwealth and states agreed to pursue further policy and reform directions through the National Education Agreement, focusing on improving school leader and teacher quality, including support for school principals, setting high standards and expectations for all students, boosting parental engagement in schooling, implementing integrated strategies for low socio-economic status school communities, implementing modern teaching and learning environments, ensuring better directed resources, providing support to students with additional needs and reviewing funding and regulation across government and non-government school sectors. Addressing educational disadvantage arising from low socio-economic status through the COAG process is an important reform not only to raise GDP but to rectify what is an unacceptable imbalance. According to OECD research, students in the lowest socio-economic quartile lag behind those in the highest socio-economic quartile by 2½ years. New funding is intended to drive fundamental changes in these schools, including reforms to attract high-performing teachers and principals while also creating incentives for talented young teachers to work in these schools. The reforms will also have the flexibility to assist students through afterschool study support, new sporting programs, strong networks with the local community and links with local businesses. Present disadvantage in public schools is of great concern to me, and I think it should be of concern to everyone. Dr Bob Birrell of Monash University in a report he coauthored titled Unequal access to university places indicated that: … in 2003 the proportion of Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC) applicants from Independent schools who received an offer for a university place in 2004 was 77 per cent compared with 55 per cent for Catholic school students and 46 per cent for Government school students. The report continued: The Government school sector is no longer servties. ing as a ladder of educational opportunity for aspiring students from low socio-economic areas. This includes schools that once provided opporlem tunity for young people from South-east Asian and other non-English speaking backgrounds. Within the metropolitan Government school sector for Victoria, there is a growing divergence in outcomes between the schools located in inner, eastern and southern locations, where academic performance is relatively good, and other metropolitan high schools, where academic performance, by comparison, is relatively poor. I think that is a real problem. Even worse, the report says: The academic performance of the lower performing Government schools deteriorated by comparison with the high academically performing Government schools and private sector schools over the decade from 1993 to 2003. In terms of access to university, the government school sector is slipping behind its vigorous independent school competitors. At the same time, the advantages held by the independent sector in terms of government funding, resources and academic reputation are growing. The increased popularity of the independent school sector has coincided with a rise in government funding at the federal level. It also comes at a time when competition for university entrance has intensified. Parents wanting to ensure their children gain entry to university have been withdrawing from the government sector in favour of the private sector. The report goes on to say: Government schools are the key to providing universal educational opportunity in Australia. Many families cannot afford a private sector education. If these people do not have the opportunity to access academically high performing government schools, the career options of their children are likely to be severely constrained. and that is absolutely correct. I mentioned earlier that the COAG agreement obliged the Commonwealth and the states to implement integrated strategies for low socio-economic status school communiThis is of particular importance to my electorate. Over the last 20 years a real probhas developed in my electorate concerning secondary education opportunities. Last year the Christian Brothers announced that it would close the St Joseph's secondary school campus in Pascoe Vale and North Melbourne by 2010. This was a bitter blow to parents Catholic boys and it underscored a growing problem for Coburg and Pascoe Vale parents. They have a government school for girlsPascoe Vale Girls High School-and a Catholic school for girls-Mercy Collegewhich are both well regarded by parents. But there is no year 7 to year 12 government school for boys in Coburg or Pascoe Vale and there is no Catholic school for boys either. An educational black hole has opened up and this is against a background of increasing numbers of children in Wills. The latest parliamentary library population change in Commonwealth electoral divisions report data indicates that Wills is experiencing a growth in the zero to four years age group, which jumped by 337 in one year, and in the five to 14 years age group, which increased by 113. A representative of the High School for Coburg group, Denis Matson, informs me that between 2001 and 2006 there was a 40 per cent increase in preschool enrolments in Coburg. Moreland had an increase of 232 babies in one year alone and has maintained birth figures at around 2,140 children since. There were 98 new preparatory students in 2009 compared with 2008-an increase of four per cent in just over one year. There were 2,575 preparatory students enrolled in local primary schools this year. This means we will have 2,575 grade 6 students looking for a high school in six years time. Against this background, and the background of the impending closure of St Joseph's, I was contacted by many residents expressing concern over secondary school options in Moreland. I therefore arranged a public forum to give local residents an opportunity to raise their concerns and to cuss options on how secondary education resources and infrastructure in my electorate can be improved. That forum was held on 18 February. It was extremely well attended by of nearly 200 local residents, the member for Pascoe Vale, Christine Campbell, the Mayor of Moreland, Councillor Lambros Tapinos, other councillors, local school principals, Justin Mullaly-an Australian Education Union representative-and representatives from the High School for Coburg group. Residents at the forum expressed a great deal of concern over secondary education options currently afforded to the local community. The forum produced a number of proposals which need to be the subject of further research and consideration. Some of those recommendations included: establishing a new secondary school for years 7 to 12 within the electorate; expanding the Moreland Senior College on Bell Street to cater for year 7 to year 12 students; the Victorian government to acquire the St Joseph's college site in Pascoe Vale and establish a local secondary school on that site; investing significantly in existing local secondary schools, including Box Forest Secondary College, Fawkner Secondary College and Brunswick Secondary College to cater for increasing population demand and to lift standards and opportunities locally; and, finally, reviewing boundaries of local secondary schools based on school closures which have occurred since the last revision. I am establishing a working group to pursue these issues further. I also invite parents who share my concern about the need to improve secondary education in Wills to contribute any ideas or thoughts they have for lifting secondary education to me. My electorate officer, Anthony Cianflone, is the appropriate contact in this regard. I do not think there is anything more important for our nation's future than giving disour young people a proper education. I would like to be able to say that everything that can be done is being done to provide quality secondary education in Wills: I cannot-more effort is needed. I have undertaken to do everything that I can to see that this changes. Children in Wills deserve nothing less. Furthermore, there is abundant evidence that more educated economies are wealthier economies. A nation that invests in education has a better economic growth rate. OECD research shows that if the average level of education of the working-age population were increased by one year, the economy would be three to six per cent larger and the growth rate of the economy would be up to one per cent higher. Access Economics has calculated that if the Australian workforce had just 0.15 years extra education and training we could increase productivity in the Australian economy by over 0.6 per cent. A person with better education and training has longer workforce participation and greater adaptability within the workplace. Investment in education is not just about achieving economic goals. It is also about achieving better social inclusion outcomes and enhancing social capital. A strong commitment to education can contribute to higher levels of civic participation, improved social cohesion and improved integration. It contributes to a more equitable, more just, society. It assists with the development of important life skills and I am delighted that the Labor government is delivering on a strong commitment to invest in education. This government is providing national leadership. It is working cooperatively with the states and territories in developing school funding policies that address need and will deliver a better education system. I commend the bills to the House.",149
177,Dr EMERSON,FEDERAL FINANCIAL RELATIONS,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy and Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation) (6.52 pm)-I thank members for their contributions to the debate on these important bills to reform financial relations with the states and territories. I particularly thank the member for Wills for pointing out the importance of ensuring that every young person gets a good education and the relevance of these bills and the contribution that they will make to alleviating disadvantage through a better education for the underprivileged in this country. The Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009 appropriates funds to provide financial assistance to the states and territories and implements the government's reforms to modernise federal financial relations in accordance with the new financial framework agreed by the Council of Australian Governments in the Intergovernmental Agreement on Federal Financial Relations. The Federal Financial Relations (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2009 provides for the relevant consequential amendments arising from the measures in the Federal Financial Relations Bill 2009, including the repeal or amendment of inconsistent legislation. As the Treasurer said in his second reading speech, COAG has agreed to a new architecture of cooperative funding arrangements that will replace the inefficient, complex and, frankly, dysfunctional system of grants that has plagued areas of joint Commonwealth and state involvement in the delivery of services for decades. With these bills, the ineffective methods of the past will be behind us. We will be heading in a new direction and into a new era of modern federalism. Following COAG's agreement to the new federal financial framework in November last year, the government was pleased to note the comments of the Business Council of Australia. The Business Council has consistently argued for reform of federal financial relations and for governments to focus on outcomes in health and education. The council congratulated COAG: … for reshaping federal-state finances in ways that can improve the accountability and efficiency of government services and make it easier for businesses to invest and grow. In agreeing the new framework for federal financial relations, the Commonwealth committed to the provision of ongoing financial support for the states' service delivery efforts through general revenue assistance, including the ongoing provision of GST payments to be used by the states for any purpose; national specific purpose payments, national SPPs, to be spent in the key service delivery sectors; and national partnership payments to support the delivery of specified outputs or projects, to facilitate reforms or to reward those jurisdictions that deliver on nationally significant reforms. The Federal Financial Relations Bill provides an appropriation for the Commonwealth to make GST payments to the states equivalent to the revenue received from the GST in respect of financial years starting from 1 July 2009 and for these payments to be distributed in accordance with the principle of horizontal fiscal equalisation. These provisions are equivalent to the current GST payment provisions. Each state will continue to receive its adjusted population share of the GST revenue. The government has a range of revenue-sharing arrangements and other general purpose payments in place with the states other than the GST arrangements. Payments under these arrangements will be provided for in the Federal Financial Relations Bill in order to bring all payments to the states under one piece of legislation. Monthly payments of general revenue assistance will be determined by the Treasurer and paid through the COAG Reform Fund. These payment arrangements will be set out in an intergovernmental agreement. The Federal Financial Relations Bill provides appropriations for the Commonwealth to make an ongoing financial contribution from 1 July 2009 to support state and territory service delivery in the form of five national SPPs covering the key human service sectors of health care, schools, skills and workforce development, disability services, and affordable housing. The Federal Financial Relations Bill also provides a facility for the Treasurer to determine the appropriate amount of national SPPs for this financial year. This transitional arrangement for 200809 is necessary to allow the government to reconcile the total amount to be paid for the year with the amount already paid under existing arrangements in order to determine the correct payment for the remainder of the year. In the past, onerous Commonwealth conditions on funding arrangements have tended to stifle innovation and flexibility, resulting in duplication, overlap, cost shifting and unnecessary administration costs. In establishing these new national SPPs, the Commonwealth will provide the states with more funding certainty. The Federal Financial Relations Bill specifies the amount of funding for each national SPP for 2009-10 and for the base funding to be indexed annually by a growth factor. There will be no more five year agreements with take it or leave it offers, as occurred under the previous arrangements. These national SPPs are ongoing payments with regular funding adequacy reviews. The Treasurer of the day will determine the annual growth factor and each state's or territory's share of the national SPPs in a financial year. These determinations will be in accordance with the principles provided in the intergovernmental agreement and detailed in a methodology paper to be agreed in March by the Ministerial Council on Federal Financial Relations. While the states now have greatly improved budget flexibility in respect of these payments, they are also subject to substantially improved public performance reporting against clearly specified performance indicators and benchmarks. These obligations are set out in the national agreements and the intergovernmental agreement. Taken together, the clear specification of mutually agreed objectives and outcomes combined with clarified roles and responsibilities and enhanced public performance reporting will represent a very substantial improvement in the public accountability of all governments. This will drive improvements in the quality of services available to the Australian community. The Commonwealth will also enter into new incentive arrangements with the states, through national partnership payments, to drive key economic and social reforms. It has already started this process, with around 20 national partnerships agreed by COAG. Continuing payments which conform to the new arrangements will be deemed to be national partnerships. The Federal Financial Relations Bill provides for the Treasurer to credit amounts to the COAG Reform Fund for the purpose of providing financial assistance to the states in the form of national partnership payments. These payments will reward those states which best deliver services and outcomes to their citizens and not reward those that do not. In so doing, they will drive a new microeconomic reform agenda in this country. Most importantly, they will improve the quality of services available community, in particular those of hospitals and schools. Full details of these measures are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Together these bills provide for the most significant reform of Australia's federal financial relations in decades. They represent a new era of modern federalism and the ending of the blame game. The new federal financial framework is the culmination of extensive work by all levels of government and provides a solid foundation for COAG to pursue economic and social reforms to underpin growth, prosperity and social cohesion into the future. The government thanks our state and territory counterparts for their contributions to developing the new framework and looks forward to working with them in the pursuit of ongoing collaboration in this area. The government also thanks the Senate Economics Committee for its consideration and support of the bills. I commend the bills to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

180,Mr ABBOTT,ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT,"Warringah) (7.03 pm)Let me begin by observing that this is a time of great uncertainty for the financial future older Australians. Senior Australians who are reliant upon income from shares have seen the value of those shares plummet over the last six months or so and have great uncertainty as to whether the dividends from those shares will maintain the incomes that they have become used to. For senior Australians who are largely dependent on the pension there is, of course, the Harmer review, which is currently before the government. It is said that the Harmer review will recommend a substantial increase in at least the single rate of the age pension. This raises all sorts of questions about what might happen to the single rate of other pensions, it raises all sorts of questions about what might happen to other pensions and benefits and, of course, it raises the biggest question of all: how is any massive increase in the rate of the single pension going to be paid for at a time of great pressure on government revenues? To increase the single rate of the age pension alone by $35 a week would cost $1.7 billion a year. To increase the single rate of all pensions would cost well over $3 billion a year. In a situation where the government has spent $42 billion in one hit on the so-called stimulus package, in a situation where the budget position has moved from a $22 billion surplus to a $22 billion deficit in about eight months, the ability of the government to afford this kind of generosity towards pensioners is under enormous question. The Harmer review was delivered several weeks ago to the government. It is, as I said, strongly rumoured to recommend this very large increase in the single age pension. What the pensioners of Australia and senior Australians would like to know is: what else does the Harmer review recommend? I think it is scandalous that the government is not releasing the Harmer review so that senior Australians and other people with a legitimate interest can actually consider this, deof bate it and mull over it well in advance of any decision that the government might make. Of course, there are rumours now circulating amongst senior Australians that one of the changes that the Harmer review recommends to help pay for this generosity to single age pensioners is to include the family home in the assets test. We certainly have had bodies that are thought to be close to the government and influential in the Harmer review process say that family homes worth over $1 million, which in Sydney is a very, very large number of homes indeed-or at least it was before the Rudd recession started to attack housing values-will be included in the assets test for the first time. So I think it is very important that this parliament and, through this parliament, the Australian population know that big uncertainties are crowding in on this area and that the government, if it is to be fair dinkum with the Australian people and if it is to be as honest as it claimed it would be pre election, really does need to put the Harmer review on the table publicly now rather than simply releasing it on budget night along with a whole lot of government decisions that will be presented as a done deal. The Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2009 and related bill before the parliament now deals with the eligibility of senior Australians for the Commonwealth seniors health card. At present, just under 300,000 senior Australians receive the Commonwealth seniors health card, and this is a very valuable benefit to those people who have it. The Commonwealth seniors health card gives recipients access to prescriptions at about $5 per go, as opposed to the standard rate of about $31. It gives recipients access to free prescriptions once they have spent about $300 a year on pharmaceuticals, as opposed to those without the card, who get access to the $5 rate for prescriptions only after they have spent more than $1,100 a year on prescriptions. The Commonwealth seniors health card gives many older Australians access to bulkbilling, because those who hold it are entitled to the bulk-billing incentive payments, or doctors who bulk-bill them are entitled to the extra payments. It gives holders access to the Medicare safety net at a much lower rate than would otherwise be the case, and it gives holders access to the $500 a year seniors concession allowance. In recent years it has given holders access to the $500 seniors bonuses in the budgets, it gives holders access to the telephone allowance, which in some cases can be well over $100 a year, and, in many states, it gives holders access a range of state concessions for public transport, council rates, power bills and so on. So this is an extremely valuable concession but, as a result of the legislation currently before the House, it is proposed to be taken away from a significant number of current holders. At the moment, the Commonwealth seniors health card is available to Australians of pension age who are not receiving a government benefit with taxable incomes under $50,000, in the case of seniors, and $80,000, in the case of couples. This is very important. Thanks to changes which the Howard government made, most superannuation pensions or annuities are not taxable. Thanks to the changes in this legislation, those annuities will not be taxable but they will be counted in the means test for the purpose of access to this card. When this change was first flagged in the budget, it was estimated that some 22,000 senior Australians who currently have the card will lose it. It is possible that, at least in the short term, there will be a lower number of Australians who will lose the card as a result of this legislation, should it be passed, because of the reductions in incomes that many seniors are now enjoying as a result of changes in the share market. But the fact of the matter is that over time very large numbers of Australians who otherwise would have received the Commonwealth seniors health card will lose it as a result of this legislation which the parliament is debating tonight. Eighty thousand dollars a year sounds like lot of money, and to people on significantly less it is a lot of money, but let us not forget that the people who have this kind of income from their superannuation only have it because they have saved and put money away during their working lives. They have paid tax on that money. They paid tax on the money often enough when it was earned, they paid tax on the money when it went into to the fund, and the income of these funds has been taxed, so this is not money which has not contributed to the general commonweal. This is not just a freebie for them; this is money that they have earned. This is money that has been taxed and this is money that now, in their senior years, they are getting back. Let us not forget that every self-funded retiree saves the community perhaps $25,000 a year, a very substantial saving that taxpayers generally enjoy because of the hard work, thrift, prudence and responsibility of self-funded retirees. So, by prosecuting this particular piece of legislation, what we really have from the Rudd government is a sneak attack on self-funded retirees. These are decent, hard working, responsible Australians who deserve a break. They were given a break by the Howard government and they do not deserve to have it taken away by the Rudd government. In the course of this debate, I am sure we are going to hear lengthy argument from members opposite about consistency. They are going to say that this legislation just plies the same kinds of tests to this benefit that are applied to other benefits. I have to say that that is very convenient for the government to say now, but if they had a shred of decency and honesty-if they had any real sense of honour-they would have said this before the election, not after the election. They would have come clean with the seniors of Australia about their plans before the election rather than just springing this on people in last year's budget. I regret to say that the Rudd government has form in this area. The Prime Minister likes to stand before us as Captain Clean or the Milkybar Kid of Australian politics saying, ‘Look, you know, I'm honest; I'm straight; I'm true,' but the fact of the matter is that we have had a series of means tests slapped on benefits that were not flagged prior to the election. In some cases they were explicitly disavowed before the election. We have the means test that has been slapped on the baby bonus, we have the means test that has been slapped on the family tax benefit part A, we have the means test that has been slapped on the childcare benefit, and we have the means test that has been put on the private health insurance rebate. To the best of my recollection, in the case of both the baby bonus and the private health insurance rebate, the government gave explicit pre-election promises that there would be no means tests-promises that have been shamefully broken by the government since that time. They are dishonest, sneaky means tests, and this is a dishonest, sneaky means test in the tradition of the Rudd government. I hate to say it, because I know that not all members of the Rudd government are as animated as some are by old-fashioned notions of class warfare and envy. I see the minister for small business and deregulation at the table this evening; his title is no doubt soon to be changed to ‘minister for even apsmaller business and re-regulation' in the wake of the Prime Minister's Monthly essay, which sings the praises of regulation and denounces deregulation as some kind of noxious neoliberalism. To his credit, the member for Rankin, the minister for small business, has always been, at least by comparative standards, a voice for economic sanity inside the Australian Labor Party, so I suspect that there is much which dismays him in the current direction of the government, but that is what we have. Dr Emerson interjecting",156
181,Mr ABBOTT,ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT,"I am very happy to engage in further praise of the member for Rankin, because the last thing I would want-from a political point of view, anyway-is to see the Rudd government attending to the better angels of its nature rather than to those who mostly seem to rule amongst members opposite. This is bad legislation, it is dishonest legislation and it damages the very instincts and elements in our society which a decent government should encourage. It is bad legislation. This opposition will certainly be opposing the legislation both in this House and elsewhere. I say in wrapping up that the principle of this legislation is bad but that the application of it is going to be quite uncertain. Many self-funded retirees need to take lump sums out of the capital of their superannuation because, for argument's sake, they have an unexpected major expense. There has been some talk from the government that in that situation the money that they take out will not count towards this new means test, but I have to say that all of the inquiries that the various seniors organisations have been directing to this government have not elicited clear, precise, certain responses, so I think not only that this is bad legislation but that it could provide for a whole lot of very inconsistent and erratic treatment of people who are caught up in it. It did not take long for the Rudd government to revert to Labor type. We had the Prime Minister throughout 2007 claiming to be an economic conservative and saying that there was not the thickness of a cigarette paper between the economic policies of the then Howard government and those of the then opposition. I have to say that the longer the Rudd government lasts the less like the Howard government it looks, the less responsible it looks and the more like the Whitlam government it looks. This is certainly in keeping with that not especially honourable tradition. This bill should be opposed.",158
182,Mr CRAIG THOMSON,ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT,"The shadow minister, in talking about and raising the issue of what was taken to an election, is exhibiting the absolute height of hypocrisy. Just across the corridor, in the Senate, we have a debate right now about killing off Work Choices and making sure that it is gone forever. It was the Howard government that, before the 2004 election, never mentioned a word about these absolutely major changes affecting all working people across Australia. It is the absolute height of hypocrisy for the shadow minister to come to this place and accuse the Rudd government of misleading or not being open and transparent with voters before the 2007 election. The Rudd government has been open and transparent, and one of the things that we have been open and transparent about is that we know that seniors and pensioners have been doing it tough. In relation to that, we have taken the position that we need to be looking at how we can assist. In October last year the first stimulus package fairly and squarely went to providing some assistance to those pensioners and carers who have been doing it so tough. What is the opposition's position? Originally, when there was debate about pensions we had all this confected anger-confected concern for pensioners-and a call from the then opposition leader for a $30 a week increase. When the October stimulus package was announced, the then opposition leaderbecause there had been a change by that time-said, ‘We support the stimulus package because we think it is doing the right thing.' However, it did not take terribly long for them to walk away from that position. If we listen to what they are saying today, and have been seen saying now for many months, almost every contribution from those opposite is in opposition to the stimulus package. So one has to ask: exactly where is the opposition in relation to support for seniors? The shadow minister spoke about this era of uncertainty crowding in on seniors in Australia. The ‘crowding in of uncertainty' has been generated in some sense by the shadow minister, and his contribution today did nothing to dispel this uncertainty. Scaremongering about the family home is what he contributed here today. He is raising totally unsubstantiated issues and throwing them into the mix. Last year the opposition was calling for a $30 increase. The shadow minister is now asking, ‘Can we afford to do anything for pensioners?' The opposition has moved very rapidly from its position of: ‘We care for seniors. We care for pensioners'-because it saw some political gain in that argument at the time-to one of: ‘We do not even support the one-off payments that they received last year. We do not support a process of review of the pension, and whatever that review is going to recommend we do not think it can be afforded anyway.' The position of the opposition in relation to older and senior Australians is totally disgraceful. Amidst the uncertainty there is one thing that is quite clear: that this side of the House, the Rudd government, is there with pensioners and seniors assisting and making sure they get the maximum assistance they can while they are doing it tough. We have put processes in place to review the pension. We have made one-off bonus payments and this stands in such stark contrast to the performance of the opposition, who wax and wane depending on which votes they are going to gain in the contest for leadership in the Liberal Party. They have tried to use the pensioners and seniors of Australia for internal political purposes. That is a shameful thing. I rise in support of the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Commonwealth Seniors Health Card) Bill 2009. The bill implements a 2008 budget measure to change the adjusted taxable income test for the Commonwealth seniors health card. The measure introduces similar treatment of income sources for people claiming the Commonwealth seniors health card to ensure that income received by all seniors is treated in a similar way and to ensure that the income test is applied to all cardholders consistently. The change will apply to the seniors health card issued under either the Social Security Act 1991 or the Veterans Entitlement Act 1986. The seniors health card legislation needs to be in place to give Centrelink and the Department of Veterans' Affairs the authority to gather the required information from customers by May 2009 to enable implementation from 1 July 2009. The information to be gathered is new information that has not been requested previously from this group. All cardholders will be required to reply regardless of whether or not they have the relevant income. In my electorate of Dobell on the New South Wales Central Coast there are nearly 17,000 people aged 65 or above. Senior citizens play a very important part in the community of the Central Coast. Nearly every week I attend a function or an event which senior citizens are closely involved in. Recently I was at the gala bowls day held at The Entrance. Nine bowling clubs from the Central Coast were in attendance. I must say it was a very enjoyable afternoon where I was introduced to bowls for the first time. But the purpose of the gala bowls day was to recognise the work that these senior volunteers had done in their particular sport to make sure that the district lawn bowls could take place. At this event I was able to present a large number of volunteers-almost all of them seniors-with certificates of appreciation. Without these senior volunteers these sorts of events would simply not be possible. The gala bowls day is just one example of how seniors are active in the community in my electorate. Look at any group of volunteers and see how many seniors are involved. Another great example of senior citizens being active and involved in my electorate is the Toukley Senior Citizens Centre. This is the biggest senior citizens centre in the Southern Hemisphere. At one stage it had over 6,000 members. The number is slightly less than that at the moment, but it is an extremely large senior citizens centre that provides a whole range of services and activities for senior citizens. It is one of the places I go very regularly because not only do you get some great advice from our senior citizens but you are also able to interact with them and see the wonderful job that they are doing, the way in which they are keeping so active in the community and the contribution that they are making to it. Hospital auxiliary groups which are in all hospitals-at Wyong Hospital in my electorate-do an absolutely tremendous job. These are senior volunteers working in my community. Seniors also play a very strong economic role in the community. The Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy will know-because he made an announcement of funding for the Central Coast Business Enterprise Centre of some $2 million, which is the first time that these business enterprise centres actually received any federal funding-the role that seniors play in mentoring other businesses on the Central Coast. It is a tremendous role that seniors play in my community on the Central Coast. So the senior citizens on the Central Coast areDebate interrupted. NA",159
183,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Petition: Excise Regulations Microbreweries",161
184,Mrs HULL,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to present a petition, as approved by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of The House of Representatives This petition of the Australian Association of Microbreweries, representing small breweries throughout Australia, draws to the attention House the inconsistent and illogical treatment between small wineries with their WET producer tax rebate and microbreweries with their noncommercially viable limited excise rebate. The taxation of alcohol currently creates an unjustifiable distortion between small wineries and small breweries that is inequitable, against common sense, Government policy and distorts industry policy. The producer rebate on WET grants small wineries the first $1.7 million in sales WET Free (maximum $500,000 p/year), whereas the Excise Regulation grants microbrewers a limited excise refund of a maximum of $10,000 p/year and caps production at a tiny 30,000 litres p/year. Almost no microbrewery qualifies for this rebate as the average annual production for craft breweries is in the order of 150,000 litres p.a. Microbreweries are mostly small, regional, family businesses. The inequality of alcohol taxation is depriving small breweries of 25%-30% of their annual revenue and stifles growth. Governmental support in granting alcohol taxation equality with small wineries will create growth in the small brewing industry, regional job creation and regional tourism growth. We therefore ask the House to modernise or update the existing provisions of the Excise Regulation to permit a brewer (or group of brewers) to obtain an excise refund of 60% of excise duty paid in any one financial year up to a maximum of $500,000 p/year and that the definition of microbrewers capping production at 30,000 litres p/year be removed. from 5,773 citizens Petition received. In this world of financial challenges, there is a group of mostly small regional family businesses, consisting of men and women who have carved out a niche industry, which is providing enormous benefits towards the sustainability of-primarily-our regions. Beer is a low-margin product that necessitates a large volume of production in order to support high initial investment and high ongoing costs and taxation. These high costs, in of the addition to the general cost increases of many of their day-today running requirements, are a challenge for breweries. However, the real hurdle to jump is the legislation that has a limited excise refund of a maximum of $10,000 per annum and has a cap on production of 30,000 litres per annum. If you were only producing 30,000 litres of boutique beer, you would certainly not be commercially viable, and the fact is that most microbreweries produce on average about 125,000 litres per annum. This equates to about $500,000 per annum turnover and also equates to some $190,000 in excise that is payable. It is true that there is virtually no brewery that qualifies for the rebate. This means that these small businesses, 58 per cent of which are in regional areas, are being deprived of around 25 to 30 per cent of their annual revenue. This is simply unfair. We must allow all Australian businesses to be relevant in the future growth of our nation. As I said, 58 per cent of these breweries underpin our regional economies. If people are willing to take financial risks with money that comes from their own pockets to secure their futures then surely government policy and legislation should not work against this progressive attitude. The time has come to recognise these small breweries and their contribution to jobs and to wealth in many of our regions and across Australia in general. We must have the current legislation amended, and the budget should deliver fairness to those men and women who make up these businesses. I must congratulate the industry for their due diligence and commitment to this issue. They will be in the House tomorrow, where they will meet with a bipartisan group of members and senators. I thank members and senators for their willingness to join in advocating for beer not to be made a cheaper product-particularly this boutique beer and specialty beer-but to support the initiative and unique talent that delivers appreciation for the taste of beer. We are not looking at raging alcohol consumption, for there is most definitely a very big difference in the general consumption of beer as opposed to the consumption of beer that is produced in our small breweries. It is indeed a taste that must be acquired. It is indeed an experience. It is indeed something that is a unique product. It would, in fact, assist in the partaking of alcohol in smaller quantities. It is not the quantity of beer one can drink from the microbreweries that goes towards making it such a popular product amongst tourists; it is the taste and the different make-ups and ingredients that go into it. It is a fact that we are facing and confronting a global financial crisis and it is these small businesses with these unique initiatives and their drive and passion that will enable us to weather our way through these significant turbulent times. I would certainly call on the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer to ensure that they address this problem in the budget and that they provide the actual outcome that has been sought by the microbrewers in their petition. I congratulate the microbrewers on the short time it has taken them to collect so many signatures in support of the industry that they have grown from very small bases. Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to present this petition in the House and bring the plight of the microbreweries into focus. I call for the upcoming budget to address that plight in order to put them on a level playing field. Employment Mrs D'ATH (Petrie) (7.35 pm)-I wish to talk, at this important time, about jobs and job security. With the global recession and the impact that it is having across this country in workplaces and households in each of our local areas, we know that jobs are certainly an issue in the front of everyone's minds. The Rudd Labor government is doing everything it possibly can to deal with these issues. It started with our stimulus package back in October last year and continued with the initiatives delivered in December, which supported jobs throughout this country across the retail sector and across tourism by putting payments in the hands of disability pensioners, carers and families. We also funded 56,000 new training places in that first initiative. As a consequence of our Nation Building and Jobs Plan, we saw more initiatives to support jobs-whether it was through the provision of infrastructure in schools or through the installation of insulation in roofs. It was also through our employment service programs, in trying to ensure that apprentices were able to complete their apprenticeships because, despite any increase in unemployment, we still have a skills shortage in this country that needs to be addressed. And of course we have the Fair Work Bill, which is being debated right now in the Senate. What does the Fair Work Bill do? It provides job security. It ensures that people are paid a reasonable wage so that they can make ends meet, they can cover their cost of living and they cannot be sacked without legitimate reasons. Also, if a workplace has to downsize and has to have redundancies, it ensures that these workers have protections and redundancy packages. We have heard a lot about jobs from the opposition over the past weeks and months, but realistically this is a party that still cannot let go of Work Choices. This is the party that brought Work Choices to our households and our workplaces. They still cannot bring themselves to let go of this horrific piece of legislation that they believe is their biggest legacy. This is a piece of legislation that they allege actually created jobs. But what this piece of legislation did was undermine basic wages and conditions. It allowed conditions, penalties and allowances to be ripped away from people. They may have had a job but they were also able to class themselves as the working poor because they were earning below the poverty line, thanks to that piece of legislation. Their idea of helping jobs was to allow employers in small to quite large businesses of up to 100 employees to just sack indiscriminately. That is what their legacy is and that is what Work Choices allowed for. It stripped away any right to have redundancy payments. If an employer did not want to give redundancies, they then just negotiated that away, and when we say ‘negotiated' that means an employee would turn up to a job and have a document put in front of them and be told to take it or leave it. That is the opposition's idea of job security. What we have heard from the party room this week is that they still do not know what to do. There are those on the other side who say that Work Choices is dead, but many others on the other side will never accept that Work Choices is dead and, given the opportunity, would bring it back in a heartbeat. AWAs, the right to sack indiscriminately and no job security-that is what the Liberal Party believe in, that is what they have always believed in and that is what they will continue to believe in well into the future.

189,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The member will refer to members by their title.,164
190,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I am here to bat for the small businesses and the medium-sized businesses in the Ryan electorate. They are doing it tough and the Rudd government is certainly no help to them. I want to draw the attention of the Labor member for Petrie to an article in the Australian on 9 March 2009. It was written by Grace Collier, a former union official. She has seen the light. She writes a very succinct and compelling piece. I draw your attention to Grace Collier's article. I wish I had time to read the whole article but let me read a very compelling paragraph: For the first time in ages, businesspeople were able to dismiss employees who they could no longer employ without fear of being sued and consequently having to pay huge amounts of goaway money just to avoid a ghastly legal process. Talk about support for business! Member for Petrie, you have no idea about the tough conditions in which small businesses and medium-sized businesses operate throughout this country. As I said, I want to bat for small businesses in the Ryan electorate. I know that a lot of them are listening tonight. I want to draw your attention, Mr Speaker, and the attention of my colleagues who are very kindly in the House, to a very courageous local business owner, Cobby Vines, who very kindly has allowed me to mention her name and her business. She runs a cafe called Betty Beans Coffee Emporium in the Mount Ommaney shopping centre. I want to give her a plug and encourage all my Mount Ommaney constituents to visit her business and buy a cup of coffee and a toasted sandwich. She very courageously wrote to me and I want to quote from her letter. She said: Dear Michael Johnson I own a cafe in your electorate and I employ 15 staff. In any week I serve 2000 local people and I have been in business for 8 years. As part of the Government's implementation of the Industrial Relations Reform an award is proposed for my business to take effect January 2010. This award would see my labour costs increase by some 20%. This additional cost will make my business marginal. In particular Sunday trading … will not be viable and I will have to look at applying a penalty or closing on Sunday. The imposition of a penalty for all evening hours is also problematic. This 10% impost when the majority of my business, particular in the last 12 months, has been at night. All in all, in light of the so-called modern award, I am reconsidering whether I will continue to operate the business in 2010. I have worked in the hospitality industry for most of my life as have many of my staff. It seems absurd that a Government initiative would deliberately place our livelihoods at such risk, at a time like this. Member for Petrie, talk about representing small businesses. What do you say to Cobby Vines, who owns the Betty Beans Coffee Emporium and who lives in my electorate at Moggill with her business partner? They are wonderful Australians who do so much community work even though they are running a small business. I want to salute Australians like her across the length and breadth of this country because, whilst doing it tough, they are still plugging on despite the policies of this government. I think the government should hang their heads in shame. In the few minutes I have left, I want to also refer to another very courageous Australian, Darren Townsend, who I spoke to just a couple of minutes ago. He very kindly allowed me to use his name and mention his business-Townsend Entertainment. He runs a video business and owns three local DVD stores. He is a young bloke. Previously he owned 13 stores. He told me a very profound storyMr Shorten interjecting",164
191,Mr JOHNSON,ADJOURNMENT,"which I know the member for Maribyrnong and the member for Petrie are interested in. He told me a story of two brothers-a 16and 17yearold-who worked for him and who stole from his business. Do you know what happened? The parents of those two young blokes came to his business and read the riot act to this young entrepreneur, Darren Townsend. They read him the riot act because he dared to question their integrity. (Time expired) Deakin Electorate: Victorian Bushfires",165
192,Mr SYMON,ADJOURNMENT,"I would like to speak on an issue of some seriousness tonight. It relates to the bushfires in Victoria and especially-though on a slightly lighter note-some of the fundraising efforts that my local schools have made to support people in those areas who have been affected in terms of property or other goods or lives. Those areas are really just up the road from the electorate of Deakin. The Yarra Valley is quite close, and there are a lot of community connections. In total, so far-and they are still counting-the schools in my electorate have now raised over $110,000, and some of them are still going. That is a really good and honest tribute to the community spirit that has certainly shown itself since that time. I would like to speak about a few schools in particular. I am sure there are a couple that I will have missed, but I am sure there will be another time to talk about them as well. One of the schools, Blackburn Primary School, with just under 500 students, raised $11,000 through both a general appeal and a trivia night organised by the staff. For a school of that size to raise so much money is quite an impressive achievement. Another school, Antonio Park Primary School, which is just down the road from my electorate office, raised $1,500 in its free dress day, with another $1,200 raised through donations to the school's office. This money will be donated to the Flowerdale, Kinglake, Middle Kinglake and Kinglake West primary schools. In addition to this, the School Council at Antonio Park has decided to donate 10 per cent of this year's profits from their school fete to the bushfire appeal. The school is hoping that this will mean that an extra $2,000 or more will be donated following the fete in April. The Junior School Council at Laburnum Primary School were largely responsible for that school's fundraising efforts, organising a casual dress day and, with the help of the school's parents group, conducting a twilight sports sausage sizzle. Food and drinks for this were donated by local businesses, and their efforts saw the school raise almost $10,000. I would particularly like to highlight the role played by the students on the Junior School Council at Laburnum. It is always pleasing to see young Australians contributing to their community, especially at times when the rest of the community is watching and taking notice. In addition to raising $1,200 for the bushfire appeal, Ringwood Heights Primary School put together about 200 individual classroom packs containing items such as stationery and drink bottles to be sent to a school destroyed by the fires, Middle Kinglake Primary School. Some of these packs also contained hats and sporting equipment and some contained toys and games sorted by school grades. The school has also collected a donation of a pallet of stationery ready to be delivered along with 20 to 30 boxes of stationery donated by two other schools and by Officeworks. These supplies will be delivered to Middle Kinglake Primary School once it has completed its move to an alternative site-as I said, the school was destroyed. A huge effort has also been put in by the staff and students at Ringwood Secondary College, who raised over $13,000 for the bushfire relief fund. In addition to this standing effort, 140 students and staff are rostered to donate blood throughout this month of March. The school community, along with others like Ringwood Heights Primary School-as I have mentioned-and Tinternvale Primary School, has rallied together to provide toiletries, goods and tools to people who have been affected by the fires. As well as their fundraising efforts and appeals for donated goods, I have also seen a number of drawings and letters from primary school students in the electorate which are to be sent to students in the affected areas. I think this gives a personal touch to the fundraising efforts. It is great to see money donated, but it is also really good to see a erous personal outpouring of genuine thoughts that are sent across. Dorset Primary School held a crazy hair day to raise money for the Red Cross bushfire appeal. The school tells me that the collection of hairstyles there ranged from the strange to the crazy to the downright ridiculous. The parade held on the netball court, they tell me, looked quite amazing and, at times, amazingly horrible! From this appeal, $2,557 was raised for the Red Cross bushfire appeal. Of course there are many other schoolsand I am going to run out of time and not get to them all. Just quickly: Norwood Secondary College raised $6,900, and Great Ryrie Primary School raised $1,850. There are many more and there are many good fundraising efforts going on. I congratulate all the schools, the students and the teachers involved. Paterson Electorate: Coal Exploration",165
193,Mr BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to speak of a matter which is of grave concern to thousands of constituents in the Paterson electorate: three coal exploraout- tion licences held by Gloucester Resources Ltd. The Gloucester community and the local council are vehemently seeking that these licences not be renewed. Let me say from the outset that I am not opposed to mining per se. However, I do find it irresponsible and incomprehensible that a government of any persuasion at any level would allow a licence to be approved where the implications of a proposed mine would have dire consequences for the established community, natural landscape and local industry. The Gloucester district has an incredible array of valuable natural attributes, and I am advised that any of the proposed mining developments under exploration licences EL6523, EL6524 or EL6563 could be gena direct threat to a number of native species of flora and fauna in the region. The Gloucester district is a tranquil and unique landscape rich in natural and cultural diversity and heritage, and the damage associated with these proposed activities could be irreparable. On Monday, 9 February, more than 850 people gathered in the Gloucester Recreation Centre to express concern about coal exploration on Gloucester's doorstep. At that meeting, the crowd unanimously endorsed Gloucester Shire Council's position that three coal exploration licences held by Gloucester Resources Ltd not be renewed so that no coal mining can ever occur in those areas. I have met with a number of residents who are genuinely concerned about the devastating impacts that renewing the three coal exploration licences will have on the township of Gloucester. I have also received letters from individuals, families, business owners, farmers and retirees who are convinced that, if the proposed licences were to be renewed, it could spell the death of the township. Concerns raised are about the landscape scenery being damaged forever, reduced water and air quality, increased noise pollution, decreasing long-term employment in the area, reduction in agricultural capabilities and tourism numbers and poorer road conditions. The Gloucester community are unanimous in their view that a balance needs to be achieved. I share with the township a view that longer term developments such as agriculture, tourism, rural and residential housing and active retirement bring jobs and economic development that are a priority. The Mayor of Gloucester Shire Council, Julie Lyford, has also raised her concerns about the effects of coal mines on the shire, citing the decline of agricultural productivity, residents moving away, reduced tourism opportunities and reduced tree-change migration as very likely consequences of exploration licences being renewed. However, her views were opposed by Ian MCDonald, the New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries, Minister for Energy, Minister for Mineral Resources and Minister for State Development, who short-sightedly opposed the calls to suspend the licenses and stated, ‘We will renew the licences unless there are compelling circumstances not to.' Unfortunately, the very real concerns presented to the minister about the future sustainability of current industry and the deterioration of the natural environment in the Gloucester shire are not compelling enough for the minister to relinquish the licences, therefore sentencing the township of Gloucester to a much starker and less-prosperous future-one where the shire will struggle to survive on a presentlythriving agricultural and tourism based economy. This is not the first time that the township of Gloucester has had to survive in the face of adversity. In 1996 I stood before this House and spoke of the failures of the Keating Labor government and New South Wales state government to support the timber industry. This lack of support wiped out hundreds of jobs and numerous opportunities for the township of Gloucester. As such, the township fought hard to reinvent itself and further develop the tourism and agricultural sectors in the region. If the federal government does not support the township of Gloucester's plea then I hold grave concerns for the future prosperity of the shire and its ability to bounce back again. Whilst I understand that the New South Wales state Labor government is the final authority, I have expressed my concerns in a letter addressed to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts calling on him to listen to the pleas of my constituents about the devastating and irreversible impact that renewing these exploration licences will have on the environment in Gloucester. What we do not need are moonscapes along each side of the Bucketts Way from Stroud to Gloucester. What we do need is for the federal and state governments to listen to the cries of constituents who live in the town, who have helped build the town and whose livelihoods are dependent on the future sustainability of the town. Gloucester shire is a wonderful area that depends on the natural beauty of its surrounds, including the Barrington Tops. Please do not allow the native fauna and flora and the livelihood of locals to be sacrificed for the sake of the New South Wales government capitalising on mining royalties to repay the debts it has incurred. International Women's Day",166
194,Mr HALE,ADJOURNMENT,"Each year around the world International Women's Day is celebrated on March 8. This is a day when women throughout the world come together to celebrate life as women and the progress made to advance equality for women and to assess the challenges that remain. It is a day when women are recognised for their achievements, without regard for divisions, whether national, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic or political. This cial day also provides an opportunity to consider steps to bring about equality for women in all their diversity. International Women's Day was first celebrated in Australia in 1928. The United Nations declared 1975 as International Women's Year and in 1977 it began sponsoring March 8 as International Women's Day. There were several events held in the electorate of Solomon recently to mark the occasion, including the Women's Network Northern Territory breakfast, the Multicultural Council of the Northern Territory dinner, the Northern Territory Working Women's Centre film night and the United Nations Association of Australia Northern Territory women's walk, whose theme this year was: women are our future. Last week I had the pleasure of attending the launch of the LHMU 20 women photographic exhibition at the Supreme Court in Darwin. The exhibition is part of International Women's Day celebrations. However this exhibition is even more significant as it is a pictorial tribute to 20 women with disabilities. I note that we have in the House tonight the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, and he is also the Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction. The exhibition participants are all women of amazing courage, energy and with a commitment to achieving the most out of their lives. They cover many activities, from world champion swimmer Tahnee Afuhaamango, horse rider and jillaroo Quita Docking to library assistant Christina Fowler. Other ladies who are featured in the exhibition are: Wendy Wright, Amy Clifton, Janelle Scobie, Leony Bowey, Catherine Jane Laurence, Helen Murray, Sahra Jok, Michele Castagna, Jean Young-Smith, Jessica Nelson, Ali Beckwith, Debb Lovett, speMelanie Hall, Vicki Williams, Rachel Kroes and Marguerite Baptiste-Rooke. I particularly liked the philosophy on life of talented disabilities worker Elizabeth Reid. She said: ‘Life is based on the principles of equality, choice and participation, enabling individuals to be afforded social justice and be free of bias.' In Darwin and Palmerston we have one of the youngest populations in the land. The most distinctive feature of our vibrant community is the diversity-a great mix of cultures, religions and Indigenous people. The Tribute to Northern Territory Women is an annual award that recognises, celebrates and commemorates the achievements of women who have made, or are making, a significant contribution for women in our community. This year's winners were: Rosanna Breed, a woman who proactively uses her role as a policewoman to improve the relationships between the Aboriginal community and police and the first Aboriginal woman to reach the rank of sergeant in the Northern Territory police force; Catherine Warrington Rogers, better known as Kate, for her contribution to the cattle industry in the early 19th century and for being an early advocate of gender equality; Bilawarra Lee, for her involvement in and contribution to the Northern Territory community and improving the lives of Territorians; Yananymul Mununqqurr, for the significant challenges, difficulty of achievement and contribution as an inspirational role model and leader; and Shirley Brown, in recognition of her tireless community volunteer work across Central Australia. I am proud to be part of a government that is united to end violence against women and girls. The very hard working Minister for the Status of Women, Tanya Plibersek, is formulating an evidence based national plan to reduce violence against women to reiterate our resolve to end violence against women and girls. I will conclude with a quote from the Prime Minister, who spoke to a UNIFEM-White Ribbon Foundation dinner recently, saying: From birth, it must be drilled into and the subconscious of all men that there are no circumstances-no circumstances-in which violence against women is acceptable. … … … That on violence against women, we have a simple, clear policy in two words: zero tolerance.
