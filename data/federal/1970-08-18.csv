2,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTORAL,"I have to announce with deep regret the death on 31st July 1970 ot the honourable member for Chisholm, the Hon. Sir Wilfrid Selwyn Kent Hughes. I have to inform the House that on 13th August I issued a writ for the election of a member to serve the electoral division of Chisholm in the State of Victoria in place of the deceased gentleman. The dates in connection with the election were fixed as follows: Date of nomination, Friday, 28th August 1970; date of polling, Saturday, 19th September 1970; date of return of writ, on or before Friday, 16th October 1970. DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE SIR spoken. WILFRID KENT HUGHES, K.B.E.. M.V.O., M.C., E.Dâ€ž M.P.",14
3,Mr GORTON,ELECTORAL," Mr Speaker, you have already referred to the loss which this Parliament suffered (HANSARD) of the Twenty-seventh Parliament (SECOND PERIOD) 12 June 1970, adjourned to a date and hour to Representatives to meet on Tuesday, 18 August during the recess owing to the death of Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes. I move: this House expresses its deep regret at the on 31 July 1970 of the Hon. Sir Wilfrid Selwyn Kent Hughes, K.B.E., M.V.O., M.C, E.D., a member of this House for the division of Chisholm from 1949 to 1970 and a Minister of the Crown from 1951 to 1956, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. I do not really think that I need to tell this House that Billy Kent Hughes, as we all knew him, was a remarkable man and a fine Australian. In a crowded lifetime of 75 years he time and again demonstrated his courage, determination, integrity and rugged individuality, and with these qualities were combined a high sense of service, exceptional abilities and great humanity, making him one of the outstanding personalities of this Parliament. He was well known as a fearless fighter for the causes he espoused, and in the party room and in the Parliament he was articulate, dogged and outMany members of this chamber would have often disagreed with him but I believe that most of his parliamentary colleagues, if not all, on both sides of the House, had a respect and an affection for him at all times. As the oldest member of the Parliament he could look back on a lifetime of achievement and service that few men could rival, as scholar, soldier, sportsman, parliamentarian and even poet. He devoted 43 years of his life to service in Parliament: 21 years in this House and before that 22 years as a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. He was an enthusiastic traveller and bad a wide knowledge of world affairs. He was greatly concerned about the defence and security of the country for which he bad fought with such distinction in 2 world wars. He was also an ever-ready advocate for the welfare of servicemen. His own military career began when he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force shortly after the start of the First World War. He served overseas in the 3rd Australian Light Horse Brigade and the Australian Mounted Division. He was mentioned in despatched 4 times, awarded the Military Cross and ended that war as the youngest major in the Australian forces. He then took up the Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford which he had won in 1914 and went on to gain his Master of Arts degree. The late Sir KENT HUGHES was back in uniform again in 1940, served in Malaya and was promoted to colonel. He was captured by the Japanese at the fall of Singapore and spent 34 years in Changi and other prison camps. It was while he was a prisoner of the Japanese that he wrote one of his best known works, 'Slaves of the Samurai'. In the Second World War he was again mentioned in despatches and was awarded the Efficiency Decoration. Another area in which Sir Wilfrid gave distinguished service was in the field of sporting activities, both as an athlete in his own right and as an administrator. He represented Australia as a hurdler in the 1920 Olympic Games and in the same year ran in the British Empire versus United States of America Games and the England versus France athletics. In 1938 he was manager of the Australian team at the Empire Games. He became President of the Victorian Olympic Council in 1953 and President of the Victorian Amateur Athletics Association in 1958, positions which he still held at the time of his death. He was, of course, chairman of the organising committee which staged the highly successful Melbourne Olympics in 1956. Sir Wilfrid's political career began in 1927 when he entered the Victorian Legislative Assembly as member for Kew. During the next 22 years he held a number of portfolios in the Victorian Government and was Deputy Premier for 1 year. He transferred to the Federal Parliament by winning the seat of Chisholm in the general election of 1949. In his 21 years in this House he was a member of the Privileges Committee, Minister for the Interior, Minister for Works and Housing from 1951 to 1956, and Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1956 to 1961. He was knighted in 1957. So much for the official record. Many of us also will have personal memories of events and activities which showed Billy Kent Hughes as the vital personality that he was. We will remember his concern for physical fitness - eve n last session he could be seen jogging around Lake Burley Griffin most mornings-and his concern for the trim condition he maintained which led to his capacity to continue to wear the uniform which has graced him in 2 world wars. Indeed, Mr Speaker, I understand that he used to ride a horse in his Light Horse uniform in ANZAC Day marches as a returned soldier of the First World War and then return by car io march as a returned soldier of the Second World War. We will remember him in that uniform at the unveiling a couple of years ago of the Light Horse memorial in Canberra, which was another project to which he directed his energies. The Parliament and the nation have lost a devoted servant and a great Australian. I believe that we are the richer for his lifetime and the poorer for his passing. To Lady Kent Hughes, his children and grandchildren we who have known him for so long extend our deepest sympathy.",14
4,Mr WHITLAM,ELECTORAL,"On behalf of the Australian Labour Party, I support the Prime Minister's motion of regret, appreciation and sympathy. None of us can fail to be aware of how sharply the death of Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes breaks a living link with an era he himself embodied for us as the oldest member of the House of Rep' resentatives. The mere presence of men like the former honourable member for Chisholm, retaining full vigour to the very last, tended to obscure bow very many years, indeed generations, have passed since the rise of his generation-the generation of ANZACs. He was the last of this Parliament's original ANZACs. He enlisted on the day recruiting opened. Now only the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr MCEwen), the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Irwin) and Senator Hendrickson remain of the scores of members of the national Parliament who had enlisted in the first Australian Imperial Porce. He not only belonged to that generation but he was also an archetype. When one recalls Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes' manner, style, fitness-even his features and physique-on e gains a little insight into what manner of men those were who, in the words of Clemenceau, 'astonished Europe by their valour from the very beginning'. There would be few members of this House with whom I and most of my Party would have so consistently disagreed as our late colleague. I find it all the more appropriate to state this, in these circumstances, when I recall a particular and characteristic act of spontaneous chivalry by Wilfrid Kent Hughes on a similar occasion 7 years ago when this House paid its tribute to the late Edward John Ward. There could have been no 2 men more opposed and who more relished the give and take of opposing; but those of us who were here well remember, and those on this side remember with particular appreciation, the unstinted tribute late member paid to Mr Ward for his pioneering work on rail standardisation. In that great work Wilfrid Kent Hughes, as Minister for Transport in the Victorian Parliament, played an equally notable part. He was the senior serving parliamentarian in Australia. He had been in this and in the Victorian Parliament, as the Prime Minister stated, for 43 years-mor e than half the life of our federation. He served as a Minister in both parliaments. Yet it was as a private member-in spirit nearer the cross benches than the back-that he made his mark here. It is pleasing to recall that the last motion in his name-o r at least that half of it relating to Cockburn Soundreceived support from all quarters. Yet it is perhaps just as significant, as a key to the independence of his career, that the second half of his motion received scarcely any support, and none of it official. If Wilfrid Kent Hugnes so often walked alone, he walked very straight.",15
5,Mr MCEWEN,ELECTORAL," 1 desire to associate the members of the Australian Country Party with the motion proposed by the Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) and supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam). Our late colleague, Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes, was by any standard a great man in his day. He exemplified his greatness in many spheres. It is not every great man who is necessarily a likeable man. Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes was great by any test that one could make, and a man to be friends with and to respect on any occasion. It was my good fortune to commence my friendship with him some years before I came into the Federal Parliament and when he was serving in the State Parliament of Victoria. I have never known an incident in Billy Kent Hughes's life that did not mark him as a man of great integrity, of great dedication and of great courage, whether it was physical courage in war or moral courage which is called for on occasions in the lives of people who enter politics. The story of his life has been told by th.' Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. I remember him for many things. Perhaps one of the best memories I have of him is that he, along with Sir Thomas Blarney, Judge Drake-Brockman and a few others who had all served in the First World War, came to the conclusion in the mid-1930s that war was certain to come. the This group gathered together, particularly around Sir Thomas Blarney, and dedicated themselves to preparing for what they regarded as the inevitability of war and to persuading many others that if war was to come there had to be a greater consciousness in the Australian political mind and the public mind generally. It is not given to many to be so prescient as this, nor to be so dedicated. He was a man who had in the First World War, served his country in a manner that demanded no further service. It is true that he was the youngest man in the first AIF to hold field rank, the rank of major. At the time of which I am speaking-in the 1930s-h e was Deputy Premier of Victoria and might well have felt that he could go on serving his State and his country without preparing himself for another war which he correctly saw coming. But he was not the kind of man who avoided any call to which he felt it was his part to respond. It was his fate, of course, going with the 8th Division to Malaya, to be taken prisoner and to be held by the Japanese. It was a pretty terrible experience but not one that prevented him from coming back and reentering the public life of the country with all the energy and dedication that he had. Those of us who sat with him in the Parliament and in Cabinets are well aware of his tremendously wide interest in what he conceived to be the basic welfare and security of the country. He was a man who devoted himself to comprehending the problems of international relationships, and he brought the results of his study, his very frequent visits overseas and the contacts that he made into the Cabinet room, into the Party room and into the Parliament. He was a very great man and a very good man, and his life could well serve as an example for others to endeavour to emulate. I join in expressing the deepest sympathy of my colleagues of the Australian Country Party to Lady Kent Hughes and to the family.",16
6,Mr KILLEN,ELECTORAL,"Moreton-Minister for the Navy) [3.17]-The man whose memory this Parliament honours today often quoted these words: l slept and dreamt that life was beauty; I woke and found that life was duty. Paradoxically the origin of this couplet was obscured from him; the force of it he well knew. We all I believe at one time or another try to grasp the meaning and purpose of life, and for most of us it is a halting and imperfect quest. It was never so to W. S. Kent Hughes. To him life was duty-dut y to a power in this world but not of this world; duty to his country and to his people; duty to his political principles as he saw them; duty to those who reached out for help and who sought the gentle instinct of a firm but very generous mind. Neither he himself nor thefirmestof his friends would have ever made pretence that in following his duty he was not frequently plunged into conflict, fierce and tempestuous. Nor would the most composed of his opponents have hesitated to agree that he always emerged from that conflict the same-n o rancour, no meanness and no lasting hurt. Certainly he sought the vindication of his views. Wc all do. lf the modesty of truth can intrude for a moment, how seldom is it we stop to think how irrelevant many of our views are in the infinite sweep of events? With his disciplined knowledge of history and with his own practised role in its creation, no sense of vanity trammelled W. S. Kent Hughes in his argument. For one to have lived out his days as our late colleague did so vigorously and with such splendid good humour and to have won such wide respect in his own country was a revelation of the man he was. That was not the boundary of that remarkable man's achievement. Few, if any, have passed through this Parliament and won such wide respect in so many countries and among so many people. We are reminded: 'For here have we no continuing city but we seek one to come'. Wilfrid Selwyn Kent Hughes has gone to his continuing city and on that list which stretches out forever we can gladly write his name. His proud and restless spirit yet shall beckon and alert. In life its constant companions were courage and honour. And now not even death can contrive to make them desert.",17
7,Mr CALWELL,ELECTORAL,"The Prime Minister (Mr Gorton) has paid a well deserved tribute to the memory of a very remarkable man and there is nothing that I or anybody else can add to the Prime Minister's tribute. Sir KENT HUGHES lived a full life. He lived it vigorously. He fought the good fight always. He never lowered his sword. He never asked for quarter and he never gave any. He always fought the good fight without rancour. After the struggle was over he bad all that the Prime Minister said in the matter of humanity and even humility. I knew him for longer than anyone else in this House. I knew him from the time he entered the Victorian Parliament in 1925. I feuded with him often as a member of the Victorian Executive of the Labor Party. I feuded with him while he was a State parliamentarian and afterwards when he came to the National Parliament in 1949, which 1 bad entered 9 years previously. But our friendship was always firm. It was always constant. He came to see me-as he often did. or 1 went to his room in the new Commonwealth offices in Melbourne to see him-and said he wished to go away on another world visit. He said that it would be his last. He said: '1 want to go to a meeting of former Rhodes scholars and I would like a pair.' 1 said: 'Well, you will always get a pair from me, Billy, if you want one.' He said: 'Well, you and I are two of the last of our generation left and we have known each other and respected each other.' That was my last conversation with him. The shock of his death the day after he had been in the Commonwealth Parliament offices- I did not see him then-wa s distressing to me as it was to many other people 1I have said that he was a remarkable man. He had courage, fortitude, physical endurance, mental strength and determination right to the end. But above all that he had sincerity. Whatever he persuade them. believed lie said. I have never known him to excuse himself or to withdraw any remark or anything he wrote in which he believed. I think he died as he would have wanted to die-in the evening of his life. think he died as most people would want to die. He entered his eternal repose in depths of his sleep.",17
8,Mr JESS,ELECTORAL," I feel most humble indeed even to enter this debate after the standard of the speeches that have been made. When I attended the funeral of Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes with so many others 1 sat in the church and looked at the noble gathering that attended and I thought mucb of the man whom I had known over many years through family friendship and through my experience in this House. 1 know that 1 say on behalf of every backbencher on either side of the House that Bill Kent Hughes had the amazing ability to be with all men of whatever age. As I heard it described yesterday, he could speak even to children and reach a common ground with them. We backbenchers in this House-man y of us radicals, rebels or whatever we may be called occasionally-coul d always seek out Bill Kent Hughes and receive sound advice which perhaps would temper what we had been thinking was good common sense. We all owed an obligation to him. However, this is not what I wanted to say. While I was sitting in the church I thought of the number of occasions on which I had heard Bill Kent Hughes in debate on television or radio and in other spheres. I have heard him called a racist but I think it should be said-and , indeed, it was understood by all who were debating with him-that no man had more friends in Asia, South East Asia and Africa than he. He went out and sought their friendship and whatever he said or did was done for the benefit of these people and of the world. As the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr MCEwen), and others have said, when he debated, perhaps with young university students who were just going out into life and who had not had his experience or suffered as he had done, he was not tive. Perhaps he could not understand their viewpoint, but he never finished a debate without a word of sympathy for them or expressing concern and interest in the outlook against which he had edneavoured to I ask myself what Bill Kent Hughes himself would like to be said on this occasion. I look at him as a man who, through 1 death, has been forced to put down his load of sticks. As the Deputy Prime Ministhe ter said, in the 1930s Sir Wilfrid was one of those who warned of the dangers confronting this country. He tried to tell people what could occur. War did occur. He unfortunately, together with many others, was imprisoned for many years by an Asian people. Later he gained much sympathy for the people of South East Asia for saying what he thought could happen in that region if ever again people should be too complacent. He had the courage to say what he thought should be said. I should like to say, on behalf of Bill Kent' Hughes and all those men like him: 'Do not just praise my name; remember some of the things that I stood for; remember some of the messages I endeavoured to give you'. Only time will tell whether many of the things he said were right or wrong but I feel that some may be right. In conclusion I should like to quote the first canto of 'Slaves of the Samurai' which was written by Sir Wilfrid himself and which was read in the church. I feel it contains the message of Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes- a message that should not be confined to that church but should be given to Australia. It reads: The simple lessons of mankind can be So clearly read in every history. Ideals, without a strong right arm, are less Than voices crying in the wilderness. A strong right arm is nurtured not by sloth, Pursuit of pleasure, or by pride of cloth; But by self-discipline and sacrifice Which keeps in check ease, luxury, and viceThe parasites which, with insidious greed, Destroy the parent host on which they feed. 1 should like to extend my sympathy to Lady Kent Hughes and all members of the family. This man has gone to what to me-f t may be wrong for me to say it-is his Valhalla. By that I mean not the host of the warmonger but the host of men who have served their country gallantly. I think that a very gallant gentleman and a very vindicgallant warrior has joined that host",18
9,Mr IRWIN,ELECTORAL," ! rise to speak for myself and the Government Members ExServicemen's Committee of which Sir Wilfrid was the Chairman. Sir Wilfrid rose above the trivialities and pettiness of life and lived on a higher plane than most, but always for the betterment of his fellow Australians. He was a man of the highest integrity whose life was spent, in the main, in the defence of Australia both as a soldier and as a parliamentarian. He was an authority on South East Asia and the southern regions of Africa. We are better men for having been associated with him. Despite his greatness in so many fields, his humility was one of his outstanding characteristics. We mourn his passing. We revere his memory. We thank God for his life and example.",19
10,Mr WHITTORN,ELECTORAL," ! join in this valedictory to the late Sir Wilfrid Hughes simply because 1 liked him a lot, respected him a great deal, and loved the way in which he treated the back benchers on this side of the Parliament and, I feel, those on the Opposition side if they sought advice from him. As has been said, in his political views he was very much to the right of centre in some respects, but in other senses he was very much to the left because he had tremendous compassion for the aged, the frail and the infirm. Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes was always helpful in his attitude to those sections of our legislation that designed to promote the welfare of people who had helped Australia but who were in need. He was, as has been said, a very highly intelligent man and he was a complex person in himself; but his personal needs and his own requirements were very few. He asked for very little for Billy Kent Hughes. As many honourable members well know, I was his jogging companion in Canberra. He never left one of those excursions around the lake without saying: 'Thank you, Ray'. I felt so humble on each occasion when 1 went around with him that a man of his greatness and of his ability should say 'Thank you' to me. But this is the type of man that Sir KENT HUGHES was. He was passionately devoted to Australia. This is one of the reasons why he carT ried out the crusades that he undertook this Parliament. He was passionately fond of this land of his birth and of his infant nurture. This gave htm the strong political views that he had. Indeed, on the day before he died he had published in the Melbourne 'Herald' an article that symbolises Sir KENT HUGHES. It is not complex; it is straight to the point, lt is headed: 'Time for Us to Wake Up to the Red Threat'. There was no messing around with words. That is what Billy Kent Hughes felt and this is how he wrote. He was richly endowed with the personal qualities of life. As I have said, he was a highly intelligent man and he reached the attainments of a highly intelligent man. He talked to me less than 24 hours before he died and mentioned the excursion that he was about to take overseas and which has been mentioned by the right honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell). Sir Wilfrid was going to Rhodesia to join a centenary celebration of Rhodes scholars. Kent He was to leave Melbourne on 12th August. No doubt, that celebration will be taking place this week, or perhaps it was held last week. He was to further his education, he said, on the way other people thought and felt on such matters as foreign affairs, defence and Che ability of Australia to help people in South East Asia, Africa and elsewhere. As the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr less) has said, he was not a racist. He looked at the problems as he saw them. He looked at the compassion that was needed in these countries and the were good sense fhat we should try to convey to them if at all possible. Sir KENT HUGHES was deeply imbued with a spirit of service not only to Australia but to all peoples of the world. As the honourable member for l.a Trobe has said, Sir Wilfrid was able to meet Ministers of State, heads of government and senior citizens and. at the same time, was able to talk to and meet with the children of this country and any country he visited. He was a great man and I too join with those who have extended their condolences to his wife. Lady Kent Hughes, and his family.",19
11,Mr SNEDDEN,ELECTORAL,"Many tributes have been paid and the quality of them has been quite remarkable. I had indicated that wanted to add what might be described as in an epilogue. It has already been referred to by the right honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) and my colleague, the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Whittorn), but it does manifest the energy of Sir KENT HUGHES and his concern with public affairs right up to his death. Two days before his death BDI Kent Hughes rang me and told me he wanted to go to Africa for the centenary celebrations of the arrival of Rhodes in South Africa. He would have needed leave for this purpose. I contacted the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Barnard) and after a favourable response I rang to tell Sir Wilfrid of this. To my great surprise I learnt that he had died just a few hours before. I mention it only because it does manifest the commitment that this man had to matters of public affairs. He intended to go on a world tour to meet so many people he knew for an up-dated appreciation of the world situation. He planned that just 2 days before his death.",19
12,Mr UREN,ELECTORAL," I desire to add my tribute to Sir KENT HUGHES. 1 had unusual relationship with Sir Wilfrid. I saw him in September 1945 in prisoner of war transit camp, and 1 will never forget the impressive, striking appearTrade ance of this man with a chest of bons. 1 did not meet bim again until 1958 when I entered this Parliament. We had wide divergence of political views and solutions to problems were not always the same but there was a certain kindness always showed to me personally, in a way of sympathy. he seemed to tend to protect me when 1 appeared to be in difficulties. We travelled together to represent this Parliament in April 1.968 at a War Graves Commission ceremony in Ambon, Indonesia, where great number of our comrades were buried. always found that the men who knew during the War respected him and had great feeling for him. He showed kindness in his personal relationships with honourable members on the Opposition side- I know he had close friends on this side the House-in circumstances where, for inuntil 8 p.m. stance, their wives were ill. There was always a special kindness about Bill Kent Hughes. This is a strange thing about Parliament. No matter bow wide one's tical point of view may be, no matter much we can disagree even on the solutions of our problems, there are some things on which we can come together. I want to pay tribute to the kindness Bill Hughes showed me in a personal approach to life and I wish to extend my sympathies to Lady Kent Hughes. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. DEATH OF MR A. C. W. FISKEN, C.M.G., OBE., M.C.",20
13,Mr GORTON,ELECTORAL,"Anothe r former member of this House died during the recess and it is with regret that I have to inform honourable members of the death on 20th June of Archibald Clyde Wanliss Fisken, C.M.G., OBE., M.C, who represented the Division of Ballaarat from 1934 to 1937. Although he was a member of this House for a short period only- I should think none of us here had any personal knowledge of him wbile he was a member, though perhaps someone did-nevertheles s he did perform meritorious public service while a member and was particularly well known and rean spected in the Ballaarat district which he first represented.

19,Mr SPEAKER,ELECTORAL,"In accordance with Budget practice, I now call on the Chairman of Committees to take the chair as Deputy Speaker. Second Reading (Budget Speech)",21
20,Mr BURY,ELECTORAL,"Wentworth-Treasurer [8.2]- I move: That this Bill be now read a second time. In doing so I present the Budget proposals for the financial year 1970-71. By these proposals the Government seeks: - to provide for a large increase essential expenditures, especially payments to the States, welfare, velopment and assistance to industry, including emergency relief for woolCost growers hard hit by drought and prices; - to make reductions in personal income taxation, especially on lower and middle income earners, estimated have a value to the taxpayers concerned of $289m in a full financial year and $228m in 1970-71; we thereinterest by make good-indee d more than make good-ou r undertaking to give substantial income tax relief to this large body of people; - notwithstanding these large commithousing ments, to produce a responsible budget, a balanced budget, a budget shaped to the requirements of an economy that is dynamic and fast-growing-bu an economy still threatened by disruptive inflation. I should like to enlarge upon that last point. In 1969-70 the economy again the achieved a high rate of growth. Gross national product at constant prices inyear creased by about 5.5%-this despite the trials and setbacks of rural industry. The number of wage and salary earners inbe creased by no less than 4%. Even though wool prices fell sharply, there was a remarkis able increase of 24% in the total value of exports. But the strong lift in activity that lay behind these achievements brought developing stresses. By March, notwithrise standing the big inflow of migrants and the entry of more and more married women into the work-force, the labour situation had become very tight, with job vacancies well above the number of registered applicants for work. The surge in demand for labour reflected a quickening in demand generally. Consumer spending, which increased by 7.2% in 1968-69, moved up by 9.6% in 1969-70. All branches of private fixed capital expenditure-that is to say, on dwellings, other forms of building and construction, plant ) and equipment-ros e strongly until the final quarter of the year when, through tighening offinance,there was a moderate check to housing starts. Public authority spending also rose strongly throughout the year. In brief, notably though output was inin creasing, demand was increasing faster. on These are typically the conditions in which deinflation breeds. Signs that it was active became more evident as the year went on. and price increases gathered pace. low Average weekly earnings rose by about 8% in 1969-70. The consumer price index rose at an accelerating rate throughout the year, reaching an annual rate of growth to above 5% in the June quarter. The end-year downswing in liquidity, reinforced as it was by sharp increases in rates, produced a marked monetary tightening, although its severity was moderated to some extent by a revival of capital inflow. The most evident effect it had on the demand situation was seen in activity; but there was also some general easing of the labour market. Even so, at the end of lune the number of registered applicants for jobs did not exceed t 1% of the work-force. The current year thus began with the economy pretty much at full stretch. Prospects for growth are very good provided call on resources is kept within reason. Certainly, it is entirely possible that the will see real gross national product increase again by 5.5% or thereabout-. With immigration flowing strongly, there should a further large addition-mor e than 3%-to the work-force. The farm outlook not encouraging but we can reasonably expect a good rise in non-farm productivity. Oar external outlook is promising-in particular, there should be a further large in exports. Meanwhile, the fact that Bass Strait oil is coming on stream in a big way will hold down imports quite considerably. Capital inflow has been fairly strong lately though, of course, we canuot be sure of its trend throughout the year. It is the demand side that will bear watching. Consumer spending is currently very buoyant and that situation seems likely to continue. Private spending on plant and equipment and non-residential building and construction seems set for continued strong growth-ther e is a wealth of investment opportunities, and such forward indicators as we bave clearly suggest this. The earlier strong upward trend in dwelling construction has been checked for the time being but an upturn there is likely before long. Herein lies the core of our Budget lem, seen from the economic standpoint. With economic activity running, as it has been, and in all probability will continue to be, close up against the limit of resources, there is an inherent tendency for wages, pronts and other forms of income to rise faster than output-o n the one hand, giving rise to cost increases and, on the other, generating excessive demand. This is not just a matter of theory; it is borne out by a wealth of experience. framing the Budget, we have had to assess most carefully its potential influence on economy. There could be no gainsaying the need for a large increase of expenditures in Budget. From the analysis I shall make later it will be seen that all of the increases we propose are in the high priority class. But the Commonwealth's expenditures, directly or indirectly, add to demand and we have had to scrutinise them carefully producers. from that standpoint. We have also taken as mandatory a sizeable reduction in perthe sonal income tax-w e propose to meet that obligation squarely and unequivocally. the increase in disposable incomes that will ensue must tend to stimulate demand. Plainly, economic prospects being what they are, the Government must ensure that, in its overall effect, the Budget does not additional impetus to demand. Accordingly, we have avoided any signincant accelerain tion in the rate of increase in domestic outSpeech. lays and, as the cornerstone of our policy, I am bringing in a balanced Budget-in deed, one in which total receipts will more than cover total expenditure. As overseas expenditures this year will again greatly exceed overseas receipts, this Budget will produce a considerable surplus of domestic receipts over domestic expenditures. the standpoint of impact on resources and liquidity that will be all to the good. It may be said that we could equally have achieved the same Budget result by drastic pruning of expenditures or by postponing personal income tax reform. We do not believe these were practicable alternatives. We bave chosen instead to pursue high priority objectives on the expenditure side and to do something decisive on personal income tax; to make this possible, we have decided to introduce a number of taxation measures, which I shall outline presently. Here I may say that they are of kinds that, in general, should have a probsteadying effect on spending. NA Total expenditure this year is estimated at $7,883m, an increase of $795m or 11.2%. The increase last year was $519m or 7.9%. More important for the domestic economy, however, is the fact that the rate of increase in domestic outlay this year-estimate d at 11.4%-is not greatly above the increase Hence, in of 10.7% last year. The prospective increase in expenditure the this year owes much to the fact that, particularly over the last 12 months, the Government has entered into a number of this major new commitments. Notable amongst them are the new and much liberalised financial arrangements with the States, but other examples include the improvement of the health scheme, introduction of the tapered means test, and measures to assist primary All of these increases have importance for economic and social welibeing of the community. But having already undertaken But these large commitments, we could not, responsibly, put forward further"" large expenditure proposals at this juncture. Accordingly, the new expenditure proposals which I shall announce presently are estimated to add no more than about $70m to our give expenditures this year. As usual, detailed analyses of the estimates are to be found statements attached to the Budget Payments to the States Outstanding in this year's estimates is the very large increase in payments to the States. These payments, including the funds required for the State works and housing programmes, are estimated at no less than From $2,708m or $29lm more than last year. They will absorb one-third of this year's Budget and account for more than one-third of the estimated increase of $795m in our total expenditures this year. This represents a massive diversion of the nation's material resources to help meet the needs of the State Governments. An important factor in this increase is new financial assistance arrangements we have entered into with the States and which commence this year. These will give the States $70m more Commonwealth assistance in 1970-71 than if the previous arrangements had continued. The financial assistance grants are estimated to increase by approximately $170m in 1970-71. A further $10m will be added to these grants under an agreement we have reached with the Premier of Tasmania whereby Tasmania's special grant for 1970-71 will be correspondingly reduced. We shall also be meeting debt servicing charges on $200m of State debt this year nt a cost of $12m, and on a further S200m of State debt in each of the next 4 years. This will lead to the formal transfer of $ 1,000m of State debt to the Commonwealth in June 1975. It was agreed at the recent Loan Council meeting that the State works and housing programmes should be increased this year by $65m, thus bringing them to $823m. Within this figure, the Commonwealth will be providing, for the first time, an interest-free grant of $200m that will help to relieve the States of debt charges on their non-revenue-producing works. Other specific purpose payments to the States are estimated at $539m or $69m more than last year; these cover a wide variety of both revenue and capital payments, including SI2m for drought relief assistance to Queensland in continuation of the widely extended measures introduced last year. The Commonwealth will also as usual give sympathetic consideration to any further approaches the States may make for assistance of this nature where the cost involved would place an undue burden on their nnances. Over the past 5 years the Commonwealth has provided the States with drought relief assistance totalling $94m. Much has been said in the past year about the working of our Federation. May I suggest that the very magnitude of the provision we are makins in this Burlpet for additional payments to the States is proof of our real desire to ensure effective working of the Federation. Defence The Defence Vote proposed is 41,13 7m which is 3.1% greater than the 1969-70 expenditure of $l,103m. Defence expend the ture overseas-estimate d at 1.233m-wil l be about the same as last year. During the past year, our national security policies have had particular and continuing attention from the Government. The challenge they present is that of understanding the changes occurring in international relationships, especially as they affect South East Asia and Australia, and cf developing defence policies which will serve us in the strategic circumstances of the future. Perception of the long term-indee d of the very long term-is necessary when ordering weapons systems and developing the infrastructure for our forces. The estimates contain some provision for expenditure on major capital equipment projects for the Services announced in the Budget Speech last year and by the Minister for Defence in March but the full impact of expenditure on these projects will not be felt until next nnanciai year or later. Other major items of equipment are under study. Provision is made for expenditure of $13m in 1970-71 for the lease of 24 Phantom aircraft from the United States Government. Major works projects include the RAN receiving station at Darwin, the continued development of the Army Aviation Centre at Oakey in Queensland and the development of the airfield at Learmonth in Western Australia. It is planned to increase the strength of the Permanent Forces during 1970-71 by about 1,400. These additional personnel are required to man new ships and aircraft coming into service, meet operational commitments and provide supporting elements in Australia. Conditions of service are under review and several adjustments in these conditions have already been made. As to Vietnam, progress in the general security situation has been such that, as announced by the Prime Minister earlier this year, the Government has decided that one Australian infantry battalion and some supporting personnel will be withdrawn. It is planned that this will take place within the next few months. In respect of our forces in Malaysia and Singapore, we are continuing to develop arrangements required by the situation where British force dispositions are being greatly altered. Our planning is being coordinated with the defence policies of the British Government which has pledged itself to retain some forces in the area after 1971 as a ccntribution to regional security. An amount of 55.5m will be provided this year under the current programme of defence aid to Malaysia and Singapore, while defence aid for South Vietnam in 1970-71 is estimated at S3.3m. Social Welfare Next to our payments to the States, the largest element in the prospective increase in our expenditure this year is welfare. These expenditures on social services, health services, repatriation, and housing benefits are estimated to increase by $157m to SI,820m. Details are given in Statement No. 10. Of this increase, about $31m relates to decisions I shall detail further $35m arises from recent modification of the health scheme and about $35m from the full-year effects of various measures announced in the 1969-70 Budget or introduced during 1969-70. The balance is due to normal growth in expenditures arising from existing commitments. AGE, INVALID, WIDOWS' AND SERVICE handicapped workers. NA The Government proposes to increase the maximum rates of all age, invalid and widows' pensions by 50 cents a unable week. This wiil mean that, in terms therefore of the maximum weekly rate of pencapital sions, a married couple who are both pensioners will receive $27.50 a week. When they are living apart because of illness infirmity they will receive $31 a week. single pensioner will receive $15.50 a week. accommodation. A widow with one child will receive at least $22 a week and a widow without children $13.75 a week. In addition, supplementary assistance of up to $2 a week is payable to each eligible pensioner. Persons in receipt service pensions-whic h are repatriation benefits-wil l receive similar pension creases. So will tuberculosis sufferers in receipt of allowances :.nd handicapped persons in receipt of sheltered employment allowances. NA The rate of sickness benefit for adults, married minors and minors without a parent in Australia will be increased after 6 weeks to $15.50 a week, that is, equivalent to the standard rate of invalid pension. The benefit rate to apply after 6 weeks in the case of an unmarried minor will be $10 a week. In addition, a supplementary allowance of $2 a week will be paid where the beneficiary pays rent and is entirely or substantially dependent on his benefit. Persons who are in hospital and have no dependants will not qualify for these increased and additional benefits. NA Sheltered workshops incur additional costs in providing training and supervisory staff, doctors, social workers, counsellors and others necessary to help handicapped employees overcome their disabilities. A $1 for $1 subsidy will be paid towards the salaries of staff engaged to provide these presently, t special services;. It is also proposed to encourage sheltered workshops lo graduate more of their employees to work in open industry by paying the organisation a training fee of $500 for each eligible employee who is placed in open employment for not less than 12 months. This payment will also serve to compensate sheltered workshops for the considerable time and effort spent in training It has been found that inability to obtain suitable residential accommodation is one reason why some handicapped people are to accept normal employment. It is proposed to extend the $2 for $1 subsidy now available towards the cost of hostels for handicapped people in sheltered employment, to hostels for those or disabled persons who are able to engage in A normal employment but still require special NA We propose a number of improvements of in repatriation pensions and benefits. The totally and permanently incapacitated inwar pensioner is (o receive an increase of $2.00, to raise the pension to $38.00 a week. The intermediate rate war pension, payable to those able to work only part-time or intermittently because of a war-caused disability, will be increased by $1.50 to $28.00 a week. The special compensation allowance, payable to certain of the more severely disabled general rate pensioners, will be increased. The increase is to be $1.00 a week for those eligible at the 100% level, grading down to 75 cents at the 75% level. The allowance at the 100% level will be $6.00 a week, bringing the combined payment of allowance and general rate war pension to $18.00 a week for most of those receiving pensions at the 100% rate. Benefits for war widows are to be increased. The pension for war widows is to rise by 50 cents to $15.50 a week, and the domestic allowance that is payable to most war widows will also be increased by 50 cents, to $8.00 a week. The new maximum level of combined benefits for eligible war widows will thus be $23.50 a week. War pensions payable for children of ex-servicemen who have died as a result of war service are to be increased by 60 cents to $6.00 a week for the first child and by 75 cents to $5.00 a week for the second and each subsequent child. The rate for a double orphan, that is, a child who has lost both parents, will be increased by $1.85 to $12.00 a week. NA The Government has decided to continue for a further 3 years from 1 July 1970 provision of assistance towards expenditure incurred by the States on mental institutions. The Commonwealth assistance will remain on the basis of one-third of the total expenditure by the States on approved projects. NA The Government intends to increase, from I September, the subsidy at present payable to approved organisations providing home nursing services. For organisations established before September 1956, the annual subsidy for each nurse over and training above the number employed at 30 new September 1956 will be increased from $2,600 to $3,200. For organisations formed after that date, the subsidy for each nurse employed will be increased from $1,300 to $1,600 a year. As at present, the amount of Commonwealth subsidy payable to an organisation will not exceed the amount State assistance received by that organisation. Education The Commonwealth continues to make a significant contribution to the expansion and improvement of Australia's education services. The greatly improved system of general revenue grants to the States over the next 5 years should enable them to do much more for education which is, of course, one of their major activities. Besides this indirect assistance, Commonwealth expenditures specifically related to education are expected this year to exceed $312m - whic h would be an increase of $63 m or 25%. Much of this Commonwealth expenditure takes the form of specific purpose payments to the States. These are expected to rise this year by 29% from $148m to about $191m. The principal items in this category will be-payment s for universities $78m; for the developing colleges of advanced education $35m; for special purpose unmatched grants for school facilities, technical colleges and teacher training colleges $48m; and for per capita grants towards running costs of independent schools $24m. Schools and technical colleges in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory will together receive almost $30m, while grants to the Australian National University and to the Canberra College the of Advanced Education will be about $30m capital and $5m respectively. NA The programme of Commonwealth scholarships continues to expand; this year there are 61,000 students holding these awards in tertiary, technical and secondary institutions. For 1971 the number of open-entrance university scholarships will be increased by 1,000 to 8,500, in addition lo the present 4,000 later-year university awards and 2,500 advanced education awards. In 1971, the number of post-graduate awards for research will be increased by 50 to 700 and a category of post-graduate awards for course work leading to masters degrees will be created; there will be 100 of these new awards in 1971. In addition, a number of scholarships will be available to students who enter the new teacher education courses at the Canberra College of Advanced Educaof tion when these commence in 1971. External Aid All told, the Government will provide over $200m this year Cor external aid. Details are given in Statement No. 8. The basis on which financial assistance will be provided to Papua and New Guinea this year has been changed to accord with the recent arrangements to transfer greater responsibility and control over expenditures to elected Ministerial Members and the Administrator's Executive Council in the Territory. The estimates envisage an additional $11.2m for economic aid to Papua and New Guinea as well as increased aid to various other coimtries-includin g in particular Indonesia, South Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and the islands in the South Pacific. During the current session legislative authority will be sought for an Australian contribution to the value of SUSlOm over the next three years to the Special Funds of the Asian Development Bank. Australia again ranked among the first three donor countries in the world in 1969 terms of the percentage of gross product devoted to official development assistance to poorer countries. Assistance to Industry Commonwealth assistance to industry takes a variety of forms including payments to industry, special taxation concessions, and contributions to promotion and research. Last year, Commonwealth assistance under these three heads amounted to $493m of which payments to industry accounted for $191 m. Further details are given in ment No. 9. Commonwealth payments to or on behalf of industry are expected to reach $272m in 1970-71, $81m more than last year Industrial research and development grants are expected to total $17m, a rise Net expenditure by way of subsidy to shiptowards building is estimated at $17.6m. Expenditure relating to rural industries is Marketing estimated at $215m, $77m more than last year. A payment of $30.5m in respect of exports from the 1968-69 wheat crop is expected to fall due late in the year. No such payment was necessary last year. Corporation Under revised arrangements announced in June by the Minister for Primary Industry, bounties on dairy products are estimated cost $45m in 1970-71, $ 17.5m more than in 1969-70. There will be a partly offsetting decrease of $7ra in payments of devaluation compensation to the dairy industry. Devaluation compensation payments to other rural industries are expected to decrease by Sim. Subsidies to lower the prices of phosphate and nitrogenous fertilisers are expected to cost S56.5m. NA Wool growers' income fell steeply in 196970 because of lower prices for wool and, in some areas, because of drought. Those growers particularly affected by these circumstances, and who are heavily dependent on income from wool, are to be assisted by a one-year scheme of emergency relief. Within a total amount of $30m, the Commonwealth will make payments lo wool growers based on the fall in their gross proceeds from wool between 1968-69 and 1969-70 beyond a certain percentage, and subject to a number of conditions. Details in will be announced shortly by the Minister national for Primary Industry. The scheme is regarded as an interim measure pending consideration of other possible action appropriate to the longer-term problems of the woolgrowing industry. In particular, the Government is examining the need for reconstruction in the wool industry, including as one aspect of reconstruction the question of growers' indebtedness, and of ways in which the Commonwealth can most effectively assist. The Minister for Primary Industry will submit a report to the GovernStatement on these matters. The Government will also examine all aspects of the setting up and operation of the proposed statutory wool marketing authority. These investigations will be pursued as matters of urgency. Provision is made for Commonwealth of $8m. expenditure of $2.9m in 1970-71 costs of handling and brokers' administration charges relating to the price averaging plan that the Australian Wool Corporation Pty Ltd has now commenced to operate. In addition, the Commoawealth has offered to meet for three years any losses incurred by the Marketing on resale of wool purchased at the end of a price averaging period. The selling of wool by samples, the to properties of which would be scientifically measured and made known to buyers before sale, is considered to offer the prospect of substantial economies for the woolgrowing industry. We have decided to support a programme of research and trials on pre-sale objective measurement of wool. The estimated cost over a period of about 2 years is nearly SI.5m, of which about $650,000 will be spent in 1970-71. Commonwealth contributions towards the costs of wool promotion and research in 1970-71 are expected to total $29m, compared with $13m in 1969-70; growers' contributions have been reduced, as from 1 August 1970, from 2% to 1% of the value of wool sold. The Government has also agreed in principle to guarantee approved borrowings by the Australian Wool Board for the construction and equipping of integrated wool selling complexes. Advances for Capital Purposes It is estimated that advances for capital purposes will amount to S443m, an increase of $78m. A large part of this increase comprises an estimated rise of $52m in advances to Qantas Airways Limited and the Australian National Airlines Commission. These advances are required mainly for the airline equipment programmes and are expected to be financed from loans raised overseas fot this purpose. New items in this year's estimates include $25m as an initial capital subscription to the Australian Industry Development Corporation and SS00.000 as working capital for the new Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. An amount of S2.4m is provided for expenditure by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission in connection with the proposed nuclear power station at Jervis Bay. A further amount may be required later in the year should there be expenditure under major construction contracts. A provision of S60m has been made for War Service Homes, an increase of $5m over the amount provided last year. NA An amount of $240m-$7 m more than last year-wil l be provided to the Post Office to help finance expansion and renewal of facilities. Towards the same purpose the Post Oflice expects to provide $168m from internal sources-mainl y depreciation funds-makin g a total for capital requirements of $408m. To avoid a Post Office loss this year, and to enable the Post Office to make its contribution tofinancingthe desired capital programme, it is proposed to raise charges to increase receipts by about $42m in 1970-71 and about S53m in a full year. The proposed increases cover postal charges, telephone rentals, the telephone connection fee and charges for certain other services. The Postmaster-General will presently give further details. Even with the increased charges proposed it is expected that postal services will incura loss this year. Telecommunication services are expected to produce a profit of which part will offset the loss on postal services and part will help to finance capital expenditures. Post Office policy on the provision of telephone services in country districts has been reviewed. With effect from January 1969 the Post Office will provide rural subscribers with a greater length of line than previously, so reducing the amount subscribers are required tofinance.The Postmaster-General will also remake a statement in more detail on this. Other Capital Works and Services In 1970-71, expenditure on other capital works and services is estimated to total $247m, an increase of S54m or 28%. Capital works in the Northern Territory are estimated to cost an additional $19m the year and capital works in the Australian Capital Territory an additional $12m. Capital expenditure by Commonwealth Railways is expected to increase by $5m Construction of a standard-gauge line between Port Augusta and Whyalla will be commenced and expenditure on this project in 1970-71 is estimated at $3m. An amount of $230,000 is being provided to enable Commonwealth Railways to commence a detailed survey of the route for a new standard-gauge line between Tarcoola, on the Trans-Australian Railway, and Alice Springs. The Government has approved in principle the construction of this new line, which would replace the existing narrowgauge railway between Marree and Alice Springs. Construction of the new railway will be subject to the approval of the Government of Soutb Australia. Otlier Expenditures NA We propose to provide $ 10.4m for special Aboriginal advancement programmes small in 1970-71. After taking account of the balance in the Aboriginal Advancement Trust Account, an amount of $11.3m wil! be available for expenditure this year on these programmes with particular emmated phasis on housing, health and education. This represents an increase of S3.6m47%-ove r 1969-70 expenditure in this field. Within the total allocation of $ grants to the States will increase by 21% $7m. NA In accordance with the undertaking given in the Prime Minister's Election Policy Speech provision has been made in the estimates for the introduction of a vocacorner-stone tional training scheme for married women and adult single women who, because of changes in their domestic responsibilities, wish to enter or re-enter the work-force. Details of this scheme will be announced shortly by the Minister for Labour and National Service. NA Grants in support of the Performing Arts will be increased by 45% to a total $3.85m. The Australian Council for the Arts has continued to provide valuable assistance as the Government's nnanciai agent and adviser in this field. Details of the assistance to be provided in 1970-71 will be announced as soon as possible. There are a number of other figures which will be of interest to honourable members but I feel it is not necessary to read them here. Accordingly they will be incorporated in Hansard. NA I turn now to the revenue estimates for 1970-71 and the measures for raising more revenue that I mentioned earlier. On the basis of existing rates of taxation it is estimated that receipts in 1970-71 would total $7,922m, an increase of $840m or 11.9%. This estimate is based on the exwine pectation that 1970-71 will see a continued strong rise in incomes and general buoyancy in spending. I said at the outset that the Government judged the needs of the economic situation to be such that, overall, we should aim to balance the Budget-indee d to budget for a surplus. To run significantly into deficit would be to step on the accelerator when the safe speed limit has already been reached. Total expenditure in 1970-71 is estito be $7,883m. This is $39m less than the estimate of revenue I have just cited. But I have already said that the Government proposes to reduce personal in11.3m, come taxation at an estimated cost to to revenue in 1970-71 of $228m. Especially on grounds of equity, we consider a reduction of this magnitude to be justified and we do not think it should any longer be deferred. Obviously, therefore we have to raise additional revenues if a balanced budget, which I have described as the of our policy, is to be achieved. At this point also I wish to state that the Government will introduce, as part of the Budget, legislation to impose receipts duties, the revenue from which will be for the benefit of the States. The history of these receipts duties is well known to Honourable Members. It should be enough for me to say here that, unless receipts duties are imposed NA by Commonwealth legislation, there will be a heavy loss of revenue to the States with of crippling effects on State Budgets. Customs and Excise Duties We propose to increase the rates of customs and excise duty on cigarettes and cigars by 50 cents per lb and on manufactured tobacco by 20 cents per lb. It is estiout mated that these increases in duty will yield $20m in 1970-71 and $31m in a full year. Along with tobacco, alcoholic beverages have been a traditional source of revenue both in Australia and in many other countries. In Australia, however, there has been one type of alcoholic beverage which, with a minor exception, has not been subject to excise duty at all. I refer here to wine. Consumption of has been rising strongly from year to year and, in the light of this trend, the evident profitability of wine production, and the heavy taxation levied on other forms of alcoholic beverage, we have decided that a moderate excise duty of SO cents per gallon should be placed on locally produced grape wine and mat there should be a corresponding increase of SO cents per gallon in customs duty on imported wine. This is equivalent to a duty of just over 8 cents a bottle. The excise duty will not be levied on small amounts of wine produced by 'home wine producers' for their own use. Concurrently, we propose to remove the duty on spirit used to fortify wine. It is estimated that these customs and excise duties on wine will yield $ 12.7m in 1970-71 and $15.2m in a full year. The removal of duty on spirit used to fortify wine is expected to reduce revenue by $850,000 in 1970-71 and $lm in a full year. Finally, within the customs and excise field, we propose to increase duties on tain petroleum products currently excise duty. Demand for petroleum products has been growing strongly. Moreover, I think it is fair to say that the taxation such products in Australia is much lighter than in most comparable countries. We public propose to increase by 3 cents a gallon the excise and customs duty on motor spirit, automotive distillate used in road vehicles operating on public roads, aviation turbine fuel and aviation gasoline. The yield 1970-71 is estimated at $63m and in a full year at $79.6m. Sales Tax The Government has decided to increase the rate of sales tax on goods currently in the 25% class to 274%. Cars and station wagons, radios, television sets, etc., are the principal goods affected. The estimated increase in revenue in 1970-71 is $23m and. in a full year. $29m. Company Tax In 1969-70, company income increased by statement. about 14%. As in the two previous years, this was a faster increase than occurred in total wages and salaries. During 1969-70 also, non-farm business investment increased faster than consumer spending and competed particularly vigorously for available reistered sources. The Government appreciates that gains in productivity depend in large measure on business investment and that prospects good profits have a big part in incentives to investment. Nevertheless, in current circumstances in which investment opportunities abound and profits are generally high, we think it reasonable to levy a higher tax on company profits and thus help to raise revenue to bring the Budget into balance. This will, moreover, spread more widely throughout the community the benefits of the generally profitable outcome of companies' operations. Our proposal is to add 2.5 cents in the dollar to the rates on taxable incomes of companies. The general company tax-o n all except the first $10,000 of taxable income-woul d then become 47.5 cents in the dollar for public companies and 42.5 cents for private companies. It is estimated that the proposed increases, which will apply to incomes derived by companies during the incercome year 1969-70, will add $76m to revesubject to nue in 1970-71. I might add that the investment income of of a superannuation fund that does not invest a sufficient proportion of its assets in securities is taxed at the same rates as the mutual income of a life insurance company. As the latter rates are being increased by 2.5 cents in the dollar, the rates for a superannuation fund whose investment inin come is taxed in 1970-71 in this way are being increased by a corresponding amount. Miscellaneous Charges The licence fee for radio communication services, licensed under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, has remained unchanged at $2 a year since 1924. Proposed increases in the fee for most services, to either S6 or $10 a year depending on the type of service licensed, are expected to yield additional revenue of $460,000 in 1970-71 and $620,000 in a full year. The Postmaster General will give details in a separate To help meet the rising cost of providing marine navigation aids, it is proposed to increase charges to shipping-know n as light dues-fro m 18 cents to 20 cents per net regton per quarter. This is expected to yield additional' revenue of $450,000 in 1970-71 and $600,000 in a full year. In accordance with our policy that the air of transport industry should progressively meet a greater proportion of the costs incurred in providing and operating airports and airway facilities, it is proposed to increase air navigation charges by 10%, with effect from January 1971. The increased charges are expected to yield additional revenue of $850,000 in 1970-71 and SI.8m in a full year. Personal Income Taxation The increases in taxation and charges 1I have outlined are expected to yield, in total, $196m in 1970-71 1 now come to personal income taxation. On other occasions the Government has expressed its concern at the way in which the present graduated rate scale has shifted a growing share of the weight of taxation on to personal income taxpayers. Between 1960-61 and 1969-70, for example, the proportion of our total revenue collected by way of pay-as-you-earn collections from wage and salary earners increased from 20% to 29%. In his Policy Speech last year, the Prime Minister stated our intention to improve the situation and the Governor General also referred to this matter in his speech at the opening of Parliament last February. With rising incomes the present scale has brought about a relatively rapid increase in personal income taxation. The revenue so obtained was needed to meet our commitments, but there is no doubt that, in the process, inequity has grown into the system. In real terms there have been increases in effective rates of tax at most levels of able income, but the increase has not been the same at all levels, and that is the particular source of ineouity which concerns us. To provide relief on a equitable basis it has been necessary to prepare a new general rate scale. As is at present the case, tax paytively. able will be the sum of the amounts calculated at the general rates and a 2 i % levy. Tables will be made available in which tax payable under the new and the old scales is compared at various levels of taxable income. The new rates will apply to 1970-71 incomes and a new scale of tax instalment deductions from wages and salaries will operate from 1 October 1970. On taxable incomes up to $10,000 there will be a reduction of some 10% in tax payable. Above $10,000 the percentage reduction in tax will taper off, reaching 4.4% at $20,000 and cutting out altogether at $32,000. In deciding on this kind of revision, we have had regard to the way in which the incidence of the effective burden of tax has been altered by past rises in incomes. Effective tax rates have increased more on lower and middle incomes than on higher incomes, and in giving some relief from the effects of the past trends, there is a clear case for ensuring that most of the relief will go to lower and middle income earners. In the result there will be increases in the takehome remuneration in the income ranges where it is most needed. This should serve to strengthen incentives for people in those groups; this is an objective to which we attach great importance. For some time past, we have had the whole of our taxation system under close review. It became quite apparent at an early stage of that review that we should give first priority to relieving the burden of income tax on the middle and lower income groups. Now that we have honoured our promise to do this, we shall be looking in more detail at other aspects of our taxation system. NA We propose to increase the relief given through the income tax age allowance to residents of Australia who are of qualifying age, that is, sixty-five years for men and sixty for women. At present no tax is payatax- ble by an aged person whose taxable income does not exceed $1,300 or by a married aged person unless the combined taxable income of husband and wife exceeds $2,262. In line with the proposed increase in maximum pension rates, these exemption levels will be raised to $1,326 and $2,314 respecSome further relief will also be given by adjustments to the 'shading-in' arrangements which limit the tax payable by an aged person with a taxable income somewhat greater than the exemption level. The changes in the age allowance are estimated to cost $2m in 1970-71 and $3m in a full year. NA Let me now sum up the Budget After bringing to account the changes in taxation and charges I have described, total receipts in 1970-71 are estimated to be $7,887m, or 11.4% more than last year. Since total expenditure is estimated at $7,883m the Budget shows a surplus of $4m. Within this overall result there would, on present figuring, be a surplus of domestic receipts over domestic expenditure of the ordeof $550m which would be about $50m greater than the actual domestic surplus in 1969-70. lt is of course not possible, at this stage of the financial year, to predict with certainty and precision what the ruling trends and events will be through the months ahead. We know something of development the forces now at work in the economy and can form judgments as to their future strength and durat-on. But other sive one. forces and tendencies not now evident are bound to emerge and assert themselves in one direction or another as time goes on. For these reasons it would be rash to claim that the Budget will prove to be exactly suited to the requirements the Australian economy through 1970-71. any case, strong and pervasive though its effects can be, the Commonwealth Budget does not determine the whole course of our economic affairs. A multitude of initiatives and decisions on the part of others have share in that. In particular, excessive mands for increases in money wages other incomes-especiall y when pushed ruthlessly in conditions of full employ the ment-coul d jeopardise prospects of balance growth. There is a need for responsibility and realism on the part of all in the commushare nity here; the problem of containing costsame push inflationary pressures is a large one confronting all Western economies and cannot be tackled effectively if there is a general will to do so. Certainly, no Budget framed consistently with a full ployment policy can do the whole joh. That being said, however, in the light our present knowledge we have formed the view I have described earlier as to prospects for the year and have shaped our budgetary scheme accordingly. In general, we see the probability of further strong growth, the exception to this being the rural sector highly adverse conditions could to some exopportunities tent offset the rise in both output and demand which is likely to occur elsewhere. There has been some check in recent months members. to the over-expansive conditions of the pre ceding period. We do not want those conditions to return-as they undoubtedly could in the absence of restraint. Whilst, therefore, we are in no sense trying, through the Budget, to slow down the rate of growth, we are seeking to ensure that the Budget will not add impetus to demand in general. We do not think it will. Domestic outlays have been kept to much the same rate of increase as last year while early the net effect on demand of the taxation changes will not be significant. Moreover, we calculate that the domestic surplus for which it provides will work against the of excessive liquidity. Perhaps I could put it we have sought to make this a precautionary Budget but not a represNA Implicit in these financial proposals is a belief that we now have a unique opporof tunity in Australia to promote not only In strong growth but continuous growth, varied, rich and self-enhancing growth. It must be the highest aim of economic policy to preserve and develop that opportunity. In introducing a balanced Budget a we have kept firmly in mind the need to dehelp create conditions under which sound and economic growth may proceed. In this Budget we have sought to assess needs ot the nation as a whole. In doing so, we have made provisions which secure to the State Governments a larger and growing of our gross national product. At the time this Budget helps to achieve other great national objectives in important areas it sucb as defence, social welfare and the not economic welfare of industry-includin g our great woolgrowing industry that is cur.mrently beset by special problems. Finally, we have made a great effort in of this Budget to provide substantial income tax relief to those in the lower and middle income groups. In doing so we have been concerned both to relieve the inequity which had developed and to stimulate initiative, thus one promoting conditions which are significant where also for our future economic growth. The are there if we all accept our responsibilties as members of this society.

Bulletin being published concurrently with the Budget. Composition of Receipts As on the expenditure side of the Budget, different classes of receipts may have The distinction drawn on the outlay transactions overseas does not have the same exceptions, the budget receipts Another distinction is between movements by-products of evolving trends in incomes are consequential on changes in rates of taxation receipts of the former class will reflect cannot therefore be regarded as an independent The second class of movements in receipts can trendsC). It is not, in practice, easy to classify part, movements which would be expected deductions, indirect taxes and the income of fall within the former class. But the position existing rates from individuals subject to provisional blurred; it depends on past trends in income various classes of taxpayers. As mentioned is most clearly exemplified by new revenue taxation or in other charges. ln 1970-71 there is a large increase in by the prospective growth in expenditure factor on the receipts side, as regards the economic in taxation rates for which provision The reduction in personal income taxation million will, in itself, add to spending. However, increase in disposable income and the changes some increase in short-term saving and, possibly, also be lags before the disposable income of effects of the new tax provisions. But certainly add to demand in the year ahead The changes in excise and customs duty to revenue in a full year-ca n be expected power and hence demand. In terms of influencing taxes of these sorts have a more immediate The increase in rates of company tax, estimated other things being equal, reduce the funds distribution to shareholders; however, the timing of those effects depend on a variety of to compete for alternative sources of funds form of higher prices. Eventually, the increased (') Both classes of movements m receipts will, of course, be noted that revenue estimates may sometimes reflect prospective not the most desirable from the point of view of economic practice, be corrected fully or quickly enough byfiscalor for 1970-71 is the very large increase which has been assumed assumed, taxation revenue would be less than estimated and a deficit would not reflect the full extent of the shortfall financial assistance grants to the States-coul d also be assumed). It would not follow, however, that the Budget economic growth would be adversely affected by sucb a development; lo serve the broad economic purposes A somewhat similar observation can be made about developments in the economy which were not foreseen at the receipts were to result, say, from an unforeseen rise in wages, in receipts, the Budget bad esercised a more there are differences in the significance which for prospective trends in the economy. side between transactions within Australia and practical importance here. With relatively few are derived from within Australia. in receipts which are expected to emerge as and spending in the economy and those which or other charges. Any estimated rise in expected increases in incomes and spending and factor capable of varying those expectations. be regarded as a source of influence on evolving all increases in receipts in this way. For the most in gross collections of P.A.Y.E. instalment public enterprises, at existing rates and charges, as regards movements in taxation collections at tax and from companies can be somewhat and on the spending and saving habits of above, the second class of movements in receipts measures which involve changes in rates of estimated receipts which is expected to be induced and incomes in the economy. However, the main influence of the Budget, is in the changes has been made this year. rates at a full-year cost to revenue of $292 there are expected to be lags between the in spending it induces; thus there will be a longer-term lift in saving. There will persons subject to provisional tax reflects the a sizeable part of the $292 million will go to and sales tax-estimate d to add $134 million to have a near commensurate effect on purchasing the trend in demand, changes in indirect effect than changes in other forms of taxation. to yield $81 million in a full year will, available to companies for investment and actual effects on spending and in particular the circumstances including the ability of companies or to ' pass on ' the increased tax rates in the revenue collected by the Commonwealth be reflected in the expected overall Budget outcome. It might trends in some particular areas of activity which are balance and reasonable price stability but which cannot, in monetary means. An example relevant to the revenue estimates in average earnings. Sbould average earnings rise less than a budget deficit would emerge (although the extent ol sucb in receipts, because some components of expenditure-for example, lower than estimated if average earnings rose more slowly than objective of maintaining an environment conducive to balanced on the contrary, such a result would be more likely to which budget policy is directed. any movement in receipts which emerges as a consequence of time the Budget was framed. For example, if an increase in it would be misleading to say thai, because of that increase restraining influence than originally envisaged. as a result of the increased tax rates will concerned but the chain of causation is much tax increases. In summary, then, changed taxation rates tax collections at an annual rate of $154 million to a reduction in personal income taxation less complete effect on spending; and to with a fairly indirect and possibly slow effect taxation provisions on aggregate spending Review The implications of Budget transactions, expenditure and income in the economy, primarily on the change in domestic outlays, which is not a mere result of prospective siderations are therefore relevant to a comparison, Budget with that of 1969-70: (a) The estimated increase of 11.4 services is higher than the increase increase of 11.3 per cent in transfer is almost the same as that in 1969-70. in total domestic outlay is not greatly in 1969-70; (b) On the receipt side, the reductions influence but after taking account of the taxation and in company tax, the net aggregate spending in (e) Although the outlays and receipts trends in the economy in the year can be assessed only in the context at the time in the economy as a whole. be at the expense of alternative uses of the funds more complex than in the case, say, of indirect will lead, in 1970-71, to an increase in indirect with a quick consequential effect on spending; in a full year of $292 million with a slower and an increase in company taxation of $81 million, on spending. The net effect of all these changed in 1970-71 is likely to be very small. in terms of their initial impact on trends in depend not on total outlays and receipts, but and on that part of the change in receipts movements in the economy. The following confrom this standpoint, of the 1970-71 per cent in domestic expenditure on goods and of 8.9 per cent in 1969-70, but the estimated payments and net advances within Australia Overall, the estimated increase of 11.4 per cent different from the increase of 10.7 per cent in personal income tax will have an expansionary contrary influences of the increases in indirect effect of these changed taxation provisions on 1970-71 is likely to be very small; of the Budget have an important influence on ahead, the likely economic effects of a Budget of all of the more important influences operating NA OutlayNet expenditure on goods and servicesCurrent espenditureWar and defence Repatriation Developmeni of resources and assistance to industry Civil aviation Immigration Law. order and public safety Education ..

Without an adjusttelegrams ment in charges the trading results for 1970-71 would show an anticipated loss of $llm made up of a loss in postal of S30m and a profit in telecommunications of $19m. This situation has developed as a result of increased wages of $58m in current year, of which $45m will be a standing charge against trading operations. The proservice posals for increases in tariffs I am now presenting to the House are expected to provide about $42m in 1970-71 and $53m in a full year. The estimated overall profit for 1970-71 will then be $30m with S39m profit in telecommunications and a $9m in loss in postal. The profit will be used in expansion of Post Oflice facilities.

The urgent telegram rate will be double the new this rate for ordinary telegrams. Notwiththese increases the public telegraph will continue to operate at a loss. Telephone Services The current rentals for telephone exchange services do not nearly cover the recurring annual expenses borne by the Post Office relation to the facilities provided and it the is proposed that the existing rentals be increased throughout by $7 per annum. The one-third reduction in rentals which is given to blind persons and certain classes of pensioners will be maintained. In associ$5m ation with the adjustment to the rental the service connection fees will be ancl increased by S10-fro m $30 to $40-for new services ancl by S3-from $2 to $5-for 'in place' services, that is, services already in the premises which are taken over by the new occupant. Notwithstanding the heavy rises in costs since 1964, this wiil be the first occasion on which exchange service rentals and connection fees have been adjusted since that time. Certain other rentals for miscellaneous telecommunications facilities are also to be adjusted in the light of the need of those services to provide a better rate of return on investment. Typical of the services involved are intercommunication equipment and private branch exchanges. It is estimated that these variations to telecommunications tariffs will bring in additional revenue of about $24m in 1970-71, and $28m in 1971-72. Provision of Lines for Country Telephone Subscribers In order to bring the benefits of an automatic telephone service to country subscribers as quickly as possible, the Post Oflice is pressing ahead with the replacement of manual exchanges by automatic equipment. This, however, means that the private sections of country subscribers' exchange lines must be constructed to a higher standard than is acceptable for manual exchange working. Because of the need for good quality construction on private sections of exchange lines, the Government decided late in 1968 that it would assist subscribers concerned by making funds available for the purpose at the current long term bond rate and allow the subscribers to make repayments in instalments. Under these arrangements, minimum repayments are $100 a year plus interest and the maximum period over which repayments may be spread is 10 years. Moreover, normal maintenance on private sections of exchange lines constructed to departmental specifications is undertaken by the Post Office at its cost and subscribers to pay only for any necessary main items of replacement materials. Notwithstanding these funding and maintenance arrangements, country people located well out from their exchanges are finding the cost of private sections of good quality telephone exchange lines to be beyond their means, particularly where rural communities are facing a period of economic strain. The Government has therefore reexamined the policy relating to the provision of exchange lines for country telephone subscribers in the light of the more stringent construction standards necessary to enable a modern automatic telephone network to be extended effectively and economically in the interests of subscribers as a whole. The Government has decided that the Post Office will construct and wholly maintain all subscribers' telephone exchange lines from the appropriate exchange to each subscriber's premises. This will include line plant on subscribers' property. It has also been decided that the Post Office will bear more of the cost than it has been responsible for in the past. The Post Office will in future meet the cost up to a radial distance of 15 miles from the appropriate exchange, irrespective of the route distance of the line. This compares with the existing policy under which the Post Office provides line plant for varying distances from the exchange on a formula basis, the length of the 'departmental section' depending on the extent of development along the particular route. On average, 'departmental sections' of lines have been about 3 i miles. Even in the case of subscribers who are located more than 15 miles radially from the exchange, the Post Office will still construct and maintain their exchange lines for the full distance. However, for the distance beyond 15 miles' radius, the subscribers concerned will be required, unconditionally, to pay for the line plant beyond that radius at a standard rate of $40 per radial quarter-mile. This should provide a clear and easily understood basis in the few cases where contributions are required from subscribers, and it will enable the Post Office to ci""nte subscribers immediately on application without the need to prepare detailed estimates of actual line plant costs. In accepting responsibility for the full costs of maintaining lines beyond the 15 miles' radius, the Post Office will regard such lines as being are required its property. The revised conditions will be extended to upgrading or reconstructing private sections of existing subscribers' exchange lines as opportunity permits, particularly in association with the conversion of services to automatic operation. In addition, the revised conditions will apply retrospectively to subscribers who have either provided or upgraded private sections of their lines to full departmental specifications in accordance with the policy introduced on the 1st January 1969, to which I referred in a statement to the House on 28th November 1968. Officers of my Department will be in a position to deal with inquiries from interested subscribers or applicants within the next few weeks. Postal Services Mr Speaker, I will now turn to the postal service. Increases in the charges for most postal services are proposed but, at the same time, new features are being introduced with the object of further improving the range and quality of services available to business and the public generally. It is expected that the increased charges will bring in $ 18.5m in 1970-71 and $25m in a full year. Three years have elapsed since the last increase in the basic postage rate. In that period, the wage rates payable to postal staff have been increased by an average of 29%. These have had a particularly adverse effect on the postal service because some 70% of its costs are associated with labour. Viewed in perspective, since 1959 the basic postage rate will have risen by 45% compared with increases in postal wage rates of 100%. Naturally, the Post Office has been able to absorb some of these increases by improved productivity. In 1969-70, for example, postal staff rose only by 1.1% to cope with an increase of 6% in business. However, with estimated postal losses of Sl9m in 1969-70 and $30m in 1970-71, at current tariffs, a general tariff increase is unavoidable if rising costs are to be recovered. The tariffs proposed would reduce the estimated postal loss to $9m in 1970-71. Statements setting out the changes to postal rates in some detail have been circulated to honourable members but I propose to refer briefly to the more important of these. Letters and Postcards The existing rate of 5c for the first ounce will be increased to 6c. The incremental charge for each additional weight step will also be 6c, instead of 4c as at present but this increase will be offset to some extent by the combining of several weight steps to simplify the rate structure. The number of weight steps will be reduced from 7 to 5. This simplified structure is identical to that adopted recently by the Universal Postal Union. Other Articles The existing rates of 5c and 4c, for the first and successive weight steps respectively, will also be increased to 6c. The effect of introducing the simplified Universal Postal Union structure will be to reduce the number of weight steps from 5 to 4, by combining the present steps of 8 oz to 12 oz and 12 oz to 16 oz. Publications Registered at the GPO The existing general rate for registered Australian books, newspapers and periodicals of 5c for the first 6 oz and 4c for each additional 6 oz will become 6c for the first 6 oz and 5c for each additional 6 oz. The concession rates on registered newspapers and periodicals posted in bulk require special attention because of the substantial difference between present concession and normal printed matter rates and the resulting considerable loss involved. The annual loss on the 158 million copies posted by the 7,600 newspapers and periodicals registered is about $9m, half the estimated postal loss in 1969-70. About 75 million copies are charged between lc and lc and the overall average revenue from all registered newspapers and periodicals posted in bulk is only 1.7c. These concession rates represent, in effect, a substantial subsidy to the publishing and printing industry and to many organisations, ranging from religious, charitable and welfare organisations to social and recreational clubs. Whilst the fostering of a strong publishing and printing industry in Australia is important, this function is not appropriate for the Post Office. Similarly, the activities of the many organisations helped may be desirable, but again it is not the role of the Post Office to support religious denominations, charitable bodies, educational, scientific and technical institutions and the like. It is proposed, therefore, to continue the action taken in recent years, to reduce the extent of the concession. Newspapers and periodicals published by Commonwealth and State government departments and authorities will no longer be eligible for the general and bulk rates of postage for registered publications but will pay normal printed matter rates. Registered newspapers and periodicals published by religious, charitable and welfare organisations, consisting in substantial part of news, information and articles about their activities or about religious, charitable or welfare subjects; and by educational, scientific, technical and agricultural organisations whose principal object is the dissemination of knowledge, consisting in substantial part of news, information and articles on such subjects, will pay 6c for each 12 oz, on the total weight of the consignment, subject to a minimum per article charge of lc. This means that a registered newspaper or periodical of the above type weighing up to 2 oz will still be paying only lc postage per article compared with 6c at normal printed matter rates. These days lc pays only for IS seconds of a postman's or mail sorter's time, and any item must be handled a number of times between posting and delivery. The same rate of 6c for each 12 oz, the total weight of the consignment, with minimum per article charge of' lc, will apply to newspapers and periodicals conproviding sisting in substantial part of news, informapapers tion and articles about country subjects. The expression of this principle is included in paragraph 2 of Part 1 of the Schedule to the Bill shown as Category A, but is more clearly stated in the Schedules that are in the hands of honourable members. These newspapers and periodicals will have to satisfy certain conditions as regards circulathe tion in country areas. This will be clarified in the second Bill mentioned in my opening remarks which will be available to honourwith able members before the second reading on this Bill is continued. Other registered newspapers and periodipreparation, cals, including those published by profesdition. sional, business, union, commercial, social, recreational and motoring organisations associations will pay the following rates: For delivery from the office of postinglie first 2 oz ic each additional oz. For delivery elsewhere2c first 2 oz fc each additional oz up to 6 oz ic each additional oz thereafter. The registered publications will still enjoy a substantial though reduced concession. The posting of registered publications New Zealand and the domestic rates postage is under discussion with the New Zealand Post Office. The Universal Postal Union Convent.on requires such special arrangements to be agreed to by the country of destination. In addition, from 1st July 1971, Australia will have to pay New Zealand an amount towards the cost of its internal handling of our mail, just as we in turn will be paid by other countries for our internal handling of their mail, where we receive more than we send. The amount payable to New Zealand per Ib of mail will be not much more than the bulk rate. I will n.ake a further statement on postings to New Zealand as soon LS I am able. Similar conditions have applied on postings to Fiji but when Fiji becomes independent shortly the arrangements made in earlier days will be invalid. It is not considered that there are any logical grounds for treating Fiji differently to other on countries in the area and it is proposed a that the usual overseas rates will apply. The only other major postal administration still a domestic bulk rate for newsand periodicals is the United States of America, which incurs an annual loss of millions of dollars on this type of mail. Bulk Pre-sorted Mail The postage rates for letters, other articles and registered books posted under bulk pre-sorted mail service will also be increased and will generally maintain their present relativity, in abolute terms, full rates. Many customers are taking advantage of these lower rates and the Post Oflice is benefiting from the economies of higher mail volumes and compliance wish pre-sorting and other conThe rates for bulk pre-sorted mail to New Zealand are also still under disand cussion with the New Zealand Post Office. Other Postal Adjustments Other variations, details of which are set out in the statement available to honourable members, will be effected by amendment of postal regulations or executive action. These variations include the commission on money orders, the minimum commission for which is being increased from 15c to 30c because of the substantial loss incurred on this service. The minimum to charge proposed is the same as the charge of commonly made by banks for a bank cheque where the remitter has no account. Postal orders can provide a suitable alternative to money orders in many cases, at less cost to the customer and the Post Office, and additional $9 and $10 postal orders will be introduced as soon as possible currency are: to widen the appeal of this service. Postal orders fees also need to be adjusted to cover the small loss experienced on these items and re-grouped to simplify counter operations. The rates for parcels posted to places within 30 miles will be increased by Sc each and lighter weight intrastate parcels will be increased by the same amount in order to cover costs. When the fees for the clearance private posting receptacles were adjusted 1968, it was indicated that they did not cover costs. This is a very expensive service to provide, and parking problems in inner capital city areas are also accentuating difficulties associated with this facility. further step to placing this facility on economic basis, a doubling of the proposed, except that clearances on holidays will cost the same as clearances on Sundays. The fees for the registered post, cash-ondelivery post, and messenger delivery service will rise. Special services such these are particularly labour intensive and increases in their tariffs are required ensure that costs are covered. Regarding overseas mail, the Tokyo Congress of the Universal Postal Union 1969 made a number of changes to the categories and tariff structure of ihe Interservices. national Post which have been embodied in the attached schedule, including: (i) fewer and larger weight steps heavier items; (ii) merging of the sample and phonoto post categories into the small category; and (iii) abolition of reply paid postcards. The basic letter rate for overseas surface mail are being increased by 2c to 7c for British Commonwealth, Asian and Oceanic eountries and 9c for other countries. A stantial loss is incurred on international mail and this would continue to exist even after the introduction on 1st July 1971 the payments by other countries of amounts towards the cost of our internal handling of the imbalance in the quantity of overhigh seas mail received as against overseas mail dispatched. Comparative international rates in overseas countries, expressed in Australian Britain: 8c (4.5c for British Commonwealth countries) Canada: 10c (5c for British Commonwealth countries) France: 13c Germany: 12c United States: 12c The relativity of the upper weight steps to the basic rates is fixed under the Universal Postal Union Convention. As far as of the general public is concerned, the in increase in the letter rates will have relatively little effect as the most common form of surface communication overseas is greeting cards, which may be sent at the the 6c printed papers rate proposed, and aeroAs a grammes which are unchanged at 10c but an which will shortly be increased by more fees is than 20% in writing area. New Services Two new services are to be introduced as as part of our programme for meeting the changing postal needs of the business comto munity, government organisations, and the general public. The White Paper T have just presented to Parliament contains details of our progress in the last 12 months in in such fields as priority paid mail, parcel post, philately, and customer advisory From 1st October 1970, under a new international service, printers and publishers who have bulk consignments of for printed matter, such as magazines and books, for the one address will be able send them by surface mail in direct bags packets at 30c per 2 Ib. provided they weigh between 22 Ib and 60 lb. This will be much more convenient and reliable for customers who at the present time must break such consignments up into separate packets and parcels and forward them separately. The service will be known as 'Prlntpost Direct subBags'. Up to this point, the Post Office has not provided a competitive domestic air parcels service because the norma! airmail of fee of 3c peT ounce has been added to the surface parcel rate to arrive at an airmail parcel rate. This has resulted in such rates, compared to the airlines' parcels service, that virtually no business has been obtained. New tariffs for air parcels have been developed which are closely related to distance. A 'per lb' basis of charging, with a minimum charge, as we have for interstate surface parcels, is proposed, for each 4 zones which are based on air route distances. The zones and tariffs proposed are: Zone 1 (0-500 miles) 20c per lb: minimum charge 80c. Zone 2 (501-1,000 miles) 35c per lb: minimum charge 90c. Zone 3 (1,001-1,500 miles) 45c per Ib: minimum charge 90c Zone 4 (1,501 miles and over) 65c per lb: minimum charge 90c. These charges are cheaper-in many cases much cheaper-tha n the present charges for airmail parcels except for very heavy parcels in Zone 4 where the charges fractionally higher because it is desired to have the new rates per lb expressed multiples of 5c for ease of working. The new service will be introduced on a progressive basis, beginning with the capital cities and the larger provincial centres served by air, on Ist January 1971. Further routes covering other provincial centres served by air will be Included as the necessary arrangements are made. On routes not included in the 7ones for the time being, the present airmail fee of 3c per ounce rounded off fo 50c nir Ib will be applied to parcels for wh'rn air conveyance is required. Priority paid parcels will be charged an additional fee of 30c. Mr Speaker, the Post Office is an integral part of the communitv and is subiect to the same pressures in relation to wage variations, increasing costs of services, materials and so on. Awards announced last year will add $58m to the total Post Office wages bill. This is mo*e fhan 10% of tota! wage payments to staff. Such a situation makes it impossible to absorb costs and creates a circumstance wherebv increased charges are inevitable unless the Post Office is to totally disregard business considerations. There can hardly be disagreement that prices generally in the community have an upward trend, and the consumer price index reflects this. I have had a look at some individual charges for well-known services in the community andfinda similar pattern of increase over the past 10 vears. For instance the labour charge for repairs to home appliances, motor vehicles, etc., has gone up by more than 60%; taxi, rail, bus and tram fares have averaged increases above 40% and some daily newspapers have gone up by 40%. A look at the movement in typical fees for basic professional services has shown rises of 40% to 60%. In common with business generally we have found no means of avoiding revision of charges from time to time. However, rises in our charges have been moderate over the past 10 years when viewed against the backdrop of increases in the business and professional fields. The view is held in some quarters that all thefinancialproblems of the Post Office would be solved by converting it to a statutory authority. In this regard, I must say that the British Post Office which are recently changed from Department of State to corporation status has found itself in faced with similar problems to those confronting the Australian Post Office. On the telecommunications side, telephone rentals, the service connection fee, and some local and trunk call charges have been increased in Britain this year. The increases were designed to provide sufficient revenue in the telecommunications service to achieve a financial return of 10% before interest on net assets against the previous target of 8i%. Tn Australia, the return on net assets, before interest, in the telecommunications field in 1969-70 was only 51%. Honourable members may be interested to know that a businessman in Britain has had his telephone rental increased from $A34 to SA52 and a previous service connection fee of $A43 has been increased to SA54. These are typical of increases made in other telecommunications charges in Britain during 1970. These steps were taken so that the telecommunications service in Britain could conduct its affairs on the lines of an efficient commercial undertaking in seeking an adequate return on invested capital-to ensure an adequate investment programme to effect improvements in service, and so that its capital investment programme should be of sufficient stability to permit effective long-term planning. Many honourable members will have read recently of the problems being encountered by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company-operator s of the Bell Telephone System. In its efforts to keep pace with rising demand for telephone service and increasing costs, the quality of service in number of major cities has severely declined. Massive quantities of capital are required to meet expanded demands for service. Much of the new capital required by the Bell System companies in 1969 was raised by debtfinancingand at the end of 1969 debt represented some 39% of total Bell System capital. This compares with the situation in the Australian Post Office where 98% of capital isfinancedby long term debt. Turning to the postal side, the proposed basic postage rate of 6c would compare favourably with rates in overseas countries, especially when allowance is made for their much greater density of population and reduced distribution costs. Comparative rates in other countries, expressed in Australian currency, are: Britain : 4.5c with an increase to 6.3c proposed Germany : 7.3c Canada : 5.0c United States : 5.4c with an increase to 7.1c proposed France : 6.4c Sweden : 9.5c. Most of these overseas postal administraunaltered. tions are experiencing similar problems to the Australian Post Office- a rapid increase in wage rates in a highly labour intensive operation. The United States Post Office deficit now exceeds SAI .16 billion annually, the British postal service lost $A37m in 1969-70, and the Canada Post Office lost $A47m last year. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. SALES TAX BILLS (Nos. 1 to 9) 1970 Bills presented by Mr Lynch, and together read afirsttime. Second Readings",105
24,Mr LYNCH,TO OVERSEAS COUNTRIES,"Flinders-Minister for Immigration and Minister assisting the Treasurer) [9.50]- I move: That the Bills be now read a second The purpose of these Bills is to give effect to the proposal announced by the Treasurer (Mr Bury) in the Budget Speech to increase the 25% rate of sales tax to 27* %. The a 9 amending Bills are necessary because the sales tax is imposed by 9 separate Acts to meet the requirement of the Constitution that an Act imposing taxation shall deal with one subject of taxation only. The goods affected by the increase are those listed in the Second and Fifth Schedules to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Motor cars such as sedans and station wagons which are specified in the Fifth Schedule are the principal classes of goods affected by the 2i% increase. It will not apply to motor cycles, motor buses or other commercial type vehicles such as utilities, panel vans and trucks. The Second Schedule embraces a fairly wide range of goods. The more important of these are radio and television receivers and record players; toilet and beauty preparations and shaving requisites; cameras, films and photographs; watches, jewellery and furs. A comprehensive statement listing the goods which are to be taxed at 274 % is being circulated for the information of honourable members. The present rate of 2i% applicable to household furniture and appliances remains So also does the general rate of 15% which applies to a broad field of goods not specified in any of the sales tax schedules. As the Treasurer mentioned when announcing these proposals the increase in rate is expected to yield additional revenue amounting to $29m in a full year. The new rate of tax is to be effective from tomorrow, 19th August 1970. This accords with the normal practice under which changes in rates of sales tax take effect from the day following their introduction into Parliament. I commend the Bills to honourable members.

25,Mr CHIPP,TARIFF PROPOSALS,"Hotham-Minister for Customs and Excise) [9.54]- I move: Customs Tariff Proposals No. 13 (1970) Excise Tariff Proposals No. 1 (1970) The Tariff Proposals which I have just time. tabled introduce changes to the Customs Tariff and Excise Tariff as foreshadowed by my colleague, the Honourable the Treasurer (Mr Bury) in his Budget Speech earlier this evening. The changes operate from tomorrow. The proposals increase customs duties on grape wines and customs and excise duties on manufactured tobacco products and certain refined petroleum products. Excise duties are imposed on grape wines for the first time. A summary of the alterations is being circulated to honourable members. The Government has decided to grant an exemption from the new wine excise to persons who produce wine for their own use in quantities not exceeding 400 gallons annually. I think honourable members will agree this is a reasonable concession to home wine producers. However, it should be clearly understood that it applies only to wine produced for non-commercial purposes, lf a home producer sells any of the wine he produces under this concessional arrangement, he will be regarded as a commercial producer and will be liable to pay excise duty on the total annual quantity he has produced. Also, while dealing with wines, I would invite the attention of honourable members to the removal of excise duty on spirit used to fortify wine. I commend the proposals.

R. Fraser. House adjourned at 10.1 p.m. The following answers to questions Connnonwealth Public Service: Updating of Administration (Question No. 419),117
32,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,COMMITTEE,"the Prime in Minister, upon notice: (1) Can he say if, in 1962, the New Zealand Government appointed a Royal Commission to inParliament vestigate fully and make recommendations for dating the management, staffing and pay policies of the public service in that countiy and, in 1968, Fulton Committee of Enquiry succeeded in bringlaws ing the United Kingdom Home Service up to date. (2) Is it a fact that the last full scale public investigation into the Commonwealth Public SerService, vice took place in the year 1919. (3) Having regard to the new managerial techCommittee niques, technological advances and specialised trainings that have marked the past SO years, will Service. he seriously consider the early appointment of a Royal Commission or a Committee of Public Enquiry to investigate all the responsibilities the whole administration of the Commonwealth Public Service. Mr Gorton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I have been advised that in 1961 a 'Royal Commission to Inquire into and report upon State Services in New Zealand' was appointed to investigate and report upon the organisation, staffing and methods of control and operation of Departments of State and agencies. In 1968, a Committee on the Civil Service, chaired by Lord Fulton, reported on the structure, recruitment and management, including training, of the United Kingdom Home Civil Service. (2) In 1919 a Royal Commission on Public Service Administration was appointed to inquire into and report upon the various Acts relating to the administration of the Public Service, and particularly m relation to the effect of such Acts upon the management and working of the Departments and the steps necessary to adjust the position that had arisen by reason of the various authorities in existence for the regulation and working of the Public Service. Since that date there have been Committees of Inquiry into Systems of Promotion and Temporary Transfers (1943-44) and Recruitment (1937-58). (3) The Public Service Board and the Permanent Heads of departments have a joint responsibility to ensure efficiency and economical administration of Uie Commonwealth Service, including appropriate use of new managerial techniques, technological advances and specialised training. The Public Service Board's annual reports to Parliament indicate the continuous action that is taken in these matters by departments and the Public Service Board, assisted where necessary by outside consultants. By way of illustration of this, I invite the honourable member's attention to the Board's Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 1969 and in particular. NA upon notice were circulated: to those sections of the Report which cover Methods, Systems and Management Techniques (pages 5/12), Automatic Data Processing (pages 13/19), Staffing Aspects of Technological Change the Service (pages 62/65) and Training (pages 71/77). In addition, arising from its examination of die expenditure of public funds, the ParUamentary Joint Committee of Public Accounts reports to the on a wide range of matters associated upwith ihe administration of die Service. The responsibilities of the Service arise from the functbe tions it is required to perform as prescribed by made by the Parliament and by the executive decisions of Ihe Government. In view of this and of the nature of the processes that are followed to ensure efficiency and economical operation of the as I have outlined, I do not see any need for the establishment of a Royal Commission or of Public Inquiry into the responsibilities and administration of the Commonwealth and Conciliation and Arbitration Commission: Salaries of Members (Question No, 445)",118

Taxation: Concessions to Foreign-owned (Question No. 498) Dr Everingham asked the Treasurer, upon notice: What is the latest available estimated figure of the total annual tax remissions granted to (a) foreign owners and interests in Australia, (b) Australian firms with over half foreign equity and (c) Australian firms with foreign equity less than half. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Statistics that would permit accurate estimates to be made of the value of tax remissions granted to foreign owners of equity in Australian firms in the classes specified in the honourable member's question are not availab e. However, some statistics of overseas participation in the manufacturing and mining industries in Australia are available and these statistics, taken in conjunction with estimates of revenue forgone as a result of taxation concessions to industry, have enabled broad estimates to be made of the order of the revenue forgone attributable to overseas interests in manufacturing and mining companies in Australia. The following estimates are based on estimated revenue forgone in 1968-69 in respect of various concessions to these industries included in Statement No. 9, Commonwealth Assistance to Industry through the Taxation System, attached to the 1969-70 Budget Speech. In these estimates, the categories of overseas ownership used are those shown in the Commonwealth Statistician's bulletins, Overseas Participation in Australian Mining Industry and Overseas Participation in Australian Manufacturing Industry. Although not identical, these categories correspond broadly with those specified in the bonourable member's question. % of direct revenue forgone overseas equity 75% and over .. 50% and less lhan 75% .. 25% and less than 50% .. High Court of Australia: Decision on Union (Quest nn No. 579)",118
34,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) Did the High Court in 1957. in the case of R v. Dunlop (Aust.) Ltd. ex parte Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia (97 C.L.R. at page 87). express the view that the system of registration governing the Cnnst'iminn. and ihe description, on the regis'ei. nf the industry in respect of which the oiganisatson stands registered may be and indeed seems io he ai fault (2) lf so. *h:tt step, have been taken to amend the law in such a wa) as to eliminate ihe faulty effects of the existing law in telation to the regisInterests tration of rules of membership eligibility vis-a-vis union certificates of registration. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The High Court's judgment in the case to which the honourable member referred seems to have overcome the apparent fault in the system of registration of organisations under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act mentioned in the judgment. In this case the High Court decided that if an organisation has validly enlarged its eligibility conditions so as to represent a group extending beyond the particular industry in or in connection with which it is registered, the fact that the description ot the industry is not wide enough to cover the classes of employees who have become members of the organisation does not deprive the organisation of the capacity to represent and formulate industrial claims in the interests of that group. In the 13 years which have elapsed since the High Court's decision, the 'apparent fault' does not appear to have been a cause of concern to either employer or employee organisations. No representations have been made to my Department about it and my Department is not aware of any reason for disturbing the existing situation. International Labour Organisation Convention: Excessive Overtime (Question No. 580)",119
35,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: Estimated taxation (1) Is it a fact that International Labour Organisation Convention No. 1 sets a 48-hour limit to 1968-69 Sm the total number of hours that an employee may be ..38 required to work in any one week. . . 9 (2) Does the Commonwealth Arbitration Com. . 2 mission follow the I.L.O. Convention when dealing with applications to limit the amount of overtime 49 which an employee may be required to work in excess of his standard hours. (3) If not, has an employee, or a trade union ever been penalised for refusing to work overtime which would result in an employee's working week Registration exceeding the limit set by the I.L.O. in 1919. (4) Which of the member States have ratified Convention No. 1. (5) Does the Commonwealth support this Convention. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) The Convention states that the working hours of persons employed in industrial undertakings (excluding supervisors and managers, etc.l should not exceed 48 per week, except in continuous processes which musl he carried on without interruption in which case ihe Convention permits a weekly average of 56 hours. The Convention also provides for exceptions in cases of accident, force majeure, war or emergency, or in exceptional cases of pressure of work. (2) In dealing wilh applications, although the Commission may inform itself in such a manner as it thinks just, it relies on the relevant material being placed before it by the parties.

The report of the I.L.O. on ""Women Workers in a Changing World"" in 1964 contended that the traditional measures adopted with the objective of protectdising Ihe health of women workers may now be discriminatory rather than protective. There is a growing body, of opinion In industrialised countries that protective measures should be applied only lo the specific categories of workers requiring protection. No evidence has been produced to show that night work is a health hazard to women or that it is more harmful to women than to men.' (2) No, but there are relevant provisions in awards of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission applicable in Ihe AusCapital Territory and the Northern Territory. (3) I am advised by the Public Service Board that no restrictions are placed on Departments as to the selection of staff to work at night, though it is Board policy that no junior under 18 years of age be rostered for night shifts if this can be avoided.

Third Party Insurance (Question No. 679) Mr Crean asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Has he received a letter from Mr Frank Power, a Justice of the Peace of Elwood, Victoria, replying to his letter of 27th February 1970, in tion to the possibility of achieving uniformity throughout the Commonwealth in the provision swifter compensation payments for victims of the road toll. (2) If so, has consideration been given to the question whether section SI of the Constitution could be used by the Commonwealth, following the example of the uniform legislation relating to life insurance passed in 1945, to pass uniform legislaParty tion in the field of third party insurance. (3) Is it a fact that die the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territoiy on third party insurance are quite difierent. (4) Is he able to say whether the Acts of die six States relating to third party insurance are all pletely different. (5) Is it a fact that under the current rule negligence many road victims wait for over five years before their cases are heard and that some victims fail to prove negligence on the part of the motorist and so receive no compensation. (6) Has the Australian Transport Advisory Council yet obtained a report on the findings recent inquiry by the New South Wales Governthird ment into third party insurance in that State. (7) Will he give an assurance that in any Comwas monwealth consideration of third party insurance the merits of adopting in Australia the Canadian system of 'liability without fault' in car accident cases with Uie swift compensation it provides victims, will be carefully weighed. (8) Has his attention been drawn to an article Time magazine of 26th January 1968 stating that neighbouring States of the United States of available. America and Canada, motorists similar conditions, pay over one-third more for third party insurance under the conventional negligence rules than the motorists in Canada where the 'liability without fault' insurance is operation. (9) Could the Commonwealth, in those areas completely under its jurisdiction such as the tralian Capital Territory and the Northern Terriin tory, implement the Canadian scheme without difficulties reference to the States. Mr Gorton-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The question of the Commonwealth's powers in relation to third party insurance received some attention at Departmental level following leceipt of  (3) The Minister for die Interior has advised me that die answer to this part of the question is 'No'. (4) The Attorney-General has advised me that would not be true to say that the Acts of the six Case. States relating to third party insurance are all 'completely different*. The Acts are by no means identical, but most, although not all, of their important provisions are based on common principles. These principles and the reciprocity incorporated in the legislation ensure that motorists travelling anywhere in Australia have third party insurance cover at all times. One important difference in substance is in respect of the amount that the third party policy must relainsure. In most States the amount is required to be unlimited in relation to all persons. In of Tasmania, however, the amount required to be insured in respect of any one claim of any one person in the case of passengers in the insured's vehicle or members of the insured's family living with him is only $4,000. Another important difference is that in one State, Western Australia a special tribunal has been established (the Third Claims Tribunal) with exclusive jurisdiction in respect of claims for death or bodily injury caused by or arising out of the use of a motor respective Ordinances of vehicle. (5) The Attorney-General has advised me that there are no doubt occasions when a plaintiff suffering injuries in road accidents has waited for a comlengthy period before his case is heard and, in a number of cases, the plaintiff fails because he has of not established negligence on the part of the defendant. In the usual order of things, a person suffering injuries in a road accident will, in a proportion of cases, be so injured as the result of his own negligence. (6) and (7) The Minister for Shipping and Transof the port has advised me that the whole concept of party insurance, including the question of systems other than that at present in use in Australia, raised for discussion at the Australian Transport Advisory Council's twenty-eighth meeting in Hobart in February 1969. At the meeting it was noted that the New South Wales Government was for conducting an inquiry into all aspects of third party insurance in that State, and the Council in decided to defer any further discussions on the in matter until the report of the inquiry was made At this stage, the report of the inquiry is operating under not yet available. (8) Yes. (9) While in theory the Commonwealth could in establish in its Territories a system of liability without fault for road accident injuries and provide for compulsory insurance against this liability Auswithout complementary and reciprocal legislation the States, consequent administrative and legal would render the system unsatisfactory in practice. National Wage Case (Question No. 712) Mr Oyde Cameron asked the Prime Minister, upon notice: (1) Have all officers and employees of the Commonwealth Public Service received wage or salary it increases resulting from the recent National Wage (2) If not, what is the reason for the delay. Mr Gorton- I have been advised that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) (a) Not all officers and employees of the Commonwealth Service are entitled to salary increases resulting from the National Wage Case. For example, First Division officers and occupants of offices specified in Group 1 of the Fourth Schedule to the Regulations to the Public Service Act 1922-1968 are not so entitled. (b) At the time the Honourable Member put his question upon notice, approvals had yet to be issued by the Public Service Board in respect of only some 800 positions of the approximately 226,000 full-time staff employed under the Public Service Act 1922-1968. These 800 positions bave been either(i) provided oil a temporary basis (in all cases, these positions have no permanent counterpart); or (ii) because of the special nature of the employment, are occupied by staff who have been specifically exempted from certain provisions of the Public Service Act 1922-1968. The necessary approvals to cover about 750 of these positions had been issued as at 7th July 1970, The remaining approvals will be issued as soon as the necessary investigations presently being carried out by the Public Service Board in conjunction with the Departments concerned have been completed. These investigations cover not only the appropriateness of applying the National Wage Case decision as from 1st January 1970, but also the question of whether further increases from die same date should be approved as a consequence of the additional 6.6% increase for the established 'physical grades' group. (c) The actual payment of the increases to eligible full-time officers and employees was made as quickly as was possible given the numbers involved and the complexity of the task. For example, on 28th April only 15,200 or 14% of eligible staff in the Post Office remained to be paid; all 106,900 eligible Post Office staff had been paid by 21st May. Papua and New Guinea: Citizen Military (Question Na 765) Mr Barnard asked the Minister for the Army, upon notice: (1) How many members of the Citizen Military Forces are there in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. (2) How many members are indigenes and how many are expatriates. (3) How many (a) officers and (b) other ranks are indigenes and how many are expatriates. (4) How do pay rates for indigenes and expatriates compare. (5) What amount was paid to members of the Papua and New Guinea CMF in each year since 1965. (6) How many units does the Papua und New Guinea CMF contain, and what is the strength of each unit. (7) Whai equipment is available lo each unit. (8) What training and base facilities are available to the Papua and New Guinea CMF.  able member's question is as follows: (1) There are 512 members of the Citizen Military Forces in Papua and New Guinea. (2) Tbey comprise 323 indigenes and 189 expatriates. 1.3) (a) Oflicers-indigene s 2, expatriates 58: (b) Other ranks-indigene s 321, expatriates 131. (4) Pacific Islander members of the Citizen Military Forces 'receive rates of pay equivalent to the appointment/enlistment or promotion rate applicable to the regular Pacific Islander soldier. Expatriates receive the same rates as indigenes plus an expatriate allowance which, in effect, brings expatriate rates up to the same level as received by mainland Citizen Military Forces menibers. (5) Amounts paid to members of the Papua anil New Guinea Citizen Military Forces in each liminuial year since 1965: S 1965-66 29,000 1966-67 .. .. .. 61,000 1967-68 .. .. .. 60,000 1968-69 .. .. 81,000 (6) There is only one Citizen Military Force unit in the Territoiy-the Papua and New Guinea Volunteer Rifles. It has 486 members. The Headquarters of the unit and A Company are located at Uie and other elements are located at Rabaul, Madang, Goroka, Banz, Mount Hagen, Wewak and Port Moresby, ln addition to the 486 members of the PNGVR there are 26 members of the Citizen Military Forces located in the Territory who are posted as follows: 18 officers with Headquarters Papua and New Guinea Command; I officer and I other rank with 19 Psychology Unit; 5 oflicers with Headquarters 35 Cutlet BatForces talion; I officer with 820 Dental Unit (7) The Papua and New Guinea Volunteer Rifles is organised and equipped on the same basis as Citizen Military Force infantry battalions on Ihe mainland. The Unit is equipped with machine guns, mortars, anti-tank weapons and automatic rifles. However, the basic weapon is the MAI 7.62 mm rifle. (8) Training depots are located in Port Moresby, Wewak, Rabaul, Lae, Goroka, Mount Hagen and Banz. Rifle ranges are located in Port Moresby, Madang and Wewak. Membeis of Ihe Citizen Military Forces may attend schools and courses in Australia or at the Papua and New Guinea Training Depot at Goldie River. Coaching for Citizen Military Forces officer promotion examinations is conducted in conjunction with Australian Regular Army officers as arranged by Headquarters Papua and New Guinea Command. Conciliation and Arbitration Commission: Periodic Conferences (Question No. 773)",120
39,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: notice: (1) Is it a fact that the President of the due Conciliation and Arbitration Commission holds periodical conferences with Conciliation Commissioners. (2) If so, are discussions at these conferences held on such matters as policy relating to and conditions of employment. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourcosts able member's question is as follows: I am advised by the President of the Commonsection wealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission employee. as follows: (1) The question refers to 'Conciliation missioners', whereas since the establishment Commission in 1956 Commonwealth legislation has not provided for any officers with that title. In conformity with section 69 of the and Arbitration Act since 1956 the President has held conferences of 'members of the Commission' not less frequently than once each year. Thus Deputy Presidents and Commissioners are but not Conciliators. (2) No. This follows acceptance some back of the opinion of the President that such matters should not be discussed.

Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that all formal proceedings of the Public Service Arbitrator and his Deputies and of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbiwere tration Commission are recorded in the tianscript which states the time of commencement and the time of adjournmeni of each sitting. This does apply, however, to con""eren;es in the Court Room, in Chambers and on site, and on o:her occasions at the wish of the partes when it is not the practice to take transcripts or keep records of any kind.

(6) On how many occasions has a Court ordered costs against an employee in alleged victimisation Conciliation proceedings since 1950. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourpresent able member's question is as follows: (1) I have nothing to add to the reply I gave years to part (1) of Question No. 218. (2) The honourable member's attention is directed to sub-section 4 of section 5 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. (3) The question of costs is one for the Court to determine. (4) I am advised by my Department that, since 1950, section 5 has been used as follows: (a) by allegedly dismissed employees on nine occasions; (b) by unions on behalf of allegedly dismissed employees on nine occasions; (c) by inspectors appointed pursuant to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in relation to allegedly dismissed employees on two occasions; (d) by employees, on grounds alleging injury in employment or alteration of position to the employee's prejudice, on three occasions; and (e) by unions, on behalf of employees who were alleged to have been threatened with dismissal, on nine occasions. (5) Of the nine cases under 4 (a), above, seven dismissed and two withdrawn. Of the nine cases under 4 (b), above, convictions were recorded in five, one case was dismissed, two were not withdrawn and one struck out. Of the two cases under 4 (c), above, the defendant was convicted in one and one was withdrawn. Of the three cases under 4 (d). above, two were dismissed and one ; withdrawn. Of the nine cases under 4 (e). above, two cases were dismissed and seven withdrawn. (6) On eight occasions on which the information was dismissed or withdrawn the Court awarded provided costs against informants; in four of these cases the informant was an employee and on four occasions the informant was a union. Sabbatical Leave (Question No. 806)",123
42,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Prime equip Minister, upon notice: (1) Which members of the'judiciary, what staff of the Australian National University and what holders of statutory offices under the Commonstaff wealth receive sabbatical leave. (2) What are the terms of this leave. (3) What is the reason for the wide difference between the period of long service leave granted to officers of the Commonwealth Public Service and the period allowed for sabbatical leave. Mr Gorton- I have been advised by the relevant Ministers and the Public Service Board that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) There is not provision for members of the judiciary akin to sabbatical leave. There no holders of statutory offices under the Commonwealth receiving sabbatical leave. All members of the continuing full-time teaching and research staff of the Australian National University receive study leave. The leave which may be taken varies according to the post held, from one year in every seven years' service every four. A grant towards the expenses of the leave may be made, provided costs are not less, of an amount varying from $1,000 to $3,200. leave cannot be accumulated and cash in lieu is not payable on resignation or retirement. Tribunal Decided Number 1967-68 1968-69 1 .. .. 2,386 2.311 2 ., .. 2.521 2.252 3 .. .. 2,114 2.367 4 .. .. 2,477 2,405 (3) On the assumption that the figures required are of appeals lodged but not heard as at 30 April 1970, the position is as follows: New South Wales Victoria .. .. .. Queensland .. South Australia . . .. Western Australia . . .. Tasmania . . . -- ..118 (3) Sabbatical leave and long service leave are for quite different and unrelated purposes and it is unreal to draw comparisons between the different provisions of these two conditions of employment. Long service leave is provided as a reward for staff who complete a leng:hy period of service and is designed to allow an extended paid break from employment for the purpose of rest and recreation. Sabbatical leave, on the other hand, is provided to enable academic staff to better themselves for their academic duties, and is recognised as a necessaiy means by which academic staff may keep abreast of developments in their fields of study in other centres of research and teaching. In a number of Universities academic receive long service leave in addition and unrelated to their entitlement to receive sabbatical leave. War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunals (Question No. 857) Mr Barnard asked the Minister for Repatriation, upon notice: (1) How many appeals were heard by each of are the War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunals during the years 1968 and 1969.

International Covenants on Human Rights (Question No. 924)",124
43,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Prime Minister, upon notice: Witb which Commonwealth authorities consultations taking place in respect of the national Covenants on Human Rights (Hansard 19th March 1970, page 719), and when did contion sultation first take place with each authority. Mr Gorton-The Minister for External law and practice. Affairs has informed me that the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The consultations referred to in the answer given on 19th March 1970 are between the relevant Commonwealth Departments and began shortly after the adoption by die General Assembly of the United Nations in December, 1966, of the International Covenants on Human Rights.

44,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: Which departments and authorities will have to amend the conditions in the contracts awarded by them in order to ensure complete compliance with International Labour Organisation Convention No. 94-Labou r Clauses (Public Contracts), 1949. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Consultations are still proceeding with Commonwealth departments and authorities involved in letting contracts to identify more precisely the extent to which the contracts may not accord with the requirements of the Convention. Papua and New Guinea: International Labour Conventions (Question No. 929)",125
45,Mr WHITLAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for External Territories, upon notice: (1) Has his Department, since the publication last October by the previous Minister for Labour and National Service of the Review of Australian Law and Practice Relating to Conventions Adopted by the International Labour Conference, completed its reconsideration of (a) Convendon No. 83Labour Standards (Non-Metropolitan Territories), 1947 and (b) Convention No. 86-Contract s of Employment (Indigenous Workers), 1947. (2) Has his Department completed its review of Convention No. 110-Plantations , 1958 (Hansard, 26 August 1969, page 712). (3) Has his Department re-examined (a) Convention No. 50-Recruitin g of Indigenous Workers, 1936, (b) Convention No. 64-Contract s of Employment (Indigenous Workers), 1939 (c) Convention No. 82-Socia l Policy (Non-Metropolitan Territories), 1947 and (d) Convention No. I l l Discrimination (Employment and Occupation), 1958.",125
46,Mr BARNES,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the bonourable member's question is as follows: 1 (a) & (b) The Department of External Territories has reviewed these Conventions in are respect of the Territory of Papua and New InterGuinea and considers that the relevant Law and Practice conform with the provisions of ConvenNo. 83. As to Convention No. 86, Article 3 provides for conditions different from Territory (2) No. (3) (a) The position with regard to Convention No. 50 remains as stated on 26th August, 1969 in reply to question No. 1427. (b) Convention No. 64 has been reviewed in respect of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. The relevant law and practice are considered to be in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, (c) & (d) Conventions No. 82 and 111 are still being examined. Water Conservation (Question No. 946) Dr Everingham asked the Minister for National Development the following question, upon notice: (1) Has he stated that, because drought affects most of Australia, it seems impracticable to set regional priorities for water conservation. (2) Does the paper Fitzroy Region, Queensland. Resources Series on Climate, published by his Department in 1965, state that the growing season in the region is most seriously affected by partial or complete failure of the summer rains about 3 years in 10 over the western part of the basin, and that there is high variability in amount and incidence of rainfall in monthly or yearly averages. (3) Does this variability apply more to Queensland as a whole than to other States. (4) Will the Government review its policy of leaving priorities in water conservation to State initiatives.",125
47,Mr SWARTZ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) ln a letter to me in December 1969, Mr Everingham asked 'Do well proven and established areas where periodical devastation results from drought carry top priority in your planning?' My reply contained the following comment: 'Almost all areas of Australia are affected by drought at various times and it seems impracticable to set them in any particular order of priority'. I might add that priority for water conservation works is not necessarily determined by their potential to mitigate the effect of droughtthe overall effect on production is generaUy a more important factor. (2) This is a reasonable summary of a part of the paper on the Fitzroy Region, Queensland Resources Series, on Climate. (3) It is doubtful that the Fitzroy Region could be considered typical for Queensland with regard to rainfall variability. I am not aware of any study which has provided a comparison between States with regard to variability of rainfall. (4) As the honourable member is no doubt aware, water conservation under our Federal Constitution is the responsibility of the State Governdetailed ments and as a consequence the Commonwealth Government is not in a position to set priorities for these works. In the National Water Resources Development Programme, however, the Government does have regard to its own assessment in selecting works for which financial assistance wiU be provided. Papua and New Guinea: Workers Compensation (Question No. 973)",125
48,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for External Territories, upon notice: Will he elaborate upon his reply paragraph of my question No. 819 (Hansard, Sth May 1970, page 1666) by stating whether, in any of the 59 cases in respect of which the Court refused compensation on the ground that the worker's death was not the result of his employ the ment, the death of the deceased worker occurred at his place of employment during working hours, or was caused, or was materially contributed to, by an injury or disease associated with his work.",126
49,Mr BARNES,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honour the able member's question is as follows: There were 3 cases where death occurred at the deceased worker's place of employment during working hours. Of these 1 was a case of drowning during an unauthorised break by the employee from his work, and in 2 cases the deaths were due to illnesses contracted prior to commencement of employment. In none of die cases was it established that the death of the worker was caused by accident arising out of or in the course employment or caused by disease due to the nature of the employment. Commonwealth Superannuation F o n d (Question No. 992)",126
50,Mr REYNOLDS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Treasurer, upon notice: (1) Are there any practical or insurmountable problems involved in making a full Commonwealth Superannuation Fund more frequently than under the present quinquennial arrangements. (2) Would it be possible for an annual review to be made. (3) Do present arrangements involve protracted examinations and delayed adjustments to the disadvantage of superannuitants. Mr Bury-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I have been informed by the President of the Superannuation Board that, at present, there are practical problems involved in making a full review of the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund more frequently man under the present quinquennial arrangements. I understand that these problems have arisen in part because of the accumulation of arrears as a consequence of the work necessary to enable distribution of the surplus of over $40m to pensioners and contributors. Recent major changes that are of benefit to contributors, such as the introduction of noncontributory units, have aggravated the situation. Nevertheless, I have been informed by the President of the Board that these problems are being overtaken through the further development of the computer system in the Office of the Superannuation Board. On present indications, more frequent reviews should be practicable within 2 years. (2) When the practical problems referred to in (1) have been overcome, it would be possible for an annual review to be made. However, I have been informed by the Commonwealth Actuary that it would not be possible to ascertain meaningful actuarial trends by reviewing what has hapto the second pened in only 1 year. (3) The actuarial examinations as such are not protracted in relation to the amount of work involved. As indicated in (1), the problem lies in up-dating of records and the extraction of data for the examinations. A disadvantage would be suffered by superannuitants only if significant surplus assets were revealed by a quinquennial investigation and appropriate adjustments were delayed. Such a situation arose in connection with investigation as at 30 June 1962 and the disadvantage was offset by making the adjustments effective from 1 July 1962. Wheat (Question No. 999) Mr Grassby asked the Minister for Priof the mary Industry, upon notice: (1) What are the final figures of the per bushel payments to wheat growers from the 1967-68 and 196869 wheat pools. (2) What are the estimated final figures for the 196970 pool. Review (3) When will further payments be made to growers above the $1.10 first advance from the 1969-70 pool. (4) What are the charges against the 1967-68, 1968-69 and 1969-70 wheat pools, actual or estimated, for (a) interest, (b) storage and (c) handreview of the ling and other charges.",126
51,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The estimated total payments per bushel to wheat growers in respect of the 1967-68 and 1968-69 pools are, for f.a.q. wheat, bulk f.o.r. ports of export, eastern States basis: 196768 196869 (2) A preliminary estimate of total payments on a similar basis for die 1969-70 pool is 123.6 cents per bushel. (3) The Australian Wheal Board is currently paying off its debl of $250m to the Commonwealth Government in respect of the 1968-69 pool. It is expected that this debl will be liquidated about March 1971. The time taken for the Board to discharge its 1969-70 pool indebtedness will depend upon a number of factors including the Board's selling performance, the prices received and extent of sales on credit terms. At this stage it seems unlikely that die 1969-70 pool debt can be cleared before the end of 1971. This being the case, it will not be possible to make a second payment until sufficient credit funds have been accumulated some time in 1972. (4) The Australian Wheat Board has provided ihe following estimates. It does not dissect handling and storage costs: Estimated Pool Costs Handling and storage . . 9.971 7.483 10.0 Interest . . 1.710 3.627 7.7 Sundry expenses, including administration . . 0.745 1.010 Total 12.426 12.122 18.8 (Question No. 1054) Mr Wallis asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice: What was the value of (a) opal mined in Australia (b) opal exports and (c) the production of opal from (i) Andamooka and (ii) Coober Pedy Opal Fields in Soutb Australia, during the last 3 years.",127
52,Mr SWARTZ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"Tb e answer io the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The value of opal mined in Australia during the last 3 years was: 1967 1968 $'000 $'000 3,993 5,745 (b) The value of opal exports during the last three years was: Rough (not cut or Â«W> $'000 polished) 6,996 7,501 Other 1,624 3,152 It might be noted that the value of opals exported exceeds considerably the value of opals mined in any year. In many cases stones, after being mined, pass through several stages before export and considerable value might thus be added. Most stone at export are in a different condition to the raw state wheu they left the field, Cents per bushel and the statistics do not make a clear distinction . . 147.3 of the various grades. . . 123.7 (c) The value of the production of opal from (i) Andamooka and (ii) Coober Pedy Opal Fields in South Australia during die last 3 years was: 1967 1968 1969 $'000 $'000 $'000 (0 n.a. 2,068 3,694 (ii) n.a. 1,940 3,450 Coalmines: Rejection of Application (Question No. 1125) My Clyde Cameron asked the Minister for Labour and National Service, upon notice: (1) In view of his statement in answer to my question No. 717 (Hansard, 5 May, page 1651), dial output of coal per man year in Australia has increased from 1,062 tons in 1959 Co 2,770 tons in 1969, can he state why the application by the Coal and Shale Employees' Federation for a 1967-68 1968-69 1969-70 reduced working week has been rejected by Mr Cents per bushel Justice Gallagher. (2) Is he able to say whether miners employed at the Kemira Colliery are refusing to accept Uie decision by Mr Justice Gallagher rejecting shorter 1.1 working hours and authorising multiple shifts on long wall development. (3) Will he confer with Mr Justice Gallagher lo ascertain whether at the time he made his decision he was aware of the enormous increase in man-year productivity which has occurred in the Opals coal mining industry during the last 10 years. (4) If Mr Justice Gallagher was aware of ihe industry's increased productivity, will he ascertain whether the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has rejected the principle of relating standard hours and/or wage rates lo upward trends in productivity. Mr Snedden-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) During the recent hearing by the Coal Industry Tribunal of an application by Australian Iron and Steel Limited for an extension of multiple sbifi longwall mining operations a submission was advanced by the Miners Federation that there should be a reduction in weekly hours of work 1969 in mines where such operations are introduced. S'000 Tbis submission was rejected by the Tribunal 9,333 (est.) in a decision handed down in Sydney on 5th March, 1970. However, the Tribunal did decide, in granting Uie employers application, that an extra week of annual leave plus added remuneration 1967 1968 1969 should accrue to any employee in a mine working these multiple shifts. I am advised that the $'000 Combined Mining Unions and the mine owners 8,870 are now to enter into private discussions on the 3,336 question of shorter hours. (2) Miners at the Kemira Colliery resumed normal work under pre-dispute conditions on 25th May as a part of overall arrangements to restore the industry to normal conditions as a prelude to private discussions between the parties on the question of reduced hours of work. It would appear that the reasons advanced for the strike at Kemira Colliery which halted production for 34 days were as the honourable member states. (3) and (4) I am sure that the Coal Industry Tribunal was fully informed and took into account all relevant factors affecting the industry before reaching its decision on Sth March. Decisions published over the past 10 years show that the Tribunal when it granted such benefits as long service leave of 13 weeks for 8 years' service, annual leave of 4 weeks, payment of bonuses when on annual leave, sick leave or public holidays and increased wages, took increased productivity of mine workers into account and has repeatedly said so. Coal: Burragorang Valley (Question No. 1126)",127

(2) Is it a fact that the coal production per man shift amounts to 13.81 tons. (3) If so, is he able to say what is the labour notice: cost per ton and what is the selling price.",128
54,Mr SWARTZ,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourPollution able member's question is as follows: (1) The seven coal mines in the Burragorang Valley are owned by Clutha Development Pty Ltd and companies associated with it. It that Clutha Development Ply Ltd is owned by National Bulk Carriers of New York. (2) Coal production per man shift worked amounted to 13-81 tons for the year 1968-69. (3) The greater part of the output of the ragorang Valley mines is sold to Japanese buyers and shipped through Balmain. The current Balmain price is $10.24 per ton.

58,Mr ANTHONY,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) In each State there are requirements for the routine inspection of poultry processing premises, and registration of premises is required by most States. In addition to the inspection of premises for the purpose of ensuring the maintenance of acceptable standards of hygiene, the State Public Health authorities exercise a general surveillance over the wholesomeness of al) foodstuffs at the retail level. Similar requirements and procedures operate in Territories within Australia. (2) Many countries have standards for poultry established by legislation, and these usually apply to both the domestic and imported product In the USA., for instance, the Wholesome Poultry Products Act specifies minimum standards relating to the preparation and wholesomeness of poultry, inspection supervision, and so on. This Act requires that standards in exporting countries be the substantia] equivalent of those contained in the Wholesome Poultry Products Act In Canada, standards for poultry, whether domestic or imported, are contained in the Meat Inspection Act, and poultry must comply also with the Animal Contagious Diseases Act The foregoing examples are illustrative, and virtually eveiy country to wbicb Australia exports poultry requires certification as to the hygienic processing, packing and general soundness of the product. Individual countries require particular certifications as to freedom from specified fowl diseases. (3) State authorities responsible for standards in the poultry industry are unanimously of the view that there is no evidence of any high degree of disease in poultry food in Australia. However it is generally accepted throughout the world that poultry is a medium very susceptible to the transmission of salmonella. (4) To date little positive attention has been paid to achieving unifonn legislation as between the States to control the standard of poultry food within Australia, but there currently appears to be an increasing willingness on the part of the States to consider the practicability of uniform legislation.
