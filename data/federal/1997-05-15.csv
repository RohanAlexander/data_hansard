1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA (ELECTION) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 May, on motion by Mr Howard: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Beazley moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, recognising that if it is to have the necessary standing and authority, the Constitutional Convention should be based on the most fair and straightforward electoral arrangements practicable, the House: (1) is of the view that the Government has exaggerated the cost differential between a postal ballot and a normal attendance ballot and considers that the elections should be made by means of a normal attendance ballot; (2) considers that the voting method proposed by the Government will: (a) cause unnecessary confusion, and both of which will distort the results of the vote; and (b) deprive many Australians of their right to vote; (3) is of the view that the proposed period of I week from the issuing of the notice of the election and the closing of the roll is undemocratic and will deny many Australians of participation in the process; (4) considers that the Government proposals for the nomination of persons to the convention are undemocratic and will allow the Coalition and its allies to have a disproportionate influence on the process; and (5) is of the opinion that a Joint Select Committee should be appointed to nominate community representatives, to advise on the processes and procedures for the Convention and to advise on the appointment of an independent Chair for the Convention"".",13
2,Mr MARTIN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I am rising to the dispatch box this morning a little earlier than I anticipated only because we seem to have lost a minister who was supposed to introduce some legislation this morning. But the opposition is always happy to assist those aberrant ministers who cannot get themselves out of bed in the morning to come in and perform their duties on behalf of the government. If it gives us an opportunity to speak perhaps a little longer and have a few more speakers on this Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997, then we are only too happy to continue with that process. The bill we have before us this morning, which has been the subject of some debate in the last day or so, and certainly a lot of comment both in the media and in the broad constituency that is Australia, relates to the proposition this government is advancing to have a constitutional convention later this year. This bill sets out the mechanism whereby delegates are elected to attend that convention. It sets out the method of voting to elect those delegates who will be attending. It is silent somewhat on the appointment of appointed delegates and who they will be and the process by which those appointments will be made. It also sets out, as I have indicated, the voting system to elect those elected delegates. The opposition has indicated that in the main we will support the passage of this legislation but that we will be seeking some amendments. We do so because we believe that this process is fundamentally flawed. We believe that this is an unnecessary step that has been imposed on this issue. The issue is a vote by the people of Australia on their future-as to whether or not they believe this country should be a republic. We have said that we would rather have had an indicative plebiscite and ultimately a referendum. We believe that the money that is going to be expended on this little exercise, this flawed exercise, is something which we could have saved, which this government could have saved. But let me say something more pertinent to the background to this legislation and to the whole concept of the republic. I must admit that I have always been a republican. I must admit that ever since I started my association with the political process in this countrywelcome, Minister; nice to see you here, but I \ ill keep going, if you don't mind, for the 20 minutes. Mr Reith-I think you are entitled to it.",13
3,Mr MARTIN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Thank you very kindly, Leader of the House. I was saying that I have always been a republican and one who believes that Australia should have its own head of state. This was a view I came to very early on in my lifetime. I first started to think about the issues associated with what we were to be as a country, where we were to go and where we could be in the future probably around the time that I started university down here at the ANU. The late 1960s was a period of great change. It was a period when much was happening around us, when much was happening in the world. It was a time when Australia was active in a military sense in South-East Asia. It was a time when people started to think about our relationship with what had been formerly the British crown and the United Kingdom. Even the connotation that is placed on 'Great Britain' gives us, I think, some inkling as to the sort of relationship that perhaps some people saw as still in place between the 'mother country', as it was described-Great Britain-and Australia. But we have gone well beyond that. As the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) said yesterday in his contribution, this is not an attack on or a put-down of the present Queen of England. This is not that at all. What this is about, and the personal view that I am expressing-and one which I am pleased to say our party has adopted-is that Australia should be a republic, that it should have an Australian as a head of state and that the system of government that we have in this country should continue the way it is. A lot of mythology surrounds what the republic is all about. The view that was put forward by Paul Keating when Prime Minister was open to misrepresentation as it was a minimalist position. It simply said that we wanted to elect an Australian as a head of state. We would remain in the Commonwealth, just as Fiji now wants to go back into the Commonwealth-if you can believe some of the newspaper reports emanating out of that country at present. But Fiji is a republic. The way it got there is certainly very different to what is being proposed in this country. If you look around the world, those countries which have their own elected heads of state as presidents are part of that Commonwealth and no difference would apply to Australia. What we want on this side of the House, and what I suspect a large number on the other side want as well, is for Australia to have an Australian as head of state, to be part of the Commonwealth, certainly, and to continue the system of government that we presently enjoy. There would be no interference under the model that we have proposed. The system of government would continue. The Australian people would choose the government of this country. The Australian people would choose who, therefore, was going to be in opposition. There is no change proposed in the model that we have put forward, but the model we are debating today, regrettably reflects the rather confused thinking of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and, of course, his own avowed bias in respect of whether or not Australia should be a republic. I do not think anyone, in seriously looking at the way in which this model has been proposed, would think that it is anything other than as described yesterday by my colleague the member for Banks (Mr Melham) as 'a process for constitutional reform based on fear'. I suspect when many of the abnormalities associated with the process of going forward with this bill are put in place, it is going to lead to not a reasonable outcome for most Australians. Let me elaborate on one or two of those particular issues. As I have said, the Australian Labor Party would much prefer to have an indicative plebiscite followed by a referendum. We do not think that this particular staged process is required, except of course that it does reflect the Prime Minister's own views. What it does is confuse the whole issue. We think that it could be fairly said that the government, in fact, is rigging the process. We think, when you have a clear understanding and a clear look at this process, that you can come to no other conclusion.",14
4,Mr CADMAN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,Oh!,15
5,Mr MARTIN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"My good friend and colleague the Chief Government Whip is saying that he does not agree that that is the case. I wonder whether you have had the opportunity to have a look at some of the information that came out of the Senate inquiry on this particular matter and at some of the evidence that was presented by people from the Australian Electoral Commission and elsewhere. The process itself of distributing the information to voters in Australia is open to tamperingthere is no question about that. I remember in the last election campaign-and it has happened before-certain parts of my own electorate where my campaign committee, having raised its own funds and had material printed, and so on, wanted to distribute it around the electorate. We did so. The cheapest way, as you know, is to use Australia Post, at 7Y2C a letter, to get it out into the community. What we found was that some of the workers from Australia Post were simply taking the bundles of those 'To the householder' letters in high-rise unit areas of Wollongong and sticking the whole lot on the top of the letterboxes. That is not what was supposed to happen. They were supposed to go to each individual household and that did not happen. The same sort of process, under what is proposed here, could happen in this case. Even more insidious a part of this, and arising out of the evidence which was given to the Senate committee, concerns what you will actually be given and how that process then will unfold. As I understand it from the shadow minister for justice and the shadow Attorney-General, there will be an envelope, about the usual size for A4, and contained in that will be two other envelopes in which you send back your votes. There will be the voting paper itself and also some biographical details on each of the candidates seeking election to be part of this convention. I do not know about you, Chief Government Whip, but I suspect that there are going to be a lot of people who put their hand up wanting to be elected to this convention. Therefore, an envelope that is about yea big will have within it two envelopes to send the ballot paper back, the ballot paper itself and biographical information about each of the candidates. Arranging that in itself is going to be an exercise which I do not think is going to be appropriate in these circumstances. We have some real concerns also about the voluntary postal ballot process. We are talking here, are we not, as was suggested yesterday, about not requiring Australians to have a say on their future. What this government is about is saying, 'We will give you a voluntary postal ballot. You don't have to be in it. You don't have to have a say.' By logical extension-and I am not really one for conspiracy theories on this side of the House-the question has to be asked: is this going to be a testing ground for what some people in the government-Senator Minchin is a prime example-would like to see for the future, to get away from the compulsory attendance at a ballot-not compulsory voting as some people think it is, but compulsory attendance at a ballot-which is what the law of this country requires? Once you are there, you do not necessarily have to vote. That is not what the law says. It says you have to turn up to vote. I wonder whether this is the first phase of the government's desire to eliminate that as part of the Australian voting system. I wonder whether this is the first phase of a process which will mean that in future the less advantaged in the community-those people who come from non-English speaking backgrounds, for example-may not, unless you have some compulsory element in this, get out to vote. Clearly, there is one side of politics that would be affected more by that process than the other. I do not think I have to point out in this place who that might be. The material that is going to be distributed as part of this ballot process is only going to be in one language, and that is English. That has to be disadvantageous to quite a number of constituents. Certainly in my electorate it will be. In the electorate that I represent, the city of Wollongong has people from 80 different ethnic nationalities residing in its boundaries. Mr Laurie Ferguson-Is that all?",15
6,Mr MARTIN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"My friend the member for Reid probably has 250,000 different ethnic nationalities in his electorate-I know that that is the case. He would be very concerned, as I am, that the ballot paper is only going to be in English. The other thing is, who is going to receive that envelope? The Australian Electoral Commission has indicated that two million Australians change their address each year. Since this ballot is going to be held 18 months since the last election and no habitation review is going to be held, it may well be that up to two million people do not get the ballot papers and therefore do not vote. There is a very tight window of opportunity when people are going to be asked to vote. It has been estimated by the Australian Electoral Commission that there are something like 200,000 Australians who are going to be overseas and they are not going to be given an opportunity to vote either. They are simply going to be denied a part in this process. According to recent opinion polls, it is interesting that something like 72 per cent of Australians support compulsory voting that we have in this country, and I see no reason why we should not do that again on this particular occasion. There is some quibbling on what it might cost to do that. On the best estimates, we are talking about $40 million as against $49 million. If we are going to spend that amount of money on a step that I do not believe is necessary, I do not think the government should be afraid of spending that extra $9 million to make sure there is a compulsory element in this so that there is a genuine representation of people's views. The voting system itself is also something which is of concern because it has been likened, according to witnesses at the Senate inquiry, to people going along to the local TAB and having a punt on a Saturday afternoon. When questioned about whether or not people in this country would have difficulties voting above or below the line-the same as for the Senate, but with some subtle variations-it was said at the Senate inquiry, 'All Australians are punters. They all know how to do it at the TAB.' I do not know if that is right. Having heard the views of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on gambling, I am not sure if he would know how to fill in a TAB ticket on a Saturday afternoon. He might surprise me, but I am not quite sure. So maybe his vote will not count either. I am sure he will get the ballot paper, because he will want to vote a particular way, and I have a pretty fair idea of which way that will be. In yesterday's second reading debate someone likened the process to a bet on the Dapto dogs. It was said that that was insulting. I am not sure which part was; certainly not going to Dapto-that is not insulting, I have to tell you. But the voting process is. I also have some concerns on how delegates are to be appointed. Under the current proposal there is no doubt that the appointment of 40 parliamentary delegates-20 to be drawn from the Commonwealth parliament, with each state sending three delegates and the territories one each-will advantage the government parties because of the current political make-up of parliaments around Australia. The only saving grace in thatthank God there is one!-is that peopl""e like Collins in New South Wales and Kennett in Victoria are very pro-republic. That is good. At least there are a couple of people's votes that our side of politics can count on among the people who are appointed. We want to see that make-up changed-and we will be moving amendments. We want to see the number of elected delegates increased to 80, to be chosen from the states and territories in a manner which more properly reflects what is happening here. Even Kate Carnell, the Chief Minister of the ACT, said that it was outrageous that her opposite number will not be given an opportunity to come along as part of that convention and to vote. I think Kate happens to be right on this occasion. We are suggesting that 16 parliamentary delegates should be appointed from the federal parliament: eight members or senators from the Prime Minister's side, six by the Leader of the Opposition, one by the leader of the Democrats and one to be appointed from the remaining minor party or Independent members or senators. That is quite reasonable in the circumstances. We do not want to see one side advantaged over the other. As was said yesterday by the member for Banks (Mr Melham) in his speech in the second reading debate, we have outlined all these sorts of concerns and the way in which there ought to be a different approach in the balance of people who are going to be here. Finally, I want to comment on the necessity of having an independent chair. We have suggested that somebody like Sir Anthony Mason, the former Chief Justice of the High Court, might be appointed as an independent non-voting chair. We think that there is some merit in that proposal. I come back to what I said at the start: if you look at the make-up of Australia in the 1990s as we are about to go into the next century, you will see that it has changed dramatically from what it was 100 years ago. Given the make-up of people who are here, their backgrounds and the way in which the relationship with the so-called mother country has now changed, there is no doubt-and certainly the polls suggest this-that the overwhelming majority of Australians would like to see us a republic with an Australian head of state. People have their own views on this and I am quite happy to accept those different points of view. In that hundred the UK has become very closely integrated into Europe; all the colonies that the UK once had have simply disappeared. Many have become republics in their own right with heads of state selected from their own countries, yet they remain as part of the Commonwealth. At the end of the day it is such a simple proposition that I cannot understand why people want to maintain this God, Queen and country type of attitude. As I say, this is a reflection on Her Majesty the Queen of England. Some of her successors are a bit of a worry but it is not a reflection on her. And I think that most people accept that that is right. I hope the government gives some serious consideration to our amendments. It is a process that we think was unnecessary but if it is to happen, and I am sure it will happen shortly, we need to ensure that the people who are taking part in this process reflect fairly and reasonably the outcomes and the views of Australians. That will only happen with compulsory voting, if the voting system is looked at carefully and if the appointed delegates to this convention also reflect more reasonably the composition of Australian society and the parliaments right around this nation.",16
7,Mrs MOYLAN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I would like to apologise to the House for the short delay in my attendance here this morning. I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) for his graciousness in stepping into help me out this morning. Debate (on motion by Mr Laurie Ferguson) adjourned. AGED CARE (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mrs Moylan, and read a first time. Second Reading",17
8,Mrs MOYLAN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill, the Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997, establishes the transitional provisions and consequential amendments to move from the current legislative framework for aged care to the new system under the Aged Care Bill 1997. This bill repeals provisions of the National Health Act 1953 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 that are no longer required and not maintains other sections applying to periods prior to the commencement of the Aged Care Bill 1997. It also contains necessary transitional provisions for a smooth transfer from the old legislation to the new. In addition, the bill amends relevant legislation of the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs and others to take account of the new aged care provisions. These are technical amendments only; for example, the bill amends definitions in these acts to reflect the changes embodied in the Aged Care Bill 1997. In considering these transitional issues, we have adopted an approach that provides security and minimises intrusion into the lives of those persons already receiving aged care. For example, formal agreements between hostel providers and residents concerning entry contributions and fees will be maintained as resident agreements under the Aged Care Bill 1997. This will protect these residents from having to pay any more in entry contributions than they have already paid. Current approvals and classifications will be maintained for existing residents, ensuring that they will not need to go through another approval and classification procedure until those classifications expire. This bill also clarifies a number of exempt status issues for residents receiving these services. For example, existing exempt residents will continue to pay the same exempt fee and will not be income tested. The bill ensures that current service providers are not unduly burdened with administrative red tape in moving to the new system. This bill gives providers of aged care certainty in the transition from the old system to the new. For example, approved operators currently providing care, or who have approvals to provide care under the National Health Act 1953 or the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 before the commencement of the Aged Care Act 1997, will automatically become approved providers under the Aged Care BiII 1997. This approval will be retained whether or not these organisations are incorporated. This bill specifically allows existing approved operators to choose not to incorporate at the time of transfer to the new system. The Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 also makes provision for applications made under the old legislation that are not finalised at the commencement date of the Aged Care Bill 1997 to be considered under the new bill. For example, applications for approved operator status will be considered as applications for approved provider status under the Aged Care Bill 1997. In addition, sanctions on providers that are now in place remain as sanctions under the new bill. In addition, for Commonwealth funding received by providers up until the commencement day of the new legislation, this legislation will preserve the accountability processes so that this funding can be acquitted after the commencement of the new act. The consequential amendments will also redirect the payment of residential care allowance-formerly rent assistance-to providers of residential aged care rather than to residents. This is a technical change only that is designed to simplify administrative arrangements. It will not significantly affect either the amount of income residents are left with after they pay the base fee or the total funding available for providers. This bill will also amel1d the National Health Act 1953 in relation to a 1997 budget announcement to increase the number of days of respite that a person in receipt of the domiciliary nursing care benefit is eligible for. This will be an increase from 42 to 63 days of respite per year from July 1998. While this amendment is not directly linked to the residential aged care reforms, which are the main subject of this bill, it supports greater flexibility in the broader spectrum of aged care services that are available. People who receive the domiciliary nursing care benefit do so because they provide 24 hour a day nursing home level care to their spouse or to another relative. This amendment recognises the dedication of these carers to their family member and is another step towards honouring this government's commitment to carers. We are committed to achieving substantial reform in the residential aged care sector. This bill is essential to that reform and is the link between current legislation and the new Aged Care Bill 1997 that will allow this transition to occur. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. AGED CARE (COMPENSATION AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mrs Moylan, and read a first time. Second Reading",17
9,Mrs MOYLAN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995 to reflect the changes resulting from the introduction of the government's aged care reform package. The changes are reflected in the Aged Care Bill 1997. The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995 provides for the Commonwealth to recover moneys it has paid to, or on behalf, of a person for their care. The recovery is able to be made when the person receives a compensation ruling which includes the cost of nursing home care up to the date of settlement. The amendments proposed in this bill are required because, under the Aged Care Bill 1997, nursing homes will cease to exist when they become part of the new unified residential care system. The amendments insert residential care and residential care subsidy in the act and extend the coverage of the legislation to all residential care recipients after Aged Care Bill comes into force. I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. NA (ELECTION) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed.",19
10,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"When he stated that he was not an ardent republican, the member for Calare (Mr Andren), of all the previous speakers, probably came closest to my point. As he indicated, the question of what is essentially a very technical change is rather less important than the reality of unemployment in this country. Regardless of these changes, the fact of life is that cutbacks to labour market programs, the reality of an electorate with a high NESB population and interrelated heavy unemployment are far more crucial issues. My main focus in this debate is the nature of the process. Two comments put this in context. As an observer at the recent Pakistani elections, the former Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Fraser, stated that democracy in Pakistan was under question and was very threatened in the future, despite the massive majority of the new government. There were two essential reasons he gave for that: the continued intervention by the armed forces in Pakistani politics and, more importantly, the very low turnout of about 37 per cent. The Australian of 5 February 1997 stated: The Pakistan Muslim League, which has claimed victory, has said it was satisfied with the conduct of the polls. Mr Fraser conceded, however, that the low voter turnout could affect the new government's legitimacy. What we are seeing is a process that is aimed to discredit itself. The other comment that throws light upon this is from the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) on page 37 of the May 1997 issue of the Adelaide Review. He stated: Even if republican candidates win two thirds of the vote in the election for delegates (a heroic assumpthe tion in the light of the republican movement's inability to sign up more than 6,000 members after six years of media boosting) that still leaves the Convention ""do you want a republic?"" vote at about 88 to 64, which is hardly a ""consensus"" or even a particularly overwhelming majority for change. So what we are seeing, as I say, is a rather tawdry effort to ensure that there is minimal participation, that large numbers of people do not vote, that people are discouraged and find it difficult so that, at the end of this process, after the vote, regardless of the percentage that the republicans or the monarchists polland as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) well realises, the likelihood is that the majority, as indicated in virtually all polls, will plump for change-they will be able to say that there were problems with the process, ballot papers were lost, there were indications of fraud, there were indications of people interfering with people's ballots, there were collection problems with ballots in certain areas, et cetera. So the essential aim of this process, rather than all this talk about consulting the people and giving them a say, is really to minimise their participation. In retrospect, it seems rather cynical that we had these people saying in opposition that the previous Prime Minister was autocratic in his attempt to change the constitutional process in this country. They continually attempted to assert that he wanted to bypass the people and the parliament and do it in a very despotic and autocratic style. The process they have put before the people of this country is, as I said, essentially about making sure that they do not have a say and, when they do vote, minimising the effectiveness of it. The most disturbing of these changes is the introduction of a voluntary voting system in this process and, at the same time, the decision that it be by postal vote. This is the linchpin, the opening of the door, for Senator Minchin's determination to change the processes that this country has operated under since 1924. Many speakers have referred to the secret ballot as the Australian ballot. We know, historically, that the nature of the population of this country, the experiences that the people of this country had in the lead-up to Federation-their knowledge of the very undemocratic processes in the United Kingdom before the 1832 Reform Act, of the fact that people did not have secret ballots, that the local landlord controlled the ballots, that England was full of rotten boroughs where families could allocate or sell seats to people-meant they wanted to do something about it. So they introduced a secret ballot. At the same time, experience in the first two decades persuaded people of all political inclinations-free traders, protectionists, labour, et cetera-that there had to be an encouragement of a sense of civic duty and being part of the system for people to feel an identity with it, to feel that they had a role and that government and the political system related to them. So, in 1924, without much debate, they introduced compulsory voting. That came 14 years after Australia's introduction of compulsory registration. That process has served this country well. Anyone who follows the number of countries that have looked to this country for advice, for help and for structures in regard to electoral systems knows that it has served the country very well. Introducing this measure for the convention is, quite simply, an attempt by the government to give it a tryout and to undermine the 72 per cent support in this country for the current system. What voluntary voting is about, if we look at all the surveys in the United States, New Zealand and western Europe, is attempting to make sure that fewer people participate. All of the surveys show that those who do not participate have certain predominant characteristics. Unlike Senator Minchin, I do not think it is as clear-cut, in regards to the two political parties in this country, as to who will be advantaged. Increasingly, politics in this country is less class based. What we have seen in the US surveys is that it is the transient population of the country, the blacks, who basically tend to be interrelated with social and economic deprivation, young people and the less educated who are the people who do not participate in the US political process. They are the characteristics. It is obviously the thrust of Senator Minchin's determination to make sure that those people are not part of the process, to make sure they do not participate and to make sure they do not have a say. When we talk about compulsory voting, we all realise that the reality, the truth, is that one is not compelled to vote but one is compelled to tum up. Despite all of these claims about how people resent having to be part of it all, it is interesting to note that, when this country and its states moved from voluntary to compulsory voting, the actual increase in the number of people voting informal-basically making the choice to protest by not voting for any candidates-was, with the exception of South Australia, extremely minimal. There is not evident in the electorate a demand, a push, to get rid of this system. It is essentially partisan driven. It is driven by a belief, on the part of Senator Minchin, that there can be political advantage in this change. It is also interesting to note that, despite all the loyal speeches of those opposite, the ANU's survey of candidates at the last federal election showed that 44 per cent of coalition candidates support the continued presence of compulsory voting in this country. There is no reason to suspect that that poll was unrepresentative. We have a very grave concern with this process being utilised as a forerunner to a wider introduction of voluntary voting. It is not only a question of the past-that is a very simple, opportunistic and cynical kind of approach that some people have taken. If we look at the political system in the United States, we can see very good reasons why this voluntary voting system they are putting forward for this election process is wrong. As other speakers have noted, there is a situation in the United States where Timothy MCVeigh and the militias are representative of a wide disquiet in American politics. At the last election, something like 27 per cent of people in the American electorate actually voted for the successful candidate-I think a little over 50 per cent of the electorate voted at all. People feel marginalised. They feel ignored. They feel that the political parties not representative of them. They feel that they have no say in the system-it is big government, unrepresentative government, an establishment, something that does not relate to them. This is the ultimate outcome of the kind of process this government seems to be setting out on the road to. Unlike in the period of Roosevelt and even up to the 1960s when they actually made an effort to enrol more people and to get people to participate, what America has created, with the increasing sophistication of political advertising and computers and direct mail, et cetera, is a political process where those who are more likely to vote are those the political parties aim to persuade. They are the people who are targeted. They are the people whose views essentially dominate the political system. It is a self-perpetuating process where millions upon millions of people feel that they cannot have a say, that it is not worth having a say and that it is not worth participating. At the same time, we have the situation where the two major political parties are affected by two basic thrusts: firstly, middleclass suburbia, with its high potentiality to vote, tends to dominate socio-economic policies in those parties, and they become increasingly conservative about those issues. Second-this is a real threat that faces this country-there are certain special interest groups, whether they are gays, the christian right or the trade unions, which have an ability to mobilise people over and above the general population. What you see in the US political system is not only this appeal to conservative socio-economic values and the power of suburbia but also-parallel with that-the development, internally within the parties, of fringe specialist interest groups which are obviously far more persuasive in that system than they would be in Australia. Here the two political parties essentially have to appeal to a broad spectrum of the electorate. They have to persuade the vast majority of Australians as to their particular attitudes and issues. As I have said, we have very grave concerns with the introduction of voluntary voting in this process. We feel that it aims to are discredit the process by poor participation. It is interesting to note that people have referred to 1977 and the various referenda then. When people walked in the door to the ballot box that time to vote in the referenda and for the actual elections at the same time, half a million people did not bother participating in those referenda. So one has to put forward the proposition that there is going to be a very poor turnout. Part of this tawdry effort to minimise the Australian people's say and to put power into the hands of the Prime Minister and a small majority within the National and Liberal parties is the reality of a few of the other processes that they are involved in. We know that at the last federal elections approximately 450,000 Australians changed their enrolment in the election period. We know that the current government is attempting to shorten that period-on the surface, because of supposed fraud in the process. They are attempting to minimise people's right to change enrolment during an election period by reducing the time. In the debate about this matter we have heard it estimated that two million to three million Australians might not get a vote because the ballot papers are going to be posted to the address on the electoral roll. Locally, last week in my electorate, I had an interchange with a citizen who claims not to have changed his enrolment for six months because no election was due. This man is a businessman and one would have thought that his level of knowledge of our system would have been greater than the average constituent, but it is typical that people do not change their enrolment five minutes after they move house. I constantly have people coming in my electorate office. They might have lived in the area for a year, six months or whatever, but they have not bothered or have not got around to changing it. Three-quarters of them do not know how to do it. They do not know you go down to the post office. So around two to three million Australians will not have the opportunity to participate in this process because they will not be able to go down to the polling booth on the weekend. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters will be considering the liberalisation of the rights of people who are overseas for a number of years to continue to vote in this country, but in this process we see deliberate measures to make sure 200,000-odd Australians overseas do not vote. One really has to question why this government is attempting to make sure these people do not participate. Those 200,000-odd will not be able to participate because there will not be enough time, effort or opportunity for people in Australia to post the things overseas and get them back again. They will also be denied their right to be part of this system. The facade is about cost. There have been various estimates of between a $35 million and $50 million difference or between a $40 million and $49 million difference as to whether we have a postal voluntary vote or a compulsory attendance ballot. When the Australian people see the kind of expenditure that occurs in a variety of other areas in this country, when they see the government's attempt to basically give tax breaks to people on high incomes with their superannuation and other savings and the kind of loss to the Australian tax system that process brings, they really must question why such a measly, small amount is used to justify the elimination of participation by people in this important convention. If there is any person who should tell the Australian electorate how important this decision is-and I find it difficult to believe that he thinks the change is that fundamental-it is the current Prime Minister. He has belaboured the point of how important this is to the future of the country. At the monarchist selection meeting at the Sydney Town Hall last week, one of the candidates said that this process was more important than the Second World War against Hitler. So a process that is supposedly so important, so fundamental to our identity, so fundamental to our society is essentially going to be carried out on the basis of minimising people's rights to be part of it because it will cost a few dollars. The opposition is also concerned about the predominance of appointment in this process-once again, a deliberate manoeuvre by the Prime Minister to essentially minimise the input, the say, the participation, of the people and to basically monopolise it as far as possible in the hands of politicians. This kind of process goes against the constitutional issue of this country, the fact that he is attempting to ensure that not only do people have minimal say in it but also a majority of the appointees are from his side of politics. The whole attempt of this Prime Minister to minimise the say of the people, to walk over their views, to ignore them, is in sad contrast to the process in Barbados. Barbados has had a longer tie with the United KingdomEngland, Britain, et cetera-than Australia has. It is interesting to note in the British papers this week that Barbados is considering its continued connection with the British Crown. There we find a process whereby Richie Hayes, the opposition leader, and Billie Miller, the Deputy Prime Minister, together are talking through that process of how it can change. The Prime Minister is saying that this change is such a great aberration, such a seminal alteration of a situation. It is interesting to note that not only is there a joint approach to how they should move away from the current situation where the Queen is the head of state but also this is going to lead to a process where a significant number of Caribbean countries will go down the same road in the next five to 10 years. In conclusion, the opposition has fundamental objections to a process which, in the pretext of saving the Australian taxpayers' money, is designed to minimise their rights, to minimise their say and, essentially, to ensure a particular result.",19
11,Dr LAWRENCE,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"It is with great pleasure that I speak on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill not because I approve of its content but because I approve of the outcome that I believe will ultimately flow despite the resistance of this government. The bill in fact reflects a very long standing anti-republican sentiment on the part of those who are in support of the monarchy. One need only look to Australia's history right from its inception to see that that anti-republican sentiment has a long, if not an honourable, history. As MCKenna points out in his paper 'Tracking the republic', the question of an Australian republic actually began in 1788 when, as MCKenna puts it, 'Australia was settled by a people who believed firmly that a colonial state was a temporary stage of political development,' and that the final stage would be 'independence, separation from the parent state and the declaration of a republic'. So the first settlers very clearly saw that a republic was the necessary outcome of a mature democracy. In many cases, the United States was seen as an example of colonial development and as proof of the inevitable destiny of Australia as a republic, not necessarily in the same form, I might say. I think it is fair to argue, as MCKenna and others do, that from white settlement we have been part of a society undergoing a process of maturation, resisted by some and albeit often slow. There is nothing inevitable about this maturation: it requires effort, it requires foresight and it requires dedication, and we have seen that in the past, from our politicians particularly. It necessitates vigorous and persuasive leadership--something, I must say, which is sadly lacking in this case. For example, one of the things that we need to achieve as a mature society, apart from becoming a republic, is reconciliation with our indigenous people. The current debate about native title, the Wik decision and reconciliation shows all too clearly that need for effort, for foresight and for dedication and the necessity too for vigorous and persuasive leadership. Without it, we fall into dissent and disunity. Despite its long history in the Australian political debate, the republican ideal and, indeed, the label republican have often excited extraordinary fear and loathing in the minds of the defenders of privilege and the status quo. Sometimes they also defend the monarchy, but it often seems as if they are more interested in defending the status quo. The sound and fury of rebellion and bloody revolution appear still to reverberate with some when they think about the republic. I would like to draw the attention of the House to an amusing example of early attempts to discredit and scapegoat those who questioned government authority and looked to, for instance, the possibility of a republic. Two incidents in particular illustrate the controversial status of republicanism in colonial New South Wales, and I use these examples to indicate this long history of antipathy, although they do have some humour. 'In 1795 the English republican John Boston, who had allegedly sailed to Australia toasting the King's damnation, discovered that one of his best sows had been shot by marines in a close belonging to Captain Foveaux. Although Boston's aspirations to become a colonial merchant saw him in economic competition with officers of the corps'something that many lived to regret-there is little doubt, as MCKenna puts it, 'that his republican sympathies contributed to the loss of his sow. At the civil court hearing in 1795, Boston heard Lieutenant MCKellar denounce him as a man who had ""publicly drank to the murder of his King and the annihilation of the constitution of his country"". MCKellar also explained that the pig was shot 'not in malice or in wantonness' but because it was, amongst other things, destroying the property of Captain Foveaux.' Again, to quote from the court proceedings: Fences or fastenings were no security against the levelling practices of this animal, practices which I conclude are carefully and industriously inculcated in every part of the household of its master. 'In the eyes of Lieutenant MCKellar, the insidious pestilence of republicanism was even capable of converting farm animals into active advocates of subversion.' Although it might not be a pretty image, it is quite likely, as MCKenna put it, that Australia's first republican martyr was a pig. That is not to say anything about the contemporary supporters, but it does show that the word 'republican' was often used, and is still used, as a means of discrediting those who question government authority. Another example that I think gives voice to this is again one quoted by MCKenna. 'In 1806 Joseph Smallsalts, a convict who dared to utter ""expressions of inflammatory and seditious practices"" by declaring his support for the philosophies of Thomas Paine'extraordinarily seditious-discovered the very harsh penalties awaiting republicans in New South Wales and was actually given 100 lashes and sentenced to hard labour in the Newcastle coal mines. This does not happen to us today, but I think there are some on the other side who would like to see many of us abandoned in this way. 'On the journey north apparently he stood in chains in the back of a wagon, and the authorities had a large label sewn on to the back of his shirt on which were deciphered in large characters 'Thomas Paine'. Smallsalts defiantly declared he would be far more dangerous than Thomas Paine if thwarted.' I use these examples to indicate what I think is the sentiment behind this bill. There is a great deal of reluctance. It is very small minded and it still has resonances of this sentiment. The hill is sadly characteristic of the Howard government. It is timid, it is lacking in excitement or vision and it is pretty manipulative and mean in its approach to broad community wishes. Indeed, it is seeking to thwart them. The bill provides a very sharp contrast I think to the founders of our constitution, who knew they were embarking on the very serious business of constructing a constitution which would have profound repercussions on the future of Australia. We are embarking on the same course now and it should be given the same seriousness. They were also very clear at the time that they were embarking on the people's business. They were not doing it for themselves and for their own short-term political gains. They were not meeting reluctantly to consider an ill thought out promise made at the height of a failed leader's vulnerability, which is what we are debating here unfortunately in this bill. Many will remember that, when the member for Mayo, Alexander Downer, was the Leader of the Opposition, he was in a bit of a pickle and suddenly we had the people's convention. It has transmogrified into this strange beast we see before us, neither elected nor nominated fully. The legislation is clearly designed to reduce the likelihood of achieving a republic by diminishing the authority of the part elected and part nominated convention. I know there will be people working extremely hard to make sure that is not the case. I myself am a member of the Australian Republican Movement and, in my own area of Fremantle, I spoke recently at a very well attended forum on this matter. So there are people out there working very hard indeed to ensure that this is a people's convention and that it will be taken seriously by the wider community. On our side of politics, we would clearly prefer an unambiguous test of the people's will in an indicative plebiscite, not this partial opinion poll which will be bolstered by a preponderance of conservative coalition delegates, and I hope to illustrate that in a moment. The convention is also not a very good means of promoting community discussion. It clearly falls short of consulting the wider community and it leaves it to those groups who have already well-fonned positions to try to persuade their fellow citizens one way or the other. If the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is serious about wanting community consultation, this is not the way to achieve it. I think there is also a measurable risk that the forum will be used for other agendas and other purposes. I am sure many people have in recent days noted the publicity given to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). She indicated in an interview that her followers would probably-I think she almost said certainlyrun a ticket for the people's convention. But, interestingly, she refused to say what their view was on the desirability of a republic or of retaining the monarchy. So I think that is a fair indication that this will simply be used as an electoral test for other agendas which have nothing to do with either of those matters. From my own point of view, I think it is inevitable that some members of the far right and their fellow travellers, who will remain nameless, will find the platform irresistible, and I believe that will be very dangerous indeed. The principal weaknesses in the legislation, apart from these philosophical problems, turn around the question of the method of voting that is to be adopted-that is, the voluntary postal ballot-how the ballot will actually be carried out and the selection of community and parliamentary representatives. I think the combined effect of these weaknesses will significantly undermine the credibility of the convention. Indeed, I believe that is the clear intent of the legislation. The clear intent is to minimise participation, to reduce the voter turnout and to then be able to claim retrospectively that this shows a lack of community interest, and therefore either that we should not proceed at all or that the matter should be delayed. As many members have already said, the bill provides for a very unwelcome departure from the usual form of voting in federal and state politics: it is voluntary and it is by post. This method will disempower significant sections of the Australian community, particularly those who are mobile-and that is a great many-and those who live in areas remote from the centre of political discussion. It is likely they will not even know it is going on. Those whose first language is not English will find it difficult. Those who are illiterate or visually impaired will also have great difficulty in filling out the ballots and, of course, the exclusion of those who live overseas has been commented upon. This is a significant and deliberate watering down of the idea of a universal vote. It is not a question of cost. We have already heard that the margin between this and a compulsory attendance ballot would be as little as $9 million. It is a critical decision for Australia's future and it should not be hostage to the Prime Minister's peculiar spending priorities--either it is important or it is not. In any case, I think there is a lot of evidence to suggest that the Electoral Commission and Australia Post may be underestimating the cost of this postal voting system. In Western Australia, they have recently introduced postal voting at local government level and, in some cases, there have been costs of over $3 per elector. Given the number of candidates who will need to be described on these ballot papers, it is unlikely that the usual standard envelope will suffice. I think it is inevitable that the Australian Electoral Commission's final estimate will prove to be an underestimate and I hope that Australia Post are not left to carry the can if their assessment of the cost is wrong. In any case, the critical question is whether or not people should be given an appropriate vote, and a postal ballot falls short on all scores. It also creates a worrying precedent, especially given the government's flirtation with the idea of voluntary voting at ordinary elections. Previous speakers have highlighted some of the problems with this. It has all the hallmarks, to my mind, of a trial run for voluntary voting despite the fact that the majority of Australians have clearly shown that they are in favour of the retention of compulsory attendance at the ballot. There will inevitably be a low turnout, for a range of reasons, expected to range from 30 or 40 per cent to 60 or 70 per cent, depending on the constituency. Of course, that will invalidate the deliberations of the convention in the eyes of many, and rightly so. And that is no accident; that is clearly the governinformal ment's intention. The less validity these deliberations have, as far as they are conable cerned, the better. Other speakers have indicated-and I think this is important to underline-that our objection is a matter of principle, since polls show that voluntary voting would probably benefit republican candidates. we do not like this precedent; we do not like what it presages. I want to speak briefly on the voting system and how the ballot will actually be conducted. The selection of postal voting has resulted already in a number of undesirable features being foisted on the voters. Firstly, a very incomplete and confused adoption of the it Senate style voting system. I was appalled, when I read the Australian Electoral this Commission's submission, at their blithe adoption of the analogy with current betting systems. I, for one, have never set foot inside a TAB, and I am sure there are many others who have not, but it does show how far Kennett's obscene casino culture has penetratrepresentatives. ed our society when such an august body, and such a usually thoughtful body, should draw such parallels. I must say to the commissionparliamentary ers that I object. The mechanism, too, is inordinately complia cated and clearly disadvantages not want to vote the 'ticket' of grouped candidates and who want to vote for individulikely as. It will mean a great deal of informal to voting, there is no doubt about that, or people being forced to not vote at all because cannot vote the 'ticket'. It also needs to be said-although people do not want to hear this because we do have postal voting for some purposes in Australia already-that postal votes run the risk of being rorted. If you think about the way is delivered in large complexes with a high turnover of residents, there is every chance that ballots will be picked up by people for whom they are not intended. Preventing that may well result in further informal voting: instance, requiring people to put their date birth on the outside of the envelope, which one thing that has been suggested, or the person who forgets and therefore has an vote although it may have been perfectly proper. So there is a very considerdifficulty. And it fails our long-cherished requirement for a secret ballot-the so-called 'Australian ballot'. It is inevitable that it will be subject to the scrutiny of others-not in the every case but in many cases--especially given the delay between the delivery and the But closure of the polls. I also want to speak briefly about the appointment of delegates. Although the bill does not specially deal with it, clearly the whole convention depends upon the balance between the elected and the nominated delegates. They will make up half the convention and they will be very influential. First of all, is clear that there should be a proper balance between the various political parties in country, and what we have seen here is a breach with precedent so that the conservatives clearly have the upper hand. The representation will be biased in favour of the conservative parties. I must say that I am not sure why there should be any parliamentary We have our opportunity to vote; we have our opportunity to discuss these matters in these places. Why should there be representation? If the Prime Minister is absolutely clear about this being community consultation process, why have those who do members of parliament? The community representatives, too, are to be chosen because they are known the political parties, in particular the Prime Minister and his supporters. It is inevitablethey and you have heard this said by some of them-that they will be prominent citizens, again not necessarily representative of the wider community. Generally speaking, this balance of parliamentarians and selected known and prominent citizens will mean that post there is a bias not only in favour of the conservative view but also towards older members of our community. It is almost certain that, if you look at the bias, it will be in favour of the older members and, as Bean, for one of our prominent political scientists has of indicated, age has the most consistently strong is effect on choosing a monarchy. The older the citizen, the more likely they are-perhaps not surprisingly-to oppose republicanism. So again it is going to be stacked by pro-monarchists, by prominent citizens who will typically be older, and there is no guarantee, despite what the Prime Minister has said, that women will be properly represented; and that is something that I want to touch on a little further. One of the things that is very interesting about the nomination of these delegates is that the government has clearly failed to notify the community that they could self-nominate and has left it to senior political figures to nate on their behalf. Again, that hardly smacks of participation. Looking at the question of the involvement of women, I feel very strongly that, since no women participated in the constitutional conventions of 1891, 1897 and 1898, we should remedy this in this current convention and women should be eligible to participate, as they are through voting, through nomination, and it should be an important opportunity for women to participate equally in the constitutional debate. That means the government has a particular responsibility through its nominations to ensure the proper representation of women. It should undertake a community education campaign to make sure that women put their names forward. There are some suggestions which are backed by a great many women's organisations that the names of men and women are required to be alternated on group tickets registered with the Electoral Commission, ensuring that we do have equal representation of women in these very important considerations. Finally, I want to talk very briefly about procedures of the convention, which are nowhere referred to in this legislation but which we deserve to be able to discuss. Firstly, who will chair it and how? We certainly recommend there be an independent chair. What will be on the agenda and how will it be fully discussed? I am not aware of this being discussed with anyone in this place. How, for example, will a consensus be reached? How will we know when there has been agreement? What will be required by way of a vote or discussion? Does it mean 100 per cent consensus needs to be reached or will a majority vote do? My suspicion is that anything short of 100 per cent for a republic will see the whole matter put on the backburner for a very long time. I conclude where I started: this bill really resonates with the anti-republican sentiment that has been part of the conservative philosophy in this country for a very long time. It need not be. If we were to have a full and open discussion of this, an indicative plebiscite would be the best way to go. This strange nomi- beast, this convention, serves no purpose other than to diminish the weight of opinion, which is clearly in favour of a republic.",23
12,Mr OCONNOR,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Corio) (10.39 a.m.)The opposition has proposed a series of amendments to the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 because this legislation as it stands is seriously flawed. This legislation compromises the noble process that the nation should be engaged in at this time as it moves further down the road to full political maturity-that political maturity being Australia's final statement and expression of its structural political independence: the creation of an Australian republic, a republic led by an Australian. Labor courageously put this issue firmly on the national political agenda in the life of the last parliament. We saw this as a unique opportunity for Australians and the nation as a whole, with the move to the new millennium and the staging of the Olympic Games, to take the final step towards political independence. We took that action at considerable political cost. When we did, we acknowledged our the unique history and the contribution of the British political system to Australia's political development. When we put this item on the national political agenda, in no way was it seen to be a comment on the performance of the monarch, and it was not meant in any way to cause offence to those in the Australian community who deeply believed that Australia should hold to its current political structures and retain the Queen of England as the Queen of Australia. But Labor in government recognised the political realities of Australia as it moves beyond the year 2000 and the necessity for the government of the day to take a leadership role in putting this issue squarely before the Australian people. Simply, the time has come for an Australian republic. We put this item firmly up the political agenda, at considerable political cost. That cost was extracted by the conservative parties in this country when in opposition. They sought to diminish a fine national debate by dragging it into the partisan political arena. Nothing has changed since they came to power. This whole notion of a people's convention has simply one aim in mind; that is, to diminish and delay the process by which Australia finally moves to become a republic and to have an Australian head of state. That is the real agenda that was put by the conservative parties when in opposition and the one being pursued now that they are in government. No government that firmly believes in the principle of widespread public debate before significant constitutional changes are made and in participation and fairness would have come up with such a bill and presented it to the House. It is patently unfair, it is patently biased and it is structured so that this whole process by which the nation moves towards an Australian republic is diminished. But there is one thing the conservative parties in this country have never been able to do, and that is to stop the march of Australian history. They may be able to stall it the life of their Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or the life of the parliament but, as surely as the night turns to day, Australia will have an Australian as its head of state and, as surely as day turns to night, Australia will become a republic. It is not a question of if; it is a question of when. Unfortunately, this government is squandering one of the most unique opportunities we have had in this century to propel Australia to a new level of national debate over an issue central to the formation of our identity and to our political development beyond the year 2000. We can strip all the arguments away because it all comes down to one proposition: at the core of this debate in the parliament today about constitutional conventional processes is the essential question that nobody can deny or avoid, and that is, simply, should Australia have an Australian as its head of state? That is the core issue. This bill is merely a reflection of and an attempt to establish a flawed process by which Australia as a nation should be considering this essential question. There is one very easy way to test the water on this in a national, political sense, and that is to put the basic proposition to the vote, put the simple question to the Australian people: 'Do you want an Australian to be the head of Australia?' I think that, when we put that question, there will be an overwhelming and resounding positive statement by the Australian people that the time has come in our political history for us to take the final step and to unleash the great energies of this nation to give hope to our young people that there is a new dawn approaching in the Australian political system and there is a new dawn in their own history. That is not a statement that denies our past, but it is time that we made a statement about our future. The responsibility for the carriage of this most critical and important national debate rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Prime Minister. It is the Prime Minister who really has the leadership role in this critical issue of national debate. What has this Prime Minister done in his time in opposition for and now in his time in the prime minister's chair? He has thrown every political obstacle and mounted every political argument against the basic proposition that Australians should have an Australian head of state. I would have thought any person in this parliament and outside of it who was committed essentially to Australia. to the formation of its national identity, to the preservation of its cultural traditions and to the preservation of its great democracy would answer that simple question in the positive, that Australia should have an Australian as its head of state. Yet here we have a Prime Minister of a nation who cannot even take the one simple step of leadership and say to his own constituency and to the national constituency that it is time that Australia had an Australian head of state. It is deeply regrettable that in 1997 the Prime Minister of Australia cannot in his own mind and in his own heart countenance the very simple proposition that Australia should have an Australian head of state. It is not surprising that this Prime Minister cannot take test. that final step, because in every area of his prime ministership the issue of leadership keeps cropping up. The Prime Minister has consistently failed, in the brief time that he has occupied the prime minister's chair, to demonstrate to this nation his capacity for political leadership. It is a matter of common political knowledge that the coalition parties turned to John Howard because they had nowhere else to go. The dream team, the fabulous twosome, the young turks, the young bucks that were going to lead the coalition parties beyond the year 2000 fell at the first steeple. To whom did the coalition parties tum? To John Howard as Prime Minister, somebody that the Australian people had rejected on a previous occasion and even his own party had rejected on other occasions. So it is not surprising to me that the Prime Minister cannot take the final mental decision to commit himself to the proposition that Australia should have an Australian head of state. He has failed the leadership test on ministerial standards. We have seen in the of this parliament already a considerable debasement of the ministerial code of conduct that the Prime Minister held to his breast and waved before the Australian people at the election. He has failed to impose the ministerial standards on his cabinet that were the simple hallmark and were the simple principles by which Labor ministers lived their ministerial jobs for some 13 years. He has failed the test of ministerial he has failed the leadership test in that area. If we go to areas of significant policy expression and development in this country, if we go to the area of industry policy, we see that the Prime Minister fails to provide leaderhold ship. We keep coming back to the central proposition that this Prime Minister fails leadership test. When we come to this very critical, national, political issue of whether Australia should engage itself in a meaningful process of constitutional change and whether Australia should confront the simple proposition that it ought to have an Australian as its head of state, the Prime Minister backs away yet again and he fails that essential leadership The opposition have mounted a series of amendments which we believe improve a very bad piece of legislation. We are not happy with this bill and we are not happy with this process. We can simply resolve this argument real tomorrow with a simple plebiscite, a simple question put to the Australian people, but the Prime Minister refuses to do it. He wants to go in a convoluted way to try to debase the process and debase the issue. We are proposing a series of amendments to this legislation in the hope that what comes out at the end of the tunnel, what comes out of this parliamentary process, although the process might be flawed, is a bill that reflects some honour and reflects some-what shall we say; what can it reflectMr Barry Jones-Integrity.",27
13,Mr OCONNOR,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Integrity, that is the word. I was searching for a very simple word that would describe this particular legislation. My colleagues have gone through the limitations of this legislation, and those limitations are substantial. The first one of course is the life voting system that is going to be employed. We know that this is the thin end of the wedge as far as voluntary voting is concerned. It has been pointed out by my colleagues that last the financial difference between holding a compulsory ballot and holding a voluntary ballot is in the region of $9 million to $10 million. A compulsory attendance ballot in would cost in the region of $49 million and the existing proposition is going to cost in the standards and region of $40 million. But there are other important propositions in this legislation that are really offensive. This legislation compromises the notion of a secret ballot-the' Australian ballot' - that we dear and that is really at the heart of Australian democracy. This legislation will the disenfranchise many people in this country. The Australian Electoral Commission admits that there are two million people who move their places of residence in anyone year. It is estimated that, at the end of the day, some three million people may be disenfranchised by this piece of legislation and by this proconvention. cedure. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr has Barry Jones) has quite aptly pointed out to some of the more interesting features of piece of legislation. It devotes some sections to how voting will be undertaken Antarctica. There is no provision here to ensure that the 200,000 Australians who are travelling abroad in anyone year-people in London, for example-are able to cast a ballot or a vote in this process, but here have 16 sections of the bill devoted to voting might be undertaken in Antarctica. Section 85 provides for assistance to the frail aged and the infirm in Antarctica, but notomed where in this piece of legislation is there a 'out. provision to assist Australians who might be travelling overseas to cast their votes. In conclusion, there is the need for Australian community to engage in this critical national debate. I recently participated in a community forum organised by the place Centre for Citizenship and Human Rights and the Constitutional Centenary Foundation. was held at the Deakin University's wool stores campus. The topic for discussion was 'Towards the 21 st century: our possible tompeople orrows'. The member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) participated in that debate It was a very important community forum and participation in these sorts of community forums ought to take place right around the nation in considering this very important issue. The Prime Minister has failed the leadership test. The government has set out to sabotage the whole notion and the whole movement of this country towards an Australian republic and, as I said at the start of this debate, as sure as day turns to night they will fail.",29
14,Dr THEOPHANOUS,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"I have been told that I have about only five minutes to speak, so I will make my comments on the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill brief. Let me just reinforce the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on this matter about the huge problems with the process that has been put into place and the huge shortcomings with the election of the representatives for this I am very concerned that the process which been put in place will disenfranchise the me people who are most vulnerable in our comthis munity. It will also disenfranchise many 16 people whose knowledge of English is not in great. Why will it do that? Because we know already, from the local government elections in Victoria and those other places where this postal ballot approach has been taken, that the people who miss out the most are people of we non-English speaking background. Also, when how we consider that the Aboriginal community will not be able to take advantage of the mobile booths that they have become accusto, the Aboriginal community will miss The idea is that there is going to be a convention to determine some key questions the about the whole future of the Australian constitution, especially in relation to the question of the republic. We are to put in an electoral process for the representatives to this convention which is severely It flawed to the point where it is going to disenfranchise a large number of people. We are talking about estimates of up to a million of different backgrounds, and certainly a very significant number of people of nonas well. English speaking background. One of the features, for example, of the envelope that people have to fill in is that at the back of the envelope you have to put your date of birth. If you do not put your date of birth, it will be considered that you have not filled the form in legitimately or properly and it will not count as a vote. Is the instruction that you need to put in your date of birth put in different languages? Are people given an explanation in different languages? Of course not. Will there be publicity in different languages to ensure that people are aware of this provision? Unlikely. You are going to get a situation where there is not only a problem about the print being too small and people not being able to read what is there but also a problem of people from the various ethnic communities in this country, many of whose English is limited but who would like to participate in the debate through their own community forums, through their own media, through the various ethnic media, et cetera, not being able to read the instructions and not being able to understand the process. What is wrong with keeping to the process of going to a polling booth-a process that has been established in this country for so many years? People understand democracy. They understand elections as going to a polling booth and voting at a polling booth. This idea of introducing this corrupt process of postal ballots, as occurs with the councils, is now to be extended to the constitutional convention. I can tell you this: the government's intention is obvious. By making the process voluntary rather than compulsory, they think that they are going to open the door to the introduction of voluntary voting in Australia. Let me give the minister at the table, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull), a little bit of an idea. We will oppose tooth and nail any attempt to move away from compulsory voting, which has served this country very well and which has given us a dynamic democracy. If this is part of what you have in mind, you can forget it. Australia is a multicultural nation of many peoples of different backgrounds who have come together to live together, work together and grow together as a people. In this context, Billson, B. F. as the former Prime Minister said, the British monarchy is not relevant. It is not relevant to Australia any more. In particular, overwhelmingly it is not relevant to people from ethnic and multicultural backgrounds. As Paul Keating said, the people of modem Australia are drawn from virtually every country in the world. It is no reflection on the Gambaro, T. loyalty of a great many of them to say that the British monarchy is a remote and inadequate symbol of their affections for Australia. That was one of the reasons why he initiated the debate and moved the country along towards this discussion of a republic. We need to have that discussion, and we need to continue with that discussion. But the discussion and the outcome will not be fair, will not be legitimate, if the process for the election of these delegates is flawed. For that reason we will be moving a whole series of amendments to try to make the process much better and much more democratic. We hope that the government will support those processes. But if it does not, then that itself opens up the whole question of how genuine the government is about having a real debate with the whole of Australia, with people from a variety of backgrounds, about this central issue. Unless the government meet the concerns raised by the opposition, it shows that they are not serious, especially about consulting people of such a diversity of backgrounds and ensuring that everybody has a say in what is going to happen to the future of the constitution and especially the republic. Question put: That the words proposed to be omitted (Mr Beazley's amendment) stand part of the question. The House divided. [11.06 a.m.] (Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - Mr H.A.

17,Mr CHARLES,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"La Trobe) (11.14 a.m.)When I concluded my remarks, being interrupted on 26 March 1997, I was talking about victimology, despair and failure. The issue is one where too many young people-in fact too many in our society, particularly over the past 13 years under a Labor administrationhave come to believe, and have been told by people who believe they are doing well in the social welfare field, that these individuals are victims of society and that there is nothing about their circumstances that they themselves can do to improve, that society needs not only to look after them but also to nurture them, foster them, develop and provide for them. In a sense, in Australia we have become too dependent on outsiders. We have become too dependent on government and government services. In a sense, we have partially lost that age old tradition of taking care of ourselves, doing for ourselves, growing within ourselves and benefiting from our own work and efforts. I hope that the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill will start to help us redress a minor portion of that problem. Over the last few weeks since the parliament stopped sitting in March I have had the opportunity to talk to hundreds and hundreds of young people around Australia who are school age children. Over and over again I or one of my colleagues asked these children what they thought of the work for the dole scheme, whether they thought it was fair and equitable, whether they thought they would participate if they could not find a job or whether they thought their colleagues, friends and neighbours who were currently on unemployment benefits and on the dole would approve of such a program. I can tell you that universally the hundreds of young people I spoke to approved the concept of the work for the dole scheme. It is significant that young people themselves apparently believe that it is right and proper that, if a person is to receive assistance from the government for their living expenses when they cannot find work, they should put something back into the community, which is funding their living expenses, in order to help the community. Many of the young people that we spoke to said they believed that many young people who were on unemployment benefits really just did not want to work. They may have been naive to some degree, and I could not tell you to what degree that is, but there was a strong feeling that there is work available for young people. It might not be the kind of work that they wanted. It might not be a management job, it might not be the managing director's job and you might have to get your hands dirty. It might be menial work that is sometimes uninteresting and sometimes at inappropriate or inconvenient hours, but that work is available and, for those who wanted to work, employers in the main are willing to give young people a go. That is really significant. These hundreds of young people believe that, if they have the right attitude and if they have a bit of skill training, they can find some meaningful employment-some employment in some field in the area in which they live. These young people universally said that they approved of the work for the dole scheme and that they thought it would help those who do not have work and depend on the public for their living to have a better life, improve themselves, and understand better the nature of work, what it is all about and how they have to approach that work itself. There is no question whatsoever that anyone who has never worked cannot truly understand the nature of work. I recall back in March the member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) was talking about the time when we had a system of on-the-job training in Australia. He was, in a sense, decrying the fact that that age had gone. I have no disagreement with the member for Curtin. I too might wish that that time was still here, but it is not. I might wish that the time when the majority of society was made up of what we now call nuclear families still continued and that the high divorce rates that we see today did not exist in our society, but wishing will not make it go away. The nature of work has changed. The nature of jobs has changed. The kinds of jobs that we have out there in real work have changed. All have changed and we have to learn to adapt, work and live with that. The work for the dole scheme is not a panacea for unemployment. It is not meant to be seen as giving young people the permanent kind of real employment that they need. It is seen as an opportunity to benefit those who do not have work and who need some work experience in order to be able to convince future real employers that they may be able to benefit their company, operation or business. That is certainly very positive. They will gain skills that help them better fit into society, to have meaningful lives; real work that gives them value, contentment and enjoyment as well as remuneration out of that work for the dole. During committee travels over the last few weeks while parliament has not been sitting I have spoken to numbers of Aboriginals and others having to do with the CDEP scheme. That scheme, run by A TSIC, is for unemployed Aboriginals. It provides basically the same incentives as the bill we are talking about today will provide: work for two or three days proportionate to the amount of receipt of the dole. The people who accept the CDEP scheme-those Aboriginal young people and sometimes middle-aged people who work under that scheme-voluntarilv give up their social security payments as thdole and instead they receive a payment for work that they do on that program. The responses I had from people telling me about whether those programs worked or not differed depending on which Aboriginal community was talking about the program. Some were very positive. They said that the work they undertook involved good community development programs that helped the communities overall and that the young people developed a se-lse of worth and more of a sense of belonging to the community because they were contributing to the community. They had also developed some work skills and some understanding of what the world of work was like. Others were not so positive. They said that some of the jobs were a bit demeaning and sometimes they did not produce the outstanding results that appeared in other communities. But it is inevitable when programs are run that there are varying results depending on the area and depending on the people. This is a good bill. It is a good initiative and I congratulate the government. I commend the bill to the House. (Time expired)",39
18,Mr MOSSFIELD,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"In supporting the amendment moved  Baldwin) to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997, the Labor Party recognises the serious problem of youth unemployment and the major social consequences arising from this problem. However, we believe the government's proposal is, at best, a lazy one that has not been thought through. It is an unconsidered attempt to overcome this problem and I really believe that our young unemployed deserve better. The proposal of the government is important in many ways as much for what it does not say as for what it does. Firstly, it is a clear indication that the government does not expect unemployment to drop significantly in the near future. This is understandable when you consider that the official unemployment figures had increased to 810,800 or 8.8 per cent of the work force in January of this year. The figures for March and April were 8.7 per cent. But the important point is that full-time employment continues to decline. The proposal is a panic move. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) himself said during the election campaign: We do not support the introduction of a work for the dole scheme. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) also said some time back in 1995: There is no thought at all ... of making any kind of work for the dole scheme a compulsory scheme. But that is what the government has done. As Alan Ramsey said in the Sydney Morning Herald of 22 March: And if the scheme is so popular, both with the community at large and young people themselves, why the necessity to legislate for compulsion? Why does the Government want the right to force people to work in what is supposed to be essentially a range of pilot programs if there are, as it claims, so many people willing to take part? The second issue that this proposal tells us about the government is that there was no real program to get unemployed people back into the work force. Unlike what the Labor government achieved with its Working Nation program, which created over 739,000 jobs in the last three years of that government's term, the coalition government has responded to rising unemployment by ripping out $1.8 billion from labour market programs. Even the choice of the appropriate minister to run this program gives us an insight into the government's thinking. Senator Vanstone, who is the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and who administers what is left of labour market programs, has been overlooked. The junior minister, Dr Kemrr-the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training-has been given the responsibility for running this program. I hope the relationship between schools and working for the dole is purely coincidental. The third issue that arises out of this proposal is that it is award free. The minister, Dr Kemp, in his second reading speech, specifically said: Amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 would also establish that participation in work for the dole would not give rise to an employeremployee relationship for the purposes of the following acts: the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1991; the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988; the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992; or the Workplace Relations Act 1996. No way. The government does not want these people covered by an award because this would allow these people to stand up for their rights. It might even get the trade union movement involved-and, clearly, the government would not want that to happen. Once again, I believe the coalition government is using the work for the dole scheme to condition people not to be too worried about award coverage when and if they enter the work force on a full-time basis. The fourth issue that causes me some concern in the proposal-it is not clearly spelt out-is whether people who are working for the dole will take the jobs of other people. This is a major problem. Unless the work involved is as menial as sweeping the footpath-and if that is the case, the proposal is a waste of time-and if there is any element of skill or value to the community, whether it be in tourism, environmental work, restoration work or a community service, there is an important principle that should be followed; that is, this work should be carried out by people employed on a full-time basis under award conditions. This would enable unemployed people to have full-time jobs and some self-respect. It would take them off social security and make them self-respecting taxpayer members of the community. The fifth issue is the proposal that people work for the dole either two or 2'/2 days a week. This is a clear case of conditioning people for part-time work as a way of life. This is an attack on the working conditions of Australians. Job growth is in the part-time area, as we all know. In January there were 38,400 new jobs created: 35,000 of those were part time. The government is saying that if you work 20 hours you are considered as being in full-time employment. Part-time employment means that working conditions that are so important to the blue-collar, middle-income and lower income people could well be lost. Very important conditions such as annual leave, long service leave, sick leave, maternity leave and compassionate leave will tend to drift into the past under the government's work for the dole proposal. What are employer groups saying about this scheme? In an article by Mark Davis and Louise Dodson in the Financial Review of 11 February, employers' views are expressed as follows: Employers have warned that the federal government's work-for-the-dole plan is unlikely to make the young long-term jobless any more attractive to them as potential employees. Private sector groups yesterday reacted coolly to the government's plan, warning that most firms would be reluctant to take on long-term unemployed, even if they had work for the dole. The article continued with a quote from Garry Brack, who is the Executive Director of the Employers Federation of New South Wales. I quote Mr Brack's remarks: The longer somebody has been out of the workforce, the les- attractive they becomebecause they become detached from all the things that are relevant to work, including getting out bed and being at work on time, being motivated to perform. Gary Brack concluded: That may make schemes like this desirable from a societal point of view. But you have still got to find some way of making them attractive to employers. That is a very important point that employers themselves are making about the work for the dole program. They are saying it will not work. So where are we going to go when these people have completed work for the dole? Are they going to go back on unemployment again? In my own electorate of Greenway, the President of the Blacktown Chamber of Commerce and Industry has this to say: The federal government's scheme of making people work for the dole will do little to tackle western Sydney's high unemployment rate. Unemployed need structured training and real work experience if they are ever going to get a job. The Howard government recently cut back on most schemes that provided this type of structured training and work experience. The Chamber participated in these schemes last year and was able to place over 100 people in real jobs. This year because of the cutbacks we missed out. That was a view being expressed by the President of the Chamber of Manufactures in my electorate of Greenway. I intend to ensure that my electorate is well aware of the 11 points that the Labor Party is trying to get into this legislation, which will strengthen it considerably. The government will not be permitted to forget that it abolished all decent programs while using our words to describe and reintroduce new programs which all seemed to be tarred with the same brush, as is shown in the work for the dole proposal. I will move through the 11 points fairly quickly. The first point is that the scheme should not displace existing workers. The second point is that resources must be made available to enable payment for activities at the relevant national training wage award rate. The third point is that participants must be guaranteed accredited onor off-the-job training within the work activity. I will pause here, because this is a very important point which is missing of from the work for the dole proposal and will virtually mean that the people who are doing this work will not get any accreditation or recognition if they do obtain some skills. To support that point, I would like to refer to a paper presented to the Tasmanian Education Consortium in Hobart in October of last year by Richard Sweet from the Dusseldorf SkilIs Forum. That speech contained this paragraph: Another way to build upon young people's experience of part-time, casual and temporary work would be to recognise it better. The intention here should not be to build recognition around national competency standards that assume continuity of employment within a defined occupation or industry, for young people who spend significant periods of time on the margins of the labour market rarely spend continued periods of time in the same job. The intent should be to recognise basic employability attributes that are important in all work, rather than those competencies that are specific only to some forms of work, and by recognising them better, help to define and shape them in the minds of young people and of employers. Better recognition of the skills gained in part-time, casual and temporary work would also involve a much clearer documentation of the skills that young people acquire at particular work sites, and the building up of these, together with a record of progress in achieving key generic employability attributes, into a portfolio or skills record. If that type of training and documentation of the work that young people do on the dole were available, it would clearly strengthen the proposal. I would urge the government, in considering this legislation, to take very considerable consideration of the remarks of people such as Richard Sweet, who are quite knowledgeable in this area. I will move on to the other points we believe should be contained in this legislation. Point four is that appropriate case management and supervision must be available to all participants, to assist them to make decisions about opportunities under work for the dole management and associated onand off-thejob training. Point five is that participants must be able to leave the scheme to accept employment opportunities, without penalty. Point six is that access to financial assistance must be available to potential employers, to cover such costs as supervision and materials. Point seven is that the government must ensure that appropriate levels of financial support for workers compensation, superannuation and safety aspects are available. Point eight is that financial assistance must be available to participants for unavoidable employment related costs, such as protective clothing, safety equipment, transport and child care. Point nine is that placements must offer opportunities for a minimum of six months. Point 10 is that organisations contracting to provide employment projects must state the proportion of people who will gain permanent employment following the placement. Future contracts should be based on performance against these commitments. Point 11 is that implementation should not require further trials. The experience of the Working Nation programs, such as LEAP and new work opportunities, provides more than enough effective models on which to build a successful program. As honourable members can see by studying the foregoing, we on this side of the House have strong policies and have researched quite deeply what is necessary to get young unemployed people back into the work force. The policies are fair and reasonable but ensure that those very disadvantaged young people can in no way be exploited by enthusiastic amateur employers or unscrupulous entrepreneurs. I understand that we are restricted in time, so I will conclude my remarks by quoting at random a couple of views of people who have some interest in this field. My own branch of the Australian Labor Party has written to me expressing three of its concerns relating to the work for the dole proposal. One is the potential exploitation of the unemployed. The branch says: Members were concerned that the unemployed participating in this scheme would be paid at below-award rates; The second is excessive exposure to risk. It says: It is not clear, for example, as to whether or not scheme participants will be covered by comprehensive accident insurance while on the job; The third is a lack of focus on developing career paths. It says: Many branch members argued that the scheme is designed more with an eye to satisfying public opinion rather than removing the structural and/or individual hurdles which are preventing the long term jobless from obtaining meaningful employment. It was the view of the Branch that the Government's Work for the Dole proposal will not promote the development of sound career paths . . . The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) referred to the inquiry conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and its tour to a number of states in Australia where he had contact with a number of school children. I was also on that committee and that review. It is true that there is a mixture of views as to whether this is a good thing for people who are unemployed. I would suggest that young school people would not have a full understanding of all the ramifications of the work for the dole proposal-it might seem to them to be a good idea. I will quote three items from a submission that was put to the committee by the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition. In my view, this was a very good submission. It had a lot of support. It spoke on behalf of young people and was drawn up by young people. I think the government would be very wise to take note of it. They say: AYPAC rejects the proposition that a response to a declining youth labour market should include a compulsion that young people participate in programs that force them to perform work for continued receipt of Government income support. Such programs, typically called work for the dole schemes, do not provide a solution to the central problem that confronts unemployed young people, ie, a lack of real sustainable jobs that will provide them with an independent living income. Work for the dole schemes do not solve youth unemployment, they force young people to perform work no one else wants to do for below poverty line ... They also make the point: Work for the dole schemes act only to marginalise young people into areas of work that do not attract a market income. Such marginalisation serves only to exclude young people for longer periods from the mainstream labour market, is not an efficient way to improve young peoples skills and will not assist young people to move to independence. Forcing young people to perform work on a compulsory basis that no one else wants to do or will pay to be done is simply a form of exploitation and neglect. The final point I raise from this submission reads: Work for the dole proposals recognise the chronic nature of youth unemployment but do nothing to resolve the key issue of significant job deficit. Work for the dole and make work programs are neither an equitable nor practical solution to youth unemployment. They are, in fact, an admission of failure. I once again emphasise that the government would be very wise to take note of those three points that I have quoted from the submission of the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition.",40
19,Mr MAREK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"Capricornia) (11.42 a.m.)In early January, prior to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announcing the introduction of a work for the dole scheme, I floated the idea of a work for the dole scheme in my electorate of Capricornia whilst being interviewed by the leading Morning Bulletin news journalist, Mr Jason Purdie. The idea received front-page headlines and a lot of positive community reaction. I made the suggestion on the basis that if it was good enough for Aboriginal communities to work for the dole under the community development employment program, then it should be good enough for other recipients of unemployment benefits to work for the dole as well. While there are two sets of rules in this country-for black and white-the country will continue to be divisive. We Australians live in a multicultural society. I do not care what is the land of your origin, the colour of your skin, the look of your face or the accent of your tongue. We all have a common goal-that is, to make Australia the best place on earth to live. The public reaction to the work for the dole scheme was mixed. But what most surprised me was the reaction from the young people in the community. Almost all of those who were approached by different sections of the media supported a concept of a working system for the dole. When we floated the idea, we were approached straight away by many different community service groups, like New Horizons and Centacare. When we looked at the scheme, we thought that maybe local councils should become involved in it. Basically we would have the mayors of each of the shires on our board, particularly from places like Capricornia because there are so many shires within that electorate. The idea was to ensure that projects put forward for work for the dole recipients to do would not take work away from small business. As far as I can see, it is absolutely imperative that small business be looked after, particularly in respect of these schemes. The scheme could go many different ways. Participants could help the elderly by mowing lawns, taking the elderly shopping and acting as carers, basically helping them to remain in their homes longer. Many of the elderly wish to stay at home and do not want to be put into nursing home centres and those sorts of things. They would love the opportunity to be able to stay at home. I am more than sure that, if implemented in the right way and with the right people with the right attitude, this could happen with the work for the dole scheme. So, as far as that is concerned, I commend the young people in my electorate for this positive attitude in relation to their statements in the media on the work for the dole scheme. However, some of the older generation in the community did not agree that they should work for the dole, and some of them wrote to the local newspapers and telephoned my office to voice their protest. Most of these people were genuinely looking to find employment, but they could not find anything in their hunt for that elusive job. They want to continue to look for that job on a full-time basis. I am compassionate towards their point of view and I would much rather see people searching for a job on a full-time basis as long as they were actually doing something to ensure that they were going to get a job, and there are many different systems that we could implement. Therefore, before we impose the work for the dole requirement on people over the age of 21, I would like to see a set of standards imposed on claiming unemployment benefits and those who do not meet those standards can then be required to work for the dole. The sorts of standards I would look at are based on the number of jobs applied for and, of course, interviews undertaken, particularly over a given time. We could evaluate this through the social security employment diary that was implemented by this good government in the past year. It is fair and reasonable that young Australians in receipt of the jobsearch allowance participate in approved work for the dole programs in return for such payments, especially until the job market picks up and there are more employment opportunities available. The reason I say that it is fair and reasonable to expect young people to work on these programs is that most of them have never had a job and have never paid tax. This means that they have not contributed to the welfare of this country, yet they expect to be supported by the government. I know there will be moans and groans out there from some parents that they have paid tax and contributed to welfare so the welfare system should look after their children, but in so many cases today we see the parents unemployed as well which causes an enormous drain on this country's finances. I believe we should restrict unemployment benefits to young people under the age of 21. I believe we should institute a program that provides young people with a number of alternatives to unemployment benefits. They should be required either to have a job to go to, to attend a university or TAFE training, to go on the work for the dole scheme or-and I have floated this idea before and there are many people out there who agree with it-to go into a type of national service or, as some like to call it, boot camp. We should be instilling in our young people, especially those still at school, that there will be no access to unemployment benefits until they have worked or paid tax for at least two years. This, I believe, will engender a different philosophical attitude among our young people. Currently they are being told by their teachers, parents or their mates, 'If you can't get a job, go on the dole and the taxpayer will keep you.' That attitude must cease. It is creating a lethargic society of young people. They must learn that it is tough out there in the big wide world and that this world owes them nothing. As far as I can see, they must get in there and have a go, put their best foot forward. They should be encouraged to stand up for themselves and make sure that this is the best way to go. I am sure that the young people will realise that they have to contribute to society rather than look for that inevitable handout. I am also sure that, when prospective employers start to search for new staff, those people who have been on the work for the dole scheme will be the sorts of people the employers want to pick up. Those people have a work ethic. Those students who have just left school want to have a go. I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and we have spoken to many employers and youth groups. The employers have said, 'If we're looking for an employee, we'll look for somebody who has probably done some time at MCDonald's or somebody who has gone out there and had a go and done some part-time work.' This is indicative of the way the country is. Employers want young people who have a good attitude to work. A number of employers in my electorate ha\e indicated to me that they would view someone who has been on this work for the dole scheme more favourably than someone who has been unemployed for 12 months or more. I am aware of some complaints that the work for the dole scheme does not provide these young people with job training and only treats them as slave labour. While the scheme is not meant to provide specific training needs, I am certain that any young person who volunteers for one of these programs will work better, particularly after getting a working education, than someone who has sat in front of the TV for so long. We have a mentality in the youth of today that when they come home from school they sit down in front of the TV. They do not go outside and do something for themselves. While that mentality is there, we are always going to have problems. Mr Martin-Tum it up.",44
20,Mr MAREK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"As the member interjects, it is that Socialist Left mentality that is causing a lot of the problem. Mr Martin-Excuse me. New South Wales Right, if you don't mind.",46
21,Mr MAREK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,You were involved in it. It was your scheme. You were involved with Keating for many years and his attitude was to keep the people,46
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,Mr Andrew)Order! The member for Capricornia has an obligation to address his remarks through the chair.,46
23,Mr MAREK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Training is expensive. We have seen how much it can cost with the figures provided by the former government's new work opportunities scheme, which cost the princely sum of $143,000 per head to train people. For what? It was only to go back on the dole queue again. In most instances, the training they received was totally wasted. Sure, they learnt how to plant trees and lop branches and, as the memb-r for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) promotes, the painting of rocks. You really must question his credibility. He attacks the government about putting forward a scheme that the majority of good Australians are calling for, but I am sure something could be arranged should the government make it an order of the day. Commenting again on Labor's new work opportunities scheme, what was the use of it all, especially when no level of government was increasing its work force in the parks and gardens area or employing more rangers to look after the environment? In fact, most levels of government were shedding staff. All we ended up with was a surplus of nurserymen and women that nobody wanted. What? For $143,000 a pop? You have to be kidding! The former government must be condemned for providing such a waste of taxpayers' money and a complete waste of the applicants' time and trouble. This philosophy is typical of the Labor Party, which is the socialist welfare mentality that I was talking about before. They spend all the taxpayers' money on poorly planned employment programs that give little or no positive result so that people are so dependent on the government that they cannot afford to be without the high level of welfare. The young people in our country need to get rid of the cobwebs. They need to get out of the house for a couple of days a week and work on local community projects so they can feel proud of their efforts. It will improve their self-esteem, it will improve their communication skills and it will provide them with a work ethic. Most of all, it will give them something productive to do for the benefit of everyone in the community. I commend this bill to the House, but I also call on the government to look at some of my other broad suggestions, particularly in relation to restricting unemployment benefits to those under 21. People in this country must have a work ethic. They must know what it is all about. Going on the dole straight after finishing school is not a great initiative and it does not help contribute to this great community that we live in.",46
24,Mr MARTIN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"This particular piece of legislation that we are debating this morning goes by the regrettable title of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997. I cannot recall ever having seen in the nation's parliament a phrase such as 'work for the dole' inserted as part of the title of a piece of legislation. Where has its genesis been? It has been in the polling which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Liberal Party have done. It is a phrase that resonates in the community and they think-as the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Marek), who has just scurried out of here, obviously believes-that all young people in Australia come home from school, sit around in front of the television and bludge off their parents. They think that, when young people leave school, they do not particularly want to get a job, instead they want to club in together, get a house somewhere, go to the beach all the time and just live off government welfare. As a consequence, work for the dole has been introduced as a concept which this government thinks is going to salve the economic ills of this country. Let us look at the reality of what is being proposed here, and it was even in the budget released earlier this week. Ten thousand pilot projects form the basis of this great bit of social revolution, this great centrepiece of economic fundamentalism in Australia10,000 places. They are notionally targeted at young people but, even as admitted by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) himself, this could also apply to any age group within the broad Australian community. Whoopee-do. What about the other nearly 900,000 people out there who presently, not through circumstances of their own making, not through their own fault, are also looking for employment opportunities? We have had this government hell-bent on destroying anything that the Hawke-Keating governments put in place-whether it be in social security, whether it be in employment generation opportunities, whether it be in anything-simply because they want to extinguish from the landscape anything those former governments did. The honourable member for Capricornia talked about some of the One Nation programs and said, 'They didn't do anything.' What is being proposed under this work for the dole scheme? My colleague the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) was talking about painting rocks and so on. In fact, that is exactly the sort of thing the Prime Minister used to refer to when talking about these schemes before he suddenly had some sort of Damascus like conversion to saying that this was what was needed. And why? Because it was simply a phrase that resonated out there in the community. Suddenly, the Prime Minister jumped on the bandwagon-like he does with everything else he thinks is popular out there in the electorate. There was no leadership, no vision, no guidance from Australia's point of view. He said, 'This is what we'll do. Here are 10,000 pilot projects. We'll give them a few dollars and get them out there in green corps or get them out there doing weed clearing somewhere. ' There is no training. We could not have training-that would be abhorrent to those in the government. We could not have any training like we used to have in the programs that we had in place. There is going to be no recognition after the event. There is going to be no piece of paper saying these people were lucky enough to be part of the 10,000 out of the 900,000 unemployed. There is going to be no piece of paper to say they have some accreditation at the end of the scheme so they have something to set them up for life. As the member for Capricornia said, 'All these young people don't want to work anyway. They want to sit in front of the television, play computer games and whatever.' I think this issue is a bit beyond the joke that it has turned out to be. What was the genesis of this little brainstorm that the government had? The genesis was that the Prime Minister turned up at the Channel 9 studios one Sunday to be interviewed by Laurie Oakes. The government was under a tad of strain at the time because one of its number in the Senate had been caught out. There was some concern about Senator Woods and what he was and was not doing and whom he was doing it with. As a consequence, the Prime Minister decided he needed some sort of a circuit breaker. He needed to make some sort of an announcement just to try to get the heat off the government. What did he come up with? Work for the dole. The interesting thing was that, 18 days after the announcement was made by the Prime Minister on the Sunday program, when anyone rang the minister who had responsibility for the delivery of the service-that is, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) or the junior minister in this place-the only response they were given was a copy of the Prime Minister's press release and a copy of the transcript of the Prime Minister's appearance on the Sunday program. That is all they knew about it because no-one had heard of it. Senator Vanstone, when asked about it the next day, shrugged her shoulders and in true Aunty Jack fashion said, 'Well, I don't know. No-one's told me about it.' And that was exactly right. It was policy on the run. It has been pointed out by a number of people on this side of the parliament when talking about this that there were all sorts of complaints levelled by people who were delivering services of this nature into the broad community about the effectiveness of it. I remind people of an article in the Australian on Monday 24 March 1997 by Glenn Milne under the headline 'Work for dole plan hardly greeted with heavenly trumpets'. In this particular article, Milne goes through the circumstances of the scheme's genesis and talks about some views expressed by people and organisations that have delivered services to young unemployed and older unemployed for some time. He talks about the opinions of the Australian Youth Action Coalition, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, the Australian Council of Social Service and the Salvation Army. He talks about the Adelaide City Mission, the Australian Volunteers Association, the Sydney City Mission, the Open Family, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Australian Local Government Association. He talks about their views and he clearly indicates that these organisations-business and welfare organisations-were less than enamoured about the proposal. Having gone through and talked to all of these people, he says: So, to sum up: five of the most representative church and social welfare umbrella groups in the country--groups conceivably critical to work for the dole's success-have fundamental objections to the scheme. The remaining social welfare groups have reservations about the scheme's worth without real training. That is right. I think that the concept of having younger and older unemployed people involved in some sort of a scheme is not a difficult thing to grasp. We did it under One Nation; we did it under Working Nation. But we included the training component with it. What is the point in simply putting people for six or 12 months on some sort of task which has been ill-defined so far and then at the end of the day not having them trained in some way to be available to be taken on as 'real employees' in--to use that dreadful term'real jobs' as distinct from 'unreal jobs'. I have never been able to get what the Prime Minister means by that: what are real jobs and what are unreal jobs? People talk about part-time jobs in a derisory fashion. They say that part-time jobs are no good, and that everybody wants a full-time job. Well, people do not! I am sure a majority of people in the community want a full-time job-and that is right. We all in this place should be striving to achieve that by economic policies that will see this country continue to grow. But there are other people who want part-time jobs, so they should not be put down. They should not be simply dismissed out of hand and told, 'You are some underclass; you have a part-time job; you should not really be doing that; you should be striving for a full-time job.' Parental responsibilities in some cases cannot allow that, so you do not put those people down. The Glenn Milne article goes on to say: Don't worry, though,and he was talking about some leaked minutes from the meeting David Kemp, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, had with all of these groups that I have mentioned. He says: Don't worry, though, the minutes also record that Kemp noted 'a survey in this week's Bulletin indicates 75 per cent support for the initiative'. Glenn Milne continues: Kemp is probably right then; work for the dole is a political goer. Which is all the Government probably really cares about. I think that is dead right. We on this side have tried to take a reasonable approach to this. We have actually moved a second reading amendment, not declining to give the bill a second reading in this House but having made some positive contributions to the debate. We have pointed out the training issue. There is a need for training for ple--there is no question of that. Recent statistics indicate that people now change employment three times in their lifetime. At each of those occasions, have to go through some reskilling, retooling and retraining. This program being advocated by this government does not even give them the first step, the first leg up to something which is as important as training. Australia has passed into this incredible technological society as we lead into the next century. I not think anyone could deny that technology is a boon to humankind, but it is also a bane in some respects because technology displaces people from jobs. If we are going to look at the concept work into the next century, we have to change some of our more traditional views of what that means. It is not simply going to work from nine to five and doing a variety of tasks. We have to harness that technology and we have to make it work for us so that we make work for us, and that is an important element in any discussion here. We also need this two-way commitment, this reciprocity. I have heard coalition speaker after coalition speaker advocate that when we had some form of social security system in place, when we were in government, there was no reciworth procity, there was no commitment on behalf of the recipients of social security benefits give something back. That simply was not true. If people were not actively looking for meaningful employment, if people were not out there actually being case managed by people if they were longer term unemployed, their benefits were reduced or cut. There was reciprocity there. It was not the television syndrome that the member for Capricornia referred to. There was reciprocity and that is why it is an important element in any scheme of this nature. It is something that has to be really borne in mind. At the end of the day, we should not be debating these pilot programs that are bandaid solutions to the more fundamental problem in Australia. Both sides of this parliament should be embracing an appropriate industry policy with two pinnacles: education and R&D. In the last 14 months since this government has peobeen in government, it has cut R&D funding by $2 billion. You talk to any overseas country-any of the Asian tigers. Why do they have the substantial growth rates that they they do? Because their governments know that they have to invest in those twin reasons, education and R&D, to stimulate their economies. If you look at Malaysia, Singapore or any of those Asian tigers, it is in R&D and education that investment is being made. For some unknown reason, this government in this do country has decided that we do not need to do that. It is called business welfare. It is not business welfare; it is national welfare. It is something which will assist industries promote new job opportunities to of take up the slack that exists now from some of the industries which have more traditionally provided employment opportunities. I will give an example from my own electorate of Wollongong-and I have referred to BHP in a similar way before: in 1983, 26,000 people were directly employed at BHP; now, 6,800, and about to become about 5,000, yet productivity has gone through the roof. The steel industry is working effectively in the port of Port Kembla and in Wollongong more generally. The reason they have increased productivity is the investment of about $3 billion of high technology in that steel plant. That illustrates the difficulty for a region to like the Illawarra. How do we offset those job losses yet at the same time recognise that heavy industry is still prospering and productivity is high? We have to look for something different. That is why the Illawarra Regional Economic Development Organisation two weeks ago released a new economic strategy, a blueprint, a business plan, for the Illawarra. It talked about these sorts of things and the need for R&D and education as fundamental rights of people in Australia. Regrettably, this work for the dole scheme skirts all of that. It is a bandaid solution. It does not meet the needs of this country. It does not meet the need for a meaningful industry policy. It does not do anything for education. It does nothing for R&D. It gives young unemployed people and older unemployed people, of 40 years plus, no security in life. It does not give them any horizon or any vision because, regrettably, this weak Prime Minister, this weak leader, has no vision, has no philosophy, for where we should be going, and that is an absolute disgrace.",46
25,Mr LINDSAY,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION," Mr Deputy Speaker, with you and the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) in the chamber this afternoon, I might just say that I am looking forward to some positive recommendations from the Public Works Committee later this year in relation to the redevelopment of Lavarack Barracks, Townsville. The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill sets out the amendments required to implement the popular work for the dole program. I know it is popular in Townsville because I have asked many of my Townsville constituents how they feel about this initiative. I can report to the House that it is widely accepted and warmly endorsed. The Townsville community supports both the philosophy and the intent behind this initiative. Townsville people strongly support this initiative in which predominantly young people, aged between 18 and 24, who receive unemployment benefits will be asked to work on community assistance and development programs in return for the assistance they receive from the community. Earlier this year I held a public forum in Townsville. More than 130 people attended that meeting. On top of discussing a range of popular issues at the time-the Wik decision, euthanasia, crime, law and order, and so onI specifically raised the issue of work for the dole. The feedback I received was that Townsville people are overwhelmingly in favour of the government implementing a work for the dole scheme. Might I also add that the people who attended and supported the concept believed the government had not gone far enough and that we should be introducing a far more stringent work for the dole program than is being proposed. There was great interest in and popular support for reintroducing some form of national service. Interestingly enough, this particular concept came predominantly from the younger people at the Townsville meeting. I personally have reservations about this. Yes, it might help instil discipline and drive in our young people, but the Australian Defence Force is not a social security safety net. If young people want to do part-time military service, then they should inquire about joining the reserves. My office started to receive initial calls from people about the work for the dole concept immediately after the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced the program. From there the level of interest has grown remarkably. While project submissions will not be sought until early June, the number of individuals and organisations already approaching my office with ideas about community projects indicates there is a high level of interest in the program in Townsville. I can only say that Townsville will put up such quality projects that I expect we will receive two pilot programs instead of one. Only last week an article ran in the Age pointing to a growing support for the work for the dole program within the business sector. That article reads in part: The controversial work for the dole proposal has been given its biggest boost, with an influential survey finding that three in five businesses would be more willing to employ someone with that experience. Even menial labour would instil a work ethic and develop a greater sense of self-worth in the unemployed, according to the Morgan and Banks Job Index survey of 3,200 employers conducted for The Age. A total of 57.6 per cent of employers would be more willing to hire someone who had worked for the dole rather than someone who had spent the same period receiving only unemployment benefits. There is a strong message in that. The article continues: Slightly more than a third-35.7 per cent-felt the scheme would make little difference to the employability of prospective workers, while only 1.8 per cent felt it would not help someone's prospects. Further on in the article it states that polls have put community support for the introduction of a work for the dole scheme in some instances as high as 70 per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker, I would not be surprised if it were even higher than that in some parts of Australia. Indeed, at that last Townsville community forum I held, as a straw poll I asked for a show of hands from those people who supported the idea of work for the dole. About 75 per cent of more than 130 people who attended said they supported the concept of work for the dole. Many different ideas for projects were floated at that meeting, including linking bike paths throughout Townsville and Thuringowa, and house renovation and maintenance work for elderly and impaired citizens-very worthwhile projects indeed. Other people have suggested local environment projects such as erosion control for Townsville's northern beaches and the eradication of noxious weeds like lantana. All these ideas are worthy of development by the community groups who suggested them and of consideration for adoption by the government. I would like to stress here today, as I have in my electorate, that the work for the dole program is not an employment creation program. This has been recognised time and again by both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), in this House and in the media and by all members on this side of the House. The only people whom it seems it has not dawned on are the Labor opposition. The Labor opposition have jumped up and down on this issue. They shrilly claimed initially that it was slave labour in disguise and that they were going to amend the program so that it looked exactly like every other failed labour market program of the past 13 years. Just on that point: there has been a lot of hot air coming out of the belly of the shadow employment spokesman, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), about this. If the former government's labour market programs were so successful, why was the unemployment rate for the northern north-west Queensland statistical region, which takes in my electorate of Herbert, running at 11.9 per cent at the time of the last election in March 1996? The member for Batman has quoted the Australian Bureau of Statistics' figures for this region on one or two occasions since the coalition won office. On two occasions he has criticised the unemployment rate for this region as being unacceptably high and has said that it is a sign of failure of the Howard government in regional North Queensland. However, what the honourable member failed to add was that, even though the unemployment rate for the region was still too highand it is-it was in fact some two to three per cent lower than when Labor lost the last election. Can I further point out to both the honourable member for Batman and you, Mr Deputy Speaker Andrew, that in February 1993 in the ABS statistical region that covers Townsville the unemployment rate was a whopping 14.5 per cent. That was not after 14 months of Labor government; that was after 10 years of Labor at the levers. If members opposite wish to cast stones, perhaps they would be wise to first come out from their glass houses which isolate them from the rest of mainstream Australia. But getting back to the bill: in the end the opposition has realised what we already know-that there is a great deal of community support for the work for the dole program. The honourable member for Goldstein made the following point in the second reading of this bill: The government recognises that the work for the dole initiative is not a solution to youth employment and has not represented it as such. Real jobs can only be created by the government providing a business environment that secures our economic future. This was of course exactly the strategy in Tuesday's budget. Get the nation's finances right and increasing employment follows. That is why the government has taken steps to balance the budget and return it to a surplus. That is why I will be able to proudly say in my report to my electorate on television next Sunday night that for the first time in years the government is not borrowing a penny. It is a great result from Tuesday's budget. That is why we have comprehensively changed Australia's industrial relations system so that now both employers and employees can get a better deal. That is why the coalition has scrapped Labor's job destroying unfair dismissal laws and replaced them with a system that gives employers, particularly those in small business, a fair go while protecting the rights of employees. That is why the coalition has taken steps to address the critically low numbers of apprenticeship and traineeship places in Australia through the modern Australian apprenticeship and traineeship scheme. That is why the coalition government, led by the Hon. Prime Minister, announced in March fringe benefits tax cuts and further capital gains tax cuts to small businesses, along with other initiatives. Work for the dole is about requesting that people who are being supported by the community give something back to the community in return. It is about mutual obligationpure and simple. The Hon. Prime Minister had some words to say in question time during the last parliamentary sitting on why we have decided to introduce the work for the dole scheme. Those words bear repeating, because I strongly support them. I quote the Prime Minister: Wethat is the coalitionthink it is destructive of the human spirit to be of work indefinitely. We think it is destructive of the human spirit to grow up in an environment where your parents and perhaps your grandparents have been unemployed. We think it is desirable for the government of this country to approach . . . policies designed to ensure that people do not sink into a lifetime of unemployment, do not sink into an attitude of indifference towards work. I strongly support this bill.",50
26,Mr KERR,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill has been put forward, as some of those in the government say, not as a response to solve the problem of youth unemployment. They have said that bluntly and frankly and they are correct. The truth is that it is not an answer to youth unemployment; it is simply a political positioning of this government responding to the natural and legitimate concern that they are hearing from all around Australia, particularly in regional and rural Australia, about the crisis that we face in being able to provide jobs for young Australians. They have put something up that will distract attention from the real issues and which has some superficial, glib coverage of support across the community. I am not at all critical of those who support the idea of asking people who have been unemployed for a substantial period to make a contribution. There is a legitimate basis for building a system around the idea of mutual obligation. You would think that this government was the first to discover that idea. But in fact that was the whole idea behind the Working Nation scheme. What we did in government, when we were aware of exactly the same sense of need within the Australian community, was to devise a national scheme that applied to everyone so that no Australian who was out of work for a period of longer than two years would be left without the opportunity and the requirement to undertake work training programs of a substantial nature which would lead them to be better job ready. Those kinds of training programs, work generating programs, were in place and were cut by this government in its first budget. That is a national tragedy, because we were not talking about 10,000 people who were out going to be singled out for a special program, after which they would not have improved their work related skills at all. We were talking about every Australian, whatever their age, who had been out of work for two years. It was not a voluntary scheme. It was not a scheme that relied on the goodwill of those who were unemployed for that period. What occurred under the Labor Working Nation initiatives was that, once a person reached that benchmark to maintain access to benefits, they had to undertake those training programs. There was a direct relationship between the recipient of future ongoing benefits with willingness to improve their work related skills, to undertake training programs and to be involved in initiatives that would improve the community. All Australians who found themselves in that situation were the beneficiaries of that program. When this government came to office, what did it do? The biggest budget reduction across programs was in exactly those training related programs, in exactly those programs which did impose mutual obligation. There is basically nothing that gives hope to a person who is long-term unemployed. A long-term unemployed person can face for years the prospect that they will not be given the resources and the opportunities to get back into the workplace and that their skills base will not be increased. It is certainly that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has introduced some smaller programs of a significantly diminished nature which the government represents as being equivalent to those which they replaced. But you just have to look at the dollar figures to realise what a complete fraud and what a complete hoax that proposition is. They have replaced programs that were extended to all with programs that will extend to few. They have reduced programs which cost a substantial amount from the community with programs that will essentially be funded at a much lesser rate and which do not do the job that is required. To cover the deficiency and to cover the fact that everybody would have correctly identified as a moral failure of government leaving people long-term unemployed without improving their resources and without making them job ready, they came up with the idea that you could get some words that would appeal to and resonate with the Australian public-as if they were doing something. It would be cheap and it would not apply to many Australians. But you could go out and say, 'We've introduced a new program that most Australians will support.' They called it work for the dole. They called it work for the dole because they know from their polling that there are a lot of mums and dads at home who would look at their children who have been out of work for some period of time, look at them sitting dispiritedly in front of the television set or wandering off to the games arcade and the like, trying to fill in their time when they had not had access to any proper jobs training programs, and say, 'Look, my kid needs to be made to do something.' Certainly, they feel that in relation to other kids in the street. It is a pretty normal, expected and predictable human reaction. But, instead of introducing a program that actually applied to all Australians in those circumstances so that skills levels would improve, what we got were the words, the rhetoric and the wind, but without the reality. So we actually have a program which is limited to a handful of those people in this true long-term unemployed situation. We have a program that is designed to give the appearance of addressing a problem without spending the money or doing the work that is necessary to achieve the objective. This is sham politics, it is poll-driven politics, where you wave a symbol in the air and you ask people to respect the symbol but ignore the reality. What we say from the opposition is that good government, moral government, government with actual leadership, does not focus on symbolism but actually focuses on doing the job. This government has singularly failed to do the job. Not only has it singularly failed to do the job with respect to those people who are long-term unemployed, but it is also actually increasing the number of people in that predicament. The number of Australians, in regional and rural Australia in particular, who are now finding themselves out of work, is increasing daily. In my own state of Tasmania the job queues are stretching week by week, and this government's most recent budget is only going to exacerbate that problem. There will be more sackings from the public sector and more closures of resources that the state requires--dosure of offices like the Medicare office in my own electorate. All these initiatives are being carried out without the recognition of their job damaging consequences. You have a government which has initiated a national program of inaction in relation to the long-term unemployed, then developed some plausible words that they know the Australian public want to hear-a symbol to distract attention from the reality. At the same time, they are actually pursuing policies which, day by day, week by week, in all the regions of Australia, are putting more and more Australians on the dole queues, putting more and more Australians out of work. I thought it was a pretty significant irony the other day when the government discussed its new initiatives under the Natural Heritage Trust, a trust which I might say-wearing my hat as shadow minister for the environmentthey have massively underfunded. I think the language the Americans have evolved to describe what this government has done is a 'greenwash'. They are using it in the same way as a whitewash, where you cover what you are doing with words that you know the community is going to be attracted to. You say you are doing a lot but, underneath, you actually do not deliver what you have promised. You do not deliver what you have promised, because, with regard to the Natural Heritage Fund, the government has underfunded what it promised in Meeting our Commitments by $103 million for the first two budget years alone. That is $103 million short just on the trust. Instead of having an opportunity to make major inroads in programs which would of course have had a significant labour content in terms of initiatives to revegetate and reafforest Australia-a whole range of other initiatives-we have had the biggest single environmental backdown in Australia's history. And it is covered up by ministers who come to the table and gloat about what they have done! In that news report, which said, 'Howard is going to take this program and subvert it even further by shifting it away from its original environmental focus and turning it into a regional related job strategy, because they knew the word ""jobs"" was not going to be mentioned in the budget', on the same front page a headline down in the comer read: '2,500 Telstra employees to be sacked.' This government knowingly pursues policies that have led to mass sackings right across this country. It stands aside when major national producers of steel productsfor example, BHP-initiate change which will lead to the closure of steel manufacturing. It stands aside when there are threats to our shipbuilding industry until forced to act under pressure from criticism by this opposition. It sees staring in its face more and more people joining the dole queues, yet it stands aside on a whole range of issues of social responsibility and then massively attacks the public sector and throws more and more people out of work. The government does not have an answer for growing unemployment. It resorts to 'green-wash' initiatives in the environmental field where it seeks to use language that it knows the Australian public will support but underneath it reduces funding, it reduces programs, and it subverts an initiative that the government itself announced as a massively important attack on the issues which Australia faces as a nation and which have to be addressed, such as environmental degradation and the need for the government to improve its record in that area. Then the government talks about what will happen in the work for the dole programshow some of the people who will be picked up under that scheme will do some work on the environment. The government will not fund properly any of these programs, or train people properly, but will use fancy words which it thinks the Australian people will be mugs enough to buy as a substitute for real action. It is not surprising that right across regional Australia, in the bush, and in places like Tasmania and South Australia-where people see daily more and more jobs being lost in industries all around them, factory closures, reductions in the public sector, services being eliminated, Medicare offices being closed, Telstra public officials being removed and resources being stripped away-this government has to look for the cheap, down and dirty solutions. That is what we have got here-a cheap, down and dirty solution not addressing the structural issues that this economy has generated, not doing what is required to extend the program across the whole of the community, but looking to respond to the natural and legitimate concerns of parents about the future of their kids and elderly people about where they are going in the future with a program that is simply designed to be a fig leaf to hide the underlying realities. It is designed to create a straw man, somenately, thing that we can all look to while the action takes place elsewhere. So the governrecent ment waves some symbolic piece of paper in the air and declares victory but at the same time allows the defeat of the aspirations many Australians who are looking for some real opportunity to get back into the worklast place under an industry policy in this country which says to Australians: 'We have a sense of direction. We have some ideas about where this economy will go in the future and where Australian job opportunities will be in future and we are pursuing a set of objectives that makes sense in that context.' So the opposition deals with this bill with an appropriate degree of cynicism, knowing what this government is doing, which is clearly avoiding its national responsibilities. This opposition says to this government that if it really wants some respect from the registered Australian community it will not be fiddling at the edges and saying to the elderly: 'Work five more years in the workplace, work you die, and trade off your pension entitlements for a sum of money which is less than half what you would get in that area'; it will be doing something for young people seeking jobs. It should do something for the 40-yearworking olds who are facing insecurity in the ment market. It should do something for people across Australia and rhetorical flag symbolically in order to disNo tract attention from the crucial should be at the heart of Australia's policy making.",52
27,Mr ANTHONY,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"-I congratulate the government, particuThis larly the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Andy Reeve: Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), for introducing this work for the dole legislation, the Social Security (Work for the Dole) Bill. It works on the principle of mutual obligation, where society has an obligation to provide financial assistance for those who cannot find work but where unemployed people also have an obligation to offer something in return for that financial assistance. Particularly in the electorate that I represent, Richmond, this policy is very relevant. The Richmondffweedl Mid North Coast, unfortuhas one of the highest levels of regionreal al unemployment in Australia. The most ABS figure was 13.3 per cent-the third highest in the state. However, I suppose it is pleasing to note that the unemployment of the rate has been starting to come down since September, at 16.7 per cent, and in October year, 16.9 per cent. The DSS figures also indicate that the unemployment level is levelling out with newstart. In the last month it totalled 51,081, compared with 54,000 in January and 53,000 in March. So the far north the coast will benefit enormously from this initiative, as we have high regional unemployment. The local reaction when this idea was first brought out was excellent-from local councils, chambers of commerce, individuals and labour market providers. I believe that many organisations on the north coast would have an interest in participating in this scheme-voluntary organisations such as Apex or Rotary clubs, health care workers, till Meals on Wheels and local charities. I would like to quote a couple of examples of the initial reactIOn when this scheme first came out. One editor wrote: Critics argue such schemes are simply exploitation of our young, but it is hard to see how anyone could be worse off for the dole than sitting idly at home employfeeling worthless and depressed. not just wave a Another comment: doubt the detractors will be out in force conissues which demning the proposalnational the Labor Partybut if the programs work, our youth will be able to quote is from a local in Murwillumbah, It's a great idea. It will get people out of their rut and give them something to get up for in the morning. Trial it in the Tweed. Something has to be done in the Tweed Valley. There is too much unemployment. And the quotes go on. But what is interesting is that since the initial announcement was made, a recent article by Paul Chamberlain in the Melbourne Age on 7 May notes that the work for the dole proposal has been given the biggest boost, with an influential survey finding that three in five businesses would be more willing to employ someone with that experience. Morgan and Banks job index survey of 3,200 employers noted that 57.6 per cent of employers would be more willing to hire someone who had worked for the dole, rather than someone who had simply been receiving unemployment benefits. The retail sector has been the strongest advocate for this, which is very pleasing because the retail sector is the largest employer in the country, particularly in Tweed Heads and Ballina. The other interesting point is that public opinion now is that over 70 per cent of the public support this idea, which makes you wonder why the ALP has been criticising it. Some of the projects which I would like to see in our area-which have been proposed for Richmond-include the Caldera Track, a proposed 200-kilometre walking track which will pass through four world heritage areas-a magnificent part of Australia. It is something which I would like to see achieved in my lifetime and could rival the Milford Track and the Appalachian Way. In other areas, perhaps we could see community projects such as the construction of cycle tracks in the shire, particularly around the Byron area, and the formalisation of a visitor centre at Stotts Island, which has a pristine native rainforest many hundreds of years old literally metres away from the Pacific Highway, separated by a narrow channel. For the many charity organisations serving the very high aged population that we have, work for the dole could help provide basic care and also provide extra experience within the health industry. Other environmental groups are the local dunecare groups, of which I note there are three now working under a Green Corps project-Pottsville, Hastings Point and Fingal, to name a few. Of course, our biggest employer outside retailing, the tourism industry, would also benefit enormously from having these areas. Looking at the background, when the Prime Minister made his announcement on 9 February it was aimed at 30,000 young people who were unemployed for six months or more. It is interesting to note, when you look back in history, particularly to the Depression years of the 1930s, that state and local governments provided a work for the dole scheme for hundreds of thousands of unemployed men through subsistence benefits. Indeed, many of the bush trails up Mount Warning, the highest mountain in Richmond, were built through one of these early schemes. Similar schemes were proposed by the Hawke Labor government and also came through in the Fightback document of the Liberal and National parties in 1991, but none were implemented. One project which has been implemented, a work for the dole program which has been continually in operation since 1977, has been the community development employment program-better known as CDEP-which enables Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to engage in community projects instead of receiving unemployment benefits. ATSIC pays these grants which are equal to the dole, plus oncosts and capital support. This has worked exceptionally well in these communities, particularly in my area at Cabbage Tree Island where, if it wasn't for the CDEP program, unemployment rates in these communities would be well over 90 per cent. When you look at other countries, even in the last more notable British campaign the Tories and Labour both had what they called a 'workfare' plan-work for welfare. The Tories workfare pilot gave long-term jobless 13 weeks help in finding a job. If the search was unsuccessful, 13 weeks of compulsory work followed. If the unemployed person refused to search for a job or take a compulsory one, their unemployment benefits would cease. The result of the pilot studies was that many people stopped claiming benefits once presented with these alternatives. Tony Blair has a workfare concept as well, under which he plans to offer around 200,000 people under the age of 25 and jobless a sixmonth scheme offering a number of options, which is very similar to our work for the dole scheme. If you look at the United States, their welfare-to-work program as part of their job opportunities and basic skills program has worked very well in a number of states. In Iowa, a family investment program requires most adult welfare recipients to work either full or part time to search for a job, to train or to study. There is a similar program in Utah. I think it is important to look at the coalition's wider perspectives in creating employment. One of them is the jobs pathway program, which will act in tandem with the work for the dole and acts as a bridge for students at their most vulnerable time-when they leave school. By providing a direct link from school straight into work, this government wants to stop unemployment before it begins. The new apprenticeship scheme is another example of a government which is recognising and responding to the needs of the labour market. Under the previous government, apprenticeship levels fell to the lowest level in 30 years. Taking on apprentices was overly bureaucratic and dominated by the Trades and Labour Council, which did not encourage apprenticeships in growth industries, resulting in a lack of skilled workers some of the most rapidly emerging industries. Under this government, there will be substantial benefits given to take on traineeships. Over $265 million is included in this budget for over 100,000 new apprenticeships. Isn't it better to give people something longer than just a labour market program, where, after a number of years, they walk away with a trade and a skill? This is certainly encouraged by the 7,000 small business operators in the areas I represent-Tweed, Ballina, Murwillumbah and Byron Bay. The national apprenticeship scheme will provide a means to employ them, to put on a trainee. The other area of expenditure in this budget geared towards providing skills for our young people to get better employment is $1.3 billion going to vocational training-the amount of money going into TAFE-and, most importantly, the amount of money going back into education for the improvement of literacy skills, to give young people the basic life skills so that they can go out into the labour market, be attractive and be taken up. This was not recognised by the previous government. Another area is the small business package. This should not be underestimated. Over the last 12 months, the removal of the unfair dismissal law, the changes in the capital gains tax and the cutting back on red tape have provided an impetus for small businesses to take on someone. Mr Martin-It hasn't happened.",55
28,Mr ANTHONY,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"The feeling I get around my area, which the member should listen to, is that when capital gains tax legislation is introduced it will allow those businesses to upgrade. Indeed, with the new unfair dismissal laws, many of them now are feeling a lot more comfortable about taking on extra staff. Seeing that we have had some comments from the ALP, I would like to look back at the ALP's track record on their labour market programs. When Working Nation was introduced-and perhaps it was introduced with the best intent-in the six years from July 1990 to March 1996 Labor's policies added only 7, I 00 additional full-time jobs. One in particular DEETY A report on labour market programs found that programs like the new work opportunities program effectively resulted in four per cent of participants gaining work, at a cost of $143,000 for each additional job. That record is disgraceful, and I am curious that these sorts of figures were not published by the department. Surely DEETY A were doing this kind of research when the ALP were in power. Did previous ALP DEETYA ministers, including Kim Beazley, simply ignore the research of their own department? The former left-wing member for Richmond, Neville Newell, is on record in the Hansard of 31 May 1995-one of the few occasions when he spoke-as saying: The effort that has been made to create jobs through the new work opportunities has been commendable ... I could think of 143,000 reasons why he and the ALP were so out of touch with commercial reality--one being wasting taxpayers' money. There is one simple reason why the ALP continued to pour millions of dollars into many of their ineffective labour market programs. Not all the programs were, I acknowledge that, but a lot of them were to buy votes. It is unfortunate that many unemployed people were given access to these training schemes without the prospect of real jobs at the end. I do hope that the Labor Party will not in the winter recess attempt to ambush this legislation in the Senate, in which case it may not get up or could be delayed beyond September when the first pilot program is meant to begin. The work for the dole budget in 1997 is an allocation of $21.6 million. There is $15.5 million for up to 70 community based pilot projects for 10,000 participants throughout Australia for 12 months. The remaining $6.1 million will cover administration, monitoring and assessment of the initiative. The $15.5 million includes $12.4 million to community organisations to run the projects, around $520,000 for child-care costs for participants and over $2.5 million for that extra $10 a week for travelling expenses to allow those unemployed people to actually get to their project. It is a good scheme. The last point I would like to touch on is youth suicide, which should be bipartisan and go beyond the politics that happen in this chamber and the other chamber. Unemployment is seen as one of the major factors contributing to the shameful level of youth suicide. In 1993 our youth suicide rate per 100,000 was 23.7 for males and 3.7 for females. This level is amongst the world's worse and is simply unacceptable. By giving young people something worthwhile to do with their time-it is not seen as a panaceathe work for the dole scheme may just break that unemployment cycle. Unemployment goes hand in hand with loss of self-esteem and of motivation and often leads to high levels of depression and family break-ups. I note with interest the comments made in my local media by a psychology lecturer at Southern Cross University when this policy was announced in February. The lecturer stated that the work for the dole scheme could reduce youth suicide on the far north coast. The media often reports our high levels of youth suicide but seldom accompanies the statistics with constructive solutions to the problem. If the work for the dole scheme can reduce the risk of youth suicide just by one, it is definitely worthy of this parliament's wholehearted support. In conclusion, the work for the dole scheme is a positive initiative. It goes hand in glove with the other government programs for addressing unemployment. Traineeships get a massive boost. This gets away from the sixmonth programs which dominated the previous government's approach. Policies to assist small business-theirs is still a waiting game-will make them feel more confident so that they can put on more staff, not fearful of draconian industrial legislation and able to have the benefit of making some profit. Other areas addressed include vocational training, education, better life skills and, of course, overall having better fiscal management of the country to allow the private sector to flourish so that it can start to tackle that enormous social problem-it is not just an economic problem--of unemployment. I commend the bill to the House.",57
29,Mr JENKINS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"In preparing for this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997 last session, I proposed to open my remarks by asking this question: what happened to the quest for real jobs? What happened to the quest for real, meaningful, sustainable jobs? Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you would allow me to put this in the context of the opening week of this session, where on Tuesday night we saw the bringing down of the government's budget. Even more, that question should be emphasised: what has happened to the quest for real jobs? An analysis of the forecasts within the budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) on Tuesday night shows that at the end of the next financial year the government expects unemployment to be at a level of eight per cent. If we look at their forecasts for the present financial year, one has to doubt their ability to correctly forecast the figure at the end of next financial year, because at the time of the budget last August the prediction was that unemployment would track down to a level of 8.25 per cent. This was subsequently amended by the Treasurer to a level of 8.5 per cent. What is the level of unemployment in Australia at the moment? It is 8.7 per cent. So can we realistically depend on the types of forecasts that are contained in the budget? In a more real sense, if we look at the context of this piece of legislation, in the explanatory memorandum it correctly says that this legislation grew out of an announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in February this year. The announcement was made on a television show at a time when the government was receiving great criticism about the behaviour of senior members of the government. It was seen, I think quite correctly, as a decision that was put forward as a distraction to the real issues that obtained at that time and, in a way, continue to obtain now. This is typical of the 'developing' nature of the policies being made by this government: it is an illustration of a decision being made on the run. Somebody's good idea was plucked from thin air, announced outside of this place and then the Prime Minister asked his ministers to rush off and try to figure out how these things could be put into place. It was an idea that was not thought through and an idea without much substance. Regrettably, this is not the only example that we have of this type of policy decision making on the run. A number of the decisions made in the areas of employment and labour market programs are of the same ilk. During the non-sitting period between these two sessions we had the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) deciding that it might be a good idea to reward schools for placing people into jobs. These claims were made on the basis of some of the work done under the pathways program at a school somewhere in Queensland that they think is a great idea. But it does not seem to underscore and acknowledge the work that schools, through careers teachers, already do. It does not acknowledge that the schools did that with the cooperation of the Commonwealth Employment Service. It does not acknowledge that the real need to even be suggesting such a scheme is because the CES is to be abolished. Again, it was something that was plucked out of the air-a decision apparently made on the run. Regrettably, these ideas are strewn like confetti across the political landscape, where there appears to be little thought. Yesterday-and I acknowledge this is an unrelated matter-we had the Prime Minister developing a position on the run about the optional nature, perhaps, of the taxation rebate on savings. I offer that as an illustration of the way in which either in real terms-and that is the position I am putting-but, at the most charitable, in the perception stakes, this government appears to be continuing to make policies on the run. Perhaps these are somebody's ideas that occur to them in the morning when they get up, before they sit down to brekkie. Whatever the case, the policies are not based on thinking both the issues and the outcomes through. In this case, we have a piece of legislation which, right from the title of the bill, sets the scene and the flavour for the legislation. We have a government that, in opposition, continually denigrated the programs that we had under Working Nation, such as LEAP, because they would supposedly not provide real jobs. We were told that it was unfair on the unemployed to have them participating in these schemes because, under some definition, the then opposition and now government felt they were not meaningful. What happens? The government is elected and Working Nation is smashed, not for any real reason bar the underlying ideological preferences of the government. Now they sit there and chant the mantra, 'Let the marketplace create jobs. Let the unemployed look after themselves.' Indeed, this seems to exemplify the overall thinking of the government. Take a look at this week's budget. There is not too much, just a few smokescreens that try to attract a few headlines because of superficial criticism. Now, a couple of days later when there is detailed analysis of these policies, everything is falling apart. At least we are seeing some fair kum criticism of this year's budget, unlike way the media, in a flim-flam way, looked last year's budget. Most clearly, from the budget and from the speech of the Treasurer, one year down the track the government has admitted that it has failed to create jobs. It has failed to the single most important issue that confronts Australia-unemployment. We know that they recognise that they have failed because one the best things they have to offer-well, they claim it is a good thing-is this piece of legislation. Even before their much heralded employment service market has been put to tender, they know they have failed and they have had to come up with something else to be seen to be doing something for the unemployed. What they have done with this piece of legislation tells us a lot about them and the mealy-mouthed ideas that fill their heads. Instead of reintroducing labour market programs to provide the unemployed with training and support while they get work experience, now the unemployed are to be dragooned into a scheme that simply requires them to work. This is clothed in the language of reciprocal obligation; but, of course, this is a deliberate con. No-one in the opposition is against the idea of reciprocal obligation; Working Nation was based on the idea of reciprocal obligation. But, while borrowing the language of reciprocal obligation in Working Nation, this scheme is based on a far more pernicious concept-punishment. Whilst I acknowledge the comments of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) in concluding his speech, when he workers. talked about youth suicide and the fact that employment brings young people a degree much needed self-esteem, the negative nature of this program is not the type of signal that should be sent out to young people. It is a matter of saying to the unemployed, 'If train you, give you work experience and you in identifying a vacancy then you have reciprocal obligation to take that vacancy.' That was the core of Working Nation-the notion that each party to the job compact had obligations. This program is about saying to dinunemployed youth, 'You owe us. To receive the your income support from the social security at system you must earn it. Our only obligation as a nation is to pay you. We don't owe you a real job . We don't owe you training and job search assistance and other support which has been part of our social security net for many address years. You, the unemployed, owe us.' This is a fundamental shift in social policy in this country. It is a change from the notion of that income support is owed by society to individuals as compensation for the failure of the labour market to the notion that individuals owe a debt to society for income received out during the time that they are unemployed. I acknowledge that this might have some short-term appeal to the pollsters; it might have appeal to the Ray Martin set. But this decision will come back to haunt this government. It is appalling that a term that carries with it such negative and derogatory connotations as 'dole' should actually be included in the title of the legislation. What signal does it really send out to the people that are on unemployment benefits? More than anything else, this reveals the agenda for the government: we cannot fix unemployment so we will blame the victims, stigmatise the unemployed. The one small positive thing to emerge from this shabby debate is that it puts into perspective how pitiful the level of income support is if it can be worked out in only 15 hours. The opposition has an II-point plan which details the minimum criteria for acceptable labour market programs. The first and most important of these points is that no scheme should displace the jobs of existing Sadly, many unscrupulous employers may of seek to take advantage of the government's proposal unless adequate safeguards are in place. In fact, the day after the Prime Minister not made his work for the dole announcementwe done without the knowledge of appropriate assist ministers-anecdotal evidence from my a electorate suggested that some employers were already intending rorts. My office told me of an example of a factory owner who said, 'I'm not putting anybody on. I'm going to sack 10 and put on 16 from the work for the dole scheme.' Hopefully, measures that will be taken in administering this scheme will prevent employers from doing this. But, again, this is a notion of the signals this idea puts into people's minds. The government must ensure that employers do not act to dismiss people on the false premise that they can get a couple of young unemployed kids to do their jobs. Yet, there is nothing in the second reading speech of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training to indicate that this type of rort will be prevented. Other points in the opposition's criteria include the provision of training in any of these schemes. This legislation provides no obligation on the part of any prospective employer to provide those in his or her charge with onor off-the-job training. The government attacked Working Nation labour market programs on the basis that they did not lead to real jobs but simply churned unemployed people from training scheme to training scheme. But what does the work for the dole scheme do? It does not even ensure that participants learn anything during their time on the program. Whilst it heralds that they will learn a form of work ethic in that they will have to turn up, some of these people, especially as they will be people unemployed for over six months, need a lot of support in the run-up to them being able to develop that work ethic. This scheme is simply about filling in the unemployed person's time on the grounds that they owe the government for their unemployment benefits and should be punished accordingly. It does not ensure that there will be jobs available at the end of the scheme for those who have participated in it. Therefore, the opposition has called upon the government that in this work for the dole program the government force participating organisations to state up-front the proportion of participants who will receive permanent employment after the placement. Any further contracts with the government to provide services under the scheme should only be based on the participating organisation's performance against this figure. Another worrying feature of the proposed scheme is that the relationship between the unemployed participant and the participating organisations is not clearly defined. What arrangements are in place with regard to safety standards, superannuation or industrial relations? If this is to be fair dinkum work experience, those matters have to be addressed. Yet, the participants are to be exempted from all of these requirements of this type of legislation. Perhaps the most damaging comment about the work for the dole scheme comes from the minister's own second reading speech, in which he said: The government recognises that the work for the dole initiative is not a solution to youth unemployment and has not represented it as such. What a damning indictment of this whole sorry episode. The minister admits that this will do absolutely nothing to alleviate youth unemployment and that this was never the intention of the scheme. By his own words, the minister confirms the suspicion that this scheme is all about punishing the unemployed for being unemployed. It is not about jobs for the unemployed. I wish to raise on that point one of the farragoes that surrounds the Green Corps program. During the election campaign, this was offered as something that was to be aimed at providing labour market programs for unemployed youth. But that has now been denied and we are told that Green Corps is an environmental program. In conclusion, I suggest that members of the House look at the budget related paper to do with the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs where, under student youth support, it says that the Green Corps programs involve young people in protecting and restoring Australia's natural heritage. But it is under the heading of a support scheme as a labour market program. The opposition has great concerns about this piece of legislation, which we have outlined in this second reading debate. I hope that the government will carefully reconsider this policy and come up with things that are more concrete to enable people who are unemployed at present to re-enter the labour force as quickly as possible.",58
30,Mr ANDREW,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"Wakefield) (1.07 p.m.)Before participating directly in this debate on the proposed work for the dole scheme, I would like to pick up a point or two made by the member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins). As all members in this chamber know, I have a high regard for the member for Scullin, as I believe most members do. But he drew a very long bow in his introductory remarks when he suggested that we should question the whole work for the dole proposal on the basis of the statistics run in Tuesday night's budget. The member for Scullin was critical of all statisticians on the grounds that a difference between an 8.7 per cent and 8.5 per cent projected unemployment rate somehow indicated a remarkably loose use of figures. What the chamber should be considering is this underlying truth about unemployment: the figure of 8.7 per cent is better than once it was and if the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is right and the government achieves an eight per cent figure-not all that remarkable-it will be the best figure, albeit, I freely concede to the member for Scullin, not good enough, since 1990. That is the best figure after six years of the previous government's various job creation schemes. So, far from being critical of the work for the dole proposal, the opposition ought to see this proposal for just what it is. Opposition speakers have suggested that this was the only suggestion that this government was offering to the unemployed, that this was the only technique that we had to help people back into the work force. Instead of that, it is one of a segment of ideas that we are putting to the unemployed. The real solution to unemployment, as parliamentary members-not government or opposition--know, is the creation of what the member for Scullin has called 'real jobs', a term somewhat derisively observed by the member for Denison (Mr Kerr), as the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) was here to attest. But I pick up the member for Scullin's term. I know what he means by 'real jobs' and I know what I mean by 'real jobs'. I know that real jobs are created when the marketplace believes there is an opportunity to employ people and to employ them productively. So the obligation the parliament has is to cultivate a marketplace that will put on people in order to be more productive. Frankly, the task of the government is to build a marketplace in which employers want to engage employees. I do not doubt that the previous government had a similar objective, but their task at national economic renewal failed abysmally, so unemployment remained for them and for the parliament something of an embarrassment. We are serious about national economic renewal. The member for Denison had much to say, much of it critical, about all of the government's proposals. He said, 'Look at all of the cuts that the Howard government has made.' It is as if we had a choice about it, as if cuts were something we loved doing, as if we were desperate to see any area of government expenditure and pluck it out. The reality, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you well know, is that all of the cuts that the Howard government has been forced to make it has been forced to make because of the budget deficit. The Treasurer has every right to be proud of the fact that in one term he will have taken a budget deficit of $10 billion-I am the first to concede, should the member for Scullin want some reassurance, that it is not the first time that there has been a budget deficit-and tum it into a budget surplus. That is good news for the unemployed, but it is not the impression you get from opposition members participating in this debate. All of the cuts that have occurred have occurred in order to generate a budget surplus, because the alternative to that was to jack up income tax, payroIl tax, company tax, excise and other rates, which would, of course, be further damaging to economic recovery. Let it be clearly understood. In the work for the dole program the government does not say to those who are unemployed, 'You owe us, so you should be working.' There is a sense of reciprocation that the member for Scullin has referred to, but in reality the government says to the unemployed, 'If you're a young person, unemployed for an extended period of time, you're in danger of getting into an unemployed mentality, and we want you to experience what work is about.' The work for the dole program is all about giving unemployed young people an opportunity to discover what work is all about. Work is not something we seek to avoid. There was once-and I know very little about it-a philosophy around called the Protestant work ethic. There was this understanding that because people had not been asked to be born and discovered themselves here with various talents, they wanted an opportunity to use those talents as part of a community. That is roughly my understanding of the Protestant work ethic. Mr Abbott-Join the Catholics, mate, and you won't have to suffer.",62
31,Mr ANDREW,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"I hasten to reassure the parliamentary secretary at the table that I am sure this is not a uniquely Protestant philosophy at all; it is understood by a number of people, including him. My point about the Protestant work ethic is as follows. People discovered that it was not a matter of being paid or how much you were earning; it was a chance to feel that you had a role in the community that was important if life was to be fulfilling. The work for the dole scheme allows unemployed young people to discover that they have a role in the community and that they have talents and attributes that the community can use. You do not need a work for the dole scheme to do that, you would think, except that, sadly, if it was automatic, we would have every volunteer organisation in Australia swamped by unemployed people right now. The reality is that those unemployed people in my electorate who have been unemployed for some period of time are not rushing into volunteer organisations. They are not rushing into discover what it is to be a participant in the community. This scheme gives people an opportunity to discover what work is about-to discover what it is to be part of the community and accepted in the community because you are making a contribution. It is not a matter of the government saying, 'You owe us.' It is a matter of the government saying, 'We would do you a gross disservice if we did not give you the opportunity to discover just what work is about and how work makes life more fulfilling. There is a mutual obligation and there is an opportunity through this scheme to put something back, but there is more than that. There is the chance for individuals to discover what they are about and what sort of status they may discover. The member for Cunningham, in his remarks on this debate, made the point that the government had been gUilty of research and development cuts, much the same point as has been made by the member for Scullin and other speakers who have been critical of the budget. 1 put this point to the member for Cunningham: as I said in my opening remarks",63
32,Mr ANDREW,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"I will gladly respond to the member for Chifley as well. The cuts that the government has made have been made out of an obligation to balance the budget. I regret that there is not more money available for R&D, a sentiment I share with the member for Cunningham. But the government has felt an obligation to balance the budget. This particular scheme is a scheme that, with minimal outlays, allows the government to let unemployed young people discover what work is about and how they can be participants in the community as it is. We are told that over one-third of employers say that participation in the scheme will make little difference to the employability of the individuals, but two-thirds of the employers say that it will make a difference and that they would be keen to employ young people who have been participants in this scheme. As a result of being in the scheme, they see young people as being more employable. I noticed that in relation to this the member for Scullin made the point that the ALP felt that there should be an 11 point plan in place before they can endorse the work for the dole scheme. One of those 11 points was an obligation on these employers to state how many permanent people they would put on as a result of this scheme. No-one who has been an employer could possibly conceive such an absurd plan. ",63
33,Mr ANDREW,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"I will pick up the member for Chifley's interjection about cheap labour in just a moment. Do you imagine that any employer is actually prepared to go into a scheme in January saying, 'In July I will put on this many people'? It depends on the market, it depends on the sales and it depends on how the scheme is running. Clearly, that is not a reasonable obligation to put on any employer. The member for Chifley has interjected, saying that this was some form of cheap labour. ",64
34,Mr ANDREW,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"Thank you; he has made it even more colourful. In order to help the member for Chifley, the member for Scullin made the point that he believed that one of his employers would be prepared to sack 10 people if he could put on 16 under the work for the dole arrangement. Of course, that is nonsense. There is no proposal under this scheme that allows employers to suck people out of the unemployed reservoir and put them into permanent jobs. Once they are in permanent jobs, they have the same obligations as all other full-time employees. This scheme gives young unemployed people the opportunity to discover what the discipline and the rewards of the workplace are all about. The suggestion that it will in some way take unemployed people and have them replace those already in work is a matter that has already been addressed by the minister when he introduced this very scheme. Previous speakers have also made much of what they have seen as the work for the dole scheme: simply getting people involved in menial tasks. As most people in the parliament know after 14 years, befOie coming into this place I employed people in menial tasks, principally fruit picking. If there is one thing that I really resent participating in debate in this chamber it is the emphasis on so-called menial tasks, as if to be the cleaner in the House of Representatives was some task that ought to be dismissed relative to being a member. The facts are that we need Australians who discover how menial tasks, so called-as I said, I am dismissive of the tcrm--can be rewarding and how there is an opportunity to feel that the skills and the talents you have are being used as part of the community, whether your role is as an MP or a cleaner. One should not be dismissed for merely carrying out a menial task. I do not see the work for the dole scheme as being something that engages people in so-called menial tasks; I see the work for the dole scheme as being something that allows people to discover what work is about and how there can be a real sense of reward in participating in the community and allowing your talents to be used to the advantage of the community in total. This is not a scheme about which the government should make any apology. It is a scheme that has clearly been well received by the electorate at large. It is a scheme that allows unemployed young people to participate in the community. That is why it is in place. To pick up the concluding remarks of the member for Richmond (Mr Anthony), it is a scheme that allows young people to feel a greater sense of self-esteem because they have a role in the community, and the tragedy of youth suicide is best addressed by allowing young people to feel that they have a role and that they are needed and wanted by the community at large. Far from being dismissive of the scheme, we ought to be giving it a shot, because nothing else has worked thus far.  pleased to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997. I will pick up a couple of the points made by my colleague opposite, the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). He said that working for the dole is popular. I, for one, would not contest that, but the better question to ask the people of Australia is: do you think that every Australian who wants to should be able to have meaningful work? I think we would get an overwhelmingly strong and positive answer to that. Neither the previous government nor the current government-perhaps much less, the current government-has been able to fulfil that overwhelming desire for work for all Australians, particularly those who are unemployed. The issue of youth suicide has been raised in this debate on several instances. We should not avoid it, but the issues underlying our extraordinarily and unacceptably high youth suicide rate are multifaceted. I do not believe that, regrettably, there is a single-shot solution. Without doubt, there are two main reasons for youth suicide. The despair of the individual is one of the leading causes. Ironically, relationship problems is the other main causal factor. However, our unacceptably high unemployment rate is no doubt also a significant contributor. It was interesting that at the last election the Labor government-and you would expect that of the Australian Labor Party-was concerned to get unemployment down. We did something that was perhaps foolish for a government to do. We said that, by the year 2000, we believed we could get unemployment down to five per cent. I say it was foolish because, whenever governments set a target, if they meet the target, people say that it was probably too easy; if they exceed it, they say it was certainly too easy; and if they fail, then they say it is just another failure of government. However, in government, like any other form of organisational activity, we need to set targets. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that he wanted Australians to feel relaxed and comfortable. I suppose that applied to the unemployed, including the long-term unemployed. I do not think they are feeling too relaxed and comfortable at the moment, especially as the long-term unemployment figures trend up. The government has said to institutions like the Reserve Bank, 'Do away with your priority about unemployment. Our primary concern as a government is inflation. We don't want you to have a matching or equally high concern about unemployment' or 'Unemployment is an acceptable feature of our modem existence. Ignore that, but crunch down on inflation.' If I did a poll of the people of Australia at large and asked, 'Would you be prepared to have a slightly higher inflationary figure in the economy if we could really crunch down on unemployment and get it significantly lower?' I think that, overwhelmingly, they would say, 'Yes, we are really concerned about unemployment. Our current high level of unemployment is not an attractive feature of Australia.' I am trying to say that the coalition came to office and, in government, has demonstrated a lack of commitment-if not in the medium to long term, certainly in the short term-to doing anything about unemployment. We now have the work for the dole scheme. Mr Deputy Speaker, I need to remind you and the government that one of the first actions of the Howard government was actually to cut out funding for 117,000 training positions for the unemployed. In a sense, we are replacing them with the 10,000 posi tions to pilot work for the dole. I would not say to you that every proposition or scheme that we developed in trying to get people job ready was an outstanding success, but overall they were successful. There is no disputing the evidence that the more you put into training, the better chance you will have of individuals getting a job. The modem dilemma that we have in Australia-and in fact in other economies-is that, if you do not do anything, particularly with the long-term unemployed, you will have an overhang of long-term unemployed. As your economy picks up, you will pick up the new schoolleavers and those re-entering the work force but you will also have an overhang of long-term unemployed. I notice that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) is at the table. I would be surprised if he were comforted by the fact that the numbers of long-term unemployed are increasing. That is a blight on our society. I want to get back to the topic of work for the dole. If we meet someone in the corridor or out in our electorates or what have you, apart from the first pleasantries, we will usually ask, 'What do you do?' We credential ourselves by our activity. I can say that I am a member of parliament or that, in my previous occupations, I worked for Telecom, was a labourer with the water board, was a fencer and worked on a poultry farm. I can say--or could have said in the past-all of these things to credential myself. But what do unemployed people do? What activity do they own up to? They say, 'I am unemployed.' It is like putting a black mark on yourself straight away. It really does not come as a surprise to me that, amongst the unemployed, some are quite enthusiastic about working for the dole. It actually credentials them with an activity. It puts them at least almost on a par with other people in the community. I do not think any of us in this chamber have been through the frustration of seeing jobs advertised, applying for them when they are filled, having the application be one of 100 or one of several hundred and not even getting an acknowledgment that the application was received, let alone being short-listed. We in this illustrious chamber, the House of Representatives of the Australian parliament, have not been through that frustration. Even though I believe the scheme has flaws, 1 can understand that some young unemployed people would say, 'Get me out of this; at least I can do some activity that will credential me along with other Australians in the community.' But what is it really doing? As I started off by saying, what we want for all of our fellow Australians, whether they be young or middle aged, is that they have work-a meaningful job. As a government, as a community and as a society, we are not delivering that. How do 10,000 of these jobs stack up against the 117,000 positions that the Howard government has already cut out of the training programs that we had in place? Unfortunately, the scheme does not necessarily mean that anyone of those 10,000 is actually going to be more job ready. Yes, there is the discipline of getting up and, yes, there is the motivation associated with the work-there are those pluses--but, unlike a training program, it is not going to get any of them more job ready. If any government members have any knowledge of some of the more difficult, long-term unemployed cases, then they know that this sort of work for the dole falls well short at' the mark. I think it is preposterous say, 'We have cut out 117,000 places, we'll replace them with 10,000 places, and somehow we are affecting the suicide rate of young Australians.' As a Labor politician, I have always believed fervently that a primary responsibility of a government is to set the preconditions for full employment, knowing that that is a tough objective and knowing that it is not ea:y to achieve. I have always passionately believed that. However, even the most optimistic forecast by the Governor of the Reserve Bank suggests that we are going to have six per cent unemployed by the turn of the century, and in my electorate that would be much higher. I notice that we have incorporated the 11 points that we believe make this scheme much more acceptable. On the Labor Party side, yes, we should not lose our passion and commitment to training, to getting people job ready, but we also need to face up to the reality that too many of our fellow Australians are not going to get a job. How are we going to ensure that they have self-esteem, that they have dignity, and that they have self-worth? I believe we are well short of developing a policy towards that. I really was stung the other day by a comment from the St Vincent de Paul Societyand, by inference, Cardinal Clancy, who endorsed the work of the society-that Mount Druitt was a sinkhole of welfare. As the elected representative of the poor of my electorate, I was incensed that such a comment should be made. It really did make me think about how welfare dependent we are making some people and how we are removing self-esteem, self-worth, and not replacing the sense of despair and sense of hopelessness. Because debate is being curtailed on this legislation, let me say quickly that I would always applaud things the government does towards helping the unemployed. I understand why work for the dole is a popular notion in our society, but I need to reiterate my belief that it is a poor substitute for decent and meaningful work for all of our fellow Australians. Work for the dole is not going to do much for those 10,000 who are on the pilot to program, and 10,000 positions is a miserable dividend when you have cut away 117,000 positions. Last but not least, let me say that we in the Labor Party, without abandoning our beliefs in investment, in industry policy, in encouraging job growth and in having the reduction of unemployment as a very high priority in society, need to come to grips with whatever the percentage is who will remain unemployed, whether it is three per cent, four per cent or five per cent. Whatever the percentage is, these people should not be considered to be second-class Australians. These people are entitled, as I am, and as you are, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the notion of self-esteem, selfworth, dignity and being meaningfully involved in our society. The Labor Party in that regard still has a long way to go to deal with that issue.",64
35,Mr MCDOUGALL,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"Griffith) (1.34 p.m.)I wish to participate in this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill. However, before I do so I must say that it was interesting to hear  were well on the way to developing a policy to help the unemployed. They had 13 years to do it! I heard this morning the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who is currently leaving the chamber, say that this work for the dole scheme is nothing but a bandaid solution. That means, to me, that all the programs of the previous government, over their years on the government benches, could not come to grips with the problem. Maybe one could say that the bandaid solutions were simply theirs. What we are seeing here today, and what we are debating in this legislation for work for the dole, is not a bandaid solution. It is a real solution. I am surprised that the opposition derides the work for the dole scheme. The feedback I have had from my electorate indicates that it certainly has the community's support. I have already had submissions from local community groups and associations offering work and training for the work for the dole scheme and for the participants that we propose to put into the scheme. I believe one of the most devastating of unemployment is the loss of the work ethic. We are now seeing a phenomenon of young adults who left school, went straight on the dole and have never worked. They have no work ethic to even relate to. This, I believe, is the direct legacy of Labor's social program which created a welfare culture and a generation of Australians who have been socially manipulated to their detriment. We know that not only do long periods of unemployment lead to a loss of motivation and a desire to seek work but vital training time is also lost. A cry I hear often from young adults is that employers offer jobs for which they do not have the skills. There is no doubt that the unskilled labour market is shrinking. But this does not mean that the job market is shrinking; it means that it is changing form. We cannot hope to compete with the cheap labour force available in other parts of the world, but we can compete in other growing markets, such as technology, science and the service industries. Today, for the first time, companies are including in their assets the skills of their individual employees. They are no longer looking at staff as a necessary adjunct of business but as the vital core of their business. Young people playa vital role in our work force, but I believe we must redirect their focus. For example, let us consider the ordinary, everyday work skill of typing. Once, only young women learned to type and typing skills led them into the work force as receptionists, clerks and secretaries. Typing was a vital skill for women. I can remember when a young man was considered a bit sissy if he took up typing. Today, touch-typing skills are just as necessary for men and women, and computer technology means efficient typing skills are necessary at both junior and senior levels. Just as learning to touch-type is not a difficult task, neither is learning a computer program. No longer does the ability to type place a worker straight into the old typing pool or at the reception desk but into all aspects of business and trade. I believe it is vital that we get young people out of the results mind-set that women type and men drive trucks. Their skills and potential skills might not be evident, not even to themselves. Therefore, programs such as work for the dole are a way to enforce this awareness. Our young people have been deceived for more than a decade by a Labor government that created training programs which did not lead to jobs. Instead, most led straight back to the dole queue. Young people believe the previous government was concerned, but the figures show only a facade, even worse-a farce. We are creating systems which prove there are jobs for young people. The school to work program has already shown that it can be done. Working on the principle that schools are well placed to build a bridge for students from the classroom to the work force, a pilot program was established in my city of Brisbane. The first results have been more than impressive. Both Marsden and Acacia Ridge state high schools bid for the government contract to find jobs for their school leavers. Since January, Marsden has found work for 147 teenagers and Acacia Ridge, which came into the program a little later, has already placed 30 students in jobs. So much for Peter Baldwin's statement to the House in March that work for the dole was a 'pathetic mickey mouse scheme'. We have already shown it is possible to break the start of that deadly pattern of classroom to the dole queue. We are doing what the opposition said was not possible under our programs: we are already putting young people in jobs. Our jobs pathway strategy does not start and end with work for the dole or the school to work program. While both break the system of leave school, go on the dole, do a training course, go back on the dole, they are just the beginning. The CES, the government agency around which so many young lives revolve, is to be restructured. The CES will no longer be a pure bureaucratic government agency but one that has to compete with the private sector in the job finding business. But what of the hundreds of thousands of young adults who have been revolving around the unemployment circuit since they left school; those who were told by the previous government they were not on the dole, but instead were receiving benefits? The word 'benefit' is described in Webster's Dictionary as 'material aid provided or due as a right', whereas the word 'dole' is described in the Webster's Dictionary as 'a government payment to the unemployed and also the distribution of money to the needy'. There is a big difference in attitude created by these phrases. Not many people like to feel they are given money because they are needy. Certainly not when they are young, healthy and able to work, given the incentive and the right pathway. A decade ago I would have considered it unusual to be talking with young adults of 26 years of age who have never had a long-term full-time job, let alone a couple with a newborn baby. This couple, whom I know well, both live on government welfare, and neither have ever seriously considered seeking anything other than part-time work. Now in their mid-20s, it is doubtful they realise just how many years of vital training they have lost. We know, with the benefit of hindsight, it is unlikely they will be taken seriously by an employer looking for senior staff. These young adults are not lazy, nor do they enjoy living on the dole. But their lifestyle has developed to include a great deal of leisure time and the pursuit of hobbies which they find emotionally and physically fulfilling and rewarding. It is not surprising at their age when they apply for jobs that the salary, commensurate with their skills or their limited range of skills, is geared for a jobstarter not a mature age adult. It is like trying to teach an adult to read using kindergarten primers. Boredom tends to set in quickly and job changing has become the career path of the young. Therefore, I believe any scheme or program which gives the unemployed the chance to gain from constructive effort is of great value. The work for the dole scheme is one such scheme. With wise placement, young people will find themselves working in fields they may never have considered a potential career path-the environment, for example. This is an area which has been erroneously considered the domain of the greenies. The environment, which has many facets, is an industry where many specialists work alongside community groups. These are the types of projects I believe are perfect for work for the dole participants: working alongside specialists and gaining knowledge which is of value to society and therefore to an employer. The work the for dole program has been carefully considered. The ultimate aim is employment for young people. The previous government said a great deal and congratulated itself on programs while more and more young people fell by the wayside. This government recognises the need to change the way we as a society must act to help those who have difficulty in finding work. Work for the dole is a positive part of our jobs pathway. Work for the dole is just one step and leads ultimately to an improved apprenticeship or job training system. As it is an active work program, any participant who has a child or children will be able to place that child in government funded care. I support this bill because I know it is imperative we remind our young people that they are of value. We need to remind them that they are a vital part of our community, help them become an integral part of a team and, ultimately, assist them acquire skills which they can utilise in the workplace. Voltaire summed up the situation in one sentence: 'Work keeps at bay three great evils, boredom, vice and need.' Australia will be an even greater country when we see our young people off the dole queues and living fulfilling lives. This is just one reason why I give this bill my wholehearted support.",67
36,Mr ANDREN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"At the outset, let me say that I believe the subtitle this particular piece of legislation-work for the dole-is highly derogatory. It is a name that we have given something which is trying to arrest a problem that I do not believe that either party has got a handle on. In fact, many of the major economies around the world are struggling with huge unemployment problems, particularly in the area of youth unemployment. In the second reading speech of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) to promote this bill, he said that the value of the work for the dole initiative lies in bringing young unemployed people back into a work culture to help instil a positive attitude to work and that it will give young people a chance to engage with the community rather than being alienated from it. Those are very worthwhile sentiments expressed there but, having said that, I am afraid that the philosophy of this bill has gone somewhere off the track because later in the House I heard the minister refer to 'these people' and that they had certain obligations to the community. When we have 28 per cent of 15to 19-year-olds unemployed in the western area of New South Wales, when we have 30 per cent of youth unemployment state-wide, I wonder whether we should, as those statements imply, be suggesting that it is their problem and not ours. It is our problem to generate jobs for the youth of this country and for those who have been put off by the downsizing of industry, by the lack of an industry policy and by the exporting of jobs because of our inability to compete. We cannot blame. We cannot say that people are going to sit back in their houses, lie in the bed and watch the television all day. There may be, and there always will be, a percentage of people who may not wish to work. But I think that it is basic to our instinct that we be rewarded and recognised for a job well done at the end of the day. There are hundreds of thousands of people-l V2 million, probably-out there who are crying out for some participation in the work force. We have structural unemployment. Once upon a time we used to have people we called labourers-the working class, if you like. of They were people who left school at a young age-sometimes, like my father, at 14--and went out into the work force. There were jobs there. There were processing jobs, jobs in industry and jobs in the mines. But now many of those jobs have been taken away by technology. They have also been taken away by the fact that labour is cheaper offshore than it is in Australia. Whose fault is that? We cannot just stand here for ever and a day blaming the union movement and the wage structure that we have developed in this country, because that very wage structure is a sign of our very prosperity. It is a prosperity that people in this country have come to expect and we cannot stand here and blame the person who is laid off for being the cause of their own problem. We now have 20 hours work regarded as full employment. We have one hour regarded as a person being employed. We have a huge underemployment problem in this country, quite apart from our unemployment problem. We must tackle the problem in a far more creative way than this social security amendment. I do not wish to refer to it as work for the dole. As I said, it is derogatory of those out there who have been rebuffed five, six, 10 or 12 times. How would any of us feel if we had that sort of rejection? We want reward for effort put in and we must find a more creative way of putting these people to work. The economic policies of both sides of politics in this country have been largely responsible for the situation we are now confronted with. Downsizing, rationalisation, privatisation, Telstra, Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank alone have created a situation where thousands of jobs have been or will be lost, and they will not be replaced. We have highly skilled people as well being laid off in the prime of their lives unable in many cases to contribute. Corporatisation is the precursor to privatisation. There was the ADI factory experience in my own electorate where something like 1,100 jobs have been reduced to 120 at best in the last few years. What have we seen in the last few days but the Carr Labor government awarding a pistol contract overseas when it could have been done locally and a very competitive product could have been turned out locally. But no, we export the jobs and we import the product. What sense is there in that? I support the concept of work for the dole. I support the concept of people having meaningful work three days a week over three years, but there must be a training component in it. There is no mention of the training component in this bill at all, yet I would refer you to the original interview that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) gave on the Sunday program back in February when he was asked by Laurie Oakes: What sort of work will they do? Are we talking about painting park benches? The answer from the Prime Minister was: Well, well, yeah ... I mean, I don't know. You know, for example, one scheme that I know worked quite well was a scheme where a lot of young people were engaged in meeting and greeting newly arrived visitors to Sydney, and part of the work they were given ... or part of the package they were given and might be given under this arrangement . . . would be a short training course at a TAFE college as part and parcel of the package that they would be offered. The answer suggests how half-baked and shot from the hip this policy was, but there was some sort of undertaking in this answer that there would be a training component in this program, and there is absolutely no sign of it. The labour market programs of the former government did deliver certain outcomes, although they were too short-26 weeks on LEAP. I met many young and middle aged people who had worked on that program and who had just become enthused at their contribution to what they saw as a very worthwhile program when the program came to a shuddering halt. They were forced to return for 18 months to the dole queues before they could qualify again for that program. There were features of both skillshare and LEAP in particular that I thought were very beneficial. I always believed they should have been far longer programs so that their participants were given some sense of belonging to something on a long-term basis. They then became employed not by the government on some work program, but they became enmeshed in the work force and became part of the work force, because that work force is largely becoming a part-time work force these days. If they had had two days a week of belonging to a program over three years with a training component, it would have made far more sense than the short, sharp 26-week program which largely hid them from the numbers on the unemployment figures and did not much more in many cases. I would be suggesting that we look at the farm sector in this program. I believe that there are many farmers out there who would love to have a person come and work for them one or two days a week. I have been criticised in my area for suggesting that by the state Labor member for the seat of Bathurst, who says that this would mean putting cheap labour into take work away from other people. The jobs just are not there on the farms. I was driving down the road south of Bathurst the other day towards the little village of Burraga and a farmer was standing in his yards mustering about a thousand sheep all on his own. I commented to the person with me how lonely a task farming is these days. The family farm is essentially made up of the farmer and his lady and the lady most often has to go off the farm to earn some other money to supplement the income. Having someone to help them get the essential jobs done would be useful. There is a critical situation with weed control in my electorate. They just cannot keep up with it. They have not got the time. If we could see our way clear to having a two-day a week work component with training, you could employ 30,000, 40,000 or 50,000 people and they would be volunteering. There should be no sense of compulsion with 10,000 jobs being provided under this scheme initially. They would be lining up for them. It is not a sense of compulsion we should be talking about. We are talking about real people who want to work in most cases and want to be part of this community, not isolated, marginalised and made to feel like they are lepers. Another useful program would be classifying and recording archival film at the regional television stations, one of which I worked for for many years. There is a heap of material of historical value sitting in cans on shelves and in unairconditioned circumstances where they will break down and deteriorate to the point where they will be useless. They need to be transferred urgently to the new digital ing technology. This will be a wonderful archival contribution and something that we could perhaps look at as one of our federation projects. We could train people in this state of-the-art technology to do this work. Much the same program was used in America during the depression to record the final words of the surviving slaves and those people who had worked in the pioneering part of America, especially in the southern states. They would be recording archival material, something of value-not the bench painting exercise that some people have been alluding to. The government is floundering and looking for some creative ideas to employ these young and older people in this scheme. We could use those people who have been downsized to act as the managers of this program so we do not create another bureaucracy or impose on local government to come up with the means of putting this project into play. Let's get creative. Let's not just call it work for the dole. Let's not point the finger at those people and say they are sitting back watching television all day. That would be five per cent of them at most of the 30 per cent of the young unemployed who are out there in the towns, regional centres and are really becoming quite cynical-and I can understand it-of the ability of this nation to ever deliver them any share of the economy or the fruits of the economy. We have four per cent growth in this country-the first time we have had growth of those proportions without jobs. It is nonjobs growth. We are not generating new jobs and yet we have what is boasted by the economists, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and everyone else who is well off to be a good healthy economy. It is not. There are no jobs being generated and there are many thousands out there who wonder when, if ever, they will be able to share in the fruits that we hope this country can generate. I would ask too that a voluntary rather than compulsory factor be built into this work for the dole scheme. Debate interrupted.",69
37,Mr SPEAKER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGIS LA TION,"Order! It being 2 p.m., the debate is interrupted in accordance with recordstanding order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA Racism",71
38,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall saying in this House on 5 June 1995 that: . . . the best messages all of us can convey to those who peddle racist bigotry is to ... brand them as the moral outcasts of our society. Does he also recall his words that: ... there is no place in Australia for racial intolerance, there is no place in this country for people who peddle racist bigotry and there is no place in Australia for people who would seek to treat one Australian as less important or less deserving ... than other Australians. Is it not a fact that the Prime Minister in this place last Tuesday clearly repudiated those principles? Why has the Prime Minister reserved a special place for the racist One Nation party, a place of preference on the how-to-vote cards of the coalition? Mr Costello-Off the budget, are we?",71
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Off the budget. Very interesting. Let me say this in reply to what the Leader of the Opposition has asked me: I stand by earlier repudiations of racism. Let me make it very clear, on behalf of the government, that anybody in Australia or any party in Australia that peddles racism deserves the condemnation and the criticism of all decent Australians. Now let us come to the question of preferences. Let us explain why the Australian Labor Party put Australians Against Further Immigration ahead of other parties in many electorates in the last election. Let the Leader of the Opposition explain why not only was he reluctant to see the former Labor member for Kalgoorlie-the now Independent member for Kalgoorlie-expelled from the Labor Party but also why he actually fought tooth and nail to keep him in. I do not fling around the epithet and the description of 'racist' as freely and irresponsibly as do members opposite. One of the reasons the Labor Party suffered a heavy loss in the last election was that you had ministers like the former Aboriginal affairs minister, Robert Tickner, who used the disgraceful description of 'racist' to condemn anybody who disagreed with his version of Aboriginal reconciliation. It is that kind of political correctness gone mad that the Australian people repudiated. But let me make it very clear to the Leader of the Opposition: we are not going to play any games with your silly preference tricks . We are opposed to racism but, like any other political party, we are not impressed with your attempts to brand people who disagree with you as racist. That is a kind of modern MCCarthyism which we reject.",72
40,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I wish to ask a supplementary question, Mr Speaker. Does the Prime Minister seriously mean to tell this House that he cannot give a clear cut unequivocal answer on a question of preferences to a party his Treasurer said was backed by: People like the League of Rights that have been looking for front operations for a long period ...",72
41,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The question is out of order. Savings,72
42,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Treasurer inform the House what the implications would be for national savings without the government's policies for deficit reduction and retirement incomes and what would have been Labor's national savings legacy? Mr Crean-You need a big sponge to mop him up.,72
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Don't let's start talking about mopping up, because it will start here. Watch it!",72
44,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, the budget which the government put in place this week was a pro national savings budget. One of the proudest achievements of this first Howard government will be that we took a $10.3 billion Labor deficit and we turned it into a $1.6 billion coalition surplus. A turnaround of that dimension-of around $11 billion or $12 billion over the course of the first parliamentary term-is a turnaround of about two per cent of GDP. This is a government that has put in place a program for national savings and led the way. We must say that with a great deal of mirth we saw the Labor Party out talking about national savings and various schemes for national savings that they would like to think that they would have introduced, if they had only been able to stay in office for more than 13 years. But nothing could have been less pro national savings than their fiscal policy. Their fiscal policy would have been running down national savings all the way into the next century and beyond. And this is a government which was able to tum that around-a 2 percentage point change in GDP over the first term of the government. In the budget on Tuesday night, we went a step further because not only are we now able to say that this government has turned from borrowing to saving, we are now able to say that this government has turned the tax system so that it now has a direct incentive for saving as well. And those measures which we put in place on Tuesday night to put to bed the tawdry episode of deceit over the l-aw tax cuts were measures open to all and open to all kinds of saving. I notice that the Labor Party is now out claiming that they are somehow concerned that the $450 tax rebate will be open to all income earners and that income earners like the Prime Minister will be able to get it as well as other income earners. Let me make this clear: this pro-savings savings rebate which replaces the l-a-w tax cuts is targeted at low income earners. A Keating Labor minister who voted for the l-a-w tax cuts in 1992 would have received, under those l-a-w tax cuts, a tax deduction of $1,252 a year. A person on $20,000, under the l-a-w tax cuts, would have received a tax cut of zero. The Keating Labor ministers in 1992-those people now concerned about progressive tax systems-voted for themselves, with the l-a-w cuts, a tax cut of per annum-and for the battlers of Australia, nothing, not one dollar. Now we find that they are all getting concerned, after the election, about progressivity in the tax system. Let me compare it with the measures that we introduced for the savings rebate. After you have claimed that 15 per cent rebate on your marginal tax rate, a person on $20,000 a year would pay $150 on $3,000 worth of savings; a person on $40,000 a year would pay $840 after claiming the rebate; and a person on $70,000 a year would pay $960 after claiming the rebate for savings-totally progressive. The biggest benefits are to the low income earners, and there are benefits of lesser dimension to the higher income earners as well. That is a 15 per cent rebate off a marginal tax rebate compared with an l-a-w tax cut which benefited no-one on $20,000no-one. Mr Fitzgibbon-You don't even believe this.",72
45,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"All the employees in the Hunter got out of the l-a-w tax cuts was zero-absolute zero. The Keating Labor ministers-there they are: Keating Labor finance minister, Keating Labor foreign minister, Keating Labor unemployment ministerall voted for themselves $1,252 per annum in tax cuts. So let us not have any of this crocodile tear concern about the high income earners. You were in there not just talking about it, my friend, but putting it into l-a-w. Savings Rebate",73
46,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of course, as you would realise, Mr Speaker, the three per cent superannuation contribution went to the battlers. My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall saying on the Channel 7 11 AM program this morning that he was 'certainly not calling upon other people to not claim the savings rebate'? Is that not precisely what the Prime Minister was doing yesterday when he said to the member for Dobell, to me and to the entire opposition front bench: I will not be claiming it-and it is up to you not to claim it. Are you going to make an \!quivaient promise? $1,252 Why did the Prime Minister say on the 11 AM program today that it would be stupid to have a means test on this proposal when, during the election campaign, it was made explicitly clear that an income related means test was a central part of the coalition's savings incentive initiative? Is the Prime Minister's memory today as faulty as his judgment was yesterday?",73
47,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. We now have from the Leader of the Opposition a new definition of a broken promise. The new definition of a broken promise is that if you over deliver on what you promise you have broken the promise. Let me remind the Leader of the Opposition that we did make a savings commitment, and the savings commitment we made at the time of the election has been massively and generously exceeded in the federal budget. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for giving me the opportunity of reminding the parliament and of reminding the Australian people that, just as we have over delivered in the area of capital gains tax for small business, so we have over delivered in the area of savings breaks. What the Leader of the Opposition does not seem to understand-and perhaps some of the people who sit behind him will begin to understand it when they go back to their electorates at the weekend-is that Australians quite support the idea of a tax break on savings. Australians quite like the idea that, at long last, they have a government in power in this country that not only entreats Australians to save but actually gives them a tax incentive to save. Let me plead guilty to the Australian people for having delivered more than I promised for the small business community. Let me plead guilty to the Australian people: I delivered more than I promised in the area of savings. Let us also plead guilty that we have delivered more in so many other areas. Mr Speaker, I am a humble man. I will always plead guilty to exceeding my promises to the Australian people.",73
48,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question. Prime Minister, how does knocking off the three per cent copayment exceed your election promise?",74
49,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The l-a-w scheme is defined, after what the Treasurer has said, to be an r-o-r-t scheme, a rort scheme.",74
50,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question is outside the guidelines. Savings: Self-funded Retirees,74
51,Mr SOMLYAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. What are the benefits in the government's new savings initiative for self-funded retirees, for battling Australians struggling to save a deposit for a new home, and women, many of whom go in and out of the work force and contribute to their own superannuation?",74
52,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In answer to the member for Fairfax, who represents a very large number of self-funded retirees in his electorate, let me say one or two things about the relevance of this savings proposal so far as self-funded retirees are concerned. The first point I want to make is that, like people who were earning under $20,000, the Labor Party's now discredited superannuation l-a-w, law scheme provided absolutely no benefits at all for self-funded retirees. The scheme that we have abandoned was savagely penal so far as self-funded retirees were concerned. For those opposite who interject, might I remind them of something that was said by the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate on 10 May 1995. He said: ... we are ... not spending the second tranche of the tax cuts in that way but rather diverting that government payout in other directions ... In other words, they decided to divert the money away from retired Australians. Retired Australians have worked their lives contributing money and when that money was collected by the federal Treasury, what did the Australian Labor Party decide to do? They decided to spit in the faces of those retired Australians, they decided to say to those retired Australians, 'We won't give you any access to the l-a-w law tax cuts.' He went on to say: Obviously it would be desirable, from the point of view of self-funded retirees, to be able to deliver them tax cuts. But there are lots of things that are desirable that are simply not attainable and not achievable. There are more immediate priorities Let me repeat that, he said: There are more immediate priorities ... The now shadow Treasurer was saying in 1995 that there were more immediate priorities in the eyes of the Labor Party than delivering tax justice to self-funded retirees in this country. So can I say to the member for Fairfax that one of the most important elements of our plan is that self-funded retirees will get a fair share in relation to the taxation rebate, unlike under Labor, which offered nothing in this area to self-funded retirees. All self-funded retirees will be able to contribute. There are many retired Australians who warmly welcome this initiative by the government. There are many retired Australians have modest savings. There have significant savings. All of those people will welcome this benefit. They have long wanted this benefit. They have long said, 'Isn't the Australian ethic meant to be that you are rewarded if you save? Oughtn't you be recompensed if you are thrifty your life?' They belong to a generation that worked hard and sacrificed a lot. They paid their taxes. They were told by Labor they were going to be left out in the cold. Let me say to pay tax. the self-funded retirees, 'Our savings scheme will bring you in from the cold. Our savings scheme will be open to you. Our savings scheme will reward your thrift. Our savings scheme will salute the contribution that have made through your working life to the welfare of the Australian nation.' Savings Rebate",74
53,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister on this occasion.,75
54,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,75
55,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You will see why in a moment.,75
56,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting Mr Costello-Here! Send them here!,75
57,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You'll get your projects chance. Curb your racing hormones. Your time will come again. Does the Prime Minister recall the Treasurer saying in his budget speech the other night that the savings rebate was particularly designed to benefit older Australians, by which I presume he meant not just self-funded retirees but others as well? Why then have you acted that over 11,4 million full rate age and service pensioners will get nothing at all from this rebate, even if they have substantial savings earning around $2,500 a year in interest income? How can you justify over delivering $450 to your entire front-bench while giving age and service pensioners nothing at all?",75
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer and I are completely at a loss to know what the shadow Treasurer is getting at. Mr Gareth Evans interjecting,75
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Resume your seat. who The Deputy Leader of the Opposition does are some who not have the call. Mr Gareth Evans interjecting,75
60,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. You did not have the call and the Prime Minister is not throughout required to answer.,75
61,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is it about pensioners being kept out of the tax net, is it? So can I say to the shadow Treasurer that of course the measure is not available to people who do not Federation Fund",75
62,Mr WAKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given the fact that the you government's visionary Federation Fund will provide real jobs in the construction industry, real jobs in those small businesses needed to support the projects and real jobs in various parts of Australia, what criteria will be used to decide which of these plans go ahead and which ones will contribute most to the Australia of the next century?",75
63,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Federation Fund, which has been allocated a capital sum of $1 billion, will be utilised to provide support for practical, enduring projects with a strong regional impact. It will be directed towards which maximise longer run economic and employment opportunities. The focus under the scheme will be on economic and social infrastructure. We have already announced that the National Museum of Australia will be eligible for funding under the Federation Fund. In doing so, we are making good on a promise that was broken by the to ensure former Keating government. I want to make it plain to the House and to the Australian people that both public and private projects will be considered. There will be a reasonable geographic spread to ensure equitable participation. The scheme will commence in 1998-99 in order to give adequate time for planning and adequate time for careful selection of projects that have maximum job and maximum geographic and other benefits. I have made it plain that I will be writing to the state and territory leaders on criteria and possible projects. Final decisions will be taken by the federal government. I say to the member for Grey that this Federation Fund is designed to mark in a practical way 100 years of federation. It is not designed to splurge the money of the Australian taxpayer on a thousand obelisks in a thousand towns, rather it is designed to provide support for major national infrastructure projects-infrastructure projects that will help rebuild the infrastructural assets of the Australian nation, infrastructure projects that will employ large numbers of Australians in the construction phase, infrastructure projects that link different communities within the Australian nation and infrastructure projects that are appropriate to the celebration of 100 years of nationhood by the Australian community in the year 2001. It is a visionary project. It is designed to call forth the desire of the Australian people to see a greater investment and a greater commitment towards renewing the infrastructure assets of our nation. I believe it is a measure that will receive very strong support from the Australian community. Foreign Affairs",75
64,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have a real question for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The minister will be aware of statements by Dr Mahathir in Africa recently where he attacked the Chinese in terms far more vitriolic than anything that has been heard in Australia. He also urged areas of Asia and Africa to descend on Europe and America en masse in line with a scenario painted in the Camp of the Saints by Jean Raspail. He also now is faced with the United Nations condemning Australia for human rights by a committee that is made up of the very same Third World countries. What is the government's response to that, seeing it is quite clear that Australia, as well as America and Europe, would be in the firing line?",76
65,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not aware of this thesis. The Australian government is not in the process of preparing to respond to some such thesis. We run a mature and sophisticated foreign policy. We are a country which has a high level of national security and which advances its interests in a very productive and constructive way, and we intend to continue to do so. Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme",76
66,Ms JEANES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. I refer the minister to announcements in the budget relating to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Can he outline to the House how the therapeutic premiums measure will work? Why is it needed? Will it prevent Australians getting access to necessary pharmaceutical treatments?,76
67,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. There is a great deal of nonsense being talked about in the changes to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The facts are that, with the therapeutic group price premiums, the additional costs for people are totally avoidable. Let me repeat that: patients, if they do not wish to pay a premium, can choose to change to another brand that is no more expensive than what they are paying at the moment. It very simply maintains people's right to freedom of choice while properly limiting taxpayers' liability. It will also introduce substantial price competition into the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, something that does not exist in most areas at the moment because the government subsidises the cost of drugs to 100 per cent. Similar policies are in place in several other countries, such as New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands. These products are grouped together because they are chemically very similar and they have very similar clinical effects. It is nonsense to say people are going to suffer disastrous consequences and terrible side effects if they switch from one product to another. For most people, a switch will make absolutely no difference whatsoever. This has been the experience in New Zealand, Germany and the Netherlands, where this has been introduced. If products are genuinely not interchangeable, this will be something that will be considered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee in advising us on the introduction of the therapeutic price premiums. Similarly, in the rare case that there are side effects, this is something also that we will take expert advice on. The other night I was reading some former Labor Party speeches in the Hansard-I do this when I cannot get to sleep. I came across a very interesting speech from 12 September 1990. Let me read some of the quotes out of this speech in Hansard. It says: It is important to remember that four years ago this country allocated $500m from taxpayers' money to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. In the last financial year the allocation was more than $1 billion ... Today it is $2.7 billion, I might say. It continues: ... in three years' time it will be more than $2 billion. And one can imagine how much we will be spending on subsidising the cost of drugs for our community by the tum of the century-a massive sum of money, if there is no change in the meantime. This Government has had the courage to take a very hard decisionThis speaker goes on to say: I have to say that I agree with some of the comments he made about the preference of a number of doctors to prescribe expensive drugs, often in cases where a patient does not need the most expensive drug available. Further in the speech, he says: Doctors should be trained to prescribe a family of drugs and not a particular brand. Who in the opposition do you think would have said this? Mr Fahey-Kim Beazley?",76
68,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it was not Kim Beazley, but that is close. It was someone else in the opposition who knows nothing about drugs. Who do you think it might be? It was the member for Dobell. I know he was a lusty young backbencher then, but this is the same person who was sitting there 10 minutes ago calling out, 'Flip, flop, flip, flop.' One wants to be very careful before one does that in this parliament, because Hansard has a very long memory. The fact is it is sheer and utter hypocrisy to say something in 1990 and do a complete flip-flop now just because it suits you. Kim, I hate to give you this advice. I know you are there saying, 'We're going to look at this very seriously, and we may not let it pass.' You might have been finance minister for three years, but this is done by regulation without disallowance. Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme",77
69,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Does the minister recall his comments on the John Laws program this morning when he said that the budget was about giving money 'to the people most in need'? If that is so, how do you justify pocketing $450 in the savings rebate for doing nothing, while pensioners who do not pay any income tax will receive no benefit whatsoever? One and a quarter million pensioners will receive no benefit whatsoever and will be forced to pay up to $7 more for the drugs which your government is removing from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Why should 66 pensioners in Long Jetty in my electorate each pay $7 more for their medicines to pay for your $450 savings rebate? Is this how the government plans to deliver money to the people most in need?",77
70,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is true that some drugs are being de-listed. Let me read you out some de-listed drugs: thiamine tablets, antihaemorrhoidal ointments and suppositories, emollients, creams and ointments, anti-viral topical ointments, topical antiseptics, sodium citrotartrate and urinary alkaliser. These were the drugs removed by Labor in the 1995 budget. The fact is things are continually delisted from the pharmaceutical benefits system so we can provide newer, better, higher cost drugs, and to pretend that you did not do it is further hypocrisy. Vocational Education",77
71,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Minister, I understand that funding has been allocated in this budget to assist and encourage schools to implement vocational education programs. Has the Commonwealth now extended the vocational education programs to target students in years 9 and 10 who are at risk of dropping out of the school system early? Minister, can you tell me details of those plans, the level of funding and when the funding will become available?",77
72,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I know that he has had a long interest in and concern for young people, particularly in those years 9 and 10 anL, indeed, Berwick Secondary College in his electorate has been a pioneering school in making sure that these young people, who are amongst the early drop-outs, could in fact get a secure pathway from school into employment. There is a very dramatic difference between the attitude of the government to helping these s.tudents and the attitude that the Labor Party showed when in office. Over the last 13 years, the message that the Labor Party gave young people in years 9, 10, 11 and 12 in school was that, if you were not going on to university, you were not going anywhere. But the problem was that 60 per cent of students were not going on to university and very little indeed was provided for these students over the whole 13 years of the previous government. In fact, in the first term of the Howard government, this government is providing almost four times as much to support vocational education courses in schools as you provided over the whole 13 years of your government. In fact, as we know, the main contribution of the new shadow minister for education is that he wants to close up to 366 schools. That is his contribution to education for young Australians. This government is providing $187 million over four years to provide students with quality training and workplace experience that will lead to real jobs, and this includes the introduction this year, for the first time, of school based apprenticeships and traineeships. Mr Crean-The first time? Rubbish!",78
73,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Hotham, the Two Billion Dollar Man, is the man who waited for these young people to drop out of school and then began to shuffle them through his hugely expensive six-months training programs. Well, this government is committed to quality training programs for these young people and for the first time there will be school based apprenticeships and traineeships. The government will be putting $70 million over the next three years through the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation. We will be rewriting the charter of the foundation to ensure that, for the first time, money is available to encourage students in years 9 and 10 to stay on at school. I know that the member for La Trobe will be particularly pleased at this initiative because he has been one of the members on this side of the House who has been pushing most strongly to help these young people, who, under your policies, are dropping out of school and going into the long-term youth unemployment queues. This initiative builds on initiatives announced in the budget to fund over 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships over the next 12 months, and these apprenticeships and traineeships will be in high growth industries such as technology, tourism, hospitality, finance, sport, as well as the traditional trades. More than $415 million has been set aside for the new national apprenticeship system, which will provide thousands of young Australians with the quality training that will lead them on to real jobs, something that the Labor Party failed to do. The Leader of the Opposition knows that better than anyone because, when he was minister for employment, youth unemployment rose to 34 per cent. It is no wonder that young people turned away from you in droves at the last election. Savings Rebate",78
74,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question on this occasion is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer take any steps to ensure that a wealthy family which chooses to split its savings income four or five ways through family trust or similar arrangements will not be able to collect four or five different $450 savings rebates? If not, why not?",78
75,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because I have already taken the steps. It can only be claimed by individuals. It cannot be claimed by trusts or any other personality. If you had read it, you would have known that. This is a universal rebate of $450 which is open to savers. And the government wants to send this message to the Australian people: the tax system is going to recognise saving. If you save, you are eligible for a 15 per cent rebate on your individual marginal tax rate, and it is open to all and it is open in relation to all classes of savings. When you see the Labor Party getting up here and going in and out and doing their mental gymnastics, the people of Australia have only got to take into account one thing: Labor is against reducing taxes on savings. That is all you have to understand here. The coalition is in favour of reducing taxes on savings and the Labor Party is against it. They always do this. They sit there and say, 'Oh, we are really in favour of it, but we have a thousand reasons why we can nitpick and raise points.' What was the question that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition put to Prime Minister? What was his big point? Why aren't you giving tax cuts to people who don't pay tax? That was your big point. Why is it night when the sun is not out? Why is it day when the sun is out? These are very deep questions, and I am sure you sit around in your office and try to think them up but they go nowhere. Here we have the twin act, Beazley and Evans-up, up, up, up, trying to figure out reasons why they are against reducing taxes on savings.",78
76,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The point of order goes to relevance. The Treasurer got a very clear-cut question on where the application of that $450 rebate would lie-whether it would lie in taking income from trusts. We have not yet got an answer to that question. What we have got is an excuse for the fact that a pensioner with $40,000 worth of savings gets nothing.",79
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer is concluding his wide ranging answer on this contentious topic.,79
78,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am, Mr Speaker. As I have made it clear, this is a savings rebate on your marginal tax rate for an individual who saves. The great thing about it is, as I have already said, that 66 per cent of the benefit goes to people who are earning under $40,000 and it is progressive, unlike the l-a-w tax cut. The l-a-w tax cut was $1,250 of tax cuts to Labor ministers and zero to $20,000 income earners.",79
79,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Zero!,79
80,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Zero. Absolutely zero. When we see the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition going up, down, up, down, telling us",79
81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The point of order goes to relevance again. The Treasurer has an interesting way of excusing the three per cent co-payment that he has just taken off low income earners.",79
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have taken the point of order. You can resume your seat.,79
83,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What I would like to know is the answer to the question.,79
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer is winding up his answer.,79
85,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Up, down, up, down. In getting up here, the one message they are giving is they are against the savings rebate. That is the message that you are giving. The Leader of the Opposition and the deputy leader-the 1983 Mal Colston defence team. That is who they were.",79

92,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What is your point of order?,79
93,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The point of order is this: it was a simple question on $450 worth of gain potentially split four or five different ways from income received from a trust and the Treasurer has not managed to answer it yet.,79
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am under the impression the Treasurer has finished his answer.,80
95,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Generally you let senior counsel take the points of order in the defence team, but I will leave it to the Leader of the Opposition on this occasion. Small Business: Unfair Dismissals",80
96,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Given that the government's proposed partial exemption of small business from the unfair dismissal provisions will promote employment, can the minister advise the House of reaction to Labor's decision not to support the initiative? What do employer organisations say about Labor's anti-jobs decision?",80
97,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for her question. There has been a very positive reaction to this proposal to exempt those small businesses with 15 employees or fewer from the unfair dismissal scheme in the first 12 months of somebody's employment. The initial reaction came from Senator Cook, from the Labor opposition, who said it was not a bad idea. We had the Labor shadow spokesman for small business saying the other say basically it would be political suicide for the Labor Party to oppose it. In the last 24 hours we have had a whole series of people saying it is a good idea. A spokesperson for the small business community said that Labor's decision was: ... stupid ... highly disappointing and frankly absurd ... This is total idiocy and I call on to assist the government to remove this impediment to employment. Brian Noakes of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that Labor had made a serious error because the small business community remained extremely concerned about the impact of the unfair dismissal laws. He also said that the exemption gave small employers a really good, positive signal to go out and give somebody a job. The Australian Business Chamber said: The government's objective is an important proemployment initiative that should be supported by all political parties. Then this morning's Courier-Mail, which summed it up pretty well, said: Small business must be given incentive to employ more people. They also said: There is a sound argument for employers to be given an effective 12-month period when new employees can be judged on their merits and, if they don't measure up to the task, be dismissed without unnecessary regulation and difficulty. That is a pretty sensible point. In fact, somebody else said that yesterday on the Jeremy Cordeaux radio program. This other person said: ... I think it's reasonable [hat people coming to jobs have an extended period of probation to prove themselves ... Fair enough; we would all agree with that. In fact, that was basically the reason for doing this. Furthermore, it was said: The people I employ in my office, I keep them on months and months of probation to make sure I've got the right person ... I think that's absolutely reasonable for small business ... Mrs Sullivan-Who said that?",80
98,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Who said that? Mr Costello-Senior counsel!,80
99,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Senior counsel said that. In fact, the case was put very well by the shadow Treasurer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He said that yesterday. He is absolutely right. This is not some sort of arcane matter of detail. The reality is we are trying to say to the small business community that they have the support of the government with a sensible Labor system to go out and give somebody a job. And what is the Labor Party's message? Their message is: don't give somebody a job. Their message is, 'Oh, look. We're pro jobs but actually in the parliament we are going to do absolutely everything we possibly can to prevent the government setting up a system that will give small business a go.' I do not know what their explanation is for it. In fact the shadow Treasurer has blown away the reality of this, and that is that Labor is opposed to it for purely political reasons. You have no explanation for this. I think you need one. The reality is that you are on probation as well. I say to everybody in small business and those people who are unemployed that they ought to write to the Leader of the Opposition and voice their concern and require of him a bit of decent leadership on an important issue. NA",80
100,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"-I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the Kingdom of Thailand led by their distinguished Speaker of the National Assembly. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Savings Rebate",81
101,Mr OKEEFE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister, the beleaguered Leader of the National Party, and it concerns the great rural savings hoax. I ask the Deputy Prime Minister: are you aware that the latest ABARE figures show that the vast majority of Australian farms run at a loss and that the wages of farm workers are among the lowest in the nation? Apart from you and the other high income farmer members of cabinet, just how many ordinary farmers and their workers will qualify for your savings rebate?",81
102,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me point out to the House that the interest rate reductions which have occurred under the coalition government have saved farmers over $300 million already, with more to come. With regard to those farmers paying tax and who are able to get into a position of savings-I know that with drought and with the recession that Keating gave us there have not been as many as there should have been-they, too, will be eligible. I was very pleased to see that just before Easter there was a bit of a shuffle along the front bench-a couple got sacked, a couple got pushed sideways, a couple got promoted. If that is your first it is a pretty weak one. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Deputy Prime Minister has not addressed the question as to how many farmers will benefit from the savings tax rebate.",81
103,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat; there is no point of order. BHP: Newcastle,81
104,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. Earlier this week we heard from the member for Hotham that in 1995 the opposition had secured the future of jobs at BHP in Newcastle with the promise to construct an electric arc furnace. Minister, are you now aware of reports suggesting BHP may announce further job losses at its Port Kembla plant? I ask the minister: what is his reaction to these statements and reports, and how does this reflect on the attitude of the opposition to the recent restructuring of BHP's steel interests.",81
105,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The last part of the question is clearly out of order. It is asking him about the opinion of the opposition.",81
106,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I call the honourable Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and invite him to ignore the last elements of the question.",81
107,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very pleased that the member for Paterson raised this matter, because I thought there would probably be another stunt from the member for Hotham, who is particularly keen on stunts no matter what. As a consequence of this question being raised by a New South Wales backbencher, another scare tactic by the ALP, I asked BHP to clarify the position as it related to Port Kembla. I will quote from a letter from Mr MCNeilly, who responded to me very recently: BHP flatly denies the reports that it is negotiating to sell its tin mill facilities to British Steel or any other company. Currently we are spending $300 million to upgrade and expand production at the tin mill-the Tin Mill 2000 Project-which will give us the chance to capitalise on opportunities in Australia and Asia. Capacity will be increased by and best effort, 40 per cent. That is certainly not in line with some of the stuff that was turned out yesterday. While I am here, I might just reflect on some of the comments made by the member for Hotham during the matter of public importance discussion. During that time he went to some considerable pains to point out the virtues of the Button plan-what a great plan it was for steel in Australia; how much it maintained employment; how much it did for steel. Steel in Newcastle did not get one cent from the Button bounty plan-not one cent. So at the end of the period all you did was subsidise employment and then it fell down the drain. It is just part of the fraudulent claims by the member for HothamMr Allan Morris- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The minister is misleading the House. What he is saying is wrong in fact, and that is provable. It is not the first time he has done it.",81
108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order; resume your seat.,82
109,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-Not one cent under the bounty scheme was paid to the steelworks in Newcastle. So the outcome of the Button plan was a complete disaster for Newcastle. You did nothing for what went on in that area whatsoever. As to the arc furnaces in 1995, you were informed that as a consequence of that there would be a further fall in employment. You did nothing about it. Mr Crean-We saved Newcastle-for 13 years.",82
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Hotham!,82
111,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-On Monday you were in here talking about yet another plan-another steel plan which is going to do nothing for Newcastle, as was the case in the past, and you know that. You are great on colour and movement; not too good on substance. Mr Crean interjecting",82
112,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Hotham.,82
113,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-As a consequence of that, the regional affairs subcommittee of cabinet will be visiting Newcastle next week. We will see the interested parties in Newcastle to see what they think should be done. We will involve them in the decision-making process, and there will be some money involved in those decisions. These are the real answers needed in Newcastle-not some claptrap from you. Official Establishments",82
114,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has said that he will not claim the savings rebate, even though it is the so-called centrepiece of the budget, because he has two homes funded at public expense. Given that the move to Kirribilli is costing the taxpayer millions of dollars and that Tuesday's budget contained large cuts to public housing for other Australians, Prime Minister, why don't you just vacate your public housing at Kirribilli and take the savings rebate instead, thereby leaving the taxpayer millions minus $450 better off?",82
115,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I suppose this was sanctioned, was it? I suppose the Leader of the Opposition signed off on this. Could I just say in relation to the expenses of running Kirribilli and the Lodge: the latest figures that were available to me indicate that the costs of running both of the official establishments in the first year that I have been in office have been several hundred thousand dollars less than the last year that Mr Keating was Prime Minister. Mr Latham-My supplementary question IS",82
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You haven't got the call. Resume your seat.,82
117,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,82
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I intend now to resume question time. National Museum of Australia,82
119,Mr NAIRN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Can the minister advise the House what measures were contained in the budget which led to the creation of the National Museum of Australia? Mr Wilton-What about the Bendigo art gallery?",82
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Isaacs!,82
121,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for his question. In the budget, we announced through Senator Alston's portfolio that we were committing $7 million to the design phase of the National Museum. As already indicated by the Prime Minister earlier today, the funding for the museum will come from the Federation Fund and the indicative cost at this stage is $133 million. The interesting thing about the National Museum is that, when we went to the last election, in our policy For Arts Sake-A Fair Go! we promised that we would proceed to deliver a national museum for Australia. And in this budget we have done so. But prior to being able to proceed with the museum, we had to discern where was the most appropriate site. After the election, a committee was established and determined that it would be Acton Peninsula. We also had to give effect to a land swap between the government here in the ACT and the Commonwealth. It was started by the previous government but never completed. That land swap has now been completed and the museum will be able to go ahead. . The interesting thing I found when looking Into the museum was that, back in 1993-the member for Eden-Monaro will be interested in this-the Labor Party issued a policy called Distinctly Australian, in which they detailed that they would proceed with a national museum of Australia. They said: Lab.or will proceed with the development of the NatIOnal Museum with a Commonwealth contributi-n of $26 million over four years. Its completion will be a cooperative exercise between the Commonwealth and the government of the Australian Capital Territory. Nothing happened at all. You made a promise in the 1993 election, and nothing happened at all. The most interesting thing about it is that the minister for the arts at the time was the member for Canberra-the man who lives here. He promised Canberra a national museum, and did not deliver it. It gets worse. In this budget, we also announced $20 million for the upgrade of some of the infrastructure here organised by the National Capital Authority. I have since discovered that for 13 years the reflective ponds in this city have been empty. There is a whole generation of people in Canberra who think they are nothing more than a receptacle for dead leaves. You did nothing about it. Those ponds are cracked. It is an absolute disgrace. But it gets worse. Scrivener Dam is 30 years old. Requests have been urgently made through the National Capital Authority for funds to make sure the dam is able to do its job; that is, keep the water in Lake Burley Griffin-and $1 million has to. be allocated to it this year. You ignored It! You, after 13 years, were going to leave Canberra devoid of any water in the lake. The dam would have collapsed if we did not address these problems. There is no water in the reflective ponds and you promised a museum-and you did not deliver it! You are an absolute disgrace. You do not care about Canberra. All the crocodile tears over the last 18 months from you people are an absolute disgrace. You have done nothing for Canberra, you never did anything for Canberra-and you are the guy who lives here. You were the minister who had the opportunity, and you did nothing. Domiciliary Nursing Care",82
122,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. I am pleased to say that the opposition supports the extension of the domiciliary nursing care benefit by $16.60 a fortnight. But, Minister, is it not the case. that this increase in the domiciliary nursmg care benefit will be funded by taking at least 15,000 children with disabilities off the child disability allowance for a net saving of $19 million? That is $19 million off carers. Is it not a fact that children with severe asthma, diabetes or attention deficit disorder will no longer get the child disability allowance? Is it the intention of the minister to keep her $450 tax rebate while taking $2,000 away from parents of children with disabilities?",83
123,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Here we go again. It is - arp, carp, carp; whinge, whinge, whinge. Is It any wonder that this shadow minister is being tagged in the community as the 'shadow minister for scaring', not the 'shadow m-niste- for cari?g'. It is just carp, carp, carp. It IS whmge, whInge, whinge. What were they going to do in their 14th year of government if they had ever managed to get there, which they didn't? What would they have done? These changes go to the heart of matters in the social security portfolio and they should have been properly directed to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Social Security. But I will be happy to talk for a moment about the matter of disabilities. In its budget report to members, the ACROD organisation, which is the peak body for disability in this country and represents the providers of disability services-and they do a darned good job; they are a fantastic organisation-says: The government has announced new money and it is real money, real new moneynot like the l-a-w tax cuts that you never delivered on; we have delivered real new money for people with a disabilityfor personal care and accommodation support. Mr Gareth Evans-Point of order, Mr Speaker, on a point of relevance: the minister has made it perfectly clear that she is indeed happy to talk but her obligation in this place is to answer the question, and that was about asthmatic kids",83
124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will cease talking and address his point of order. Mr Gareth Evans-That is the point of order.,84
125,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,84
126,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It would have been useful if the shadow minister had directed the tion to the appropriate minister in this place to begin with. It just demonstrates ACROD's support of what we have done in this child disability allowances. It is another indication that these people have never had the capacity to listen to what the community has to say. We have demonstrated that we have been listening. We do listen, we have a plan, and we are putting that plan into action. Budget 1997-98",84
127,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is advery dressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, budget. is it a fact that the fall-out from the frenzied business activities of the 1980s combined with Labor's high interest rates, one million unemployed and record bankruptcies severely dented the confidence of many Australians? Given the fact that the government's new budget overcomes many of the Labor !egamerce and Industry: cies, does the Prime Minister believe that this week's decisions will help restore some of that lost confidence? Over time what will that mean for job opportunities in Australia's city and regions and what are some of the reactions so far to this new budget?",84
128,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, on a point of order under section 144: this is a question asking for an opinion from the Prime Minister and is not a question addressed to the issue.",84
129,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,84
130,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is undoubtedly true, as suggested by the honourable member for MCMillan, that one of the principal features of the second budget delivered by the Treasurer earlier this week is that it dealt with some of the worse legacies of the former Labor administration. No amount of noise at question time, no amount of guffawing by those who sit opposite, no amount of obfuscation at question time or in the press can alter a number of single unassailable facts. The first and most important of those is that in March of 1996 the newly elected coalition government inherited an underlying budget deficit of $10,500 million. By the third year of our first term in office we will have turned that into a surplus of $1,600 million. It is a scale of fiscal turnaround that has not been quesachieved by any federal government since Federation and it far exceeds the fiscal turnaround achieved by state governments in area of Australia over the last few years. It is a magnificent tribute to the particular skill and application and work of my colleagues the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance. I want on behalf of the government at the end of this budget week to record my particular thanks to the Treasurer and to all of my other colleagues who have worked so very hard to make this such a successful Let us cut through the negative reaction of those who sit opposite and remind the chamber of the reactions of those who speak for the business community and those who speak for other sections of the Australian community. We take the Australian Chamber of ComThis is a good budget which will go a long way towards restoring growth and lowering unemployment. From the Minerals Council, Mr Dick Wells: The second Howard-Costello budget should contribute to a more secure basis for Australia's economic future. The Master Builders Association of Australia: The budget reduction strategy will help remove upward pressure off the deficit on interest rates benefiting businesses. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia: The government has shown it is prepared to give business a chance to grow and create more jobs. These are the words of real Australians out in the workplace of this country; they are not the words of the out of touch politicians who sit opposite. The Carers Association of Australia, Mrs Avril Fink: The budget is a clear indication that carers are a priority for this government. The Council on the Ageing: We appreciate the initiatives to improve acute care in the public hospital system. The Australian Vice Chancellors Association-very interesting: The AVCC is pleased the government has introduced more flexible discounting arrangements for HECS payments. The Credit Services Union: Residents of towns in rural Australia have renewed hope for their future following tonight's budget. It goes on. Mr Mitch Hook of the Australian Food Council: The industry welcomes the government's commitment to continued fiscal consolidation and the key initiatives specific to the food industry. Mr Richard Gilbert of the Investment Funds Association: It is a clear signal that the government wants all Australians to raise levels of saving. Not all Australians. The Labor Party does not want the levels of savings raised. The Labor Party is against it. The Australian Hotels Association: This federal government support will be directly translated into new jobs. The Australian Catholic Welfare Commission-has not always given us. a tick, I have to say: The carers package has a number of initiatives that will make a real and positive difference to the Jives of those caring for frail and disabled family members. And finally, Dr Ron Silberberg of the Housing Industry Association",84
131,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting-Hal,85
132,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Oh! We laugh at the representative of the housing industry, the greatest small business employer in Australia-very interesting. This is what he had to say: The federal budget addresses Australia's twin problems of jobs and low national saving. Mr Speaker, I think the reaction to the budget has been first class. I simply remind the House and I remind the Australian people that those who sit opposite opposed the environmental measures of the government, they voted against them. They imposed a superannuation surcharge on high income earners, then they voted against it in the Senate, and they are against the tax breaks for savings for the Australian community. I think the Australian community will make a very harsh judgment on the Australian Labor Party because of that. On that note, Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Racism",85
133,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I would like to add to the answer I gave to the first question that was asked of me today by the Leader of the Opposition when he asked me about preferences. I would like to supplement my answer by reminding the House that in the Lindsay by-election last year-remember Lindsay, Jackie?-the Australian Labor Party gave its preferences to Australians Against Further Immigration, and this is what Mr Vince Townsend had to say: The only one that did approach us in regard to this how-to-vote card was the representative of the Labor Party and an arrangement was made that we would not be last on the list with Labor and we have decided to put them in a similar position. I would also remind the parliament that in the last election there were 13 seats in New South Wales, not just mine-I might have thought they had a particular reason for that-in which the Australian Labor Party gave preferences to the AAFI ahead of the Liberal Party and perhaps other candidates. Those seats were Bennelong, Blaxland, Charlton, Dobell, Eden-Monaro, Fowler, Greenway, Macarthur, Mackellar, Macquarie, Mitchell, Robertson and I think Warringah. It really does expose the humbug. Official Establishments",85
134,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"In further answer to a question asked by the member for Werriwa about Kirribilli House, I have been advised that, in the relevant period to March 1997, in my prime ministership, the total in relation to Kirribilli House and the Lodge shows a lower spending of $200,294 and, if you take reduced guarding costs into account, the total saving in a 12-month period is $541,446-a lot more than $450, mate!",86
135,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Will the Prime Minister give us the costs of the movement of public servants to Sydney?,86
136,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat.,86
137,Mr BEAZLEY,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"I think it is fair enough. We haven't had an answer. Also, it ought to be pointed out, Mr Speaker, that, in all seats bar three, the AAFI gave their preferences to that lot. Foreign Affairs",86
138,Mr DOWNER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie asked me a question. I concede to not having been able to hear the very beginning of it because of the cacophony of noise that was coming from the other side. I understand at the beginning of his question he referred to some remarks that Dr Mahathir, the Prime Minister of Malaysia, made which were reported in the Australian media. I can tell the honourable member I did see the newspaper article which he drew to my attention. I will put it this way to the honourask able member: the point that Dr Mahathir was essentially making was that developing countries demand better access to the markets of developed countries, particularly the United States and in the European Union. That is a reasonable proposition. As a matter of fact, it is a proposition that this country shares and he is rhetorically embellishing that point. As for the rest of the thesis that the honourable member was expounding, as I understood it, as I said earlier I am not familiar with that. Unemployment",86
139,Mr HOWARD,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Speaker, I would like to add to another answer. Yesterday, I did the Australian Labor Party a very great injustice. I said that in the last six years when the Labor government was in power they ran up $75 billion of additional debt to purchase an additional 7,100 full-time jobs. I am advised that that figure was subsequently revised by the ABS to 16,000. So they spent $75 billion to buy 16,000 full-time jobs. NA Questions",86
140,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have a question of you, Mr Speaker. Yesterday the member for Denison took a point of order as follows: Repeatedly during this question time ministers addressing the House have asked questions of the opposition, and that is not in order. You responded: There is no point of order and you know it. Having examined both the standing orders and the third edition of House of Representatives Practice, the Barlin edition, I ask you to review your ruling on three counts. The first is that there is no provision in the standing orders for ministers to ask questions. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I want to raise a point of order. He is out of order. He is not entitled to ask a question and thereby essentially de facto challenge one of your rulings.",86
141,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I thank the minister.,86
142,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I would ask you to consider the issue of whether ministers addressing the House may questions of the opposition during question time. That is the question that I ask of you. I do so for three reasons. First, there is no provision in the standing orders for ministers to ask questions. The purpose of question time is for parliament, on behalf of the nation, to hold the executive accountable. Nor is there any provision for the Leader of the Opposition or any other members of the opposition to actually answer those questions",86
143,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I thank the honourable member for Wills. I have got the thrust of the question. The questions were rhetorical. There is no further point of order.,87
144,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I have other issues which I wish to raise with you, Mr Speaker, in relation to this matter.",87
145,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,I am more than happy to take the further issues in writing from the member. NA,87
146,Mr LEE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Dobell) (3.17 p.m.)Unfortunately, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) has left the chamber for some reason, but I claim to have been misrepresented. At question time today the Minister for Health and Family Services accused me of being a hypocrite for opposing the government's new drugs tax, which forces patients to pay more for safer and more effective drugs. During his answer the minister quoted from a speech I gave in 1990. This is what the minister said: Doctors should be trained to prescribe a family of drugs and not a particular brand. What the minister did not do was go on to quote from the following sentence, which said: A chemist has to ring the doctor to confirm that there will be no medical complications if he provides the generic alternative. Clearly I was talking about generic drugs, which are identical chemical substances, not drugs that are safer and more effective, and the minister has misled the House with his answer. Mr Reith-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the member for Dobell has alleged that the minister misled the House. He ought to be required to withdraw it. If he wants to make that allegation, he should move a substantive motion.",87
147,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,There are forms and conventions within the parliament if you wish to,87
148,Mr LEE,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,He has misled the House. I am permitted to say that under the standing orders and that is exactly what he has done.,87
149,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order that has been raised, the expression that requires the particular motion that the Leader of the House referred to is when to the word 'misleading' the word 'deliberate' is added. That is a matter that suggests that the person is prevaricating in the chamber, and that is why there are forms of the House that require to be addressed.",87
150,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,We have addressed this issue a couple of times today. I thank the Leader of the Opposition. NA Questions on Notice,87
151,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, before I ask my question, isn't it out of order for minister to try to interrupt while I have the call, on a matter unrelated to what I am talking about? Wasn't it just damn bad manners?",87
152,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,This is a day of unusual robustness and there has been some flexibility. You have a question of me?,87
153,Mr CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Yes, Mr Speaker. I asked of the Attorney-General in February a series of questions, in question No. 1330, to which I have not yet had an answer. As it is well beyond time, I wonder if you could take it up with the Attorney-General for me.",87

NA (ELECTION) LEGISLATION Supplementary Explanatory Memorandum",88
157,Mr MARTIN,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,"Cunningham) (3.22 p.m.)Mr Speaker, and I am seeking your guidance in this respect. I did notice-and I am pleased the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) is still here-that what was tabled as part of those papers today at item No.7 was the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 supplepapers: mentary explanatory memorandum. It said on the paper that was in this chamber this morning, 'Not available prior to tabling.' As that legislation is in the middle of debate in this House at the moment, I wondered whether the supplementary explanatory memorandum would therefore have any bearing on the debate that has proceeded in this House already from members on both sides. I wanted an explanation, through you, as to why that document is now being tabled and what is in it. I spoke on this bill this morning. Now we have a supplementary explanatory memorandum being tabled but the bill has actually gone through this House.",88
158,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,I thank the honourable member for Cunningham. He has raised an interesting point. I will take advice from the minister. Mr Leo MCLeay-He doesn't know.,89

We thank the other side for their cooperation in seeing the matter finalised this morning. I am happy to advise the House of this. As to the circumstances surrounding this particular supplementary document, I have absolutely no briefing whatsoever but I will certainly tain the facts from the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and advise the member accordingly. Mrs Crosio--No, advise the House.",89
161,Mr REITH,CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION,I will advise the House. NA Visit to Singapore and China,89
162,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-I would like to report to the House on my recent visits to Singapore and China between 26 March and 2 April. Both visits were part of a deliberate pattern of visits I have made as Prime Minister to key regional countries in the Pacific region. They follow my visits during 1996 to Indonesia and Japan, and my participation in the APEC leaders meeting in Manila. The message I conveyed during my visit was that my government was committed-and very strongly so-to building Australia's engagement in the region. There can be no doubt that Australia's political and economic future is closely bound up with the future of the Asia-Pacific region. Our success in our economic partnership with our region will be vital to our economic prospects and to our capacity to generate worthwhile jobs in Australia, especially for our children. My government is committed to ensuring that Australia's economy is equipped to compete for a share of the spectacular growth in the region, that adequate frameworks are in place at a government level with our regional partners to facilitate business and other links and that Australia plays an active part as a member of the regional community in shaping its future. I would like to extend my deep appreciation to my hosts in both Singapore and China for the warmth and generosity of the hospitality they extended to me and to my party. This was a compliment to Australia, a measure of the regard with which Australia is held in both countries and a recognition of the great benefits which flow to both sides from our relationships. In Singapore, in meetings with President Ong, the Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong, ascerand the Senior Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, I reaffirmed my commitment to Australia's partnership with Singapore. In an address to a major business lunch hosted jointly by the Singapore Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Singapore Australia Business Council, I outlined the strengths that Australia brings to its economic engagement with the region and the benefits of my government's reform program in this regard. Australia's relationship with Singapore is one of the most diverse and active we have in the region. I marked an important element in the history of that relationship in laying a Asiawreath at the Kranji Commonwealth War Cemetery where 1,100 Australians are buried and the deaths of 1,640 others are commemorated. Singapore is our largest trade and investment partner in ASEAN, with total bilateral trade worth $5.8 billion last year. It is one of the principal sources of visitors to Australia, and the second largest foreign investor in Australia's tourist industry. About 11,000 young Singaporeans studied in Australia last year. We cooperate very closely with Singapore regionally and internationally. We have very similar views on the importance of APEC. The government is working closely with Singapore to consolidate APEC's role as the pre-eminent structure for regional cooperation and to ensure that the momentum of trade and investment liberalisation is maintained within APEC. Singapore's own economic success is a testament to the benefits of liberalisation. I expressed my appreciation to the Prime Minister for Singapore's strong and consistent support for Australia's membership of the Asia-Europe Meeting, noting the appropriateness of Australia's participation in this body. We have strong defence links with Singapore and Malaysia through the five power defence arrangements. The Singapore government expressed to me its appreciation for the training facilities that Australia provides for Singapore's armed forces. Given the breadth and depth of our links it was particularly pleasing to be able to announce with the Singapore Prime Minister a new aviation agreement which provides for nearly a 40 per cent increase in services between Australia and Singapore, meaning about 30 extra Boeing 747 services between the two countries every week. The agreement will also result in a doubling of the number of air freight services between Australia and Singapore. If I may depart from my written text and interpolate, one of the events that I remember most from my visit to Singapore was a gathering at the Australian High Commission of some of the hundreds of the alumni of Singaporeans who had been to Australian universities over a very long period of time. As a reminder not only of the past but of the continuing close relationships between our two countries, one graduate of Sydney University from the early 1960s approached me and pointed out that his daughter and my daughter are currently classmates at Sydney University and that they had participated together in the Sydney University law review last year. This was a personal reminder to me of the depths of the links between us and the way in which those links span different generations of Australians. It is also a very proud reminder to any Australian politician of the massive contribution that the Colombo Plan and those educational links between Australia and Malaysia and Singapore in particular have made to the very strong bilateral relationships we have. It drives home to all of us that the association between Australia and the nations of the region is not a recent thing: it is something that is very deeply rooted in the postWorld War II experience of Australia and something to which great contributions have been made by leaders of both sides of the Australian political divide. My visit to China had, as a principal objective, establishing a good working relationship with the Chinese leadership and suggesting new horizons for our economic partnership. I underlined the continuity of Australia's commitment to a strong relationship with China, acknowledging the contributions made by previous governments from both sides of politics. Reflecting the strength of the bilateral economic relationship and the priority Australia attaches to it, some of Australia's most senior business leaders participated in my delegation. I would like to particularly thank those business leaders who accompanied me for their contribution to the visit's success. Their participation sent a very positive signal to the Chinese government about the commitment of the government and the business community to work together in strengthening the relationship with China. Might I again interpolate another recollection of a personal kind in connection with the business delegation. One of the members of that business delegation is a businessman well known to many members of the House, Mr Lewis Ting, who is the managing partner of Ernst and Young. When we had a meeting with the Vice Premier, Mr Zhu Rongji, who will visit Australia very shortly, Mr Ting was amongst the four members of the business delegation who was invited to make a presentation to the Vice Premier and, as he opened his presentation, he pointed out that one of his grandparents had been born in Shanghai and that he could trace his ancestry back to one of the provinces of China in the 11 th century. And then he rather dissolved the gathering into some laughter-particularly on the Chinese side-when he expressed his regrets that he was not nearly as fluent as the minister in Mandarin. It was another very good reminder of the personal links between Australia and the nations of the region, which are so very important to building sound relationships at a national level. Given our mutual interests-and the importance to the region of cooperation between us-good communication between Australia and China is crucial. I proposed-and the Premier Mr Li Peng agreed-that we should strengthen dialogue at a political level. We agreed that we would meet regularly at head of government level. I also proposed that the ministerial framework for discussion of economic cooperation be upgraded and broadened, in order to ensure our economic complementarities achieved their full potential. In short, my government is seeking a partnership in growth with China. I am pleased that we will have the opportunity to continue our discussions on this when the Vice Premier, Zhu Rongji, visits later this month. China is already our fifth-largest trading partner. In the past decade, Australia's trade with China has grown twice as fast as our trade with the rest of the world. By the year 2000, China could be our third largest trading partner, after Japan and the United States. Australia will maintain its track record as a reliable supplier of mineral and agricultural commodities. China is already our largest wool market-taking about one quarter of our wool exports-and we supply about 60 per cent of its iron ore imports. I drew the Chinese leadership's attention, however, to the much greater role that Australia could play in fuelling China's economic growth. President Jiang Zemin responded well to this. Australia can play the part in China's economic growth that we played during the rapid industrialisation of Japan and Korea. Possible areas for expansion include LNG and directly reduced iron, DR!. During my visit China agreed to send a feasibility study team to Australia to look further at the prospects for directly reduced iron. Investment from China could play an important role in consolidating this economic partnership. I reaffirmed that Chinese investment would be most welcome. According to Chinese figures, we are already the second largest destination for Chinese investment, after Hong Kong. Australian investment in China is also growing at a rapid rate. The composition of the business group that travelled with me reflected the scope for this partnership to expand into new areas, including manufactures, construction and services. In particular, my visit highlighted Australia's strength in financial services. During my visit, I participated in a ceremony to mark the issuing to the ANZ Bank of a licence to operate a branch in Beijing. I opened a seminar sponsored by the Australian Stock Exchange in order to explain the benefits for Chinese companies of listing in Australia. Just before I visited, AMP received a licence to open a representative office in Beijing. I supported the applications Colonial Mutual and National Mutual have made for licences to operate in China. I also opened Ansett's new office in Shanghai. Closer political cooperation between Australia and China is also important. There will, of course, be differences from time to time between us, reflecting our different traditions, cultures and political systems. My government's approach to China will be based on the principles of mutual respect and recognition of our mutual interests. It is better that any differences are discussed openly and directly in a non-confrontational way-in the context of a mutual recognition of the value of our cooperation to each other and the importance of it to the region. I reiterated in my discussions that Australia did not regard China as a threat. China's economic growth was to be welcomed, not feared. Rather, we wanted to see China constructively involved in regional institutions and beyond. I underlined our shared interests in APEC. I promoted publicly the benefits for China itself and for the rest of us of early Chinese accession to the World Trade Organisation on reasonable terms. Dialogue with China on regional security issues is important. President Jiang Zemin's ready response to my suggestion that our respective defence forces should have regular talks was, therefore, very pleasing. These talks should help provide a clearer understanding of our respective outlooks and promote stability in our region. I reaffirmed the government's commitment to the one-China policy. Australia will pursue its legitimate economic interests in Taiwan with due regard to the sensitivities involved. China has agreed to regular consular talks and my government has agreed to discuss a possible consular agreement. I raised the case of Mr James Peng, and Li Peng, the Chinese Premier, undertook to pass on my concerns to the relevant authorities. The Premier assured me that China would respect all the freedoms of Hong Kong after 30 June as laid down in the Basic Law agreed by the UK and Chinese governments. Since my visit, China has agreed to my proposal for a human rights dialogue. We see such a dialogue as a constructive and potentially productive way of engaging China on this issue. Finally, I want to say something about the importance of the human ties that bind us with the countries of the region. I have already spoken of my visit to the High Commission in Singapore and the meeting with the alumni of Australian educational institutions. In Beijing I held a reception for Australian students in China and Chinese students of Australian studies. These were significant and very enjoyable parts of my program. The store of knowledge of Australia that these links constitute is hugely beneficial to Australia. The understanding of Australia that they generate-its qualities and values, its economic, intellectual and physical attributes-is quite invaluable. Likewise, the communities within Australia who trace their origins to Singapore and China playa significant role in our relationships with these countries. These communities have made an invaluable contribution to Australia. Their success in our country and the esteem in which we hold them are important measures of the sort of society we are and the sort of relationship we want with our neighbours. Might I also take the opportunity of recording my respect for the high quality of the Australian missions in the two countries that I visited. At every stage of my visit I received unqualified support and very high quality professional advice. In the very important discussions that I had with the Chinese leadership, I was very grateful to have an ambassador of the quality of Mr Ric Smith, who is the Australian ambassador in the People's Republic of China. It is a reminder that there remains within the Australian Public Service a very strong streak of high quality professionalism. The quality of the representation that the men and women of that calibre give to this country overseas is something of which I think all members of this House should remain conscious, and it is something that does this country very proud indeed. I present the following paper: Visit to Singapore and China-Ministerial Statement, 15 May 1997 Motion (by Dr Kemp) proposed: That the House take note of the paper. Motion (by Dr Kemp )-by leave-agreed to: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition speaking for a period not exceeding 17 minutes.",89
163,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The parliament rarely has an opportunity to discuss foreign policy matters or defence matters. We virtually only get the opportunity if we choose to raise these issues in private members' time or when we briefly debate ministerial statements from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and statements on visits by the Prime Minister. Unfortunately-and I do not particularly blame this government for this particular operation; it has become long standing over the last 20 years in parliament-in providing for the foreign affairs and the defence of the nation--one of the reasons this federal polity of ours was created-we rarely get an opportunity for serious discussion in the principal forum of the development of national policy. Therefore, we have to operate on a thin grill, and that thin grill comes most often, as I said, with statements on ministerial visits by the Prime Minister. The rather anodyne and unexceptional statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) conceals-I am not saying deliberately; nevertheless it conceals-something of a hiatus, if not to say crisis, in relationships between Australians and the nations and the region around us. In the case of China, a very poor relationship has developed over the course of the last six months or so. In fact, it could be said that this particular visit of the Prime Minister, which has been on the agenda for some considerable time, had a question mark over it as to whether or not it would take place at all. I strongly suspect that it was a decision taken by the Chinese leadership to set aside exception they had taken to some of the attitudes and actions of this government in order to clear the decks for the principal focus of their attention in international politics-the absorption over the next few months of the shortly to be former British colony of Hong Kong. Right around the globe over the course of the last few months the Chinese have been clearing the decks in their relationship with a number of countries where there have been points of disagreements in the recent past as they seek to focus on that matter alone. That is not to say that necessarily any of the problems that have been associated with those concerns have been set aside. The situation that confronted the Prime Minister is a very different situation from that which he confronted when he got into office. Had there been no events from the day of his election to the day of his visit to these two countries, he would have arrived in these two countries with no question marks over Australia's policy. He would have arrived in these two countries with a background, in respect of our relationship with China, of a massively burgeoning increase in the trade arrangements and a frequent set of ministerial contacts at foreign ministerial level, at prime ministerial level and at trade ministerial level-at any level, in fact, you would care to name. You would have found accompanying those visits between the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) or the Prime Minister and their equivalents in China frequent robust discussions on matters of human rights, on matters related to the situation in Tibet, on matters related to security arrangements in the region, on matters related to Australia's relationship with the United States and on matters related to Australia's attitudes to the Western alliance. Those discussions would have been held with no problems attached to them whatsoever. The fact that there was mutual agreement that there are matters that we would disagree on from time to time did not mean that the matters which we disagree on had to be set to one side or have a special process created for them. What you got was a situation where you could raise them, as most countries do, in a normal bilateral relationship between two countries and no special problem or special arrangement needed to be made for that. That is part and parcel of conducting your diplomacy on the basis of a free and independent nation with your own views on your strategic circumstances, your own views on your strategic needs, your own views on human rights or whatever, not one that is marshalled and incorporated within the lowest common denominator of what is capable of being sustained by both sides. That was not the situation that the Prime Minister walked into; the Prime Minister walked into a totally different situation. It was a totally different situation largely of a making of his own government, starting with a reneging on those DIFF contracts with China, followed by the belittling of the Chinese ministers who complained about what had happened with those DIFF arrangements, telling the Chinese then out of our largess that they might be able to secure one or two of these projects provided they renegotiated our aid arrangements with them, followed by speculating about uranium sales to Taiwan and then undisciplined babbling by the defence minister-when the foreign minister was trying to fix up some of the problems associated with this-about the nature of the Chinese threat and how the American alliance might be used to counter it. That was followed by a set of unexceptional arrangements being put in place with the Americans, arrangements that continued a deep and abiding relationship that we had in place and that we enjoyed with the United States, claiming new things that were in fact old or initiatives that had been started under the previous government as something new. That allowed an impression to be created out there in the general public and, more particularly, in the region around us that a new strategic partnership had started with the United States. We on this side of the House value our relationship with the United States. We value it personally. We value it as part of our nation's security. But we never felt the need to clothe the claim for it and rub people's noses in it because there was a more sophisticated attitude to the way in which you conducted a security dialogue with a region and with nations in the region who may have had some degree of sensitivity about it. From that followed a plethora of commentary from Chinese officials, including very senior Chinese officials, warning Australia that they would not tolerate for one minute a new pincer movement, as was being suggested by one of them, between the United States and Australia in relation to China and they would not tolerate for one minute in any sense from the Australian side that they were being contained. What you see in that process is this: a situation in which by overclaiming, by bumbling, by incompetence, by insult, the Australian government placing itself in a position where it could not discuss in strategic terms the principal partnership that we have with China. What an extraordinary thing to visit one of the major powers in the Pacific, probably the major power in the Pacific in the next 30 or 40 years, and have a curtain drawn over our relationship with the United States in any discussions with them because it was too embarrassing for us to mention and because of a bit of pressure there it was pushed quietly off the agenda. What sort of relationship do we have with the countries in the region? It reduced the Prime Minister's visit to a well-focused, state Premier's visit. I am not going to belittle the fact that there were achievements there on the economic front. If you see a Premier go to China or any other country in the region now, you will see them accompanied by a bevy of business people. You will see them arriving at trading agreements, trading arrangements. You will see the business interests of Australia advance. How else over the last 13 years did the trade between China and Australia increase exponentially in a nation which values very much government to government contact backing up the activity of the private sector? There are many state premiers who have done very well in that regard as they have presented themselves in China. As something the equivalent of that, so did the Prime Minister. He presented himself effectively in Beijing as a state Premier with Australia's considerable wares to lay on the Chinese table. But that is the job of a Premier. That is not the job of a Prime Minister. The job of a Prime Minister is to engage the major powers in this region across the board, across the board of all our strategic and security concerns, across the board of all the issues that we regard as morally important in the region, be they on human rights or anything else. It does not mean you march in and rub people's noses in it; it means that you raise it forthrightly in the sessions which you have. When you have those concerns, you raise them effectively. Above all, with China, we have to be able to discuss what we hold as important in security terms and why we have those concerns, why we have those views and why we have those relationships. We have to obviously do it in a sophisticated and effective manner, and to allow an impression to be engaged that we were somehow or other trying to put China into a position where we and the Americans were going to contain it was not the best introduction, I do have to say, to what ought to have been the sort of dialogue that we ought to have had. But, somehow or other, with the powerful relationship we had with the United States for 13 years, we managed it. We managed to hold discussions with the Chinese on major security issues; the Prime Minister did n'ot. The Prime Minister went there and obtained an agreement to consult on human rights issues and he touts that as favourable. I am afraid to say I cannot see it that way. I do not think every time you visit China you are going to be required to raise human rights issues. You raise them when you need to. If you do not need to, you do not bother. The notion that you need to have an automatic consultation of this incorporates you in a dialogue and restricts the capacity of other people to make those points, and that has been noted. Can you imagine what would happen if an Australian Prime Minister of the Labor Party came back from China and the leading communist party newspaper in China produced a set of comments like this-'Wise choice' the People's Daily said of Australia as we walked away from the United Nations resolution on human rights in Geneva. The Sydney Morning Herald reported the activities by saying: ""They are not willing to bind with the US,"" the Communist Party paper said. ""They are not willing to continuously act as a human willing to set up a pointless confrontation with developing countries. ""What they have done deserves praise."" ""The result shows that confrontation on human rights is also becoming unpopular in the Western world."" The response of the people in the United States to that Communist Party newspaper set of commentaries would be one of mild humiliation. If the Liberal Party had been in opposition and we had been in government, we would have been pasted all over the walls of this chamber for that particular set of commentaries. How the wheel has turned. But the wheel has turned for only one reason. When this government came back into office, it took a giant backward step. It handled its international affairs with complete incompetence-not just mild incompetence but complete incompetence-and the consequence of that is now worn by our principal ally. The humiliation is worn by our principal ally. The fact is that we have got ourselves into a situation which penalises not so much us any more. We have heen incorporated into a dialogue acceptable to China-a most important country-and taken out of a framework in which we, with our Chinese colleagues, can discuss what is most serious on our hearts about the security of the region. We are going to pay a price for that. That price is going to be a long time coming, but we will pay it. We will pay a price for that particular set of propositions. And, as I said, it was a completely unnecessary set of conclusions. We do have things to say to the Chinese about security matters. I think the ASEAN initiative in the ASEAN Regional Forum actually does operate in the best way, without going down the stale road of containment of setting up, in the informal sort of way the countries in the region like, for security dialogue. confidence building and functional integration. There is a lot to be done on that. Did the Prime Minister present any views on that to his Chinese interlocutors when he was in China? I doubt it. It is certainly not incorporated within the framework of his rights judge and not statement. But there is a lot of water flowing under the bridge in that particular area at the momenta lot of water. Good work is being done, and the Chinese are involved. Attitudes are being expressed by countries in the region as to what contribution could be made. We are part of that forum, but what is our view? What is our view on the security arrangements for this region? What view could have been presented to the Chinese interlocutors if we had not been frightened off the ground, frightened off the territory? Any government with the defence interests of its nation at hand would have presented that view, but we were frightened off from having a dialogue with one of the principal powers in the region, a power which will probably be the principal power in the region over the next 50 years. So we had a great premier's visit and a non-entity of a Prime Minister's visit in the course of that. It was a framework made available not by the Australian government on the importance and significance of the views of the Australian government, but by a sensible, tactical decision by the Chinese that they clear the decks in the intervening period from a few months ago to the point of time when Hong Kong comes back within China. It was not much of an achievement by the Prime Minister, and the problem is that I do not think the Prime Minister has the first idea of what these problems and concerns are. The Prime Minister went to Singapore and the Prime Minister made some very good comments both about our relationship with Singapore and about the building of those relationships with the students. We thank him for the comments he made, but the five-power defence arrangement and all those agreements in defence terms with Singapore were made by Senator Ray, by and large, and then briefly by myself when I happened to be in office. Mr Howard interjecting",92
164,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"No, the agreements with SingaporeMr Howard interjecting",96
165,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"You did mention air training in Australia didn't you, Prime Minister? Air training in Australia? Us. It was Senator Ray. But you do not know. The fivepower defence arrangements were substantially revived by us when we were in office. But the problem is this, and I will close on this. You mentioned the significance of the education connections, but remember this: your attitude to the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and to those particular issues are being tested in educational institutions, in particular, in the region, as it is in the media in the region. The simple fact of the matter is, Prime Minister, you are currently being found wanting. So if you want those greet contacts ') continue to be of value to Australia, it is up to you, old son, to do something about it. This was a visit on the defensive. A visit that reflected your government's incompetence. A visit that, in so far as it was success264,400 ful, was successful only as a result of grounds laid by your predecessors. Debate (on motion by Mr Downer) adjourned. NA Unemployed Australians",96
166,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to address in the budget the need to find jobs for the 802,300 unemployed Australians, including 246,400 long term unemployed. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",96
167,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise this afternoon to speak on an issue of major public importance and it goes to the question of what I would describe as a fairly important road show-the Mr WishyWashy and Mr Smug Road Show. I want to deal with the performance of that road show over the last 12 months and, more importantly, in the last couple of weeks. Because I tell you what: this road show in the last couple of weeks has gone out of its way to create certain expectations in the Australian community. One of the most important issues that the Australian community is looking for some leadership on at the moment-and the road show has even touched upon this issue in the last couple of weeks, especially in the media in regional Australia-is that all important question of jobs, the sense of job security. I suggest that an emerging major problem confronting Australia at the moment is not just the issue of youth unemployment but, importantly, the issue of rising unemployment amongst blue-collar middle-aged males. The problem with the road show goes to the failure, I suggest, of the government to address in its budget the need to find jobs for 802,300 unemployed Australians, including long-term unemployed Australians and, unfortunately, 90,000 young unemployed, who, even this week, have to confront cuts in expenditure on education and training, contrary to what the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) would have the House believe today. The 1997 hudget has failed to deliver. It has failed to deliver miserably to the Australian community on the issue of jobs and job security. It has failed to deliver to the battlers and their families. It has failed to deliver to the mob that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) likes to refer to from time to time. I suggest in passing that failure to deliver represents a continuation of trend with respect to the performance of this government since they were elected 12 months ago. They have failed to deliver to the Australian community on a range of matters. The real issue that the Australian community is looking for with respect to leadership at the moment is the issue of jobs-the question of some hope and security for the future of the Australian community. That is the No. 1 agenda item out there in mainstream Australia at the moment. What did the wishy-washy and smug road show say to the Australian community today? It was not a big tick about doing something to create jobs and a sense of security in people's lives. It was a big snub to the battlers. That is what it was: a huge snub to the Australian community about the issue of jobs and a sense of security and hope in life. I will tell you why it is worse-because, in the last couple of weeks, they finaIly got some feedback from the Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Robb, who has recently vacated the chair. One of his parting gestures was a message to the Prime Minister along these lines, 'Look,  ment, Senator Vanstone, is right' - you know, the senior minister of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training'when she basically suggested that, if we do not deliver on the jobs front' - and she has said it on a couple of occasions, much to the upset of the Prime Minister-'then you really do not have a right to be re-elected at the next federal election.' Mr Lee-She was even reprimanded.",96
168,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"-Yes, as the member for DobeIl said, she was even reprimanded by the party organisational structure and by a range of members on the front-bench. I suppose when it comes to a question of leadership, we should not be surprised that the Prime Minister has failed to deliver on the question of jobs and job security. As I have said, it represents a trend in government of the Howard government. You look around at the big issues-and budget night is about the big road show. The Australian community sits there and listens to the television and the radio. It is looking for direction. It is looking for the hard decisions. It is looking for a Prime Minister and a Treasurer to actually stand up with some commitment and say, 'We've got the answers and we are going to give it our best to do something and to deliver to you.' But you know, it is not just jobs and job security. Where has the government been, for example, on the issue of the Hanson debate? Where has the Prime Minister been? He has gone missing in action. Where has he been on the race debate? I will tell you where the Prime Minister has been. He has gone missing in action. Where has he been on the all important question of industry policy? Again, missing in action. Where has he been on the issue of regional Australia-the question of Cairns, Ballarat, Bendigo, all those important regions which are experiencing great difficulties with respect to unemployment and social dislocation at the moment? Where was he on industry policy in regional Australia? Gone missing in action. Even on the question of women and their capacity to take their rightful place in the Australian work force and the issue of access to child care, where was the Prime Minister? Unfortunately, missing in action again. He might like to go over to China and sell out on the question of human rights and come back to Australia and suggest that that is a big achievement but, I tell you what, the Australian community at the moment is concerned about bread and butter issues, the issues of jobs and job security. I suppose leadership does require a bit of stature, a Willingness to make hard decisions-not intellectual pygmies who go missing in action when the hard decisions come around, but people who are prepared to layout a plan and basicallv. in essence, put their heads down and tails UI. and get on with the job of doing something to create that environment that encourages investment and confidence, which in tum leads to jobs and real job creation in Australia. I suppose budget night is about lots of lights, dazzle, big numbers and big speeches. We even had the Treasurer (Mr Costello) dancing around-a bit like some have suggested before, the loaded dog, at the dispatch box last Tuesday night-tongue hanging out one comer of the mouth, the make-up on and the stick of dynamite hanging out of the other side of the mouth. He was prancing around because, unfortunately, the Speaker was a little bit late and he wanted to spit out this great picture about where Australia is going on the issues of jobs and job security. All of a sudden he rises to his feet: 'Here I am to tell Australia about how fortunate they are_ Firstly, they have got me'---the loaded dog'as the Treasurer of Australia. But I am going to tell you about your future this evening.' So he starts off at page 2: 'These are the key issues, helping families' --well, I think jobs and job security are important to families-'boosting small business, creating jobs'-the third point on page 2-'and encouraging saving.' We sat here. We have looked at all the regional press and the stories-all the expectations that have been created in the last couple of weeks. I recall that that was the same day that the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the long-term unemployment figures and the figures relating to unemployment in regional Australia. Just over a month ago I did have cause to look at these regional unemployment figures. In question time some months ago the Prime Minister said to me that after 12 months of a coalition government I would have the right to ask him a question about unemployment. So I waited for that 12 months to lapse-I am a very patient man--and what did those figures say about regional unemployment? They said 77 per ccnt of regional Australia is worse off on the unemployment front a- a result of the first year, one-third of the normal life of a parliament if it runs its full (erm, the Howard government. Since those figures came out the message has been spelled out by Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug Road Show all around Australia, backed up by Dr Do-Little, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. He does very little for jobs, very little for universities, very little for equality of access to education. I think he is concerned with only one issue at the moment: Dr Do-Little feels he should be sitting at the cabinet table rather than his senior minister. Today the Prime Minister wanted to talk about the reaction of some of the business community. I listened to his long list of friends, but there are other commentatorssuch as Katie Lahey, who is only the Chief Executive Officer of the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce. It is appropriate we quote what she said about the budget because it is fairly relevant to the issue of unemployment: There were no real initiatives (in the budget) to help business soak up the unemployed, which is a concern. [ agree with her. She even did a survey of members of the New South Wales chamber. And what did that survey say? It said-and this is factual-that 76 per cent of members surveyed by the New South Wales chamber believe that the budget would not create jobs. That is what the business community believes. Then I go to Access Economics-friends of the coalition, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and frequent advisers who do detailed work in the preparation of coalition policies. What did they say today? It is reported in the media that they have suggested-and I believe this is also the view of the Research Bank Governor and the Secretary to the Treasury, as spelt out last week; unfortunately, the minister for employment did not know the difference between the two when questioned last week--that economic growth of 3.75 per cent would lead to an unemployment rate above 8.25 per cent. That is what Mr Richardson of Access Economics said this mornIng. Anyhow, the road show has gone on, and unfortunately the reviews have not been too of good. The critics have been looking at the budget, including the Treasurer of Queensland, Mrs Sheldon, and the Liberal Party leader, who have also canned the budget on the unemployment front. The problem is that, when the reviews to go bad-and we understand some of the and direction. critics get a little bit bitchy at times-the main players, Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr face Smug, go around backdooring one another. That is what is happening in the gallery at moment. Mr Smug is up there saying, 'Look, if I had had my way it would have been better road show. But, unfortunately, Mr Wishy-Washy was interfering. It is also his budget. If I had had my way, we probably would not have even mentioned the issue of unemployment in the budget because that is not a real priority.' So at the end of the show we are going to have to live with the bitchiness between the road show main players, Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug. It might be appropriate for them to play their little games, but it is time we faced up to the fact that $21 million on the work for the dole scheme, with its couple of days. 10,000 places and people working two days on and then having five days off, will not produce the goods. It is about time we faced up to the fact that the Federation Fund billion-with funding to commence not this year (I wonder why it will not commence year) but in 1998-99, stretching out to 2001; and it will be interesting to see the porkACro, barrelling that occurs under the Federation Fund-will not produce the goods either; nor will the government's savings policy, that great rip-off that is occurring with the bench of the government looking after itself, produce the goods. It is about time we faced up to the fact that after 12 months this government has failed the unemployment front. Unemployment is higher. Youth unemployment is higher. understand why there is some sensitivity the other side of the House: because it is accepted in the Australian community that those so-called battlers that the Prime Minister was going to do so much for have been forgotten-forgotten on the savings front forgotten on the unemployment front. What is the real problem confronting middle-aged male battlers now? The real problem is that there is little hope for them or their families on the unemployment front as a result of this budget. There are 146,000 men between the start ages of 35 and 45 who are looking for work The time has come for this government to up to the fact that it has got to stop and think about what it is not doing. What it is the not doing at the moment is delivering on the issue of jobs, delivering on the issue of job a security, delivering on the need to get om young people back to work and delivering on the need to get out there in middle Australia, amongst those middle-aged men who want to look after their families, and ensure that we create a sense of hope and security for their future. That is the challenge for Dr Do-Little and for Mr Wishy-Washy and Mr Smug Road Show. When it comes to performance, after all the expectations of the last couple of about weeks the critics are going to be just as negative as they have been over the last",97
169,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Minister for Fiof $1 nance for Privatisation) (4.14 p.m.)-If anyone were listening to the speech we have this just heard from the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), the ex-president of the one of the architects of Australia's unemployment, they would be deeply disillusioned if they ever had any illusions about the Labor Party. What we have heard is pathetic frontempty rhetoric from the architects of the deeply entrenched unemployment that Australia now has. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on recently moved the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) from his portfolio because he I was not making any impact. I suppose any on person hearing this debate would wonder how now long it is going to be before the member for Batman is moved from his portfolio. They might remember, I suppose, that he is an expresident of the ACTU. We know that exand presidents of the ACro are untouchable within the Labor Party because it is the ACro who pays the bills and calls the tune. It is worth remembering, when we hear this pathetic performance today, that this is nothing new from the member for Batman. When he was President of the ACTU, some 600,000 trade union members actually walked out of the trade union movement, which would have to be the most abysmal performance of the century by any ACTU president. But of course the ACTU have absolutely no credibility on employment because they were the people pulling the strings throughout the whole period when the previous Labor government was creating the problem that this present government is fixing. For 13 years they implemented their policies. The result of those policies was a million unemployed, unemployment over II per cent, the worse unemployment since the Great Depression. They had absolutely no answers whatsoever to the question of how you create jobs for Australians. In fact every policy they pursued-to pursue the narrow sectional interests of this trade union based party-made unemployment worse, because the trade unions in the end under the member for Batman were not interested in creating jobs; they were interested in trying to hold on to their rapidly diminishing membership, and their policies showed that. Over the last six years of the Labor government, as the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in question time today, the Labor Party succeeded in creating 16,000 additional new full-time jobs. Mr Bruce Scott-How many?",99
170,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Sixteen thousand additional new full-time jobs in the last six years of government. A million people were unemployed and they created 16,000 full-time jobs. That is their performance. And they seriously expect the Australian people to listen to this empty rhetoric and imagine that they have got any credibility whatsoever on the issue of unemployment. It took them 13 years to drive Australia down into the condition that it is in at the moment. That is not going to be fixed in 13 months, and every Australian knows that. Let us just have a look at why Labor failed so badly, bccause we certainly heard nothing today which would give anyone any impression that the Labor Party have a policy to deal with unemployment. They have no policy to create jobs. They have not got one now. Not one was articulated by the member for Batman and not one was put in place over their 13 years in government. Let us look at the reasons for their failure. I suppose if you went to the core of their failure and asked why the unemployment situation is as bad as it is in this country, you would find that it is because for 13 years the Labor Party, manipulated by the ACTU, trampled right over small business. With the highest interest rates in the world, they drove tens of thousands of small businesses in Australia into bankruptcy. During their last major recession, they destroyed some 300,000 jobs in small business. And then, just in case that was not enough, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), sitting here at the table, the architect of the unfair dismissal law, went out and told small businesses that no matter how unsatisfactory any of their employees were the government was going to make it almost impossible for them to dismiss them and give a full-time job to somebody who could do the job. Sitting at the table today are the two great job destroyers in this country. We have had to take the necessary action to get rid of their laws, to get rid of their job destroying policies, and that is what we have been about. When you get down to the economic fundamentals, you will not create the jobs we need in this country when Australians are not encouraged to save. The greatest dis-saver in their this country for the last 13 years of Labor government, and particularly for the last six years, the years of the Keating-ACTU government, was the Commonwealth government. They had $75 billion of accumulated deficits. They were spending money they did not have, after they had put up taxes and after they had ripped off small business in budget after budget. They put in place the most complex tax laws this country had ever had. Between 1983 and 1994 the tax act tripled in size from 1,300 pages to 3,792 pages. The compliance costs for company tax equalled 22 per cent of the total revenue they got from company tax. It was so expensive for business to comply with the tax laws the government had put in place. The fringe benefits tax was a nightmare. The act was 300-pages long. How was small business supposed to cope with that? New Zealand had 50 pages. But, no, the Labor Party needed 300 pages. The capital gains tax compliance costs were also burdening small business. On top of all that, you could not stop Paul Keating spending. When the present Leader of the Opposition, the weak Leader of the Opposition, was the Minister for Finance, Paul Keating as Prime Minister trampled right over the top of him and spent up very big indeed-$75 billion worth of deficits-and ran Australia into a huge debt. They were the job destroying policies that this government is now coping with. On top of that, of course, Labor completely failed to respond to the changes that were affecting young people in particular-the huge changes taking place in the youth labour market. Between 1983 and 1996, there was a disappearance right across Australian industry of the unskilled jobs that young Australians dropping out of school early used to get. They let the apprenticeship system die on its feet, because the trade union movement of course liked all those complexities. They were not going to interfere with the apprenticeship system. They were just going to leave it there to die. Consequently, in 1995, the last year of Labor Party in government, the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. At the end of 13 years of Labor, 30 per cent of 14 yearolds in this country could not read properly, and that is why small business was finding it so difficult to give these young people jobs. They did not have the literacy skills. They not have the numeracy skills. They could not work the cash registers. What happened to vocational education and training? Almost nothing was done on it. Nothing was done in schools over the 13 years of the Labor Party government. Vocational education and training went down the drain. In the first tcrm of the Howard government, we are spending on vocational education and training in schools almost four times the amount that Labor spent over its entire 13 years in government. What was their answer to the problems of young Australians? To pour money into massive, expensive shortterm training programs that did not lead to real jobs. They demoralised the young people of this country. In the last year of the Labor government, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) spent $500 million on his new scheme. It had a four per cent success rate. He bought jobs at the cost of $143,000 a job, almost bankrupting the country. And the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) says, 'Let's go back to Working Nation. That's what we need for Australia's young people.' Let me say that this government has a commitment to provide young Australians with quality training. The saddest thing I suppose-I cannot resist pointing this out-is that if you go around this country and you ask where the biggest problems are they are in Labor Party electorates. Go into the Labor Party electorates in the cities and what used to be the Labor Party electorates in the regions and ask: what did the members do for their constituents over the 13 years they were in power? Some parts of these electorates look like war zones. What did they do in 13 years? There are some people who are unkind enough to suggest that the Labor Party deliberately likes the to keep its supporters struggling, because it thinks it can scare them into welfare dependence and then it will tax the rest of the community to provide the benefits and frighten them that the coalition is going to take away all their welfare benefits. It likes its supporters to be poor. Of course, its supporters have realised that, and that is why they turned against the Labor Party in droves. They know did that, unless you have a government with the leadership, the courage and the understanding to address the fundamentals, you will never redress these problems. The first job of the coalition has been to repair the budget, to put an end to the massive spending which destroyed savings and investment in this country. For the second time in a row, in this budget, there was no increase in income tax, no increase in company tax, no increase in wholesale sales tax and no increase in petrol excise. In fact, there were tax reductions. What a different story to the Keating budgets year after year, pumping up taxes and destroying jobs! Secondly, this government got rid of Laurie Brereton's unfair dismissals law. We will begin to see the effects of that over the coming months as the benefits of our new law, our fair legislation, come through. Thirdly, we have reformed the tax system. We have simplified the fringe benefits tax. We have introduced the major reform of the capital gains tax rollover provisions which will be tremendously beneficial to many small businesses as they roll over their funds from one business into another, like business or unlike business-a major benefit to small businesses. Fourthly, we have put into place major improvements to education and training opportunities for young people, not the shortterm programs that lead nowhere-so beloved by the member for Batman and his cohorts on that side of the House-but real, decent, quality education that will give young people the basis on which they will get real jobs. The first national literacy plan in the history of this country has been put in place, and every child in this country in grades 3 and 5 will be tested against those national standards. For the first time, we have got commitments to have a look at the literacy level of every child when they come into school and to make the resources available to give those children the skills they need. For the first time in this country's history, we will have, under the policies of this government, a national apprenticeship system. This budget provides funding for over 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in the coming year. This government has committed itself to $187 million to expand vocational education and training in schools and to make sure, for the first time, that students have the opportunity to get industry recognised and accredited skills in schools that will lead them on to jobs. We want to give to those students who are dropping out of school something to keep them in school, something relevant-that they can see is relevant-that will help them move from school into employment. Fifthly, we are putting into place a sensible work for the dole scheme. It is not a scheme that is going to manipulate the statistics. That is what that $500 million of the member for Hotham was all about. One effect it had was to redefine the long-term unemployed as short-term unemployed. That is the difference: we are putting into place solid policies. (Time expired).",100
171,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is not coincidental that two days after the budget was presented the opposition raises as a matter of public importance the question of unemployment. We raise that question because we believe that employment and unemployment are important issues. We believe that they are not only important economic issues but also important social issues. We just heard a great deal of rhetoric, which we have become accustomed to, from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). He has developed a reputation over the years for fudging the figures. His presentation in response to the shadow minister for employment and training, the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), was another good indication of the way in which the figures can be fudged. After this government's first 12 monthsone-third of the way through the term of this government-he was referring to what they are going to do about apprenticeships. The number of apprenticeships in Australia at present compared with 12 months ago when this government came into office is lower, and the number of traineeships in Australia is lower. These are the sorts of opportunities that the minister and his colleagues on that front-bench, together with their supporters on the backbench, are providing for young Australians. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and aU members of this parliament and all members of this national community heard in the lead-up to the last election these same people talk about the creation of real jobs. They said that they would cut out the programs-and they didcut out the traineeships and cut out aU of those market programs that were so important to tens of thousands of Australians and replace them with real jobs. Well, have they indeed! Mr Fitzgibbon-Just like at BHP in Newcastle!",102
172,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In the last 12 months-in the first third of the first term (and the last term) of this present government-34,000 more people are unemployed. In March 1997, there were 34,000 more people in Australia unemployed than there were in March 1996, when that government came to power. As well, there are 14,000 more in the ranks of the long-term unemployed. So in both of these areas, whatever the rhetoric, whatever the fudged figures from the minister or members of the coalition, the Australian people want to keep in mind exactly what the first 12 months of this government has meant to them. The budget that was handed down a couple of days ago should have made the question of what this government is going to do to address the problem of unemployment one of its central planks-and it did nothing. Responsible, informed and competent commentators have also indicated that as far as unemployment is concerned the budget offers nothing. When the Labor Party came to government in 1983, unemployment in Australia was almost 11 per cent. When we left government, it was below 8Y2 per cent and was edging down. We made as our target a level of five per cent by the end of this decade. After the budget was presented, the commentators indicated quite clearly that the figures that were being presented by the government in connection with the budget were fudged. When they spoke about unemployment coming down to eight per cent at the end of this next 12 months, the commentators said, 'No, it will not.' The growth figure that they projected is recognised as being insufficient to bring their 8.7 per cent unemployment down to eight per cent over this next 12 months. The good doctor, Dr Kemp, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, who just responded to the shadow minister for employment and training, has the responsibility in this chamber for representing his senior minister--I think the position should be reversed-from the Senate. My colleague the member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) referred just a short time ago, by way of a very constructive and useful interjection, to the fact that what we should be doing is referring to the situation which has developed in our area-in the area of the member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and the  Newcastle. Let me do so. At the end of March, in the Hunter region as a whole, the unemployment rate was 12 per cent. It was up 2.5 per cent in the previous three months. The number unemployed in the Hunter region was 31,000. That had increased by 7,000 in the previous three months. The participation rate in the Hunter was 61 per cent-one of the lowest in Australia. We might ask ourselves: why were people in the Hunter, unlike people in many other areas of Australia, including those on the lower North Shore, giving up on the prospect of getting a job? Why were they opting out in disillusionment, frustration and despair? Why were they giving up the struggle to find a job? They are giving up the struggle because there are no jobs there. If the same proportion of those people who could be in the labour force in the Hunter were looking for jobs as are looking for jobs in the lower North Shore, then there would not be just 31,000 people identified as unemployed in the Hunter; there would be over 60,000. The unemployment rate-which is officially 12 per cent in the Hunter-would be not 12 per cent but 21 per cent. Mr Fitzgibbon-He should resign!",103
173,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is a question of the operation of the participation rate. Again, my colleague and friend the member for Hunter has been sufficiently helpful to suggest to me and, through me, to the minister that the minister should resign. If he is prepared to accept any responsibility at all for these figures, he should resign. Mr Laurie Ferguson-What about Vanstone?",103
174,Mr ROBERT BROWN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He could take Vanstone with him. In fact, it might be better if Vanstone went first. We in the Labor Party believe that when the market mechanism breaks down the responsibility of governments and public policy is to put into place programs that will compensate for that market breakdown. That has not happened as far as the government is concerned. In fact, in the face of the decision that was made by BHP just recently to withdraw from primary steel making in Newcastle, the response of the Prime Minister was, 'I'll listen to anyone. They can come to me with their submissions. But I will not intervene.' Further than that, the Prime Minister also said that he will visit Newcastle, in effect, to recharge their batteries. He has not had an opportunity, as I am reminded by Laurie Ferguson, Martin's brother, also a member of the Ferguson family which has made more contribution to the welfare of workers in this country than any thousand of the present ministers. The number of people who will now, as a result of that decision by BHP, find themselves unemployed is 2,500 directly in BHP and, of course, the flow-on effect will mean there will be somewhere between 6,000 and 12,000 people in the Hunter region who will be unemployed as a result of that. We are not just talking about 2,500 people losing their jobs; we are talking about 2,500 families. Overnight, when the decision was made by BHP to withdraw from Newcastle, the total share value of BHP increased by $1 billion. Where did that value come from? It came out of the pay envelopes and off the dinner tables of those 2,500 employees of BHP who will lose their jobs. It came, as well, out of 6,000 to 12,000 other individuals and families in the Hunter Valley who are going to be placed in a similar situation. I was talking as well about the breakdown of the market. This is what happened to those people in Newcastle. In 1983, the output per worker in Newcastle was about 160 tonnes per employee. They were told then that what they needed to do was to achieve an output of 500 tonnes. They achieved it and surpassed it, and it is now over 600 tonnes per employee. But they were told then it had to reach 1,000. In the face of that, BHP announced its withdrawal and this government sat on its hands. (Time expired)",103
175,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think their time expired a long time ago. The MPI this afternoon, the debate we have had on work for the dole, proves one thing beyond a shadow of a doubt: that this Labor opposition is totally bereft of any fresh ideas, of any approach to the unemployment problem or to any of the difficulties they left this nation with after 13 years of Labor's failures. Thirteen years of Labor failures, and we hear the same rubbish and rhetoric in here this afternoon as we sit through an MPI on work for the dole. What is Labor's answer? Labor's answer is very simple: let us create a big government, the bigger the better. Then let us make big promises, wrap them in all sorts of goodies. Then let us tax big as well. So we tax big; we have big governments; we spend big. We make big promises and we deliver nothing. The next big thing we do is we go out there and whip the media into a frenzy. We come out with all the rhetoric we can come up with to hide the truth. What is the truth? The truth is you failed the Australian people for 13 years, and if you had your way you would continue to fail them for the next 13 years. But they saw the light. They saw the fact that you did not have the answers, and you have proved that again today. Mr Adams-Your budget.",104
176,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We will come to the budget. Don't let that worry you. One of their answers was the One Nation statement. It sounds a bit like the one notion statement, or the one notion party. We are starting to see these terms reiterated in other forms in this place. They spent some $12Y2 billion. That is pretty typical of the Labor Party: tax the workers, tax business, get this big bucket of money and then just throw it at the problem and hope that the problem will be washed away. The only thing that was washed away was the hopes and aspirations of the average Australian person out there who was put onto a merry-go-round of training programs. Those training programs did create some things; they created the illusion that unemployment was coming down. The Two Billion Dollar Man, Simon Crean, who overspent in the last 12 months in labour market programs, put people into programs that were never going to create a real job for them. He built their aspirations up and then pulled the carpet out from underneath them. That is what he did. In doing so, he artificially deflated the real unemployment problem. Let us go back to the election of 1996 and remember what the public told us out there. 'We know the unemployment problem is much worse than the people in the government of the day are telling us, but they do not want to admit the problem.' This government has faced up to the reality. We do not hide people in short-term, worthless, fruitless programs like you did. We now subscribe to a program where labour market programs have real outcomes. New work opportunities: now there is another great little piece. As the minister said earlier, the real net impact was four per cent. Four out of every 100 people who undertook a new work opportunities program achieved a job that would not have been created otherwise. That is a cost of $143,000 per person. I would say that perhaps even the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) would be able to find a few jobs for people if someone put $143,000 per job into his pocket. But all he was able to do as the ACTO President was lose those jobs. He was very good at that. So let us just look at the budget on Tuesday night. What it did was not throw a bucket of money at this problem and hope that it would go away. We did not try to cloak it in minors and smoke. What we did was go to the actual structural problems that this country was left with after 13 years of Labor. Now I do not expect you to believe me. So let us look at the comments-some of which the Prime Minister has already stated today-from different industry groups. The Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said: Mr Adams-He never voted Labor.",104
177,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, he has got some brains if he never voted Labor. You have to give him some credit for that. He said: This is a good Budget which will go a long way towards restoring growth and lowering unemployment. We then have the National Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures who said: The creation of Small Business Innovation Fund, and the relaxation of the tax mles applying to family tmsts are good news for small business. Small business-that is something you would not know too much about-the single biggest employer in this country, and here they are saying that what was in the budget was good for them and good for employment, which is good for the unemployed people of Australia whom you left as a legacy of your 13 years. Let us keep going. The Managing Director of the Housing Industry Association said: The federal budget addresses Australia's twin problems of jobs and low national savingsAddressed! That is unemployment addressed again. The Master Builders of Australia said: The Government ... is commended for pursuing jobs growth as one of its main policy priorities. It really does beg the question why we are standing up here today trying to make sense of what is an inadequate opposition talking about the failure of the budget to address unemployment when the very people who have to create the real jobs in this country are telling us what it will do for them. The Institute of Chartered Accountants said-and honourable members opposite should listen to this one: ... by not imposing any additional charges on businesssomething members opposite were good atby quarantining industry assistance and maintaining the 125% Research and Development program, the Government has shown it is prepared to give business a chance to grow andwait for itcreate more jobs. Finally, tourism--one of the biggest emploY-T industries in Australia-said: This Federal Government support will be directly translated into new jobs and is clear recognition, along with other Federal Budget tourism initiatives that the Government is acknowledging tourism as a key element in Australia's economic growth. The one comment that really shows the difference between us as a progressive Liberal government concerned about people and you the Labor opposition, is this quote again from the Australian Hotels Association: ... much-needed boost for the tourism industry after the debacle of New South Wales Government's 10% bed tax. This is a job destroying tax-high taxing, high spending, big government. There it is again; state, local and federal-you cannot get away from it. That is all that you have ever been good at. Let us have a look at some of the programs. In my own electorate of Longman, which is a beautiful part of the world, we have gone a long way towards working with the community to address the problem of unemployment. No longer do we shove the unemployed into short-term programs, hope that no-one sees them and that they are forgotten. We having the community work with them. The Caboolture area schools industry links scheme-CASTLES as it is known-which is part of the school-to-work program has been successful throughout Australia in a number of locations, including Labor strongholds such as Port Adelaide. Here we have business working with schools to ensure that young people have every opportunity from the very start to get into the workplace. They understand what work is about and, more importantly, business also starts to understand the young person. That is a great initiative involves the community. The Marsden school has picked up on the pathways program. have almost completed their first stages which have been wonderfully successful. Approximately 150 young people deserted by Labor were picked up through an innovative program. Let us face it-your programs did not work. All you have said today is, 'Let's have of the same.' It looks good in the press. It looks good on the front pages of the paper'X billion spent on One Nation.' Mr Hatton-Working Nation.",105
178,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"One Nation, Working Nation-they are all going to go down the same tube, quite frankly. They will be forgotten by the nation as failures. The structural differences between us in the Liberal Party and you in Labor are quite distinct. This government rejects big government. It rejects the big taxing and big spending mentality that you are renowned for at every level. We in this budget have addressed the underlying problems created by you the Labor Party, that is, the high deficit of $75 billion in the last 6 years and record low national savings and household savings. We have introduced practical industrial relations laws. We have removed your unfair dismissal laws. We now have low sustainable inflation and low interest rates. This Howard government is about letting business get on with creating real jobs for the Australians who were deserted by Labor so that Australia can prosper once again.",106

184,Mr ANDREN,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"In the debate just finished on the matter of public importance, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, told the House that we have deep, entrenched unemployment. It is entrenched, I would suggest, by economic policies that are not working particularly to the benefit of those who do not happen to be shareholders and do not happen to be part of that sector of the economy that is doing particularly well. In that downsized economy, where thousands of jobs have been shed, these people are victims of a policy of four per cent growth. For the first time in our history, it is non-jobs growth. That is certainly not a situation peculiar to Australia. Let's not blame the unemployed for their own fate. Let's encourage them to be creative with this work for the dole project. Let's not marginalise them even further by referring to 'these people' whom 'this community' expects to participate, because these people are very much part-as I said earlier-of this community. Let's get creative and look at something like the Alberta welfare reforms. I would urge the government to take a look at these. Mike Cardinal, MLA for that particular province in Canada, came up with this scheme in 1991. He later became the Minister of Alberta Family and Social Services and immediately set out to reform the entire welfare system. His philosophy was that people wanted to work; any job was a good job. Training was the key. That is something that is noticeably absent from this work for the dole project, despite the very strong suggestion from the Prime Minister on the day he announced it-in the way I referred to earlier: off the hip, not very confident about it-he did say, or strongly suggested, that there would be a training component. In 1995-96, due to the Alberta Community Employment program, 67 per cent of welfare recipients no longer depended on welfare one year after completing the ACE program. In 1995-96, under the Alberta Job Corps program, 78 per cent of welfare clients no longer depended on welfare one year after completing the program. Again, in 1995-96, under the Employment Skills Program, 70 per cent of welfare clients no longer received welfare one year after completing the program. I wonder whether these initiatives in Canada have been carefully studied. If so, why aren't some of the components of that highly successful program included in this program which, I believe, offers very little? Youth groups associated with this program say in their submissions to the minister that to talk about compulsion is entirely counterproductive. The Australian Youth Action Coalition is not supportive of the concept, especially the compulsory participation. The Brotherhood of St Laurence do not support the scheme if participation is compulsory. The Catholic Social Welfare Commission says that the scheme should not be compulsory. The Council of Social Service is not supportive of compulsion. The Salvation Army has similar views to the above. Compulsion is the thing that should not be part of this scheme if it is going to be acceptable in any way to the community. There are thousands of people out there who would line up for a scheme if it was creatively formatted. What we need is training. As I said, there is no sign of it. We need a complete review of our economic strategy in this country. Again, the government might refer to the comments of Dr Michael Crawford, a leading management consultant, who, in a circular late last year, said: Australia's conventional economic wisdom is well overdue for some reality checking. The experiences of the last forty years do not support the economic theories followed by recent governments, including the current one. Until those economic theories are scrapped, Australia's economic performance will be abysmal, with low growth and high unemployment. He goes on to say: . . . until the government introduces some very different economic policies, plan on 8%-9% unemployment to go with 3%-4% inflation ... While we have been reducing tariff protection against imports, we have been providing subsidies to exports ... This is now beset with problems ... Reduction of those subsidies will inevitably curtail the growth of our exports, increasing the need to limit imports share. He finishes up by saying: So, given the international trade policies successive governmentsthis and the previous oneany approximation to a reasonable balance of payments can only be achieved if Australia retains, and even increases, its unemployment rate. That is the sort of problem that is giving us this deep and entrenched unemployment to which the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) refers. He, at best, can blame the former government but he is not coming up with anything that is substantially creative enough in soaking up those people who cannot be part of that increased prosperity and growth that we are supposed to be enjoying. The outcome from this program need not be a job. There has been too much focus on the outcome being a job at the end of it. The jobs are not there. We need to have people feeling that they belong, we need them to be skilled at the end of it and we have to have a healing of the 'them and us' divide which is creating a huge social problem in this country. It is tearing away at the fabric of our society. It is creating the attitudes that have led to the formation of the party of my colleague who sits next to me. I cannot believe that people, when they get laid off from Newcastle, might not be tempted to march down the road to sign up for those movements with no answer to our problems. Certainly, the sorts of questions they are asking are the sorts of questions they are hearing nowhere else. That is the danger, unless we create a program in this country to soak up the 30 per cent of kids who have not got work out there. Ten thousand work for the dole positions will not do it. There is no training there and nothing worthwhile. And all we can do is blame them for their position. This is bankrupt of any morality, and both sides of politics can sit and argue all they like, but they have got to get their heads together and come up with something that has real guts that people can believe in or we are going to see a continuation of this sort of movement and we are going to rue the day we did not address the basic problems that created this.

185,Mrs GALLUS,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Hindmarsh) (5.04 p.m.)pursued by The member for Cal are (Mr Andren) is obviously sincere in what he says, and perhaps his plea for both sides of politics to get together to address the unemployment problem is a genuine one. It also may be a good one, because unemployment is this country's major problem as it comes into the year 2000 and the next century. The figures as they are today-8.7 per cent-are enough to shame any government. But, unfortunately, Australia does not face this problem of high unemployment alone. It is endemic around the worldparticularly in Europe. At the same time, I note that the US has a current unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent, and I will refer to that later. In opening, may I say that I support work for the dole, and I always have. When I first came to this parliament, one of the first things I did was ask David Connolly, who was then the shadow minister for social security, why we could not have a work for the dole program. His reply was that it was too exp-nsive. The costing had been done, and he dId not the lk it was worthy of the expense. I had been a strong supporter because, prior to entering parliament, I had worked for the South Australian Health Commission. I am a psychologist by training, but most of my work has been in research. I did a needs study of an area that later became the seat of Hawker-later to be abolished. As part of that needs study, I concentrated on youth. The study was divided into several parts, and one of them was looking at the needs of youth in the area. We looked at all sorts of things to do with youth-dmg taking, health needs-but the big problem, even then, was unemployment. I remember I was invited one day by a youth worker to come to see some of the kids who hung out on a vacant lot near Westfield shopping centre. I met him, and he took me to meet these kids. A rougher bunch of kids you would have a hard job finding. The smell that was hanging around the trees where they were sitting was quite unmistakable, and they were happilyor perhaps I should say 'unhappily'-sitting there, smoking marijuana and looking extremely tough. I sat down and talked to them for quite some time. I asked them what I, as somebody who was doing a needs survey, could do for them, and they said, 'Find us jobs.' That was general amongst these kids, who were, as I said, the tougher looking kids. They were the sorts of kids that you would try to avoid if you went down the street, because you would wonder what was in their mind. In fact, all that was in their mind was a job. At that time. I thought that, if they did not have a job, at least working for the dole would give them something to do with their day and would get them out of what happens to you when you become long-term unemployed. That was also part of the study that I did-looking at the effects of health on the long-term unemployed. You probably would be aware of the vicious circle that being unemployed engenders: your self-esteem goes down and depression comes on; the lower your self-esteem, the greater the depression, the less appealing you are to a potential employer and the less likely you are to get a job. The cycle goes spiralling down and usually ends with people having serious health defects. We also know that it can end in young people committing suicide because of the general lack of hope that they have and the state of their life cycle. Just the ability to get out and meet other people makes a tremendous difference to that. It can lift people's spirits no end to be out there doing something and achieving something and to feel that, at the end of the day, they have done a good day's work. The member for  disliked the term. He commented that it was an overwhelmingly pejorative term. I do not see it as that; I see it as what it is. I suspect that the member for Bradfield (Dr Nelson) agreed with him because he suggested that we change the name. Work for the dole is what it is and we should not be ashamed of that there is nothing to be ashamed of. It provides an outlet for young people who are unemployed and have nowhere else to go. The minister for education made it clear that this is not an employment program. It is not a substitute for employment; it is what it says it is-simply working for the dole. In that I think it can do a lot of good because it can provide somewhere for young people to go, young people who really get tied up with staying at home and with the absolute tearing apart that goes on after they apply day after day for jobs and do not get an answer. In the end they really do stop applying. I would like to give my full support to this program, while acknowledging that it is not an answer to what is now Australia's major problem. The problem, as I have said, is endemic in Europe, as weB as in Australia, although it is interesting to note that the UK's unemployment rate has come down-I think mostly because they have very much foBowed the path of the United States. Also, the Netherlands are doing some interesting things inasmuch as they are looking at various countries to see what is working. I say to the member for Cal are that I am not aware of the program in Alberta, and I certainly would be interested to look it up. However, I would ask him whether the figures he gave us were self-selected figures, that is, were the people selected the ones most likely to benefit or were the people randomly selected? If it was the latter, then they are very impressive results indeed, and I would be interested to look at them. Last week the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia appeared before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration and was questioned quite closely about unemployment and what he saw as the future. The governor made it very clear that he divided it into two areas: growth in GDP and structural growth. He said that he could not see growth in GDP bringing a decrease in unemployment of more than perhaps 2.7 per cent. He was talking about good sustained growth to the end of the century. He said that, if we really want to bring down our unemployment rate, we have to look to structural adjustment. Of course, in that he meant greater flexibility in the workplace. This government is aiming to bring about flexibility so that the workers and those who are supplying the jobs can better fit together and not be constrained by outmoded rules and regulations that make people fit into a system designed a long time ago. We have to free it up. I would hope that the Governor of the Reserve Bank was not suggesting that we would go totally down the American road, although, when you look at the American statistics. you will see that they are extremely impressive. In about the 1980s our unemployment rate was about six per cent and theirs was 7.2 per cent. They are now down to 4.9 per cent and we are up to 8.7 per cent. While their unemployment rate has gone down, ours has increased. The OECD has put that this is a result of greater flexibility in the US market. But I believe that market has extreme flexibility, and it has come at a great cost. If you have a look at the prison population in the US, you will find that, since 1980, it has actually tripled. I believe the figure is something like 379 per 100,000. In Australia in the same period it has gone from something like 68 to 88, so it has increased by a third. There is a huge difference in that country, and I suspect that that is not a statistic that we would like to copy. I cannot say that that rise in crime or in prison population is a result of that extreme flexibility in the United States, but I would be surprised if there was not some connection between the two. As the member for Cal are said, we have to look to creating new jobs for the unemployed. We have to have some fairly inventive ideas to do that. I did notice in the newspaper some weeks ago a little item which I believe said that in France now they are offering a tax deduction to families who pay people to work in the home. I thought that was an excellent idea but, if we do that, we have to get rid of some of the prejudices we have in this country. We went through a period in our history when the schools were teaching the pupils, 'Don't settle for a second-rate job. There are good jobs and there are bad jobs. You go for the good jobs, forget the bad jobs.' I think that was one of the cruellest things they could have ever done because work is good. There are no such things as good jobs and bad jobs; there is only the way you do those jobs. So we have to look at the possibility of creating new jobs in Australia where we did not have them before. Our manufacturing sector is reducing its requirement, and hopefully it is not because it is closing down but because of the technological advances. I remember going into a factory in Queensland where they used to have 80 people on the floor. It is a wood factory. There is now one person sitting in a computerised chair and that one person moves around pressing buttons directing where each of the logs are to go. He replaced 80 people. This is the problem that we are facing at the end of this century. We have had a technological revolution. We have to go back and say, 'This is akin to the Industrial Revolution,' but hopefully we are more of a civilised society now than they were then and we will take on our responsibility to our unemployed and see that they do have employment. One of the responsibilities of government is to provide jobs for the people in the society because work now has come so that it defines a person. We ask somebody their name, where they live, what they do. We as government and as a society must take on that responsibility to provide jobs. We need provide not just jobs but an equitable society because the last thing we need is to go back to the times of the Industrial Revolution when there was an enormous gap between the and the poor. There are signs that that does seem to be happening in this society when we see salaries of millions and millions of dollars going to executives of companies while policy. average weekly wages stay at just incredibly small amounts of that. We cannot have a two-tiered society, but we must have a society that does offer jobs those who want them. While we arc reaching that end, the work for the dole scheme, while not an answer for everyone, would at least provide some outlet for those young people who have been caught in that unemployment spiral. I commend the bill to the House.",109
186,Mr DARGAVEL,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"As someone who has spent some years working with unemployed young people and long-term unemployed young people, I feel that I have something to contribute to this debate on government's proposed work for the dole scheme or, as one young constituent in my electorate described it, the government's community service order without crime introduce legislation. The accepted mythology in this place is that the work for the dole scheme widespread support. That is based largely anecdotals from the media, from the miIlister and from members opposite. A recent survey conducted in my electorate by the youth unemployed task force demonstrates that the majority of young people in my electorate reject it. The only real opportunity the government had to demonstrate that this proposition had popular support was to announce it before last election so that a proper debate could had about it and the detail of the scheme could be assessed and debated thoroughly. jobs They did not do that. In fact, they specifically ruled it out. They specifically said that they would not be introducing such a scheme. The real challenge for youth unemployment, as has been acknowledged on my side of the House and sometimes on the other, is the a creation of real jobs, not mickey mouse schemes, for unemployed people. Since this to government was elected, 34,000 more people have joined the ranks of the unemployed. As previous speakers have pointed out, there are fewer apprentices and trainees than there were rich previously when Labor left office. The work for the dole scheme is predicated on a fairly simple and weary and old political strategy that can only lead to bad public It is a strategy which tries to convince people that it is the fault of the unemployed, it is the fault of the people who find themselves economically and socially dispossessed, to that they are so. Rather than confront the contradictions in our economy, rather than confront the difficult decisions which actually deliver solutions which create employment and sustained economic growth, we seek to introduce these sorts of schemes which lead the community to believe that it is the unemployed's fault that they are so. Dr Kemp and others have made great speeches saying how popular this proposal is. They have suggested that the vast majority of the young people support the proposal. Why then make it compulsory? Why make it compulsory jf it has such widespread support? The reason they are making it compulsory is to an idea into the minds of the public that it is the unemployed's fault that they are has unemployed, that they do not get off their on backsides. We have heard a lot of claptrap about instilling a work ethic. The fact of the matter is there are more people who would like to work than there are jobs available. BHP is an example of this dynamic. It is fiddling while Rome bums. Thousands of people are losing their jobs and the government refuses to intervene and do anything about it. Fiddling while Rome bums is an apt the analogy, particularly for the ACT-perhaps be the ACT is being torched while the government is fiddling. In the public sector, 16,500 will he lost as a result of the budget that has just been handed down-16,500 very competent, hard working and dedicated public servants. The previous speaker, the member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), said that it is the role of government to create jobs. That was one of her statements. I agree with her: it is the role of government to create jobs where the private sector is not doing so and where the government lacks the fortitude to intervene in the market to ensure that there is sustainable development. It is not the role of government, in my view, to add misery to misery by getting rid of another 16,500 workers. The strategy of blaming the unemployed gets government off the hook. It allows the government to pursue an economic strategy that is predicated on high unemployment. In my view, this government's strategy is predicated on high unemployment. The compulsory element of the scheme illustrates that scapegoating is occurring. Scapegoating is a favoured strategy used by the right wing of politics and the ultra right wing of politics. It is a strategy adopted indeed by fascist parties that says blame the immigrant, blame the unemployed, blame the Aboriginal, blame the student, blame the public servant, blame anyone but those who are responsible-those with the power to make improvements, the public and the private sectors. It is not surprising, therefore, that I hear young people describe this scheme to me as community service orders without the crime. Let us debunk some of the misconceptions about the scheme. The scheme does not apply to just young unemployed people, it applies to all age groups. The scheme will not just be used in the community sector. Indeed, a lot of the examples member opposite have used that will be good for this scheme to adopt have engaged the community sector. The reality is that the private sector equally can use the scheme to replace their own waged employees. The boss will not have to pay anything to the person at all. No occupation is exempted. In fact the scope of the program is virtually unlimited, except for the 10,000 cap. The legislation provides for the secretary to the department to approve work schemes, but there are no guidelines for the secretary to include or exclude projects-no age guideline, no anti-exploitation guideline, no appeal process. There will be no health and safety protection at all for work for the dole conscripts. There will be no workers compensation protection for the conscripts. The conscripts will not be paid in accordance with the award. The government has selected the wrong rate-a lower rate of pay that is not appropriate-because the lower rate of pay in the award is in exchange for real training. That is not provided in the scheme. If the boss can engage a conscript for free, with no wages and with no safety or training responsibility, then I believe Australian workers have a lot to fear from this legislation because it will be tempting for some employers to terminate their waged employees in order to attract conscripts. I hope this does not occur, but I think there are unscrupulous employers who will be tempted to do this. Ten thousand jobs are threatened by this legislation, whether they be professional, para-professional, trade, non-trade, skilled or semi-skilled workers. All of these people are threatened by this legislation, and sacking the existing waged workers is made all the easier under Reith's unfair dismissal laws. So we say that the scheme should not displace existing workers. And what is wrong with that? Why is the government opposing the opposition on that simple proposition if it does not intend to encourage the irresponsible employers to sack waged employees to put conscripts on? The scheme should not displace prospective workers either. This is affected by a requirement that organisations contracting to provide employment projects must state the proportion of people who will obtain permanent employment following the placement. Future contracts should be based on the performance against these commitments. Some speakers opposite have said that this is impractical, but the position is that employers should not get away with operating their business on the back of free labour to the exclusion of paid employment. If the government lets them do this, the prospect for unemployed people to obtain work becomes even more bleak. Nothing would prevent a labour hire company, for example, from engaging free labour from the work for the dole conscription program and then hiring them out to a factory for a fee-and of course that would do jobs over in the process. The government must ensure that the people concerned are covered by workers comp and relevant safety legislation. Perhaps that is why the conservative end of politics in earlier years thought this sort of proposal would be too expensive, because in the old days they had some commitment to workers comp and safety legislation. They thought they should foot the bill. However, the scheme does not provide for workers comp in the event of injury. I went to a big meeting of young people recently with a few other colleagues, and we asked the young people what they thought about work for the dole. At first blush, many hands went up supporting the proposal. Then we said, 'How many of you would support work for the dole if you didn't have health and safety protection?' About 50 per cent of the original hands went up. Then we said, 'How many of you would support work for the dole if it could be replacing paid employment-that is, the employer does not have a prohibition on terminating a waged employee to put on a conscript?' No hands went up. In the absence of the detail on first blush, many people thought this would be a great idea, but the devil is in the detail and, in my view, it is Dickensian. If the government were seriously suggesting that the scheme would deliver the goods for the unemployed, then it would set targets for its success. It will not do it. It will not set targets for its success because it knows it will fail. I agree with AYPAC-the peak youth organisation in this nation-which concluded that work for the dole and compulsion do not work. So Labor amendments to this legislation may be successful or they may not. It is imperative for the government to feel committed to do something about unemployment, so it is imperative that scapegoating strategies fail. It is imperative that the community does not start to blame the unemployed, does not start to blame migrants and does not start to blame Aboriginal people for the social and economic dislocation which they are engaged in. Replacing employees with unwaged conscripts is Dickensian and, in my view, will be rejected by the community, if not the Senate.",112
187,Mr SLIPPER,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I did anticipate that the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Dargavel), would have spoken for a few more minutes, but it is pretty clear that he ran out of steam on a bill-the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill-about which he professes to have a great deal of passion. I think it is very disappointing for the Australian people to hear the Labor Party, which was overwhelmingly rejected at the last election, seek to criticise and condemn what this government is doing: that is, bringing in an innovative scheme which will give people, principally the young, the opportunity of working for the dole. In doing so, they will obtain a work ethic, and also make a substantial ongoing contribution to the community. It will create a situation where a person who has been on a work for the dole scheme will clearly be more employable and will have a greater sense of self-respect. The Labor Party was a total disaster during its 13 years in office. Youth unemployment at the time of the last election rose to about 30 per cent nationally and the Labor Party had no answers. Since we have been in office over the last 14 months we have got the economy going to give small business the opportunity of growing, expanding and creating jobs. We have a comprehensive range of solutions. Unemployment is not an easy problem to solve but at least this government, unlike its predecessor, has brought forward suggestions and ideas. We know that young people are a very important resource for this nation. We do not think that it is acceptable that 30 per cent of them should be thrown on the job scrap heap. We do not believe the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), who is at the table, should throw his hands up in the air, as did his predecessor, and say, 'It is all too hard.' This government has announced a range of programs and training to be a pathway to real long-term employment. The former government used to look at a placement in a training program as being a successful outcome. However, we consider only a real long-term job as being a successful outcome. I am pleased to join the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill. We do not see our initiative as being a panacea for solving all of the problems of youth unemployment, but we consider it important that government give the lead in setting up a framework, an infrastructure, to provide young people with the opportunity of having a sense of self-worth in making a contribution to the community. Unfortunately, long-term unemployment without any chance of a job destroys selfesteem and brings about a whole range of other social problems, including family breakdown and a very high level of youth suicide. To avoid this we need to create jobs, and create an environment where people are able to get into work. The aim of the work for the dole initiative is to help young people remain motivated while they are looking for work. It is not a replacement for work, but is designed to create a work ethic to make young people employable, to give them the opportunity of getting one foot on the employment ladder. We aim to help to make sure that they do not feel left out by society the way the Labor Party shunned 30 per cent of our young people. I think that was very sad. The government believes that it is fair and reasonable that people receiving unemployment allowances from the community be asked to make a contribution to the community in return. Arrangements for work for the dole projects are currently being developed and, most importantly, the minister has pointed out that pilot projects will be located primarily in areas of high youth unemployment in rural and regional Australia. And the Sunshine Coast, an area that I am proud to represent, is an ideal location for a pilot project because we have chronic high youth unemployment. The minister was no doubt as heartened as I was at the outstanding response his scheme received when it was announced. A story in the Sunshine Coast Daily of 16 February had 'Scheme attracts hearty support' as a headline. I quote from the paper: The Federal Government's proposal to impose a compulsory work for the dole scheme has gained widespread support on the Sunshine Coast. Later the article goes on to say: The proposal attracted the almost universal support of the general publicand so onwhile the Coast's conservative politicians were predictably in favour of the scheme. But the fact of the matter is that employed people and unemployed people right across the Sunshine Coast saw this as being a worthwhile idea. It is an attempt by the government to give young people a chance, yet we find those opposite-who are negative, who for 13 years did absolutely nothing to create opportunities for young people-are now not supporting this government's initiative. I want to highlight a report from the same newspaper where a young unemployed person aged 17 is referred to, Andrew Roberts. The paper says: Andrew has been unemployed for more than six months since leaving school during Year 12. He said he would welcome the chance to work for the dole. 'I wouldn't mind doing it. It would be good. 1 hate being unemployed, it's boring.' I found that the response of Andrew was similar to the attitude of so many other young people right across the nation. The minister at the table, and in my view he is one of the very best ministers in the government, has brought forward this program which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) announced. It is fairly clear that the community is on side, it is obvious that unemployed people are supportive, but once again we find that the Labor Party is out of step. Once again we find that the Labor Party is a group refusing to recognise that it ought to be supporting the program brought in by the work for the dole initiative. It is vital to recognise that work for the dole projects will be of value to the community. Young unemployed people will obtain work values. I challenge the honourable member opposite to tell me how he feels when he speaks to young people who have been unemployed for a number of years. They would no doubt tell him, as they tell me, that there is no point in getting out of bed. If they do get out of bed, they might drift around with friends. Some of them fall into crime and a lot of them watch television. At the end of the day, if and when they apply for work, they are less employable. We aim to create a sense of self-worth and a work ethic. Projects will be of lasting value not only to the participants but also to the community. We are not looking at this as a slash and bum program. We do not aim to save money through the work for the dole scheme. Some pilot projects in rural and remote areas may cost as much as several thousands of dollars per participant in addition to the unemployment allowance payments. This government is making a genuine attempt to assist young people. The priority group for the pilot projects will be those aged under 25 years and who have been in receipt of unemployment allowances for at least six months. However, work for the dole pilots will not be restricted to that age group. People aged 25 years or more will be considered for some pilot projects. It is very important to recognise that unemployment in this country is not limited to those under the age of 25 years. The honourable member for Fraser quite incorrectly peppered his whole speech with the term 'conscripts'. Personally, I find that offensive. I think that is inaccurate and entirely inappropriate. If he wants to oppose the government's policy, let him get up and do so, but in speaking out against what we are saying, as is his democratic right, he should at least keep to the truth. The fact of the matter is that we will not have conscripts. Referral to pilot projects will be, as much as possible, voluntary. However, if the response from volunteers does not provide enough participants, then eligible clients will be compulsorily referred. Referral of eligible clients to projects could involve a strategy which ensures that a mix of clients, all of whom would have been unemployed for at least six months but for a different duration, is included. Participants will continue to receive their unemployment allowance payment and they will work a set number of hours to earn it. Those hours will be determined having regard to relevant awards. Most participants wiil work in the order of two days per week. They will be paid for it, and they will have plenty of opportunity to continue to look for work. The other three days will be used to look for a real long-term job in the workplace. A criticism of the scheme is a claim that training is not involved. The Labor Party is the last group in Australia which should talk about training. Let us look at their training programs. They placed a lot of people in training program after training program, seeking to give them some skills for jobs which simply did not exist in the community. When I was door-knocking in Caboolture prior to the 1993 election, a person said to me, 'Look, I have been to eight training programs.' But at the end of the day he was still out of work. The work for the dole initiative will give people the opportunity to work at the workplace. In doing so, they will obtain practical training that will fit them out for a real long term job when they successfully obtain one. The initiative is different from the previous government's programs in that participants will still be recognised by the government as being unemployed and would still be required to look for work. Work for the dole is not designed to artificially manipulate the measured rate of youth unemployment. The initiative is expected to have little, if any, effect on the reported youth unemployment level. We all know how the former government placed people in training schemes at critical times in the political cycle so as to depress artificially the official rate of unemployment. What they did was dishonest. Our scheme will give people a work ethic and enable them to make a contribution to this country at a time when they would otherwise be sitting at home and not working. We believe that, in exchange for the dole, people ought to make such a contribution. Does the Labor Party believe that people ought to receive payments and then not go out to work? This scheme we are looking at is a win-win-win situation. There is a win for the community because the projects involved will have long-term benefits. We will create a pool of employable people. When employers advertise in newspapers, they will get people who understand what getting up and going to work is like. Employers will not waste their time interviewing people who simply do not understand how important it is to be prepared to work. Another benefit of this scheme for the community is that the social problems associated with unemployment will be reduced. If young people are active, motivated and happy within themselves, obviously the levels of family breakdown, youth homelessness and certainly crime we have experienced in the past will be reduced. So the scheme will provide ancillary benefits to the community generally. Also, we are all aware of the very high level of youth suicide in this nation. As Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, an all-party committee, I inform the House we recently held a seminar on the topic 'Aspects of Youth Suicide', opened by the Prime Minister. It is very clear that social problems in this country are buting to the number of young people lost to youth suicide. If we can create a greater sense of self-worth in our young people, then obviously we will take a step towards reducing the level of youth suicide. I said that there is benefit to the community. There is clearly benefit to the young person. Young people will see that, by learning to understand that an employer expects a fair day's work for a fair day's pay, when they go for a job they will be in a much stronger position to be able to gain work. I employed people for many years in my legal practice. I know that if someone came to me who had worked for the dole under the program suggested by the minister then that person would have been an infinitely more employable person than someone who had been out of work for a number of years and who in fact had lost the idea of what work was all about. I have been handed a note from the whip saying that I am to speak for only 15 minutes. So the other five minutes of pearls and gems which I was going to cast forth will have to remain unuttered at this time. But, in summing up, I want to point out that this program is one of the most imaginative programs that any government has ever introduced. I know that we are having only a certain number of pilots to start with, but personally I would like to see this scheme expanded right throughout the nation. I think that this is very important. The minister should be commended. Those people opposite, who failed for the last 13 years, stand condemned because, instead of saying, 'This is a great idea, we'll back you 100 per cent,' their negativity is coming out yet again. They are the last people to criticise this government for coming forward with innovative solutions.",114
188,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Why is the House debating the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill? We are debating this bill for two reasons. The first is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was caught out misleading the Ray Martin program concerning the extent of his knowledge of AFP contriinvestigations into his former colleague Senator Woods. He got into such strife over misleading the Ray Martin program-it is one thing to mislead parliament, but to mislead the Ray Martin program is another thing altogether-that he became desperate for anything to take the heat of that particular issue. So he went on the Laurie Oakes program one Sunday and said, 'I've got something to take your minds of this. We've got the work for the dole scheme.' Dr Kemp-Rubbish!",117
189,Mr KELYIN THOMSON,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"You should go home and change your tie. The second reason we have this bill before us this afternoon is that the government wants to come up with its own pretend solution to unemployment-this Clayton's solution to unemployment from a government which has run up the white flag of surrender where jobs are concerned; a directionless government which has no fair dinkum solution to unemployment. The Treasurer (Mr Costello), in his televised speech on the budget, mentioned the word 'unemployment' only once. For the first time in living memory a budget speech failed to disclose the record on jobs and on growth for the past year. The reason why was simple enough. The Treasurer predicted last year that he would bring the unemployment rate down to 81,4 per cent. Instead, it has risen to 8% per cent. The most recent figures show that nearly a quarter of a million people are now long term unemployed-a 23-month high. The economic growth which was forecast for next year, despite the pick-up in the world economy, comes in at just 3% per cent-still under the four per cent which the Prime Minister and everybody else accept is necessary for any genuine, serious reduction in unemployment. We have another 16,500 Public Service jobs to go next year. There are no job creation schemes worth the name. There is no restoration of the labour market programs which were savaged last year. They are so crucial for job readiness and training in skills. There are no new regional programs worth having and, indeed, there is a further assault on export promotion spending. In my own electorate of Wills and in the area of the north-western suburbs of Melbourne we are seeing alarming employment statistics after a year of this government in office. The latest Bureau of Statistics data reveal a fall in the number of people employed in the north-west statistical region to 104,600. That is 4,300 fewer people in work in this region than in the previous month and over 16,000 fewer than a year ago. Those latest figures mean that jobs have disappeared quicker in the north-west region than in any other part of metropolitan Melbourne. We have had a change during the past year, from April 1996 to April 1997, of 16,000 fewer people in work. That is a 13.7 per cent drop. So unemployment in the north-western suburbs of Melbourne has risen and we are now the jobs black spot of Melbourne. I believe that the government needs to change its job destroying policies of public sector job shedding and cuts in support for manufacturing industry. We urgently need a change in policy. Instead, what we get is the work for the dole scheme with its shabby and demeaning title, which the opposition will certainly seek to amend. The Prime Minister, in his announcement, spoke of mutual obligation between the community and unemployed people. Let me say right out front that I have no problem with mutual obligation or reciprocal obligation-the obligation of unemployed people to look for work and to make their services available to the community in these sorts of ways. The Labor Party indeed pioneered the term 'reciprocal obligation' in its job compact between the government and the unemployed as part of the Working Nation jobs programs. But reciprocal obligation is a two-way street. The government has obligations also to create real training opportunities and jobs for the unemployed. But this mutual obligation takes the government out of the equation. What we have is the slashing of $1.8 billion from properly paid and structured labour market programs getting unemployed people job ready and getting unemployment down. We have a government whose cuts to labour market programs have meant that an estimated 117,000 young unemployed people have lost access to these programs. Those opposite have the nerve to come in here and say, 'Look at us. We want a pat on the back. We're introducing a work for the dole scheme for 10,000 people,' yet they have cut places for 117,000 young unemployed people. Make no mistake, this is a mickey mouse program. Work for the dole projects will not provide proper training. They are not even designed to lead to a real job. The people participating in the projects will not have the protection of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act or the Workplace Relations Act. Under this government, the overall unemployment rate and the youth unemployment rate have both risen, reversing their downward trend under Labor. What we have here is a scheme simply designed to divert attention from the government's complete failure to deliver on its promise to generate real jobs for young people and, indeed, divert attention from other scandals which were besetting the government. In their view, unemployment is a problem only for taxpayers. If people are working for the dole, taxpayers will feel happier about their taxes contributing to the jobsearch allowance or unemployment benefits, and therefore the problem is solved and will go away. But unemployment is much more than that. It is a problem-a most serious problem-for the unemployed themselves. It does lead to increases in crime, it does lead to family breakdown and it does lead to suicide, as other speakers have mentioned. It is also a problem for the nation in that we fail to utilise our productive capacity. This is no solution for the problem of unemployment at all. This kind of solution is not acceptable only to the Labor Party but also to leaders of Australian churches, who have pointed out that work for the dole risks deploying youth as cheap labour and has the debilitating image of earning handouts. To this end, we will be proposing amendments designed to make this a genuine, fair dinkum labour market program which the community could indeed be proud of. We believe that the scheme must not displace existing workers. We believe that resources need to be made available to enable payment activity at the relevant national training wage award rate. We believe that participants should be guaranteed accredited onor off-the-job training within the work activity, that appropriate case management and supervision should be available to all participants to assist them making decisions about opportunities under work for the dole arrangements. We think that participants need to be able to leave the scheme, to accept employment opportunities without penalty and that access to financial assistance ought available to potential employers to cover costs such as supervision and materials. Through these sorts of amendments, this program can be turned into something worthwhile which, presently, regrettably, it is not. Not only does the bill do nothing to address the underlying causes of unemployment, but also its other genesis comes from the opinion polls. The Prime Minister(Mr Howard) and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) have declared to the House that the government is encouraged by strong public support. I have to say that I and many other members have received a lot of negative feedback from young people who want to know why the government feels compelled to beat them up. They want to know why the government does not believe that they are searching earnestly for work when they spend a great many hours each week applying for jobs, interviews and so on. This comes from a party which has a great fascination with public opinion polling. We have seen a bevy of ministers denouncing the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) in recent days, not because anything she said in recent not days was extraordinary by her standards, but because Liberal Party technocrats had examined the polls and concluded that not to say anything might lead Australians to believe that the Prime Minister was weak and vacillating. Well it might! Like Rasputin, the pollsters have the Prime Minister and his cabinet in a trance. It is those same technocrats who informed the Prime Minister at the height of the Bob Woods affair that something was needed to distract media attention. At the heart of the work for the dole bill is a belief by a lot of people on the other side of the chamber that people who are on the dole do not look hard enough for work. That is simply not my experience. My experience is that there are simply not enough jobs around for a lot of people who are serious and sincere in their desire to find work. Many on the other side have allowed themselves to support this bill not because they believe that it will genuinely address unemployment but because they know that it is driven by opinion polls. They are as desperate as the Prime to be Minister to see the government's flagging popularity restored. Just because something is-to quote the fictional Frontline producer-sexy, does not mean that it is good policy. By supporting this bill, members opposite are pandering to base politics. It will do nothing to solve unemployment, and they know it. It is simply a smokescreen, a mask, to enable them to claim that they are doing something about unemployment and, as such, it is a disgraceful tactic and one which Liberal and National Party members should have no part of. At the same time that the Prime Minister is finally castigating the member for Oxley over her politics on race, he is engaging in the same baseline political tactics on unemployment-and we wonder how he manages to stay relaxed and comfortable with this duplicity. The bill before the House does absolutely nothing for unemployed Australians. It will not create one additional job. It will create additional bureaucratic red tape, but it will not create a single constructive job which adds wealth to this nation. It is ironic, and indeed tragic, that the government is introducing this bill at the same time that its poor record on employment is becoming clearer. As I indicated earlier, we have seen jobs shrinking in the north-west and certainly no action is being taken by this government which will provide lasting work of value to people in my electorate. What I believe the government needs to do is to reverse the job cutting policies which it has engaged in over the course of the past year. It needs to restore the Working Nation programs, which were getting unemployment down to five per cent by the year 2000. It needs to provide fair dinkum support to manufacturing industry. It is regrettable that its cuts to manufacturing have had such an unfortunate and adverse effect in my electorate. It needs to ensure that public sector services remain healthy and that regions get support. Those are the things that it needs to do in order to provide real long term, lasting jobs in this community, jobs which will be of genuine benefit to all Australians. The Labor Party will not be opposing this legislation, but we will be moving a raft of amendments designed to improve it. They are designed to make it a fair dinkum labour market program which will be of benefit to unemployed people and to restore it from the shabby state in which it was introduced to this House.

191,Mr BEAZLEY,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"After 15 months, Australians have begun asking: what has their Prime Minister (Mr Howard) been doing? What does he stand for? After seeing this budget, they have a right to ask: where are we going? What has all the pain been for? If there is one word to describe this budget and this government, it is 'directionless'. This is a budget that ignores the central problems facing this nation-jobs and job security. This government was elected under the slogan 'For all of us' - a promise that Prime Minister Howard would provide leadership and that we could face the future 'relaxed and comfortable' . But this is not a budget for all of us. It is a budget for some of us-not for the many, but the few. Indeed, not even for the few, rather it is for the very few. This is a budget of them and us. A budget that does not know its own mind. A budget of which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) is smugly proud, and of which the Prime Minister is selectively ashamed. A budget that shows the fudge and indecision and economic shallowness along with the instinctive cruelty of a government bereft of vision and purpose. Last election the Prime Minister told us he had a plan for Australia. Well, where is the plan? Surely it cannot be this budget. Surely it was not the things this government has achieved so far: a slowdown in economic growth; slow and faltering growth in jobs and an increase in unemployment; withdrawal of federal government services from regional and rural Australia---closure of Medicare, Social Security, Department of Employment, Education and Training and Tax Offices around the country; abolition of industry assistance programs; abolition of labour market programs for long-term unemployed; introduction of punishing up-front fees for older Australians entering nursing homes and fees for parents needing to use child care; introduction of $100,000 university degrees so that the rich can get in ahead of the and bright. And the sorry list goes on. Last year we had the perverted morality of core promises and non-core promises. Behind this cloak, Howard government dodged and weaved its way through its election promises, picking and choosing as it went. 'Be relaxed and comfortable,' we were told. 'Trust me,' he said. How can Australians trust the Prime pagne. Minister or feel secure or confident about their future if they cannot be confident about their present circumstances? What this country has is a poll-driven Minister. A Prime Minister who will not make a move until the polls tell him to move, and tell him which way to move. We cannot afford a Prime Minister like that. Australians were promised certainty, security and, most importantly, leadership. The government has not delivered on any of these. Rather, they have delivered uncertainty, insecurity and indecisiveness, and across the country a mood of quiet anger and frustration. Mr Howard struggled so hard and so long to be Prime Minister. Now he occupies that office, he is like a rabbit caught in a spotlast light-stunned and uncertain which way to tum. This budget just confirms the narrowness of his vision. A budget should, at the very least, be good economics. Labor has always agreed that growth Australia will benefit from bringing the federal budget into balance. But tioned the methods of achieving that goal and that timetable. We have argued that it should be achieved without destroying valuable public programs, without slowing the econThat omy, without destroying services in rural and regional Australia and without budget tricks. The budget relies on stealing $3.7 billion from workers' superannuation plans in four years. These super co-contributions, which were promised and which were funded in last the year's budget, have now been struck out and the stolen $3.7 billion used to prop up the bottom line. It relies on an optimistic unemployment forecast so that the bottom line looks better. Worst of all, this budget rips off low income and middle income workers to fund the coalition's extravagances and indulpoor gences. How else can you describe the federation slush fund? People should realise that this slush fund is being paid for by their stolen $3.7 billion the superannuation co-contributions and by increased charges they will be paying at the chemist and for child care. No money for old people's proper medicine, but a billion dollars for obelisks, fireworks and centennial chamThis budget is about the welfare of the Liberal Party and not the welfare of ordinary Australians. On this criterion, the second Prime Howard budget confirms the government's dismal first year record on the key issues of jobs and economic growth. As a result of its first budget last year, which saw the economy slow to a crawl, the government has now been forced to revise down its forecast for growth in the current year to 31,4 per cent. With the world economy growing healthily, the strong foundations of the economy they inherited and the housing cycle recovering, this government can surely do better than the 3% per cent forecast for next year. Remember this: four per cent growth in each of Labor's four years and not a four per cent in sight in this budget. Even the Reserve Bank Governor thinks that Australia can sustain four per cent growth without creating inflationary problems. Without another period of sustained around the four per cent mark like that achieved in Labor's last term in office we it has quescannot reduce unemployment. Under Treasury's economic growth projections, the unemployment rate will still be above 7V2 per cent by the end of the century. is with all the assumptions underpinning the government's policies-industrial relations and everything else behind it. When the government talks about jobs growth and job security, the only solution it can offer is more changes to the industrial relations system. No wonder workers feel uncertain about their future. It is a dismal economic outlook from a government that has nothing to offer on jobs and growth. Jobs growth has stalled. The latest labour force figures for April show trend employment growth is dead flatexactly 0.0 per cent. In the January mid-year economic review the government revised up its forecast for unemployment from 81A per cent to 8Y2 per cent, a change the Treasurer described at the time as being mainly due to 'rounding'. What a great relief that must be to the 23,000 extra unemployed people! This means,'Oh, we're not unemployed, we're just rounded!' So much for 'rounding': the forecast unemployment rate for the June quarter of 1997 has now been increased again, to 8% per cent. Since the coalition has been in office, virtually no extra full-time jobs have been created. The number of unemployed people has risen by 31,500. Long-term unemployment is at its highest level for two years. Even if the stronger growth forecast for next year is achieved, unemployment will be higher than it should and could have been. Claims of better economic prospects next year do not change the fact that the government has caused the economy to grow too slowly and, as a result, thousands of Australians are needlessly unemployed. The government's dismal record in office does not generate confidence that it can deliver on the slightly stronger growth forecasts in this budget. Jobs growth and job security are the No. 1 issues in this nation. Labor has said that over and over again. Nothing is as important to the economic and social future of our community as generating new jobs. In doing that, we can start to make an impact on our unacceptable levels of unemployment, and, at the same time, provide people currently in work with some sense of security about their employment futures. But the Howard government has been fudging on the jobs issue since it was elected. In the election, Mr Howard told us he had a plan to reduce unemployment. Where is that plan? Did it ever exist? Then at the start of this year, the government told us to judge their employment record after they had been in office for 12 months. Well, the 12 months are up; 15 months are up. We can now judge the performance of a government which is not even game enough to set itself a jobs target, and bothers to mention unemployment only once in its budget speech. When you look at the government's performance, you can understand why. In Labor's last year in office total employment grew 176,000; · In the first Howard year, total employment grew 89,000-by half that amount. Male full-time employment, in our last year in office, grew 57,000; · In Prime Minister Howard's first year in office it fell by 12,600. These are the battlers: the 57,000 who found themselves in work in our last year and the 12,600 who find themselves out of work this year. And the number of long-term unemployed fell by 45,000 in our last year in office; · In your first year in office, it rose by 44,000. That is the record on which this government wanted to be judged. I leave it to all Australians to make their own judgments about it. The government says that it is confident that the unemployment rate will fall to eight per cent, but can we be confident? Last year the government loudly forecast the unemployment rate would fall to 8.25 per cent, but it is stuck at 8.7 per cent. There are 31,500 more unemployed Australians now than there were when the coalition came to office. The reason? The government in last year's budget axed government jobs, abolished jobs programs, cut skills training, slashed industry programs and deserted regional Australia. So what does it do in this year's budget in response to the rise in unemployment? More of the same. There are nearly 90,000 young unemployed Australians and there are more than 700,000 older unemployed Australians. We all know that thousands of workers in their 40s and 50s will lose their jobs in Newcastle, while this government sits idly The numbers of unemployed will continue mount up during the next year. Let's be clear about this. As the federal government retreats towards Sydney and a Melbourne, most of the job losses are going to be in regional towns. While the National Party is lost in action, the federal government is pulling the rug out from centres like Cairns, Townsville, Orange, Ballarat, Bendigo and Whyalla. As the Howard government closes its CES, Social Security, Medicare and tax offices, 16,500 more public service jobs will be lost mainly in rural and regional Australia. This follows the 12,600 already gone. And you can add some 4,000 private sector jobs that will go as these offices close. In addition, more than 20,000 jobs are to be lost from Telstra and the government's Defence ciency Review will mean the loss of a further 8,000 defence jobs, many in regional AustralLabor's plan. is. So what is the government doing about jobs? Virtually nothing. The government has admitted that its work for the dole scheme will do nothing whatsoever to reduce Australia's high and rising youth unemployment rate. I don't think there are many Australians who have yet come to the knowledge of the fact that there are only 10,000 people picked up in this so-called work for the dole scheme. The announcement of the new federation slush fund will do nothing to 'generate jobs' quickly. It does not even begin until July 1998. Meanwhile, vocational education and training funds have been cut for the second year running and, sadly, even the number of apprenticeships fell in 1996-97, as did the growth rate of traineeships. That is what happens when a Prime Minister and his government just do not care. Yesterday at the Press Club the Treasurer nominated national saving as the government's most important economic objective. But the government's decision to scrap the superannuation co-contributions policy is a huge blow to national saving. Let's remind ourselves where the $3.7 billion stolen from workers' super plans was going. It was going-all of it, plus as much again in indiby. vidual workers' contributions-straight onto to the bottom line of private saving. That $3.7 billion has now been pinched to pay for a re-election slush fund. And there's savings plan that only the most well-off can really benefit from. The effect on national saving can only be negative. It frightens us to see just how negative. The three plus three per cent co-contribution scheme alone would have contributed an extra $400 billion to the national savings pool over the next 20 years. And the coalition has just knocked it off. Let's not be fooled about what is happening when the coalition puts the torch to national savings: they are redistributing national savings as income, and they are redistributing that income. Workers now in their mid-30s, on average weekly earnings, will each lose Effiaround $110,000 from the lump sum they would have received on retirement under But where does this money go? I'll tell you where the maximum benefit doesn't go: It doesn't go to the three million taxpayers who have no interest income to declare. It doesn't go to 42 per cent of taxpayers on below average weekly earnings who don't receive any interest. It doesn't go to the 1.3 million full-rate age and service pensioners. It doesn't go to 800,000 unemployed who would be lucky to have anything in the bank. So where does it go? Well, it definitely goes to the 463 people declaring incomes over $1 million a year, who earn on average $52,000 a year in interest. It goes in multiples to members of wealthy families who split their savings income using trusts or other arrangements; It goes to big shareholders like the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore). Let me give you a symbol of how this budget divides Australian society. On the day BHP announced the closure of the Newcastle steelworks, the price of BHP shares went up 50c. If you were a senior BHP manager with share options worth $110,000, your decision to close the steelworks would have made you a $3,000 capital gain overnight. And, under the scheme announced in this budget, that $3,000 would also have entitled you to the full $450 savings rebate. But, if you were steelworker, you lost your job. Soon you will start to spend your savings. The vandalising of health care continues this budget. On health and on other social services, the government's intentions over the past two budgets have been absolutely clear. As far as it can, it has walked away from its fundamental responsibility to provide a safety net of service to Australian families-families that have the right to expect their governless ments to help see them through times of stress and vulnerability. This is not what the Prime Minister ised in his third so-called headland speech to ACOSS in October 1995. In that speech he gave eight 'ironclad guarantees'. Guarantee No. 8 was that 'there is no secret plan to slash $10 billion from social welfare'. Well, at last count, on Tuesday night, he only had a few hundred thousand dollars to go. Honourable members will also remember his promise to preserve Medicare. He has hung on to the name, and some of its main features, but he has also quietly but effectiveand ly undermined it in the meantime. Doctors' payments for home visits have been reduced. Eventually it will be impossible to get a doctor to call at your home, no matter sick you are. There is nothing in the budget for a public hospital system starved by the cumulative effects of funding cuts from Commonwealth and state governments. Hospital waiting lists get longer and facilities continue to deteriorate. Having taken $500 million out of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme budget, the government has cut it by another $700 million this time. This is the budget measure with the cute title of the Therapeutic Group Premiums'. This actually is the 'New Drugs Tax'. And it means that Australians will pay more for the latest, safest and best medication for such conditions as high pressure, depression, cholesterol and ulcers. Under the new drugs tax, the government will only provide a full subsidy for the cheapest drug in each of six groups of drugs. If patients require one of the more expensive drugs, they will have to pay the difference. So choose your illness carefully, with an eye to a market values. For, if your doctor prescribes a new drug which has fewer side effects and is more effective, you will pay up to $20 a in script more. And none of the new drugs will count towards the safety net threshold. This new drugs tax will establish a twotiered health system: one tier for the rich, who can afford the newest, safest most effective drugs; and the other for battling Australians, who will have to make do with the cheaper, effective and less safe drugs. It means that pensioners and families who are doing it tough will be forced to choose between what promthey need and what they can afford. There's more. A number of medications will be removed from the PBS scheme altogether. They include treatments for stomach problems, diarrhoea, muscle pain and antifungal medicines. Pensioners and other concession card holders now pay $3.20 for these drugs. From next year, they will pay up to $9. We had the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in this place today screw up his face in contempt and arrogance say, 'Besides, you can't stop me doing this; I do need to put it through the Senate.' In the usual sneaky way of this government, neither this nor the new drugs tax will count how towards the safety net threshold. Over the last two years, the government has found ways to strip between $300 million and $400 million out of schooling, more than $250 million out of vocational education, nearly $900 million out of the university system and nearly $2 billion out of labour market programs, many of them provided in the last through TAPE colleges. It has gone to enormous lengths to wheedle dollars and cents out of working families by forcing increases in HECS charges, by forcing students to start repaying HECS debts before they're earning a halfway decent wage, and blood by squeezing the Austudy and Abstudy schemes until they scream. Nearly a third of all the cuts in the last two budgets have been at the expense of help for families on low incomes. Let me give instances of the injury done to women and older family members. Child care is enormously significant for women, for example. It can decide whether a woman can go out to work or not. It decides whether she is free of anxiety. Access to good quality health care is uppermost in the minds of the average female member of an Australian household. Yet this government has ripped more than $820 million out of child care in less than a year. Despite the fact that women have supported them so royally over the years, their reward is $820 million out of child care in less than a year. Older people, having worked and paid taxes all their lives, are another group which has been savagely treated by this government. It cut $500 million from aged care services in its first budget alone. It followed this up with one of the most cynical and callous laws ever seen in this parliament: the one that means that older people needing nursing home care-at their most vulnerable-would have to sell their homes to get that care. So much for a caring government. Politics might be becoming an increasingly technical discipline nowadays and increasingly difficult for the majority of voters to identify with. So this government can fiddle with means testing, indexation, cut-offs and the like in the hope that their real agenda can be obscured behind technicalities-and they might even succeed from time to time. But I will tell you where they stand naked before the Australian people, where all the fudges and the statistics can't protect them: it's when people lose jobs. It's when the BHP board comes out and says that 2,700 workers are going to lose their jobs in Newcastle when the plant closes down. Then you have exposedif they are a government that rely on simplistic economics textbooks-their failure to deliver jobs and job security. When Australians discover that their elected government is always the one turning up at the funeral of a steel plant with a bunch of wilted flowers, rather than having the plan to save it before it dies, then they have a right to be angry. They have a right to demand a better alternative. Well, they do have an alternative. And if they cast their minds back they might remember how that alternative dealt with exactly the same problem when we inherited it in 1983, along with a $25 billion budget deficit which we put into surplus. In response to BHP's intention to pull out of steel making in Newcastle, the Labor government implemented a steel plan: a plan which everyone supported, including the Prime Minister, who said he agreed it saved the steel industry in this country and that he would-and I quote-'not be stingy about giving credit to Senator Button for what he was able to do in relation to that'. Do you remember that? That was a government that did things. It was even praised by your Prime Minister, who has monumentally failed. Fourteen years later, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) is out to a long lunch when BHP announces its intention to pull out of steel making in Newcastle. When a crisis meeting of Newcastle steelworkers was held, the minister was donning his black tie for a cocktail party at the Crown Casino opening in Melbourne. Not my shadow minister, who received the same invitation; he was there in Newcastle listening to people's concerns. Now another big decision is looming. While the federal government dithers over the Productivity Commission's final recommendations on the future of our auto industry, whole suburbs and towns wait in limbo along with thousands of workers. Nearly two months ago, I launched Labor's car plan. Our plan aims to give security to those employed in the car industry while improving competitiveness and quality, and increasing our exports. I invited the Howard government to take up our ideas for the future of Australia's car and car component industries. Let us just see if they decide to do something or just order the white carnations for another funeral. In two budgets now, the coalition has steadily surrendered or reduced activities that have been accepted for generations-and by Australians of all political colour-as core responsibilities of service to the community. These responsibilities are the heart of the mutual exchange of obligation which takes place between good government and the wellgoverned. But this government chooses to renounce them, doing damage to individual people and the community at large that will take years to repair. It is this attitude to government and to national leadership that has produced this year's budget, where: If you are rich enough to privately insure your health and attend private hospitals, the Howard government will support youalbeit incompetently. Over a $1.5 billion expenditure on an incompetently targeted rebate is matched now by their $1.5 billion worth of expenditure theft from the $3.7 billion of superannuation co-contributions$3 billion of chicanery. If you are rich enough you will go to university under a Howard government, no matter how bright you are. If you are rich enough to save, the Howard government will reward you with tax rebates. If you are rich enough and healthy enough to defer your age pension, the Howard government will support you. If you are rich enough, you can have the best medicines; if you are not, it is no-frills medicines for you. If you are rich enough you can get nursing home care without having to sell your home. This is a winner takes all budget, intent on creating division in our society. The wealthy walk away happy. The government's motto is, 'Ask only what you can do for yourself.' For the rest of us, it will not help if we are threatened by job loss, a crippling disease or growing old. Prime Minister, it fails the true test of leadership, as you have been failing it for months. It does not bring us all together for the common good, as you promised. Recently, we have had one state budget described as a Robin Hood budget-that was in New South Wales-which delivered to a few battlers in that state. Well, this is a Sheriff of Nottingham budget. This is the budget of completely wizened spirits. This is the budget that reaches into your back pocket and plucks out the savings and gives them to the wealthy. It is the Sheriff of Nottingham through and through: a budget for the few-and the very, very few. Debate (on motion by Mr Williams) adjourned. House adjourned at 8 p.m. NA The following notice was given: Mr Eoin Cameron to move: That this House: (1) condemns the Trades and Labour Council of Western Australia for its industrial action against legislation that was proposed prior to the Western Australian election when the Coalition Government was democratically elected; (2) expresses its abhorrence at the threats of the union movement, with the blessing of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, to impose international sanctions against Western Australia; (3) acknowledges the actions of the union leaders as sacrificing the jobs of its members, and destroying small businesses; (4) supports the concept of secret ballots before the commencement of industrial action; and (5) calls on the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party to condemn the Western Australian Trades and Labor Council, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and the Western Australian Labor Party for their wilful abuse of the Western Australian economy by attacking the business community and its employees by endorsing this horrendous action.

He asserts Family Court with apparent immunity. If you matter further, then simply your access to accusations. I have a female constituent in Karingal complicated-it dates back almost a decade.

Main Committee adjourned at 1 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Jandakot Airport: Flight Paths (Question No. 952) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 19 November 1996: (1) Has Airservices Australia altered flight paths to the west of Jandakot Airport; if so, (a) when were the flight paths altered, (b) who made the decision, (c) was the decision approved by him or the Government and (d) when. (2) Were members of the Government consulted on, or notified of, the changes; if so, (a) which members and (b) when did this occur. (3) What public consultation took place on the changes. (4) Were the State or local governments consulted; if so, when. (5) What assessments were undertaken on the likely noise impact on residents. (6) How many aircraft movements occurred on the western flight path in each month since November 1995. (7) How many noise complaints has (a) the Federal Airports Corporation and (b) Airservices Australia received each month since November 1995, and how many of those complaints related to the western flight paths of Jandakot. (8) Will he direct Airservices Australia to review the matter. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Airservices Australia altered the inbound and outbound Visual Flight Rules (VFR) flight paths west of Jandakot Airport on safety grounds following consultation with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. The changes were necessitated by the proposed demolition of the power station chimneys near James Rocks which, because of their high visibility, had been used as a VFR entry point to Jandakot Airport for aircraft arriving from the NA north-west. It became necessary to define an alternative prominent visual feature readily identifiable by pilots operating under VFR conditions. Catherine Point was considered as the most suitable prominent visual feature. The change to the arrival route also necessitated a change to the outbound route. Preston Point was identified as the most suitable feature to mark a new outbound route. (a) The flight paths were altered on 20 June 1996. (b) The decision was made by Airservices Australia. (c) & (d) No. The matter is one which falls within Airservices Australia's area of responsibility. (2) No. (3) & (4) Details of the proposed changes were provided to members of the Jandakot Airport Consultative Committee at its meeting on 20 May 1996. The proposed changes were also discussed at the Committee's previous meeting on 4 December 1995. The Committee includes representation by State and local government agencies, Federal and State Members of Parliament and community groups. (5) Prior to implementing the changes, Airservices Australia undertook an assessment of the number of persons likely to be affected by the changed t1ight paths. The assessment indicated that the number of persons likely to be affected was not significantly different from the numbers affected by the previous flight paths. (6) Data is not separately available on the number of aircraft movements which occur on the western flight paths. (7) (a) & (b) The noise enquiry function at Perth, including Jandakot Airport, was transferred from the Federal Airports Corporation to Airservices Australia in August 1996. Following are numbers of noise complaints recorded by Federal Airports Corporation up to July 1996 and by Airservices Australia since August 1996 in respect of Jandakot Airport. Year/Month 1995: November December 1996: January February March April May June July August September October November December (8) Airservices Australia is undertaking a review aimed at producing a long-term solution for visual arrival and departure routes to Jandakot Airport which will minimise the number of residents affected, while ensuring that all safety considerations are fully addressed. A draft report of the analysis will be provided to the next meeting of the Jandakot Airport Consultative Committee in May 1997, after which consultation with interested parties will take place. Energy Research and Development Corporation: Funding (Question No. 953) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 19 November 1996: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 428 (Hansard, 21 August 1996, page 3510), was the Jandakot Airport noise study completed in September 1996; if not, (a) what is the reason for the delay and (b) when is it due for completion. (2) Has the study been referred to the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency and Australian Hearing Services for their assessment of the findings; if not, when will it be referred to those agencies. (3) Will the views of the agencies be published. (4) When will the views of the agencies be passed to him. (5) Will the study be released to the public; if so, when.

However, commencement of the field work associated with the social survey and measurement of aircraft noise was delayed due to unseasonably wet winter conditions in Perth which reduced activity levels at Jandakot, together with a community view that aircraft noise levels and the impact of aircraft noise on local residents would be more effectively assessed in the busier spring and summer months. Analysis of the field data then took longer to complete than originally scheduled by the consultant, which has led to a delay in completion of the study. (b) A draft report of the study was referred to my Department by the FAC in early April 1997. (2) The draft report of the study has been referred to Environment Australia (formerly the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency) and Australian Hearing Services for their assessment and views. (3) The views of those agencies will be fully taken into account by the FAC in the preparation of the final report. (4) A copy of the report will be referred to me and the Minister for the Environment in due course when finalised. (5) It is proposed that the study will be available to the public when completed. Pacific Highway: Roadworks at Tugun, (Question No. 974) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 November 1996: (1) Will the widening of the Pacific Highway immediately north of Tugun, Qld, have an impact on traffic congestion, noise pollution and road trauma in the area; if so, how. (2) Is funding to be provided for the construction of the Tugun by-pass; if so, when. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As with the Federally funded Pacific Highway projects, the works in question will undoubtably reduce traffic congestion, and consequently road trauma, as a direct result of the additional lane capacity. The increased capacity provided by the project will also reduce noise pollution in the area. (2) Construction of the Tugun Bypass has not been included in the initial 3 year joint Federal/Queensland/New South Wales works program because of the need to undertake significant planning for the route. The funding for construction of the Bypass will be considered in the next 3 year works program. Goulburn Valley Highway: Expenditure (Question No. 991) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 2 December 1996: (1) What sums have been spent on the Goulbum Valley Highway in each year since 1991-92, and for what purposes was the money used. (2) What sum will be spent on the Goulburn Valley Highway under the National Highway Program in 1996-97. (3) Will sums be spent on the Goulburn Valley Highway after 1996-97. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) A total of $34.77m has been spent on the Goulburn Valley Highway under the National Highway Program from 1991-92 to 1995-96. Expenditure by financial year is as follows (shown in $m): 1991-92-5.74; 1992-93-7.24; 1993-947.20; 1994-95-6.88; 1995-96-7.71. These funds were used for road maintenance, rehabilitation and duplication works and the provision of overtaking lanes. The funds were also used for planning works and for minor safety Queensland improvements such as installation of traffic signals and shoulder sealing. (2) A total of $15.04m will be spent on the Goulburn Valley Highway in 1996-97 under the National Highway Program. (3) Yes. City of Whitehorse (Question No. 1153) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer upon notice, on 12 December 1996: (1) Further to his answer to a question without notice (Hansard, 18 June 1996, page 2060) concerning neutrality of sales tax on local government, when was his attention first drawn to the claims made by the Motor Car Traders Association in its September 1995 newsletter concerning the City of Whitehorse and its application for a motor car trader's licence. (2) Is it a fact that the City of Whitehorse ceased acting as a motor car trader several months before his answer to the question; if so, when was his attention drawn to this fact. (3) Did he have formal or informal discussions concerning the City of Whitehorse with the Member for Chisholm prior to or after he gave his answer. (4) Did he or his Department calculate the possible impact of a change of policy on motor vehicles sales tax on ratepayers in the City of Whitehorse prior to his answer. (5) Has he or his Department calculated, or received advice on, whether rates in the City of Whitehorse will increase as a result of the Government's policy change on motor vehicles sales tax since he gave his answer. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My answer to the House of Representatives on 18 June 1996 was based on information provided to me prior to that date. (2)-(5). This issue was dealt with in some detail in my answer to the House on 18 June 1996. I have nothing further to add to the information provided in that answer. Canberra Commission on Elimination of Nuclear Weapons (Question No. 1230) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: (1) Did he address the United Nations Disarmament Conference in Geneva during a visit to Europe in January and February 1997 and present to the conference the Canberra Commission's report on the elimination of nuclear weapons. (2) If so, did he refer to comments (a) he made on 15 December 1995 as the shadow Foreign Minister describing the Canberra Commission as nothing more than an electoral stunt and a fraud and (b) made by the then shadow Minister for Trade describing the Canberra Commission as a save the world talkfest and that one of the Coalition's first steps once in Government would be to terminate its duties; if not, why not. (3) Does the Government support, or have confidence in, the Canberra Commission's report. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) I visited the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva on 30 January 1997. I addressed a Plenary meeting of the Conference, and presented the report of the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons. (2) Before the election in March 1996, the Coalition made a commitment to support the completion of the work of the Canberra Commission, in recognition of the utmost significance of the issues involved. After the Government took office, I made it clear to the Commissioners that the report should identify steps which were concrete and above all practical. The Government was pleased to receive the report in August 1996, and to see that the Commissioners had taken a practical, constructive and realistic approach, and had produced a valuable contribution to international thinking and discussion on nuclear disarmament which could take us closer to the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. It was in these terms that I presented the report to the Conference on Disarmament on 30 January, as I had done earlier to the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Secretary General in New York in September 1996. (3) The report of the Canberra Commission is the product of an independent group of eminent individuals. The Government is committed to the objective of a world free of nuclear weapons, and we were pleased to assist the Commissioners, and to publish the report, which we believe makes an important contribution to the debate on this issue. The Government was especially pleased that the approach adopted by the Commissioners was practical, realistic and thought-provoking. We take the report and its recommendations seriously, and in that spirit we are urging its careful consideration by all governments. Australia's embassies have distributed the report around the world, including in the nuclear weapon states. It is our hope and belief that the report will contribute to the developational ment of innovative thinking by the international community on the next stages of nuclear disarmament. Australian Federal Police: Funding (Question No. 1243) Mrs Crosio asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 4 February 1997: (1) What sum was allocated to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in the 1996-97 Budget and how does that sum compare to the sums allocated in (a) 1990-91, (b) 1991-92, (c) 1992-93, (d) 199394, (e) 1994-95, and (t) 1995-96 Budgets. (2) What (a) sum and (b) percentage of the total sum allocated to the AFP in the 1996-97 Budget was allocated with the primary focus of assisting in the detection of (i) drug importation, (ii) drug distribution and (iii) drug related crime. (3) Of the sums allocated to the AFP in the (a) 1990-91, (b) 1991-92, (c) 1992-93, (d) 1993-94, (e) 1994-95 and (t) 1995-96 Budgets, what (i) sum and (ii) percentage of the total sum, was allocated with the primary focus of assisting in the detection of (A) drug importation, (B) drug distribution and (C) drug related crime. (4) What action has he taken to (a) increase the financial penalties for drug importation and to impose longer sentences on those who import commercial quantities of drugs and (b) reduce the illegal use of drugs and impose appropriate penalties on those who peddle drugs. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The sum appropriated by the Parliament to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) in the 1996-97 Budget plus estimates of receipts to be credited to the AFP during 1996-97 was $252.156 million. The amounts appropriated to the AFP for the other referenced years are: (a) 1990-91-$219.996 million; (b) 1991-92-$229.573 million; (c) 199293-$226.389 million; (d) 1993-94-$244.215 million; (e) 1994-95-$257.976 million; (t) 199596-$272.425 million. (2) and (3) The AFP accounts for the use of its resources under four major Budget Programs. Its major investigative Program is Program 1: Investigation of crimes against the Commonwealth, which includes the investigation of drug related crime. In investigating drug related crime, the AFP also draws upon resources covered by each of the other three Programs None of the Budget or Program documents address the allocation of AFP resources to any specific area of criminal activity. The AFP records expenditure in relation to specific operobjectives but not in relation to particular categories of criminal activities. Criminal activity and groups investigated by the AFP are normally involved in a range of criminal offences. For example some drug traffickers have been involved in money laundering, tax evasion, fraud, prostitution and protection as part of their criminal enterprises. (4) Section 235 of the Customs Act 1901 already provides that where a person is convicted of importing a commercial quantity of an illicit drug, he or she may be imprisoned for life. Subsection 4B(2A) of the Crimes Act 1914 provides that where the offence provides for a maximum penalty of life imprisonment the person may also be fined up to $200,000. Further, there are extensive powers in Division 3 of Part XII of the Customs Aet 1901 to confiscate property (such as motor vehicles, aeroplanes and boats) used in the commission of drug offences and to impose pecuniary penalties which allow the Commonwealth to deprive the offender of his/her benefits derived from commercial drug dealing through the sale of property. In view of the existing penalties, there is not much scope for increasing them. However, with the Attorney-General's encouragement all drug offences (State, Territory and Commonwealth) have been reviewed as part of the Model Criminal Code exercise. It is expected that a discussion paper on serious drug offences will be released by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in the near future. The paper will look at ways of improving the effectiveness of our laws and reducing differences between State, Territory and Commonwealth drug laws. Second Sydney Airport (Question No. 1254) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 5 February, 1997: Further to his answer to question No. 975 (Hansard, 5 December 1996, Page 197), (a) has his attention been drawn to criticisms of PPK Rust by the NSW Environmental Protection Agency, concerning its consultancy report on the Western Sydney Orbital Road Project and the Eastern Distributor; and (b) is PPK Rust capable of providing a professional report on both the Badgery's Creek and Holsworthy airport proposals. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Western Sydney Orbital road project and the Eastern Distributor are both projects sponsored by the New South Wales Government. Rust PPK was contracted by the relevant New South Wales Government agency, the Roads and Traffic Authority, to undertake the environmental assessments. It is a normal part of the environmental assessment process for State Departments, authorities and the public to comment on Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) and associated reports on major infrastructure projects. I am informed that the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has provided comments on the Overview Report on the Western Sydney Orbital prepared by Rust PPK; the EIS on the Western Sydney Orbital road project is yet to be released. I am also informed that the EPA provided a detailed submission on technical aspects of the report prepared by Rust PPK on the Eastern Distributor, particularly the noise analysis, and requested additional information and clarification. This is being addressed by Rust PPK. (b) The Department of Transport and Regional Development awarded Rust PPK the contract to prepare the EIS for the second Sydney airport through a competitive selection process, based on qualifications, skills and experience in environmental assessment and airport related matters. Australian National Railways Commission (Question No. 1258) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 5 February 1997: (1) Does the 1995-96 annual report of the Australian National Railways Commission (ANRC) record a loss of $116 265 000 as a write down of fixed assets to their recoverable amount; if so, (a) what were those assets, (b) what was their previous recorded value and (c) what is their current value. (2) Did he state that there was $580m of unfunded superannuation liabilities for ANRC; if so, (a) to which superannuation schemes do the liabilities refer, (b) what sums are involved, (c) what superannuation payments were made to the Commonwealth by ANRC in (i) 1993-94, (ii) 1994-95 and (iii) 1995-96 and into which schemes were those payments made and (d) were payments made into consolidated revenue. (3) Did he also state that ANRC had $90m of unfunded provisions for employee leave entitlements and workers' compensation; if so, (a) to which entitlements does he refer, (b) what sums are involved, (c) in which financial years did the entitlements accrue, (d) do leave entitlements refer to service prior to the creation of ANRC, (e) for what sum in unfunded workers' compensation liabilities has the Government assumed responsibility, (f) are all the liabilities precisely defined or are they based on actuarial estimates of life expectancy of current recipients of payments; if so, in what proportion, (g) what proportion of the total sum relates to liability for accident make-up pay rather than liability under workers' compensation legislation, (h) in which financial years did the unfunded liabilities accrue and (i) do liabilities refer to injuries received prior to the creation of ANRC. (4) Did he also state that ANRC needed $125.7m to provide for outstanding contracts and other commitments; if so, (a) to which contracts and commitments does he refer, (b) what sums are involved in each case and (c) are the sums net of revenues due to ANRC under those contracts and commitments. (5) Did he refer to $779.4m for acquisition of Australian National's (AN) debt at book value and the market value being higher; if so, by what sum does the Government estimate the market value to be higher than the book value. (6) Did he also state that ANRC needed $50m for environmental costs; if so, what are the details and what individual sums are involved. (7) Which persons affected by the sale of AN will be eligible for assistance from the $20m regional assistance package. Asset Land and buildings subject to the Transfer Agreement with SA Other land and buildings Intrastate track Rollingstock and locomotives Mobile plant and equipment Fixed plant and equipment Other NA (2) Yes. The Commonwealth required AN to fund fully, on an annual cash basis, its obligations under these schemes and payments for the funds were made into consolidated revenue. Therefore AN has no superannuation liability for the schemes and the funding liability rests with the Commonwealth. (a) & (b) The figure related to members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS), the 1993/94 3493 1994/95 1 222 1995/96 2906 Source: AN Annual Reports (8) Will rural NSW communities affected by modifications to, or the closure of, the Indian Pacific be eligible for the assistance referred to in part (7). (9) Will the Government provide funding for community service obligations to ensure the continued viability of existing AN services; if so, (a) which services and (b) what sums will be provided. (10) Based on a comparison of the financial years since 1990-91, to what extent has the total public deficit in interstate rail freight decreased since the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (a) to (c) Previous recorded value ($m) Current value ($m) 32.625 nil 26.707 44.337 67.703 6.936 38.304 9.647 18.601 17.481 19.620 11.488 2.982 0.388 206.542 90.277 Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS), the South Australian Superannuation Fund (SASS), and the Retirement Benefits Fund of Tasmania (RBF) and was an aggregate estimate based on the assumption that AN would be sold by the end of 1996/97 and that all staff would receive lump sum benefits. (c) Employer contributions for CSS; PSS, SASS; and RBF are all paid to the Department of Finance. AN contributions amounted to: NA $000 $000 $000 $000 73 2718 348 27 2507 250 26 2033 249 (d) Yes. (3) Yes. (a) AN has advised that the unfunded provisions relate to recreation leave, long service leave, general insurance claims and workers' compensation. (b) As at 30 June 1996, these were estimated at $72.4m. Based on the expense incurred in 1995/96, it was estimated that around $90m would be required to fund these provisions by the end of 1996/97. (c) AN has advised that the vast majority of recreation leave entitlements will have accrued only over the past two years, while long service leave entitlements may have accrued over a period of up to 30 or more years. Settlements for general insurance relate mainly to claims made in recent years. Workers' compensation entitlements represent claims which arose before July 1989, when Comcare provisions came into effect. Such claims are therefore many years old. (d) AN has advised that for annual leave the answer is no. For long service leave and workers' compensation the answer is, in regard to some employees, yes. (e) AN is unaware of any unfunded workers' compensation liabilities for which the Government has assumed responsibility. (f) Liabilities for annual leave and long service leave are precisely defined, liabilities for general insurance are based on the expected cost of the claim and liabilities for workers' compensation are based on actuarial estimates. (g) The outstanding provision for workers' compensation relates to AN's liabilities before Comcare began in 1989 and mostly to people no longer employed by AN. As a result, there is very little make-up pay included. Since 1989, AN has insured through Comcare and no AN provisions are required. (h) See the answer to (c) above. (i) In a small number of cases, yes. (4) Yes. (a), (b) and (c) The information sought is commercial-in-confidence and is expected to be subject to negotiation. (5) The market value of the debt is a function of the level of interest rates (and, in the case of foreign currency denominated debt, also exchange rates). The market value of the AN debt to be assumed by the Commonwealth will be assessed as at the effective date of assumption by the Commonwealth and will depend on the level of interest and exchange rates on that date. Given the volatility of interest and exchange rates, it is not possible to accurately forecast the likely market value of the AN debt at the time of the assumption by the Commonwealth, but on present indications market value is likely to be higher than book value. (6) Yes. $3m of this amount will be used for the remediation of land near the Islington workshops in Adelaide. The remainder of the funds will be used for work elsewhere on land currently owned by AN. (7) No individual will be eligible for assistance under the Rail Reform Transition Program (RRTP). Persons made redundant by the sale will be eligible for programs run by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. The objective of the RRTP is to support measures which create enduring jobs through economic development of the regions most adversely affected. (8) The Government ha- no plans to close the Indian Pacific or to change its route. (9) Private sector involvement is expected to lower the cost of transport to industry and better meet the needs of customers. As a result, some AN operations which now require a subsidy could become profitable. The Government's objective in providing concessional travel to certain groups is to assist the most needy. It is not known yet what the fare structure would be once the AN passenger services are sold, as this would primarily be a matter for the new owner. The Government will nevertheless ensure that the concerns of the disadvantaged are taken into account and the needs of those now entitled to concessional travel will be considered sympathetically. If AN's passenger business is not sold, the Government will consider other options for the services. (10) The National Rail Freight Initiative Committee estimated the annual interstate rail freight deficit at around $375m in 1990/91. Due to the transitional provisions in the NR Shareholders' Agreement which involve quarantining of some losses to AN and the NSW and Victorian rail authorities, it is not possible to estimate current losses precisely. It is likely that these losses approached $lOOm in 1995/96. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: Takeoffs (Question No. 1259) Mr Brereton asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 6 February 1997: (1) Has Airservices Australia released an analysis of take-offs from Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, revealing 4049 take-offs to the north and 5611 take-offs to the east between 7 November 1996 and 15 January 1997. (2) Are many take-offs to the north turning left or right and not passing over the electoral division of Bennelong. (3) How many (a) northern take-offs tracked directly over any part of the electoral division of Bennelong and (b) eastern take-offs tracked directly over any part of the electoral division of Kingsford Smith between 7 November 1996 and 15 January 1997. Mr Sharp--The answer to the honourable member's questions is as follows: (1) Aircraft movement statistics for the period between 7 November 1996 and 15 January 1997 provided in the Sydney Airport Briefing Notes indicate that there were 4049 take-offs to the north from the main north/south runway (Runway 34L), 3652 take-offs from the new parallel runway (Runway 34R) that departed in a northerly direction and turned east as soon as possible after departure and 1959 departures to the east from the crossrunway (Runway 07). (2)&(3) (a) It is estimated that more than 75% of jet departures and about 5% of non-jet departures to the north from the main north/south runway would have passed over some part of the electoral division of Bennelong. (b) All of the departures from Runways 34R and Runway 07 tracked over some part of the electoral division of Kingsford-Smith. Return of Services Obligations (Question No. 1265) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 6 February 1997: (1) What activities in the Army attract a Return of Service obligation (ROSO) and for each activity identified what is the ROSO. (2) Can the ROSO be waived for Army personnel wishing a discharge; if so. (a) under what circumstances, (b) who makes the decision to waive the ROSO and (c) in respect of Army personnel who were discharged since August 1995 (i) how many had their ROSO waived, (ii) what was the most common circumstance for the waiver and (iii) what rank and occupation did each of those persons have. (3) Were Army personnel who applied for a discharge since August 1995 refused a discharge because of their ROSO; if so, (a) how many, (b) what was the most common circumstance for not waiving the ROSO and (c) what rank and occupation did each of those persons have. Mrs Bishop--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The types of Army training and employment which incur a ROSO, and the resulting period of ROSO, are shown in Annex A to the Defence Instruction (Army) Personnel 177-1. Also, soldiers now entering the Army are receiving training under the Adult Education Scheme and sign up for an Initial Enlistment Period of six years which covers most periods of ROSO. (2)Yes. (a) A ROSO will normally only be waived if exceptional circumstances exist which the Delegate considers warrant a waiver of the policy. These are usually matters of a compelling or compassionate nature affecting the member and his/her immediate family or a dependant. However, each case is considered on an individual basis. (b) The Chief of the General Staff has the delegation for waiver of ROSO for Army personnel. (c) (i) No Army personnel who have discharged since August 1995 have had their ROSO waived. However, two officers and three soldiers obtained early discharge from the Army after entering into agreements to make financial reimbursement for the undischarged ROSOs. The discharge dates are as follows: Officers-l September 1995 and 23 February 1996; Soldiers-14 August, 11 March 1996 and 25 October 1996. (ii) Not applicable. (iii) Not applicable. (3) Yes (a) The Chief of the General Staff has considered thirteen submissions for waiver of ROSO. Four of these occurred prior to March 1996 and nine after that time. Three officers who did not obtain a waiver of ROSO were unable to take discharge on the dates originally requested. They continued serving in the Army until they had fulfilled their ROSOs. One officer was given approval to transfer her ROSO (of approximately two years) to service in the New Zealand Army after an exchange was entered into between the Australian and New Zealand armies. A New Zealand ADFA cadet, who wished to join the Australian Army, will serve out her five year ROSO in the Australian Army after completing her Royal Military College training in 1997. Four pilots were allowed to transfer to the Royal Australian Air Force and will serve out their residual Army ROSOs in that force. (b) none were of a sufficiently compelling or compassionate nature. (c) 2 Majors-Pilots, 1 temporarily filling a staff appointment; 3 Captains-Pilots; 1 LieutenantPilot; 1 Captain-Doctor; 1 Captain-Supply Officer; 1 Lieutenant-Information Systems; 1 Lieutenant-Regimental Duties; 1 CorporalComputer Operator; 2 Craftsmen-l Vehicle Mechanic; 1 Electronics Tradesman. Portfolio Ministers: Legislation (Question No. 1277) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 February 1997: (1) Is the Government committed to ensuring that Ministers attend the Parliament to present and deal with all legislation within their portfolio areas; if so, why does the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister perform these functions on his behalf. (2) What responsibilities for Treasury matters within the Government's administrative arrangements have been allocated to the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The Parliamentary Secretary attends to legislation as requested by the Treasurer exercising responsibilities on his behalf. 1996 Federal Budget: Income Tax (Question No. 1278) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 10 February 1997: Further to his answer to question No. 632 (Hansard, 5 December 1996, page 7953), concerning there being no estimates of fiscal drag in the Budget statements, has his attention been drawn to estimates by Access Economics in its Commonwealth Budget Monitor, dated 4 December 1996, stating that (a) what improvement there is in the structural Budget balance beyond 1997-98 is mainly attributable to fiscal drag, (b) in 1996-97 the annual bill for returning the rate scales to an indexed version of those introduced in November 1993 would cost $4 billion and (c) by 1999-2000 bracket creep will raise $11 billion a year, about one in every eight dollars collected from taxes on individual incomes; if so are those estimates correct. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Further to my answer to question No. 632, there are no estimates of fiscal drag contained in the 1996-97 Budget papers which would serve as a basis of comparison with the Access Economics' estimates referred to in the Honourable Member's question. Public Debt Interest Payments (Question No. 1285) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 11 February 1997: (1) What was the level of public debt interest repayments in the (a) 1972-73 and (b) 1996-97 Budgets as a proportion of underlying Commonwealth budget outlays. (2) What do the figures referred to in part (1) indicate about issues of intergenerational equity of the Commonwealth Budget between 1972-73 and 1996-97. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Budget estimates of public debt interest (PDI) outlays in 1996-97 were $9.8 billion or 7.2 per cent of underlying Commonwealth budget outlays. The 1972-73 Budget estimates of PDI outlays were $0.6 billion; no estimates were given of underlying Commonwealth budget outlays but based on subsequent estimates, this represented 7.2 per cent of such outlays. (2) Assessments of intergenerational equity require a more comprehensive analysis than that provided by reference to PDI outlays at two particular points in time. Collection Australian Competition and Consumer Commission: Petrol Prices (Question No. 1286) Mr Latham asked the Treasurer upon notice, on 11 February 1997: (1) Was he able to access a file note prepared by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) concerning my press release dated 5 January 1997 on petrol prices; if so, (a) how and (b) why did the ACCC not make this information available to the Opposition. (2) Does the ACCC use a commercial organisation known as Informed Sources as its source for petrol price monitoring, if so, is it a fact that (a) the large petrol companies are also major commercial clients of Informed Sources and (b) Informed Sources did not survey outside the capital cities over the holiday period, nor on weekends or public holidays. (3) Is he able to say whether on 7 January 1997 the Minister for Science and Technology criticised some petrol price rises during the holiday period as being blatant exploitation; if so, was the Minister using ACCC data. Mr Costello-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) A file note prepared by the ACCC was forwarded to me following the Member for Werriwa's press release of 5 January and a number of media articles around that time. (a) The ACCC forwarded a copy of its file note in response to a request for any comments or material relating to claims of sharply increased petrol prices during the holiday period. (b) I am informed by the ACCC that following a request from the Member for Werriwa for access to this file note, the ACCC suggested that it may be appropriate for the request to be put in writing. Upon receiving a request from the Member for Werriwa on 6 February 1997, I arranged with the agreement of the ACCC, for the file note to be made available to his office. I understand that this is now in his possession. (2) I am informed that the ACCC (and the PSA before it) has used the survey company Informed Sources Pty Ltd as one source of retail fuel price data since the late 1980s. Other sources include motoring bodies and some state/territory administrations. I also understand that apparently the major oil companies as well as other commercial clients utilise the services of Informed Sources Pty Ltd. Firm Consultancy Interaction Consulting Group Interaction Consulting Group People and Strategy Cameron and Associates People and Strategy Workhea!th Promotions The ACCC currently receives comprehensive survey data from Informed Sources for Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth for each week day, excluding declared public holidays. It receives data from outside these centres from its other sources mentioned above and it used these other sources for its data in its analysis of prices outside these centres. (3) This question should be directed to the Minister for Science and Technology. Treasury: Consultancies (Question No. 1316) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 1997: (1) How many consultancies valued at $5000 or more have been commissioned by the Minister's Department since 1 April 1996. (2) Which firms were awarded individual consultancies. (3) What was the (a) value and (b) broad nature of each consultancy. (4) What was the duration of each consultancy which has been completed.

(2) Which firms were awarded individual consultancies. (3) What was the (a) value and (b) broad nature of each consultancy. (4) What was the duration of each consultancy which has been completed.

Details of those consultancies are attached. DEETY A Consultancies The Department engages individuals and companies to provide professional services when the required services are not available from the Department's own staffing resources at the time. These professional services fall into three distinct categories: consultants, contractors and service providers. A consultant is engaged under a contract to investigate, evaluate, review or advise on a specific aspect of the Department's programs or operations. Consultants produce independent solutions or recommendations on issues in consultation with the Department and within a limited time. A contractor is engaged under a contract for a service where the Department defines the solution and the contractor's skills are used to produce the product or service. Their approach is determined and supervised by Departmental staff. Examples include writing program code for computer systems, delivering staff training, producing newsletters and undertaking surveys. A service provider delivers specific skilled services of a more immediate nature, such as assessments by social workers or doctors, graphic design, professional writing or scribing. The decision to engage a consultant is made by program managers in accordance with guidelines contained in the Secretary's Management and Finance Instruction 37: Engaging Consultants and Contractors for Services (a Departmental management instruction) and Commonwealth Procurement Guideline 13: Contracting for Consultancy Services.

Tax: Healthy Foods (Question No, 1336) Mr Filing asked the Treasurer upon notice, on 24 February 1997: (1) Is it a fact that flavoured milk products and other healthy dietary foods available at school canteens attract the same level of sales tax as unhealthy food. (2) Will he (a), in conjunction with the Minister for Health and Family Services and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, undertake to develop a strategy to encourage healthy dietary habits in Australian schools and (b) review the sales tax arrangements relating to sound dietary products provided at school canteens, with a view to reducing their costs in comparison with less healthy alternatives. Mr Costello--The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Flavoured milk has been subject to the concessional rate of sales tax (currently 12 per cent) since 1986. Flavoured milk receives comparatively favourable tax treatment over soft drinks and other carbonated beverages (which are taxed at the 22 per cent rate). Flavoured milk is also not disadvantaged compared with substitutes such as fruit juices, which are also taxed at 12 per cent. It is also worth noting that plain milk, which would generally be available at school canteens, is exempt from sales tax. Most food, including healthy dietary food, is generally exempt from sales tax. However, confectionery is subject to the concessional rate of sales tax. (2) (a) School education in Australia is the constitutional responsibility of the State and Territory Governments, and as such the Commonwealth does not intervene in specific curriculum matters. However, the Commonwealth does have a strategic role in setting national directions and policies. In 1989, the State, Territory and Commonwealth Ministers of Education endorsed ten common and agreed national goals for schooling in Australia. Part of this strategy involves Health and Physical Education, which aims to expand students' knowledge and understanding of a range of issues, including ""the role of food"". This learning area includes a study of food's nutritional value, trends and other factors that influence dietary practices, and as such provides an opportunity to educate Australian children about the importance of healthy dietary habits. All States and Territories are implementing some version of this strategy in their own systems. In addition, the Department of Health and Family Services has informed me that it has already taken significant steps towards addressing the promotion of healthy dietary habits in Australian schools through the National Nutrition Education in Schools Project (NNESP), and the National Health Promoting Schools Initiative. The NNESP undertook intensive research and development in the area of health, food and nutrition education in schools over the period from December 1992 to June 1995 with the aim of encouraging health promoting behaviour in the area of food and nutrition in students from kindergarten to year 12 throughout Australia. The project maintains that students must not only develop food and nutrition knowledge, but must also develop skills in critical thinking, decision making, problem solving, food preparation, food selection and advocacy. The project IS now in its second phase with educators being trained in providing the necessary skills to students. The National Health Promoting Schools initiative seeks to build on and learn from international, national, state and local community initiatives to establish a supportive environment of promoting the health and well-being of all members within the school community, through the establishment of school based policies and activities to support the lessons taught in the classroom. The activities proposed to be undertaken within the project aim to build capacity to support the health promoting schools concept at local, state and national levels. (b) As noted above, the current sales tax system already provides concessional treatment to flavoured milk, while plain milk is exempt from sales tax. In addition, most food, including healthy dietary products, is already exempt from sales tax. Committee of Attorneys-General Meeting: Human Rights (Question No. 1350) Mr Melham asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 25 February 1997: Did the Standing Committee of Attorneys General at its meeting in Adelaide on 2-3 November 1995 unanimously agree to establish a working party on human rights; if so, (a) was the working party established (b) when and where has the working party held meetings and (c) what has been dietary the outcome of those meetings.

(b) The meetings were held on: 31 January 1996-Sydney; 14 June 1996-Sydney; 12 September 1996-Sydney; 7 February 1997-Sydney; (c) Matters discussed at these meetings have included: · 'best practice' procedures under Commonwealth and State antidiscrimination legislation; · grounds for discrimination and exemptions under Commonwealth and State anti-discrimination legislation; · reporting on the outcome of the HREOC review; · future cooperative arrangements on human rights; · development of Optional Protocols to the Convention on Rights of the Child and to the Convention Against Torture; · arrangements for State and Territory representation on international delegations; · details of forthcoming UN meetings, conferences and working groups; and reports to UN bodies. Vietnam War (Question No. 1351) Mr Cobb asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 25 February 1997: (1) During what period did Australians serve in the Vietnam War. (2) Is he able to provide a breakdown of how many personnel served in combat and other roles. (3) How many personnel died (a) in Vietnam and (b) since returning to Australia. (4) What were the causes of death referred to in part (3) and how many and what percentage of those were war caused. (5) How many personnel committed suicide (a) in Vietnam and (b) each year since returning to Australia.

(7) What was the average age of those who died after returning from Vietnam and how does this compare with Australian death rates. (8) How many personnel in each category referred to in part (2) died after returning due to (a) suicide and (b) other causes. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I will be shortly releasing the report of the Vietnam Veterans Mortality Study which will provide substantial information about deaths of male Vietnam veterans. The report analyses the 3,249 deaths that were reported in Australia up to 31 December 1994. (I) The Department of Defence has advised that most Australian personnel served in Vietnam between 23 May 1962 and II January 1973, a small guard unit remained in the Embassy until 1 July 1973 and some RAAF personnel served during the evacuation of the Embassy in April 1975. (2) This matter falls within the portfolio responsibilities of my colleague, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel. (3) Of the 58,230 male Army, Navy and Air Force personnel who served in Vietnam 499 died in Vietnam. A further 3,249 died between the time they returned to Australia and 31 December 1994. (4) The mortality study report will show the number of deaths by cause of death. However, there is insufficient data available to determine which deaths were war-caused. (5) I do not know how many personnel committed suicide in Vietnam. The mortality study identified 242 deaths of Vietnam veterans due to suicide since returning to Australia, but estimates that the actual number may be around 280 (the report of the mortality study elaborates on this point in greater detail). The number of identified suicide deaths by year of death are detailed in the following table: 1978 1979 1980 1981 6 7 4 10 10 7 5 8 8 14 1992 1993 1994 9 13 15 17 18 14 15 7 8 (6) At the time of their first tour of service in Vietnam the average age of Australian personnel was: Army-24 years; Navy-23 years; and Air Force-28 years. (7) The average age at death of male veterans who have died since returning from Vietnam is 47 years old. The mortality study report will provide detailed comparisons with Australian death rates. (8) I am unable to provide this information. Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport: Safety (Question No. 1373) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 99 (Hansard, 20 August 1996, page 3289) concerning air safety incidents, how many safety incident reports were received involving air traffic at or over Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport between 4 May and 31 December 1996. (2) Will he request Airservices Australia and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation to make safety incident reports available to those Members of Parliament whose electorates border the airport. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) During the period from 4 May to 31 December 1996 there were no accidents reported to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI). However, the Bureau did receive reports on 161 incidents in this period. None of these incidents were assessed as representing a serious safety deficiency, a concern for public safety or the need for safety action by BASI. (2) The BASI prepares a weekly summary of air safety occurrences covering all of Australia including operations at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. This information is disseminated to the Department of Transport and Regional Development, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Airservices Australia. These summaries are available on request from BASI. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders: Australian Armed Forces (Question No. 1381) Mr Eoin Cameron asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 27 February 1997: (1) How many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have served in Australia's armed forces since, and including, the Boer War. (2) How many serving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander servicemen or women have been (a) killed in action and (b) wounded on active service since, and including, the Boer War. (3) How many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are currently serving in Australia's armed forces. Mrs Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question is as folIows: (1 )-(2) Other than through the 1993 Australian Incidents Defence Force (ADF) Ethnicity Survey, the ADF does not record the cultural background of its members. In order to obtain this information, it would be necessary to manually examine each personal file held within the ADF, and the man power and financial resources are not available to accomplish this task. (3) The most recent complete collection of data on indigenous ADF membership is the 1993 ADF Ethnicity Survey. At that time the representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander personnel in full-time continuous service with the ADF, numbered as follows: Navy--40-45 (0.25%) . Army-390-400 (1.4%) . Air Force-30-35 (0.13%) The overall ADF proportion is approximately 0.7%. The ADF is currently implementing a strategy specifically to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander recruitment and career development in the ADF. Austudy Recipients: Electoral Division of Namadji (Question No. 1396) Ms Ellis asked the Minister representing th'o': Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 3 March 1997: (1) How many Austudy recipients resided in the post code areas of (a) 2606, (b) 2607 and (c) 2900--2906 on 1 January 1997.

(2) What has been the cost of each overseas visit the Minister has undertaken since entering the Ministry. (3) Has the Minister utilised frequent flyer points for overseas or internal flights on official business in accordance with the direction issued by the Minister for Administrative Services in April 1996; if so, to what extent were points used and on which overseas visits were they used; if not, why not and what action is being taken. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (a) I have undertaken one overseas visit since 18 September (details of this visit were included in my answer to House of Representatives Question No. 740 which was circulated in H of R Hansard of 4 December, at pp 7791-7792); (b) & (c) I was absent from Australia from 23-26 October and spent three days in Indonesia. (2) According to advice from the Department of Administrative Services (DAS), the accounts they have received to date in relation to the above overseas visits total $4501 (for my visit to New Zealand) and $8664 (for my visit to Indonesia). DAS advice is that it 'meets the cost of accommodation, meals, telephone and fax calls, airfares, passport costs, health vaccinations and trip associated medication, baggage insurance, car hire, ground transport, incidentals (tips and gratuities etc) and personal hospitality for the Minister, the Minister's spouse and the Minister's personal staff'. (3) Consistent with Government policy, I look to the opportunity to use frequent flyer points to offset the cost of official travel wherever possible, and will continue to do so. The opportunity to redeem points, however, is restricted by the airlines' conditions, eg not all flights have seats available for frequent flyer use, not all destinations can be reached using a specific carrier and their partner airlines, and there are 'block out' periods by the airlines (peak times) when no seats are available. Department of Foreign Affairs Paper Supplies: Australian Fibre Content (Question No. 1443) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 5 March 1997: Have samples of the paper products purchased by the Minister's Department been examined by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories or private sector alternatives to cstablish or verify the Australian fibre content. l\1r Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. Department of Trade Paper Supplies: Australian Fibre Content (Question No. 1444) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 5 March 1997: Have samples of the paper products purchased by the Minister's Department been examined by the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories or private sector alternatives to establish or verify the Australian fibre content.

Mr Costellcr-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Paper products purchased by the Department of the Treasury are purchased using the Buyers' Guides published by Purchasing Australia. The Buyers' Guides state that: ""Most of the products in the Buyers' Guide are manufactured in Australia. In some cases they may incorporate imported raw materials."" Enquires with Purchasing Australia have confirmed that no tests to determine Australian fibre content of paper products have been carried out. Purchasing Australia further advise that an examination of paper products is unable to determine country of origin of the fibres contained therein. Environmental Impact Statements: Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy Airport Sites (Question No. 1465) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 6 March 1997: (1) Has the closing date for the environmental impact statement on the Badgerys Creek and Holsworthy airport proposals been extended; if so, what public consultation has been organised. (2) Has he or his Department given an instruction to Rust PPK not to undertake further public consultation; if not, will he ensure that Rust PPK undertakes further public consultation. (3) Is he able to say whether correspondence from Rust PPK to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation refers to a Departmental instruction not to have further public consultations; if so, will he provide details. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) As I announced in Parliament on 26 February 1997, the timetable for the preparation of the draft environmental impact statement (EIS) has been extended by at least two months. An intensive schedule of meetings, mobile displays and community access days is planned to continue throughout the EIS process. (2) No. One of the initiatives being taken in the EIS process for the second airport is the release of discussion papers before the release of the draft EIS. The first, which was released on 5 February 1997, covered aviation traffic forecasts and a paper on the preliminary airport master plans was released on 19 March 1997. Papers outlining the approach to be taken to the assessment of aircraft noise and the options for road and rail access to the airport sites were released on 15 April 1997. A paper is expected to be released shortly on preliminary flight paths. The resources allocated by Rust PPK to the community consultation program will increase, if necessary, to respond to community interest in these papers. (3) The Department has advised me that in correspondence from Rust PPK to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation dated 26 February 1997, Rust PPK indicated that: ""Due to recent discussions with the Department of Transport, all information days have been postponed for several weeks."" The letter referred to a decision to delay further , iformation days until release to the community of tnfonnation on the preliminary airport master plans Office ASL 25 March 1996 National Office New South Wales Queensland South Australia TClsmania being considered at both airport sites. No information days which had been advertised in the press and elsewhere were postponed. While a number of information days were delayed, Rust PPK has continued with the other elements of its consultation program. The community access centre has remained open, mobile displays have been held throughout the region and Rust PPK has attended a number of community group meetings. Preliminary master plans for the proposed airport development were released by the Government on 19 March 1997. Brochures outlining the approach to be taken to the assessment of aircraft noise and the options for road and rail access to the airport sites were released on 15 April 1997. In response Rust is in the process of organising a series of information days for May 1997. These will complement the ongoing elements of the community consultation program. Up to date information on community consultation activities can be obtained by telephoning the Second Sydney Airport Community Access Centre on 1800818017 (toll-free).

(2) I am advised by my Department that the cost of purchase of new equipment and of recommissioning of existing equipment was approximately $2155. Department of Transport and Regional Development: Hire Car Companies (Question No. 1537) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister of Transport and Regional Development, upon that part of the notice, on 19 March 1997: (1) Which hire car companies have been used by the Minister's Department in the period since 30 April 1996. (2) What sums had been paid to the companies referred to in part (1) up until 28 February 1997. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Hire cars from a range of operators, including DASFLEET and other commercial hire companies such as AVIS and HERTZ, have been used when staff have travelled on Departmental business. The Department's financial system records all travel by Sub-Program. Hire car transactions are only one element of the travel records. I am not willing to commit resources to disaggregate travel transaction records to compile information for this question. Great Australian Bight (Question No. 1549) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 20 March 1997: (I) What level of protection is appropriate for the offshore canyons located in the Great Australian Bight. (2) Is a Marine Park proposed for the Great Australian Bight; if so (a) will all the offshore canyons be included and (b) will breeding places for squid and fish be protected from fishing. (3) Will the Minister publish maps showing the location of the offshore canyons to enable full community input to the decision-making process. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) The government recognises the important conservation values of the Great Australian Bight. I and my department are currently considering what level of protection is appropriate to protect those conservation values. (2)(a) & (b) Yes. A marine park is under consideration for an area of Commonwealth waters in the Great Australian Bight. The details of the proposal, including the area involved and management intentions, are still being finalised. Further details will be provided for public comment if it is decided to proceed with a Notice of Intent regarding the proclamation of the park. (3) A map specifying the area under consideration for proclamation as a marine park will be available if a Notice of Intent is issued. Broaderscale maps which include information on the topography of the margins of the continental shelf off the Great Australian Bight and adjacent areas are available commercially. Map folios from the Offshore Resource Maps series for the Esperance, Ceduna and Eyre regions are available from the Australian Geological Survey Organisation. Australia Council: Music Fund (Question No. 1551) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice. on 20 March 1997: (1) Did SYNERGY percussion receive funding for its 1997 program of activities from the Music Fund of the Australia Council; if so, what sum was provided. (2) Was a joint project with the ELISION ensemble excluded from the funding approved; if so, what was the reason for the exclusion. (3) Was funding for ELISION to perform works by composers Chris Dench and Michael Smetanin also excluded from funding; if so, why. (4) What modernist music projects have been funded through the Music Fund for 1997. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The Australia Council has provided the following advice: (l) Yes, $80,000. (2) Yes. The 1997 Program Grant application from SYNERGY requested $140,000. This represented a 100 per cent increase on SYNERGY's 1996 grant and the proposed program of activities was much larger than in 1996. The Program Grant category was particularly competitive in this grant round and the Fund was unable to provide the requested level of support. In these circumstances, the Fund felt that its grant should be focused on maintaining SYNERGY's core subscription season, not on expanding its activities. The joint project with ELISION, proposed as a 'value added incentive' to SYNERGY's core SUbscription season, was therefore not supported. (3) No. ELISION is in receipt of a multi-year grant of $67,000 for 1996 and 1997, approved by the Music Committee of the previous Perfonning Arts Board in September 1995. Under the terms of this grant, ELISION is required to submit a program of activities and budget, but the specific works included in this program are determined by ELISION. The Music Fund does not place stylistic restrictions on repertoire choice by funded ensembles. (4) The Music Fund is supporting a range of experimental and innovative music projects in 1997, including commissions, recordings and performance projects. The Fund is also supporting modemist composers directly through Development Grants and Fellowships and indirectly through the services of the Australian Music Centre which receives major support from the Fund. ELISION's 1997 program includes work by Richard Barrett and Brian Ferneyhough, both of whom are prominent composers in the ""New Complexity"" genre. SYNERGY's 1997 program includes two commissioned works by Elena Kats Chemin, one of Australia's most esteemed and innovative women composers. Michael Smetanin has received one of only three $80,000 Fellowships awarded by the Musi- Fund to support a program of work over two years, 1997 and 1998. He proposes to develop a number of new works, including a third opera, and undertake a professional development residency in the Netherlands to further his knowledge of new technologies in music. Chris Dench's work has been supported in a Presentation and Promotion project by Soundscapes magazine. The project involves production and distribution of a sampler CD to be included in a special issue of the magazine. Chris Dench's work will be represented on the CD and will therefore receive national and international exposure via the magazine's distribution network. (Question No. 1552) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 March 1997: (I) Has he received representations on possible future uses of HMAS Perth once the vessel is decommissioned. (2) What proposals are under consideration. (3) When will the vessel be decommissioned. (4) When will a decision be made about the future of the vessel once it is decommissioned. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (I) Yes. (2) This information is commercial-in-contidence, therefore, it would not be appropriate to comment on the content of any such proposals. (3) The HMAS Perth will be decommissioned in 2000. (4) A decision regarding the future of the HMAS Perth will be made in late 1999, after all available disposal options have been evaluated and considered on their merits. It should also be noted that the primary objective in disposing of any public asset is to maximise the return to the Commonwealth, and this is normally achieved through a public open tender process. The Navy will assess any proposal where it can be demonstrated that substantial benefits will accrue to a local economy by re-utilising an obsolete platform. Commonwealth Employment Service: Internet Site (Question No. 1559) Mr Sawford asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 20 March 1997: (1) Has a commitment been made to maintain the Commonwealth Employment Service internet site with daily updates of job vacancies. (2) Has the frequency with which job vacancies are updated on the site diminished; if so (a) why and (b) will it be rectified. Dr Kemp--The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: HMAS Perth (I) Yes. The Department is committed to daily updates of the Australian Job Search (AJS) section of the DEETY A Internet site which lists current CES lodged vacancies. Job vacancies are updated each weekday morning and on Saturday. (2) There were initial problems with daily updates when the site was first implemented in September 1996. Since that time, the site has operated reliably with the exception of the period from 13 to 18 March 1997 when a scheduling program error occurred which was quickly rectified. The job search site attracts around 30 000 hits per day and is being monitored closely by the Department to ensure that the daily update schedule operates correctly. Lucas Heights: Synroc Development (Question No. 1568) Mrs Vale asked the Minister for Science and Technology upon notice, on 20 March 1997: (l) Will a reprocessing facility be sited at Lucas Heights, NSW; if so, is he able to say whether there are post-cold war comparable examples of siting a facility in a residential area at the edge of a major city anywhere else. (2) Has his attention been drawn to statements attributed to the Minister for Resources and Energy claiming that to process all the accumulated spent Hifar fuel to Synroc would involve significantly lower levels of radioactivity than those associated with ANSTO's current radiopharmaceutical production; if so, is the documentation supporting this claim available to the publIC. (3) Would facilities from a pilot plant remain at Lucas Heights if a commercial scale facility was subsequently built elsewhere. (4) Are there instances elsewhere where a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant, not just a reactor, has been decommissioned and completely decontaminated; if so, what are the details. (5) What is the long term business plan for Synroc development. (6) Will the details of the Synroc project stage schedules, engineering specifications, costs and projected savings or returns of the project be publicly available. (7) Was the proposal discussed at the ANSTO Community Consultation Meeting prior to media announcements; if not, why not. (8) Has consideration been given to developing an Australian built and funded demonstration Synroc plant at a contaminated overseas site where high level liquid waste is stored. Mr MCGauran-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Government is still considering the management options for ANSTO's stockpile of spent fuel rods. It is too early to be able to give a definitive answer as to what management option the Government will take and where a facility, if any, would be built. (2) Yes I am aware of the statement made by Senator Parer. The statement that processing the spent fuel rods would involve significantly lower levels of radioactivity than those already associated with ANSTO's current radio-pharmaceutical production is based on calculations by ANSTO that radio-pharmaceutical production on site involves processing 30kg of irradiated uranium containing 10 17 Becquerels of radioactivity each year, while processing one hundred spent fuel rods a year would involve only some 14kg of irradiated uranium and about fifty times Jess radioactivity. These calculations do not appear in any publicly available document or report. (3) See answer to 1. The Government does not have under consideration the building of a commercial scale facility anywhere in Australia. (4) The recent OECD publication, 'The NEA Cooperative Program on Decommissioning-The First Ten Years 1985-95', lists three irradiated uranium processing facilities that have been decommissioned and completely decontaminated, and a number of others are in various stages of decommissioning. The three completed decommissioning operations are the AT - I reprocessing plant in France, the BNFL Co-Precipitation Plant in the UK and the Tunneys Pasture Facility in Canada. (5) Synroc business plan is a Commercial-inConfidence document which I am not at liberty to disclose. (6) Should the Government choose the processing option, the proposal would undergo environmental assessment in accordance with the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) ACT 1974. Under this process various details on the Synroc project would become available to the public. (7) No. It would be premature for ANSTO to discuss a proposal for siting a reprocessing facility at Lucas Heights before the Government has given the matter its due consideration. (8) Yes, consideration has been given to developing a Synroc plant overseas. For example, ANSTO has held discussions with UK, French and US organisations active in waste remediation; details of these discussions are however commercial-inconfidence. Lucas Heights Reactor (Question No. 1571) Mr Martyn Evans asked the Minister for Science and Technology upon notice, on 24 March 1997: Has an interdepartmental committee been formed since 2 March 1996 to consider matters related to either the reprocessing of spent fuel rods from the Lucas Heights reactor or the relocation of the reactor to another site; if so, when did or will the committee report. Mr MCGauran-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: No. An interdepartmental committee has not been formed to report on these issues. Australian Defence Industries: Staff (Question No. 1574) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel, upon notice, on 25 March 1997: What is the (a) number of and (b) job title of full time and part-time civilian and uniform staff positions at the Australian Defence Industries facilities located at (i) Garden Island, NSW, (ii) Bendigo, Vic.

Mrs Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: AD! Limited is a company established under the Corporations Law. Although Government owned, ADI is a separate legal entity from the Commonwealth and its employees are not public servants. AD! does not employ any uniformed staff. The numbers of personnel and their classifications, by facility, is commercial-in-confidence to the company. AD! Limited's 1996 Annual Report contains information about the total number of people employed by the Company in Australia and overseas. At pages 13, 15 and 17 of the report the employees in each of the Company's major business groups, Operations, Systems and Technology are stated to be 2013, 239 and 887 respectively. ADI subsequently acquired the business assets of Stanilite Electronics and some 400 additional personnel joined Systems Group. Child Support Agency: Average Weekly (Question No. 1583)  the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 24 March 1997: (1) Did the consultative committee originally recommend that, for the purposes of the Child Support Scheme, the cap on non custodial parents should be twice average weekly earnings (AWE); if so, was the recommendation made on the belief that expenditure on children tends to plateau on high incomes and then fall. (2) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to contemporary research validating this contention; if so, what research. (3) Has the Minister's Department commissioned research on this subject. (4) Is the Minister able to say whether the cap was increased to 2.5 times AWE because custodial parents needed to obtain departures from the formula in the Family Court. (5) Does the Child Support Review Office obviate the necessity to seek departures. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes. Yes. (2) No. The Department of Social Security is not aware of any contemporary research validating this contention for Australian circumstances. (3) No. (4) No-as the decision was made by a previous Government, the Minister cannot be certain why the decision was taken to peg the cap at 2.5 times AWE. (5) No-in fact the Child Support Review Office was established for the purpose of enabling departures to be obtained outside the Family Court. World Heritage Committee (Question No. 1586) Mr Latham asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 26 March 1997: (1) Further to the Minister's answer to question No. 1248 (Hansard, 20 March 1997, page 2557), (a) on what date, (b) to which persons or organisations, (c) for what amounts and (d) for what purposes were payments made with respect to the nomination of the Sydney Opera House in its Harbour Setting. Earnings (2) On what date and by whom was the nomination received by the Australian Government. (3) Is the Minister able to say on what date and by whom the nomination was despatched by the NSW Government. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for the Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) (a)-(d) The Commonwealth provided $6812 for an expert workshop in July 1993 to examine the case for a re-nomination of Sydney Opera House and make recommendations on the likely area to be nominated and the specific criteria that it would best meet. This funding covered all costs of the workshop, including participation by eight experts,  James, Mr Jim Kerr, Mr Brian Pearson, Ms Jennifer Taylor, Ms Sarah Titchen and Mr Duncan Marshall. The Commonwealth provided funds to the New South Wales government in two instalments to undertake an assessment and the preparation of a re-nomination. The first instalment of $90,293 was paid to the then New South Wales Department of Planning in July 1994 to allow commencement of the assessment work. The balance, of $102,000 was forwarded to the then New South Wales Department of Urban Affairs and Planning in June 1995, following signature of an Agreement between the two governments on 16 June 1995. The Agreement set out responsibilities regarding the assessment and nomination process. As required by the Agreement, the New South Wales government was responsible for the disbursement of all funds. The New South Wales Government also made contributions to the project from various State agencies. (2) The Prime Minister received the nomination in n the New South Wales Government on 26 July 19':16. This receipt was too late to allow submission to the World Heritage Committee for consideration that year.

The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) is responsible for inspection and certification of all meat and livestock exported from Australia. AQIS insists on the presentation of a Wildlife Protection permit (for species under export control of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982) from my Department before issuing AQIS export approval. AQIS export approval has been granted for a number of consignments that complied with the Export Control Act 1982.

Dementia Counselling Mr Andren asked the Minister for Family Services, without notice, on 25 February 1997: June 1995 June 1996 19 March 1997 2 3 o 2 3 1 34 34 8 18 15 43 9 8 7 2 3 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 70 69 64 (1) are you aware that the Mid Plan report on the National Action Plan for Dementia Care noted the vital importance of dementia counselling services, largely developed through State Alzheimer's associations. (2) Are you aware that the report detailed the significant advantages of co-locating such counsellors with the Aged Care Assessment Teams. (3) If you are aware of this, why is the Government withdrawing funding for the five rural counsellors in New South Wales, including Orange and Dubbo, and expecting such services to be mainstreamed through the Home and Community Care service. which is under-resourced and underskilled, to carry out such a vital service for the increasing number of home based rural dementia patients. Mrs Moylan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) I am aware of the report and the Department of Health and Family Services has been working with the Reference Group in response to the proposed actions. (3) The Counselling services are an initiative of the National Action Plan for Dementia Care. The Government recognises that the needs of people with dementia and their carers will not cease when the Action Plan ends. In order to assist the Government in its consideration of how the needs of people with dementia and their carers can continue to be met in the future I have invited members of the Reference Group for the National Action Plan for Dementia Care to give me their views on the next steps for dementia care in Australia. I will consider their recommendations and the outcomes of the National Action Plan for Dementia Care in due course. Implications for Home and Community Care Program services will be assessed as part of these considerations. In the meantime the Aged Care Structural Reform Package announced in the August 1996 Budget includes measures to improve the care of people with dementia. The measure to introduce a single classification system and assessment instrument across the residential care sector from 1 July 1997 will ensure that residents will be funded according to their care needs no matter where they are. The development of this new instrument will take proper account of both the physical and mental frailly of residents match this to an appropriate level of funding. Consistent with and complementary to the Refonn Package is the National Carer Action Plan which aims to improve support for care,s, including carers of People with dementia. It is clearly evident that adequate training and appropriate buildings and environment are critical to the appropliate care of people with dementia. The Government believes that if the objective of good quality dementia care is to be achieved fully, this care must come primarily from mainstream and care systems. The August 1996 Budget measures are designed to achieve this.",209
