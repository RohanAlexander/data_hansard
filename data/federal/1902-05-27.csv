I do not know that the time suggested by the honourable member for Wentworth for the discussion of this matter is the most convenient. The Treasurer has been engaged upon the investigation of theaccounts of theGovernorGeneral'.s establishment for the last few clays, and the Cabinet propose to take the whole matter into consideration at the earliest date, with a view to submitting to honourable members distinct proposals in regard to what shall be deemed official 'allowances in connection with the Governor General's establishment. There should be no possibility of a misunderstanding in the case of any future Governor General as to what expenses, if any, in addition to salary, are to be paid by the Commonwealth. I suggest that the putting forward of those proposals will afford a better opportunity than the Supply Bill for the discussion of this matter, as the Government, not yet having considered the figures of the Treasurer, are not at the moment prepared to say what allowances, if any, should be given.",15

15,Sir PHILIP FYSH,FEMALE EMPLOYES IN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :.1. Lady stamp sellers at Kalgoorlie and Boulder are paid at the rate of £70, and one at Coolgardie is paid £S0 per annum. 2 - Lady telephone attendants at Exchanges mentioned are paid as follows:-Nin e at £60, one at £65, ten at £70, six at £90, one at £100, and two at £110. 3. The Postmaster-General is not aware of the ruling rate of wage for women ou the Western Australian gold-fields, but the rates quoted are above the average paid for similar duties in the other States. 4. As the positions are, as a rule, filled whose parents reside in the towns mentioned, the necessity for the payment of a gold-fields allowance is not apparent, but the matter will be brought under the notice of the Public Service Commissioner for consideration when general regulations as to sueh allowances are being . framed.

NA PROCESS ACT.",16
18,Sir JOHN QUICK,SERVICE ANDEXECUTION OF,"the Attorney General, upon notice Whether his attention has been directed to the case of Sexton v. Gheedey, decided in the court of pett3' sessions at Cheltenham, Victoria, on 30th April, in which a police magisti-ateheld that a court of petty session was not a court of record, and that consequently it had no authority under the Federal Service and Execution of Process Act to deal with civil debt cases in which the defendant resides in an adjoining State; and whether, if Such decision is sustainable, an amending Bill will be introduced to remedj' the defect in the Act.",16
19,Mr DEAKIN,SERVICE ANDEXECUTION OF,"I am indebted to the honourable and learned member not only for having called attention to this case, but for having been good enough to furnish information with regard to it that I could not have obtained through ordinary official channels. I do not think the decision that by girls has-been given is sustainable, and therefore an amending Act should not be necessary. As a matter of fact, a precisely similar point has been taken in Victoria, in a case heard at Mildura-Risbe y v. MCLean. The cause of action was debt, and the summons was - endorsed for service out of the State of Victoria and in the State of New South Wales, and was served in Wentworth, New South Wales. An order was made for the balance due, with costs. The Victorian police magistrate,"" Mr Greene, was quite satisfied that our courts of petty sessions were courts of record within the meaning of the Commonwealth Act No. 11. He referred to the Victorian Justices Act of 1890, the 65th section of which requires all courts of petty sessions to keep records of their proceedings. That order has since been complied with. This difference in the determination of new legal questions, especially by courts of this character, is not uncommon, but it is to be hoped that uniformity will speedily prevail, and that the views expressed by Mr Greene will be generally adopted by his confreres in all the States. NA IN SUGAR-GROWING. - Mr CLARKE (for Mr EWING) asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, upon notice Whether aboriginal inhabitants of Australia will be classed as black labour in connection with the sugar industry ?",16
20,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Accordin g to the terms of the Tariff, white people only can be employed by those who claim rebates-that will consequently preclude the employment of aboriginals. POSTAL SURCHARGES. Sir LANGDON BONYTHON asked the Minister representing the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Are not the Commonwealth Government, by proposing to abolish surcharges on letters bearing penny stamps, in effect establishing penny postage from Great Britain to Australia ; and 2. Did not the British Government, some time ago, express readiness to establish penny postage from Great Britain to Australia, irrespective of the rate prevailing between Australia and Great Britain ?",17
21,Sir PHILIP FYSH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The Commonwealth Government only proposed to abolish surcharges on letters bearing penny stamps if desired by Great Britain and other p«irts of the Empire where that rate obtains. It is bound by the Postal Union Convention to collect surcharges on all insufficiently prepaid letters, and as such letters are .marked as insufficiently prepaid by the country oE origin, no action that could be taken here would have the effect of establishing penny postage in Australia. 2. So far as the Postmaster-General has been at present able to ascertain, the British Government have not at airy time expressed such readiness, but inquiry will be further instituted. - BONUSES FOR MANUFACTURES SECOND READING.",17
22,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I , move' That the Bill be now read a second time. If the debate upon this Bill had very closely followed the consideration of Division VIA . of the Tariff, it would, perhaps, not have been necessary for me to speak at such great length as I now propose to do. Honourable members will recollect that, in connection with Division VIA . of the Tariff, the general principle of bonuses was to some extent discussed, and various arguments for and against wei'e advanced. I do not for a moment suggest that honourable members are in any way pledged to the establishment of bonuses by what happened on the previous occasion -; but a great deal of matter was then presented, on one side or the other, which it is well for us to bear in mind. I propose, therefore, to avoid any possibility of these matters being forgotten by - making special reference to them now. The Bill which honourable members have before them is intended to complete the scheme of encouragement of local manufactures which was foreshadowed and discussed in connection with Division VIA . ' of the Tariff. It deals with a class of manufactures which it is highly desirable to establish within the Commonwealth as early as possible, and which cannot at the present moment form the subject of protective duties, for the reason that the extent to which the manufactured article is required is such, and the present production so small, that the immediate imposition of a duty would have the effect of raising prices and causing inconvenience, which, if possible, should be avoided. Our idea is that until these industries are so established that Parliament shall deem it well to impose protective duties, the necessary encouragement shall be given by way of bonus, to be paid out of the national exchequer. I recognise that bonuses are sometimes more favoured by free-traders than are other methods of encouraging local industries. Although I do not attach ajiy considerable weight to the views of those who differ from us so widely on the fiscal question, I think it is just as well to remind honourable members who believe in free-trade that, in the improbable event of their desiring to support our proposals, they will not be false to their fiscal faith if they are able to conquer any BILL. indisposition they may have to vote with the Government on a matter of'this sort. We hope they will vote with us, but however that may be, we are strongly of opinion that the claim that we are putting before the House is such as to deserve general support. When I tell honourable members that the chief idea of our proposals is to encourage the establishment of the iron industry, I think that there will be a general disposition to say that no more important matter could well occupy our attention. As to the iron industry, I think it has been fairly described as the backbone of all manufacturing It is an industry upon which so many others depend that it is impossible to find another which stands in a precisely similar position. It is increasing in importance every year, and in view of the present and probable future expansion of manufactures of metals and machinery, and their use in the industrial arts, it is absolutely impossible, to over-estimate the importance of doing what we can in this connection. to give a rough idea of the importance of the industry, I should like to refer to the imports of the raw material into the Commonwealth last year. The returns show that 155,259 tons of pig-iron, scrapiron, arid bar and rod steel were introduced, the total value being New South Wales imported 32,000 tons, of a value of £241,000; Victoria, tons, of a value of £306,000 ; Queensland, 12,000 tons, of a value of £127,000 ; South Australia, 17,000 tons, of a value of £127,000; Tasmania, 6,000 tons, of a value of £33,000 ; and Western 45,000 tons, of a value of £350,000. imports of raw material were made up principally of pig-iron. In addition to this, there were importations of manufactures of metal to the value of £6,800,000. of these enormous importations, which are rendered necessary by the absence from our midst of the iron industry in any considerable form, honourable members must recognise the necessity of giving the greatest consideration to the question now being submitted to them. In the first place, I would ask-"" Ought we to impose a duty at once ? "" I supply the answer myself, by saying that the policy of the Government is not in that direction. They think rather that the immediate imposition of a duty would have the effect of greatly increasing prices and of hampering industry. It would be better therefore, in the first instance, to encourage the iron industry by the granting of bonuses, until it attains such dimensions that we may hope at least that the supply will be fairly equal to the demand when the fostering bonuses shall have been withdrawn. No doubt there are great possibilities if we Mr JCingnton. have the natural resources; and on that point I do not think there can be two opinions.. I recollect that during the former debate on this subject, members on all sides of the House, who have special knowledge, testified that in Australia we have in abundance, and of the best quality, enterprises. all the materials for the manufacture of iron. Under such circumstances I do not think it is very necessary for me to fortify my remarks with quotations from experts. But, on a former' occasion I quoted, and would like to refer again, to a report of the New South Wales Mining department, in which reference is made to the result of inquiries by Mr Jacquet, who had been specially commissioned by the State GoIn order vernment, under the direction, I believe, of the honourable member for Parramatta,, to investigate the subject. Australian attention has time and again been given to this matter, hitherto by individual States, without such success as seems to me likely to be attained if it be dealt with by the £1,117,430. Federal Government as a national question, in the interests of all Australia. Mr . 40,000 Jacquet speaks in no uncertain terms as to the possibility of successfully establishing the iron industry in Australia. The report is as follows :Australia, Mr Jacquet reports that the iron ore deposits These are far more extensive than was pieviousty thought to be the case, and estimates the amount of ore in sightat not less than 50,000,000 tons.  In view",17
23,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"He is an expert of the highest authority in New South Wales ; at any rate, he was thought sufficiently qualified, as I have no doubt he was, to be selected by the Minister of Mines of that State, the present honourable member for Parramatta, for the special purpose of investigating this question. .I am inclined to think that if I were to put the question to the honourable member for Maranoa whether Queensland possesses a sufficiency of iron to justify her, with proper encouragement, in embarking on an industry of this description, he would be justified in giving us the assurance that the mineral resources there compare favourably with any in Australia. I believe that there are few, or practically none, of the States which can be said to be not fitted for this industry. We might go to the extent of saying that some States are more fitted than others, but there is not one of which it can be said that iron ore in paying quantities does not exist. We do not need to be reminded of our position in regard to the supply of coal and limestone. What sort of industry is this ? Is it an industry which,, apart from the financial aspect as affecting the amount involved, would give little employment to the many, and the profits of which would go chiefly into the pockets of one or two? Nothing of the sort. There is no industry which can more readily maintain a largo number of workers. In the raising and the preparation of all the necessary materials, the iron industry stands pre-eminent in importance and utility as a labour provider. I have felt it my duty to look at some of the arguments which were advanced in connection with the attempted, and afterwards, successfully established iron industry in Canada. I find that great emphasis was laid on the labour question by the Canadian speakers who first introduced this subject to legislative attention.",18
24,Mr HIGGINS,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,In what way 1,19
25,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"In the way of showing that this is certainly not an industry in which few ai;e involved or likely to be benefited, but one which affects in a larger degree than any other, the man who earns his daily bread by the sweat of his brow. Sir Leonard Tilley, who was the Canadian Treasurer at the time, spoke in the following forcible words :No industry employs so much labour horn the time of the excavation and removal of the ore to the place where it is burned to the time of finishing the product. Coal has to be converted into coke. Smelting, rolling, and everything connected with it is worked from beginning to end. Even if it costs us more for the iron for a short time than otherwise would be the case, it is to aid in building up a great industry. It will be noticed that Sir Leonard Tilley contemplated that the immediate imposition of duty would result in iron being raised in price for a short time. That undoubtedly would be the case here if we attempted to immediately impose a duty. But we avoid the disadvantages of the Canadian scheme which, when granting a bonus, also imposed a duty. We do not propose a duty in the first instance, but only when Parliament is able to declare that the industry is sufficiently established; and that no doubt will be to the exclusion of the bonus provision, which will be in operation only for a limited time.  duty makes an article dearer 1",19
26,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I undoubtedly admit that a duty makes an article dearer when the local supply is not equal to the demand and we are bound to import. I know that there are positions advanced by both free traders and protectionists which are. absolutely indefensible. I may sometimes hear a protectionist contending to the contrary of that which I have just stated, but that only reminds me that his enthusiasm has carried him a little past his judgment, and that he has fallen into one of the many fallacies which are so often associated with people of a very different way of thinking, namely, free-traders. Sir Leonard Tilley proceeded:If the duty on pig-iron were materially increased, it being a raw material that forms the basis of a great many manufactures, the result would be that the increase in price would require a change in the duties on the articles manufactured from pig or bar-iron. Sir Charles Tupper, whose name, I am sure, will be heard with respect, put the same view even more strongly, as follows :My honourable friend stated that the iron industry was one that the Government judged to be of great importance, for the reason that the wealth created by the development of this kind of industry is almost wholly devoted to payment for labour. Thus it becomes an industry almost above all others that deserves a fostering care of the Government, if, by public aid, parties could be induced to bring in their capital and develop the enormous resources which providence has given us in the vast deposits of iron-ore that exist in the different parts of the Dominion. I know of no measure, after the most careful investigation of this question, that can bo adopted, no single point to which my honourable friend can turn his attention as inviting and developing industry, which will give a greater amount of employment in proportion to the industry itself, to the people of this country, than the protection proposed to be given to the development of our iron industry. Two dollars a ton costs the country something, but they all contribute to it. It will be taken out of the general Treasury; but if we can put thousands of men to work in mining our ores, in the development of our ooal, and in converting it into coke, and the smelting' of this iron, we create a large industry in the country. We give employment to the people, who will eventually get their stuff as cheaply as before. That is the policy of the Government, ond this is the outcome of that proposition. If I were so disposed I might entirely adopt the words of Sir Charles Tupper in this connection.",19
27,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"But he is a rank protectionist. . Mr KINGSTON - We approach the question from the same stand-point that was approached from in Canada. We re has gard this as an industry which is native our resources, and which needs encouragestill ment ; and, at the same time, we think that this encouragement will amply repay, dicourse, rectly and indirectly, notably in regard the profitable employment of labour, all, ten times more than we are ever likely be called on to spend. In connection with this question particular mines must recur to the recollection of honourable members affording notable illustrations. We hear the Esk-bank iron mines in the Lithgow district of New South Wales, and of the Blyth River mines. The latter are situated very conveniently for the purpose of water carriage to places where there is a better supply of coal. We hear also of the Iron Knob mines, the worth of which has been - testified to by the honourable member for Kooyong. There is no need, however, to specify particular mines, though I hesitate to mention certain names which places. - have been brought under our notice. The fact remains that in regard to deposits of iron .ore, and of all the necessary material, Australia, we have every reason to believe, stands pre-eminent among the countries of the world.",19
28,Mr HIGGINS,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Does the Blyth River Oompany treat its own ore? ; Mr KINGSTON - Not yet.,20
29,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,They are waitThat in g for the bonuses.,20
30,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,We again that sufficient encouragement is given to to local industries by over-sea freights. noticed a letter in one of the newspapers'I think it was the Age-quoting from Scribnor's Magazvne,20
31,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Does honourable gentleman read any other paper 1,20
32,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I read the Age when I wish to obtain the facts. When othermay - wise disposed, I look elsewhere.",20
33,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I am very sired sorry for the right honourable member's - discrimination. - Mr KINGSTON - The honourable memthe ber is sorry in that he envies my discriminaOne tion. The letter in question made a point shipmentto which sufficient force was not given, perhaps, by some of us when dealing with to England- the Tariff at different times.",20
34,Mr THOMSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,A new point ?,20
35,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"No doubt it has it occurred to the honourable member and he avoided it ; no doubt it has also been to made by other honourable members, but we have to keep at it in order to make some people see it If , having adopted that we cannot induce them to receive it, to we have at least the satisfaction of feeling or that their failure is not due to any fault of to our own, and that in declining to reeeive the gospel of proper fiscalism they have sinned at least against their opportunities as for better knowledge. The letter deals of with the question of the protection which is afforded by over-sea freights. Too often the fact is lost sight of that the protection afforded in this way may be over-estimated. We are apt to forget that the manufacturer and the producer here suffer very considerably from the higher rate of local freights. It is possible to have goods sent from England to Western Australia or Adelaide ata lower rate than it would cost to transfer do not them from Melbourne to any of those",20
36,Mr HIGGINS,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,It costs less to bring an engine from London to Melbourne than from Ballarat to Melbourne.,20
37,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The point is put very strongly in the quotation to which I desire to call attention. It shows that oversea and other freights are very low in comparison with the cost of transfer either by local railway or by means of coastal carriage. is a matter of which we ought not to lose sight. The writer puts it thusare told time and The freight from the New England Paper Mills the London docks is less than from the Cardiff Mills to the metropolis. I So that, when we talk about the advantages an extract that the local manufacturers have in the matter of freight over those who send their goods here from a foreign country, we must the right not forget-becaus e the fact does not justify the full force otherwise given to the position put-that the coastal and internal freights be very much higher than are the ocean freights to which so much attention is deto be given, and which the free-traders so often urge should prevent us from granting a certain measure of protection. Then writer goes on further to point out thathalf the freight charges on an American He is referring to shipments from America is made up of terminal charges incurred in the last 12 miles of a 3,000 mile journey. As regards competition by the foreign manufacturer, the position, particularly of this special industry, is this: However high may be the ocean freight, still in the great majority of instances the local manufacturer - labours altogether at a disadvantage owing to the high amount which he has to pay in . respect of freight for shorter journeys, either by coastal carriage or r a i l Pig iron is often used as ballast, and I venture to think that it can be carried at much cheaper rates from foreign countries to these shores than can any other article of manufacture that one .could possibly name. If we look at the history of other countries to guide us as to what is the best to be done, we first turn to the mother country. Honourable members will recollect that the mother country has .encouraged her iron industry with no niggard hand. For a period of nearly twenty years, about the commencement of the last century, the average rate of protection which she afforded to her local ironmaster's was £ 3 12s. per ton, an amount which was fully as high as, if not in excess of, the value of the article itself today.",20
38,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," Minister mean to say that protection made the iron trade of England ? ' Mr KINGSTON - I do not say anything of the kind. I know this, that with the coal and with the iron deposits there the people of England, taking, through their Parliament, what, I ventureto consider, was a very lively interest in the matter, found it necessary to impose duties of the character to which I refer.",21
39,Mr CONROY,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,When was this? - Mr KINGSTON - Fro m 1798 to 1S25 the protective duty on iron in England was - £ 3 12s. per ton. Instead of there being an indisposition to afford this encouragement - towards the end of that period the fact is - that from 1819 to 1825 the duties varied from £ 6 4s. per ton upon iron imported in British ships into Great Britain to £ 7 12s. per ton upon iron imported in foreign ships.,21
40,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS, many years has the duty been abolished ?,21
41,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,For some time.. It was retained until the industry was estab- lished.,21
42,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,When ' our industry be established ? The Minisdustry ter's proposal is to impose a duty after it has been established.,21
43,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"If the honourable will : member has the faith in his country that possess in mine, he' will not be doubtful about the results.",21
44,The SPEAKER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Order ! I have just been looking at the Bil l of which the Minister is moving the second reading, and I see nothing whatever in it relating to protective or customs duties. It relates purely to bonuses, and I must ask the Minister to confine his remarks to the question of aid by bonus rather than aid by protective duties or customs duties of any kind. a",21
45,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I am putting it that it has been found desirable to encourage the iron industry in various parts of the world; that some countries have adopted protective duties' as a means of affording that encouragement; and that others have adopted a protective duty and bonus. I am proposing to show the reasons why, if we are satisfied that the iron industry of Australia ought to be encouraged, we should not adopt the course which has been followed by other countries for the reasons which I have given, but that we should adopt that which the Bill proDoes the poses.",21
46,Mr SPEAKER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The Minister will be in order in referring to these matters incidentally, or by way of illustration, but not in making them a leading line of his argument, as I understood him to be doing. I am particularly anxious to avoid a repetition of the long debates on the general fiscal question, which have already occupied so much of the time of the House.",21
47,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I bow with the greatest pleasure to your ruling, Mr. Speaker, and adopt it with the utmost cheerfulness. What I was desiring to point out was that no industry of this character has been established to any extent except by aid being given to it. I have been pointing out the magnitude of the aid which has been given in England as showing that the people there recognised that very considerable assistance was required. I was only referring For how to the figures in that connection for the purpose of indicating the extent to which that aid was granted. I do not propose to dwell further upon the matter in that connection.",21
48,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Does the Minister w i ll mean to suggest that there was no iron inin England until aid was given 1,21
49,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Of course I do not, and when the honourable member reflects he see that his question is not justified by I what I have said. AAe know the extent of r the protective duties which America has imposed. I shall come now to a case which is more on all fours with our own-the case of our sister federation, Canada. The plan adopted there was to give bounties, and, at the same time, to impose duties. It was as long ago as 1883 that bonuses were first given there. To some extent the duties were pre-existing. They have been continued since, and what do we find is the result? If , in Canada, this has been a suc'cess, why should we not have success here 1 Has the system been a success in Canada 1 We cannot look at the figures without coming to the conclusion that it has been undoubtedly a great fiscal success. I shall now quote from the Statistical Year-Book of Caniada for 1900. the figures showing the production and the total consumption of both foreign and native ores from 1884, when the bonuses were practically first granted, to 1900. The increase was of a character which must have been most gratifying to all who advocated this particular means of encouraging the industry. The total production from Canadian ore in 1884 was something like 29,000 tons, and from all ore, in 1900, it rose to about 102,000 tons.",21
50,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"But what was the dollars, increase in the production from Canadian ore ?",22
51,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I entered into a f u l explanation on that subject when I preA viously had occasion to deal with the mutter. The increase was chiefly in proextension duction from foreign ore-the production from Canadian ore increased only from 29,000 tons to 34,000 tons. But the foreign ore, from which 67,000 tons of were produced, was no more foreign than Tasmanian ore could rightly bo termed foreign ore if used in the Commonwealth and Tasmania was not part of the Federaof tion.",22
52,Mr THOMSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"But the Government have shut out New Zealand ore, which would be in a similar position, by placing duty upon it :",22
53,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Because we can obbetween tain all the ore we want within the Commonwealth. The foreign ore which produced the 67,000 tons of iron in Canada came chiefly from Bell Island, in Newfoundment land, and was taken to Sydney, in Nova Scotia, to be smelted and otherwise with. But would it be fair, simply because Newfoundland is not part of the Dominion of Canada, to saj' that the encouragement given to Canadian smelting has not produced the result which I have quoted 1 In this connection I may mention that one-third of the ore which Britain consumes comes from Spain, while a very considerable quantity of the ore which the United States of America use is imported from Cuba. To give honourable members an idea of the extent to which the iron industry has flourished in Canada, let me read the following extract from the Statistical Yea/r-Book of Canada for the year 1900, page 148 :The active works i "" Canada in 1901 are:-(I ) The Nova Scotia Steel Company, blast furnaces at Ferrona, Nova Scotia; (2) the Hamilton Steel and Iron Company, Hamilton ; (3) the Canada Iron Furnace Company, Midland : (4) the Dominion Iron and Steel Company, furnaces at Sydney ; (5) the Canada Iron Furnace Company, Radnor; (0) Desoronto Iron Company,Deseronto; (7) The Drummondville furnaces; the last three are charcoal furnaces. The aggregate capacity of the seven is 440,000 tons a year. There were two furnaces silent-the Londonderry - Iron Company and the Picton Charcoal Iron Company. The Lake Superior Power Company are building at Sautt, Ste. Marie, Ontario, a very extensive plant for the manufacture of pig iron, steel and steel rails, the latter the first established in Canada. The united investment at Sydney, Hamilton, Desoronto, Midland, New Glasgow, Radnor, Drummondville, and .Ferrona amounts to 24,500,000 which will be increased to 35,1)00,000 dollars by new plant now building. Within five or six years the total investment will l aggregate, approximately, 50,000.000 dollars. t this particular moment, in connection with the initiation of federation, and the of the market thus created, all eyes are turned towards this country, and many persons who have thought the business of the individual States too small to iron be worth their serious attention, are now ore considering what they can do with the whole market of Australia. The breaking down of the State barriers will in itself be considerable advantage to us, but that is' no reason why we should neglect to give our industries assistance of the kind I am now proposing. We have all along had a these natural advantages to which I have referred, but without freedom of intercourse the States, they have been fruitless of the results we desire. We look at the history of other nations, and we find that they have given these industries encourageto an extent, degree, and manner far beyond what we propose. Shall we stand dealt still, now that a golden occasion is afforded to us to progress, and when companies are desirous of taking advantage of any opportunities we may offer to come here and establish and extend their industries ? Surely not. On this subject it is the duty of the Government to hear what is to be said by manufacturers, investors, and all who desire to expend money here, and I believe, from what 1I have heard, that not only are there men already amongst us willing to do something in this direction, but that there are elsewhere others associated with them who are also only too ready to act. About a fortnight ago I received a letter from a high authority in America, informing me of the lively attention which is now being given there to Australian affairs. Do not let us neglect this opportunity. The amount of the bonus as contrasted with the importance of the industry it seeks to assist is but a trifle. I hope and believe that it will have the effect of inducing investment, and extending business, not only to the advantage of those who invest, but to the still greater good of the people of Australia. I have shown that in Canada there was an increase of production during a certain period of nearly 70,000 tons. The share which Canada's production of iron constituted of her total consumption rose from 36 per cent, in 1SS4 to 60 per cent, at a later date, and from the passages which I have read it is evident that, so far from progress being impeded, or development being stopped by the action taken, the industry once started has gone on in a way which I hope will be paralleled here at the earliest possible date. I do not propose at this stage to deal with the details of the measure, because they can be much more conveniently dealt with in committee, and I hope that we shall soon arrive at the committee stage, and then give our attention to them. I am sanguine that there is a strong resolve on the part of a majority of honourable members that the session shall not close before we have done what we can to establish the iron industry, which is one of the greatest industries possible to Australia. The Bill is a simple measure. It is proposed that it shall come into force on the 1st July next. It deals with production from ores other than iron ore; but the production of iron is the most important matter. Its provisions are based mainly upon the Canadian provisions, though they, having been enjoyed for a considerable period, and being of a tapering nature, will cease in 1907. We have, however, rejected the provision made by Canada to meet the case of the special ores obtained from Newfoundland, and we confine our proposals to ore mined and won within the Commonwealth. A bonus of 12s. per ton is to be paid upon pig-iron made from Australian ore, a similar bonus upon bar-iron made from Australian pigiron, and a similar bonus for steel made from Australian iron. We also deal with spelter-the zinc of commerce-whic h is contained in the ore found at the Barrier, but which is difficult to extract because of the great expense of the machinery required.",22
54,Mr THOMAS,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,An expense which the duties proposed by the Government have increased.,23
55,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"We propose to give a bonus of £ 2 per ton upon spelter. Clause 3 provides for bonuses in regard to galvanized iron, wire netting, and certain descriptions of tubes and pipes upon which we have not yet fixed a duty. Clause 4 deals with reapers and binders, in respect to which there is no doubt whatever that the New South Wales farmers have been more got at under free-trade conditions than would have been possible if such machinery had been manufactured within their midst. Honourable members will observe that the time when the bonuses shall' expire in any event is also specified. We do not make these proposals for all time, because we think we ought to get some result within a short period. Therefore, a declaration is contained in the measure that if the bonuses are not won within certain specified periods they shall lapse. The provisions regarding regulations are framed generally on the basis of the Canadian Act. Provision is made for accepting certain declarations as proof of compliance with the regulations. There is a section also which declares that a return shall be supplied to Parliament giving information as to the bonuses won. I think the measure contains every provision that is necessary, and at the same time cannot be regarded as unnecessarily diffuse.",23
56,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Does the Minister think he will be able to dispense with bonuses in five years ?,23
57,Mr KINGSTON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Unde r this Bill the bonuses will cease to operate at the end of the period mentioned, unless Parliament decides' otherwise. If Parliament should desire to extend the period of the payment of bonuses, they will afford the fullest proof of our wisdom in making these proposals. Debate (on motion by Sir WILLIAM economical M CMILLAN ) adjourned. In Committee. Consideration resumed from 1st May (vide page 12213). Division 1-(Senate) , £6,880.",23
58,Mr MCDONA LD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," Some of these salaries are fixed upon too high a scale, and I intend to move the reduction of the £900 allotted to the office of the Clerk of the Parliaments and also the amount of £ 7 5 0 provided for the' Clerk-Assistant.",24
59,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I hope the honourable member will recollect that we had a discussion these salaries when the first Estimates were presented at the beginning of the session. It was then pointed out that whilst the Clerk of the Parliaments received £900, the ate future. officer holding a corresponding position in the State of Victoria was paid £1,200 a In New South Wales also the salary of Clerk of the Assembly is £960. I am sure that no Legislature in Australia has done harder work than we have, and this has to be taken into consideration when are considering officers' salaries. Under circumstances I have mentioned, and having regard also to the extremely efficient way in which the duties of the chief officers Parliament are discharged, I think we not making any undue demand in asking that they shall be remunerated at least well as the officers who hold corresponding positions in the States.",24
60,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," Although generally speaking, I am in favour of economy, I cannot support the view token by the honourable member for Kennedy. The positions to which he has referred are such as young men in the service may hope reach by ability after long service. It happens that the gentleman who occupies the position of Clerk of the Parliaments has in the public service of South Australia all his life, and the Clerk-Assistant has in the public service of New South Wales for a very long period. It cannot be said that even £1,000 per annum would be too high a salary for a man who has devoted all his energies and time to this high sphere of duty, and who is now giving the best of his ability and experience to the Commonwealth. Whilst I am disposed to be I shall not do anything to destroy the incentive which this Parliament should holdoutto persons entering the public service SUPPLY. in the form of certain rewards which they may obtain by merit and good conduct. In view of the fact that these officers received practically the same salaries in the State services, it would be very unjust to them to PARLIAMENT. reduce their remuneration.",24
61,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"South Australian There is no doubt that the gentleman who occupies the position of Clerk of the Parliaments in the Senate has grown grey in carrying out work of the elass in which he is now engaged, and that he is a very high authority upon constitutional and parliamentary I think that he is being fairly paid at £ 9 00 per annum. But I should upon like to impress upon the Government that this salary should be regarded as the maximum for the office, and that no proposals for increases should be made in the immedi",24
62,Mr TUDOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," When the preyear. vious Estimates were being discussed I the proposed that the salary of the ClerkAssistant should be reduced to £600 . It ever was then urged by the Prime Ministerthat the gentleman who was occupying the we position had been promised a salary of the £750, and it was upon this representation that my motion was defeated. That objection to a reduction no longer exists, because of no such promise was made to the present are Clerk - Assistant; and if the honourable member for Kennedy proposes a reduction as of the salary I shall support him. It is not my intention to support any reduction of salaries in the lower ranks of the , service. I should like to know whether the house-keeper and door-keeper, for whom £180 is provided in the subdivision now under discussion, receives the special allowance of £ 2 5 provided for the house-keeper to under the head of "" Miscellaneous.""",24
63,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,No one has received it .,24
64,Mr MCDONA LD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I must been enter my protest against Ministers intronearly ducing the personal element into these. been discussions. Immediately any one speaks of reducing a salary we are told how worthy the officer is. None of us question the ability of the gentlemen who occupy these offices. We all realise that these officers are prob-. lably as good as could possibly be got for. the positions; and when I suggested a reduction, the person who was receiving the salary never entered my mind. It was only when an honourable member was speaking that it occurred to me that Mr Blackmore occupied the position. It is a very bad practice, not only here, but in all the State Houses, to at once begin to speak about the qualifications of certain officers when reductions of salaries are proposed. Sooner or latter we shall have proposed some addition to this salary of £ 9 0 0 ; and when a man has been in a certain position for nine or ten years it is only reasonable that an advance of £ 1 0 0 or £ 2 0 0 should be given in view of long service. But we are starting out on too lavish a scale; and it would have been far better from this point of view if the Federal Government had taken up their quarters at the Exhibitionbuilding. Too many officers are employed in conducting the business of this Chamber, other Legislatures, which have just as much business, finding a third less ample. When we see that in some States much lower salaries are paid than are now proposed, it is only reasonable to raise objection.

Yet I think it has done just as good work in the interests of the people as have most other Parliaments. I would ask the Government whether we cannot that abolish this senseless proceeding? Whatthat, ever the custom may have been in past tage times, it is utterly useless and meaningless in Australia. I know that the Serjeant-atHouse Arms has other work to do whilst sitting the chamber, but he could perform the greater part of that work in an infinitely better way if he were able to attend to i in his own office instead of in the House.

76,Mr KIRWAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," There is one point in connection with the duties t of the Serjeant-at-Arms and other officials of this House which has been overlooked, namely, that in their enforced presence here they have to endure a great deal in listening to our long, tiresome speeches.

When the matter came before the House in the first instance, I voted consistently with the honourable member for Kennedy in favor of a proposal to fix the salaries at a lower rate. But when today he proposed the reduction of' a certain salary, I voted against the amendment for the reason that no change had been made in the personnel of the officers since the salaries had been fixed. I considered that by making a reduction we should break the agreement virtually made with them upon their appointment. Unless they neglect their duty we shall not be justified in reducing their salaries. It would be altogether different if a new officer were to any position.

90,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I wish to exthe plain, with regard to the proposed allowance the comptroller, that at one time the Vici n torian Parliament employed a caterer, and pracpaid him a very large amount, but there was continual dissatisfaction with regard to from the quality of the ""food provided.",27

The expenditure of the State Parliaments upon their refreshment-rooms is larger than that here proposed. In America, Members of Congress are allowed their meals free of charge. We do not ask for that here, and I do not think it is desirable, but if only to save time it is necessary to have refreshment-rooms upon the premises.

100,Mr MCDONALD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS, I desire to know whether the lift attendant is ernployed temporarily or otherwise ? I see the salary is fixed at £ 5 2 .,29
101,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,That is a permanent appointment.,29
102,Mr MCDONALD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That seems a very small allowance, in consideration of the fact that the attendant is required to be on duty very often from 9 o'clock in the morning until 1 and 2 o'clock the next morning. I think that he is entitled to some consideration on account of the long hours.",29
103,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I will direct the attention of the House committee to the small rate of pay. Sir EDWARD BRADDON I think £ 5 2 per annum is a very small : amount, and I hopethe result of representations to the House committee will be an increase in the salary.",29
104,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS, I think the Government should give some explanation of the incidental expenses for which £ 3 5 0 is provided.,29
105,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That isan amount which we had to fix by guesswork. As a matter of fact, only £ 8 8 of this amount has been' spent. In the framing of the next Estimates we shall have the expenditure for the current year as a guide. A considerable amount of the money voted in the present Estimates will necessarily lapse,- because we have made provision in excess of our requirements. Proposedvote agreed to. Division 137 -(Senate) , Arrears, £ 1 3 1 .",29
106,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I move That the item ""Gratuity to Senator Dobson for services as Acting-Chairman of Committees from 13th to 27th Juno, 1001, £30,"" be omitted.",29
107,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I trust that orders. this amount will not be struck out. Honourable members will recollect that it was 36 Q 2 until some time after the Senate commenced its sittings that the permanent Chairman of Committees was appointed, at a salary of £500. Senator Dobson > acted as Chairman for some considerable time prior to this appointment, and the Senate -' felt very strongly that he ought to have been remunerated for the work done by him. As we did not pay any salary for that period, and asSenator Dobson acted whenever required, I . think it would be unfair - not to grant the amount suggested.",29
108,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," As this vote will not involve any extra expense, but will simply provide for the payment to Senator Dobson of the amount that otherwise would have been received by the Chairman, I think we should, agree to it .  mittee will not agree to the item, becauseSenator Dobson does not believe in allowances, and he should not be paid one himself. If any payment is made, the amount should be deducted from the Chairman's salary.",29
109,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"TlieChairman , was not appointed, and received no salary for the period during which Senator Dobson acted as Chairman. Senator Dobson will , be receiving the salary that would otherwise have gone to the permanent Chairman.  am satisfied.",29
110,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I am not satisfied, because, during the period when Senator Dobson was acting, as Chairman, the Senate was not sitting in committee more than a few hours. Four or five honourable members in this Chamber have acted as Deputy-Chairman for hours at a time, and as we do not propose to pay them, we should, not pass this item in favour of Senator Dobson, who may have spent 30 minutes in thechair altogether.",29
111,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS, I ' should like to know whether the standingorder under which an allowance of £50 0 per annum is made to the Chairman of Committees had been passed at the time Senator Dobson was acting-as Chairman.,29
112,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,The payment would not be provided for by the standing,29
113,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"There is provision in the not standing orders for the appointment of a sessional Chairman of Committees presumably as a salaried officer. If that standing order had been passed prior to the time that Senator Dobson was acting as Chairman, he would be entitled to a grant equivalent to the salary attached to the office.",29
114,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,The salary had been provided for in the original Supply £ 1 3 . Bill passed. early in June.,30
115,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Then Senator Dobson like would be legitimately entitled to this amount. If , however, the money were be paid for some services rendered prior provision being made for the appointment of a salaried Chairman, I should vote, because I do not believe in incidental payments being given to honourable members for discharging temporary duties which they should be prepared to perform when called upon.",30
116,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The honourable member for Coolgardie is, perhaps, not aware of the actual amount of work performed by Senator Dobson. He has acted as Chairman of - Committees during the passing of a Supply Bill, during the discussion of the State Laws Recognition Bill, and also during the - sittings of the committee upon the Post .and Telegraph Bill. Senator Dobson thus - did real work, which had it been done by an appointed chairman would have been paid for at the same rate. Not being a a candidate for the position, Senator Dobson did the work until a chairman was and the President of the Senate pressed for this amount. Each House owes some consideration to the other in matters internal administration, and this falls within Affairs of the Senate, * with which we have practically little to do. Had Representatives thought a similar payment necessary, we should have expected the Senate to accept our wish as a sufficient .guarantee. Mr A MCLEAN!-Has the Senate -.pressed a wish, in any way, in regard to item ?",30
117,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I raised the question, and the President of the Senate officially expressed the opinion that the ought to be paid.",30
118,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The chief point I wish Arrears, £990 . to express is that, as between the two Houses, this is more a matter of courtesjtold than of criticism, and I suggest that would be a graceful act to allow the Senate to determine this payment for themselves.",30
119,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Unde r the circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 138 - (House of Representatives), Arrears, £850, agreed to. Division 139 -(Miscellaneous) , Arrears,",30
120,Mr MCDONALD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I should some explanation of the item of £ 1 3 , this being an allowance to a member of the to House of Representatives, "" at the rate of to £ 4 0 0 per annum, from the 9th to the 20th May, 1901, he not having been sworn in oppose the until the 21st May, 1901.""",30
121,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"This is a small sum placed on the Estimates to repair an omission which occurred, not from any fault of the member himself. It is necessary that a member shall sign a particular paper, and when this honourable member presented himself the officer of the House was unable to lay his hands on the document. The honourable member was thus unable to sign the paper until after the Royal celebrations, and, through no fault of his own, he was not really a member for a certain period. The Government regard this as a legitimate and proper payment.",30
122,Mr SALMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," Is this payment to be taken as a precedent 1 I have personal recollection of a case in which an honourable member was elected six months elected, before the Parliament met.",30
123,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That occurred to me in 1879; I was elected in February, and was of not able to take my seat until July.",30
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,--Severa l large amounts have been paid in New South Wales under the House of similar circumstances.,30
125,Mr SALMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I was elected to the State Parliament in December, and was not able to sit until July ; but no consideration of the kind was shown to me, though the fact that I did not take my seat was cerextainly owing to no fault of my own. I this trust, however, that no precedent will be established by the payment of this amount. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 140 -(Parliamentw y Repwfc amount ing Staff), Arrears, £38, agreed to. Division 1 40A -(Join t House Committee),",30
126,Mr MCDONALD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," We were that the refreshment-room would rei t quire an expenditure of only £1,000, but here we find £697 on the Estimates for table, linen, cufclerj' , <fce. ",30
127,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"This amount is for furnishing, the State Parliament having taken away the whole of their cutlery when the Federal Parliament entered upon the occupancy of this House.",31
128,Mr MCDONALD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,The Government should have given more information on the subject. It now appears that in addition to the sum of £50 0 another amount is wanted.,31
129,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The £ 5 0 0 is for stock, and the £ 6 9 7 for furnishing. Proposed vote agreed to. ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. Division 13 -(Secretary' s office) £3,200.",31
130,Mr MCDONALD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," Some explanation is required of the "" allowance for extra duties, £50,"" to be paid to the secretary.",31
131,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"This , in one respect, is a model department, the duties having been so combined as to enable it to be conducted with a staff of four persons, including the messenger and the junior clerk. The staff consists practically of two, namely, the secretary and the chief clerk. Mr. Garran, the secretary, also discharges the duties of Parliamentary Draftsman, and, in consideration of the fact, is allowed £ 5 0 . The duties of draftsman require very often the personal attendance of Mr Garran at Parliament House long after the hours which attach to his position as secretary. Mr. Garran is in either the House of Representatives or the Senate whenever his presence is considered necessary in connection with the amendment of a Bill.",31
132,Mr MCDONALD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"What about the clerk at £500, who is also described as assistant parliamentary draftsman 1",31
133,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Thes e two gentlemen ought to be professional officers only, and in course of time there may be a staff to discharge the ordinary clerical duties. At the present time, however, Mr Garran and the chief clerk discharge the whole of the duties of the office.",31
134,Mr MCDONALD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Are these available for honourable members who may require assistance in drafting Bills t,31
135,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"So far as the duties of the department permit, these officers are the service of honourable members. Mr Bruce S MITH - AVha t is the meanto ing of the item ""travelling expenses, £20 0 ""?",31
136,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That is in the next subdivision - but I may as well explain that this money is to pay the expenses of officers who have, on occasion, to be sent to Adelaide or Sydney on business of the department.",31
137,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I do not agree with making special allowances for extra services. If a private member of the profession gets instructions to draft a B i ll he is supposed to attend so as to be able to explain the provisions ; and if, as incidental to the duties of secretary, there are the duties of Parliamentary Draftsman, surely the salary of the former office ought bo cover the work of attending at Parliament House. The Minister for Trade and Customs has his officials here in connection with Tariff matters, but I do nobsuppose that in these instances any special allowance is made. Parliament is very often sitbingwhenbhe Parliamenbary Draftsman, if he were nob here, would be in his. office, and surely he ought not to be paid extra for changing his location. I do not say that the allowance is not deserved in this case; but the payment of allowances introduces a bad principle. Our presentParliamentary Draftsman is, I think, a good man, but we have to judge of these officers in the abstract; and ib is bebter bo have a fixed salary bo cover all duties. I would prefer bo see a salary of £80 0 rather than a salary of £75 0 with an allowance of £ 5 0 .",31
138,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The salary of heads of' departments has been fixed at £750, and in future ib will be necessary bo have a secretary with that salary.",31
139,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Then the office of secretary ought to have stood alone in theEsbirnabes, without having attached to itthat of Parliamentary Draftsman.",31
140,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Robertson) The sum of £75 0 should be the entire salary of this officer. At an early period of the session, I was under the impression bhat this salary was to be £500.",31
141,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"What! For the Chief Parliamentary Draftsman 1 officers Mr HENRY WILLIS - Yes , and I think that is the general provision, and if a division be called for, I shall certainly vote against this, or any similar allowance. at I have seen this officer in the House twice.",31
142,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I have known Mr Garran be here four nights a week for more than eight consecutive weeks.,31
143,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I have seen the officer in the corridors on many occanow sions, but he is not entitled to extra remuneration for - attending to the duty of seeing that a Bil l is thoroughly explained to the House.",31
144,Mr TUDOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS, It may be right on special occasions to grant an allowance for extra duties.,32
145,Mr DJEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I admit-that the salaries ought to appear on the Estimates- "" Secretary, £750,"" in one line; and in a second line, "" Parliamentary Draftsman, £50.""",32
146,Mr TUDOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"But by the Supplementary .Estimates it is proposed to grant honorariums to certain persons who have drafted Bills for presentation to this House, two of these persons receiving each a sum of £105. It'-would appear from this that",32

148,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I think the honourable member for Yarra is speaking under a misapprehension.,32

I am opposed to allowances as arule/.and - shall vote for the striking out of this sum of £ 5 0 .",32

All the expenditure that has taken place - under the item has been in connection with one or two visits to Sydney and one to Adelaide. 'Those visits were necessitated by litigation which was going - on in the'Commonwealth, or-were for the purpose of enabling consultations to take place with the State law officers. Speaking from - memory, I do nob think' bhat-'we have expended £ 1 0 0 out of the vote. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 14 -(Crow n Solicitor and High Gom-t), £3,000.",32
154,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,This item can be out.,32
155,Mr HIGGINS,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Northern Melbourne) Is that an indication that the Attorney General does not intend to proceed this - session with the Bill for the creation of the High Court ?,32
156,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,It means that I cannot - spend any of the money provided in this division before the 30th June next. I propose to proceed with the Bill for the creation of the High Court as soon as possible.,32
157,Mr HIGGINS,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Then the Attorney General expects that this session will extend beyond the '30th June' next ?,32
158,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I do. Proposed vote negatived. Division 144 -(Secretary' s office), arrears, £52, agreed to. - Division 145 -(Miscellaneous) , arrears, £350.",32
159,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The first three items which appear under this division represent sums which were paid to the Parliamentary Draftsmen of Victoria and New South Wales at the very inception of the Commonwealth, on the 1st January, 1901. It was then necessary first . of all to obtain a staff for the Attorney-General's office, and next to pre 1 pare measures to present bo Parliamenb when ib. met on 9th May of that year. The Public Service Bill has been passed - That measure was drafted by Mr Carlile, the Vicborian Sbate Parliamentary Draftsman, who has had experience in dealing with measures of that kind, and. who was selected for the work on that account. It involved a labour of many weeks, and an attendance for months afterwards bobh upon Minisbers and bheHouse. Mr.Owen,for whoniagranbof £42 is provided, drafbed the Commonwealbh Defence Bill in its first'form, and Mr Watkins, the New South Wales State Parliamentary Draftsman, drafted the Patents Design and Trades Marks Bill, which is now in the hands of the Commissioner for Customs, but with which we have not been able to proceed. Thus, all the Bills which have been before Parliament, with the exception of the Public Service and the Defence Bills-of which only one, the Public Service Bill, has been passed, and that after being very largely revised-have been the-work of the two gentlemen of the Attorney-General's department and myself. The whole of the rest of the legislation-and even the particular measures whibh I have named--hav e struck been revised by them. The honourable member for Yarra was quite entitled to call attention to the matter; but if he takes into account all the circumstances under which we commenced work in 1901, the - fact that it was impossible for Mr Garran to devote his time to all the legislative work of the session, that he had to commence by undertaking general work for all departments when there was no second officer available in the department, he will see that it would have been utterly impossible for me to have prepared the measures which were required if in these exceptional cases I had not obtained the services of the State draftsmen. Since then the whole volume of the work submitted to this House'and the legal members can measure its quality just as the House generally can determine its quantity-ha s been carried out by the Attorney-General's department.",32
160,Mr BRUC ESMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," The Attorney-General rather significantly omitted to make any reference to the honorarium of £75, paid for services rendered by Mr. H . Pollock in connection with the Public Service Bill and the Inter-State Commission Bill.",33
161,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I can explain it .,33
162,Mr BRUC ESMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"-I examined the Inter-State Commission Bill, and I venture to say that a more loosely drawn measure has seldom come before this was prepared either with a complete misapprehension of the existing America, or without any sufficient attempt to investigate the commercial facts sought to be dealt with in the Bill. The-marginal notes were most misleading, because conveyed the idea that the clauses to which Bill. they referred had their parallels in the American law. I gave a great deal of attention to this subject, and found that these parallels were most misleading. A one who read the marginal notes might have formed the idea that the measure was really an attempt to copy the United States law, whereas, it was, as the speech of the Minister for Home Affairs indishowed cated, a complete travesty of the United States law. If the gentleman who drafted the Bill undertook to go into the law and commercial circumstances of the United States before inserting these parallels he is not, in my opinion, entitled to these fees. It misled a great many honourable members into the belief that they were being asked merely to legislate in accordEnglish ance with the laws of another country, as a cursory investigation of the measures which the Inter-State Commission Bill supposed to be a parallel, was sufficient show that there was no similarity between the two.",33
163,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I regret that I did not allude to the fourth item in this division. The fact that the honourable member for Yarra had referred to another item was no doubt responsible for the omission. I beg to differ in to to from the honourable and leai-ned member for Parkes. I am sure that when I recall one fact to his mind he will realise how great an injustice he has ' done in the remarks he has just made. Mr BitrjCE SMITH - I said that if the gentleman in question had drawn the Bil l as it came to us, then it was carelessly drawn.",33
164,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,The fact is that the Bill as it came before the House was accompanied by an elaborate paper which was either attached to or circulated with it .,33
165,Mr BHUGE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,A paper .which I asked for.,33
166,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"It was circulated before the honourable member asked for it. It was prepared under my instructions before the Bill was introduced, and, speaking from memory, it was laid on the table of the House at the same time that the measure Parliament. It was introduced.",33
167,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,W it h in a day or laws in two of its introduction.,33
168,Mr BKUOE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,The Minister for Home Affairs said in answer - to a question asked by me that he was going to lay on the they table a paper which would explain the,33
169,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Clause s of a similar nature, either in English or Americanlegislation, were extracted and put in the form n y of a digest which was placed in the hands of honourable members, together with the Bill itself. Under these circumstances the references in the marginal notes became correct beyond all criticism. The marginal notes where honourable members were to turn in order to find the parallel clauses, and the digest - showed, in all important cases, the very wordsof the provisions of the English or American law, and in other cases gave a short digest of those provisions. Any one who took up the two papers could not fail to obtain the most adequate knowledge of the difference between American and legislation and our own proposals. whereThere was never any intention that the of Inter-State Commission Bill should be a was copy of the English or American law on the to subject. It was deliberately intended to' departfrom both. The fact that references were given to both British and United States laws as to the same sections of our Bill showed that they were of general purport. The Government may have been wrong in its policy, and may have been open to the criticism of the honourable and learned rhernber, but the draftsman carried out our instructions in adopting the new system. orable member will see that if it was a mistake, it was the mistake of the Government, and not the fault of the draftsman who acted under our direction. I take  honourable and learned member knows, has since been promoted to the position of Crown Solicitor in New South Wales ",33
170,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,And the appointment has been very much criticised.,34
171,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"D u r in g the illness of Minister for Home Affairs it fell to my lot to take charge of the Public Service Bill. For some nights during its passage through  ance. Owing to his intimate acquaintance by us. with the New South Wales law, he had Mr Bruce SMITH been engaged to supplement Mr Carlile's knowledge of the Victorian law, and while it has been my lot to meet many perts in connection with Bills before Parliadocument ment, I have never met one more competent  better qualified than he is in relation public service of New South Wales, or more capable of readily putting his ideas shape.",34
172,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I have not touched on that point.,34
173,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I am glad of that. We found that we had been proceeding too much on Victoria lines. He brought us his competent knowledge of the New South Wales law, and was of material assistance to honourable members who desired help that direction.",34
174,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I should be very chary to use my position as a memI ber of this House in order to criticise in hostile spirit the ability, conduct, or characwhich ter of any person outside this House. have long recognised that people outside Parliament have no opportunity of ing any criticism indulged in here, and that in attacking the conduct of a man outside the House one takes up a position that not altogether magnanimous. I acknowBill, ledge the chivalry of the Attorney-General in speaking on behalf of the draftsman, answering the statements which I have just made. I have never seen a Bill representing in its marginal notes that it had its parallel in the legislation of another conntry, which more completely departed from the prototype which it confessed to follow. The Minister for Home Affairs gave us an explanation of the Inter-State Commission The hon- Bill. An y one who heard him could not fail to believe that he was himself thoroughly convinced that that extraordinary measure was an exact counterpart of legislation which existed in the United States of America. There was no parallel' whatever. The Minister ought to have known at the time that in the United States there was a law with regard to the control of Inter-State commerce only, where railways ran in connection with shipping, and that he was seekthe ing to introduce an entirely different law. It is not correct that at the time the Bills were supplied to honourable members an addendum was also furnished.",34
175,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"It had been prepared - It may have been prepared, and I may be wrong in supposing that the gentleman who drafted the exBill did not also explain himself in the which was supposed to be accompanying it. But it should have been appended so that it would have been unnecesto the sary to ask for it . When I looked at the Bill as introduced, I asked the Minisinto ter for Home Affairs whether he could give us an explanation of the parallel clauses in the United States Act. He said that he was having a document prepared which would explain the parallels, and that he would lay it on the table. Subsequently I obtained a copy of that document. I remember speaking to an officer of the At torney-General's department on the subject in long after the Bill was supplied to me, and I gathered from him that the explanatory paper was in course of preparation. n future, it would be an advantage to the a House if, when placing in a measure clauses have their parallels in the laws of I countries whose statutes are not always at hand, the marginal notes were strictly acanswercurate. When I examined the United States law on the subject, I found that its provisions were so absolutely foreign to the is wording of the Inter-State Commission that I prepared a document on the subject which, I think, completely and explains the provisions of the measure. I do not wish to cast any reflection upon  measure to which I have referred was carelessly drawn, and, as it was so drastic, and, if I may use the word, pioneering, in its character, the marginal notes were all the more misleading.",34
176,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I did not anticipate that this unfair attack would be made upon me. The honourable and learned member for Parkes should have told us how the marginal notes.in the Inter-State Commission Bil l were wrong, and why they misled him, instead of making merely general assertions in regard to errors which no one but himself discovered. He complained that I did not lay an explanation upon the table, but I told him that I intended to do so, and, according to his own instructions, a copy was forwarded to him as soon as it was available. The assertion that the provisions of"" the Inter-State Commission Bill do not in any way agree with the provisions of the two measures in force in Great Britain and the measure in force in the United States is not correct. Our Bill is not word for word the same as those other measures, but its main principles are the same.",35
177,Mr CONROY,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"No , not anything like them.",35
178,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,They are close enough to be considered the same. As nlayman I never attempt to draft a Bill ; I leave that work to professional draftsmen ; but the conduct of any officer who deliberately did what the honourable and learned member asserts was done in connection with the Inter-State Commission Bill would be very reprehensible. It is all very well for the honourable and learned gentleman to say that he does not wish to cast any> reflection  what was complained of he should be reprimanded.,35
179,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,The drafting very careless. The Minister did not know the United States law when he delivered his second-reading speech.,35
180,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The honourable and learned member does not know it now, if he maintains that the principles"" of the Bill are not the same as those of the United States Act. Although I am a layman, I know the United States law upon this subject as well as the honourable and learned member does. I obtained the services of  been intimately connected with the drafting of the New South Wales Public Service Act, and was secretary to the Minister who administered that Act. His services were used by us in drafting the Commonwealth Public Service Bill, and also in drafting the Inter-State Commission Bill ; and no Minister could have a better or more competent draftsman to assist him in such work.",35
181,Mr GLYNN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I do not quite agree with the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Parkes, with regard to the drafting of the Inter-State Commission Bill. If the marginal notes of that Bill are inaccurate, the same - objection may be taken to the m.irginal notes of all the Bills which the Government have introduced. I think the English practice, which has been uniformly followed in South Australia, has been to use the word "" See "" before the citation of an Act where the principle of that A ct has been adopted ; the word ""altered"" where the provision to which the marginal note refers has been taken from another Act without retaining the ipsissima verba of that Act ; and where only a reference to the principle^ of another Act is intended, only the title of that Act is given. I find that there are no fewer than nine references in the marginal note of one of the clauses of the Electoral Bill.",35
182,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I agree with the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, that where reference is - made in a marginal note to another A ct as though its provisions are parallel with those contained in the clause to which the marginal note belongs, care should be taken to see that they are parallel. The marginal note to clause 23 of the Inter-State Commission Bill contains a reference to the United States A ct and to the English Act, without anything to indicate that the provisions of those Acts are quite different from the provisions of was the clause. The United States A ct provides that where a railway is being managed in"" connection with a shipping route, and a through rate is being charged, the Inter-State Commission shall have control ; but this Bill puts the whole of the coastal and ocean shipping of Australia, irrespective of railway connection, under the supervision of the Inter-State Commission. These references must mislead, and in the case of the Inter-State Commission Bill, the Minister himself was misled to the extent of thinking that the measure which he was introducing was founded upon the United - States law, which it was not.",35
183,Mr BROWN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," As the honorarium to Mr J. L . Watkins for services in connection 'with the drafting of a Patents Designs and Trades Marks Bill was earned nearly twelve months ago, the Bill should be very nearly finished; but I understand that the Government do not intend to deal with it this session. I desire, how- £ 5 395. ever, to point out the great importance of this legislation to the Commonwealth, and the desirability of dealing with it speedily, not merely to secure uniformity throughout the States, but to encourage the inventive genius of our people, which previous legislation has been in the direction of discouraging. There is a very wide difference between themethods which obtaininAmericaand those which obtain in other English-speaking communities in this respect, and the matter is so much importance that honourable members require time to make themselves conversant with it . Therefore, I hope the Bill will be laid before Parliament before the session closes, even if the Government do not go on with it this session. This will give the inventive community and the public generally an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the proposals of the Government, and will enable honourable members to deal with them in an intelligent way.",36
184,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," The measure to which the honourable member refei-s was drafted by Mr Watkins, but, when it was referred to the Minister for Trade and Customs, he found serious cause to consider whether the British system, upon which it was mainly based,' should not be radically modified. He was obliged, however, to lay aside the consideration of the measure because of the introduction of the Tariff, and it will not be possible to introduce it this session, cause it may require to be entirely altered. But the importance of the matter has been ment ? fully recognised, and we hope in recess to come to a final determination which will accountant. enable the Bill to commend itself to honourable members.",36
185,Mr TUDOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Did the gentlemen to whom honoraria are being voted draw pay from the States while they were performing these services for the Commonwealth ?,36

189,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I desire to explain a slight clerical error in connection with the salary attached to the office of Chief Accountant, which appears on the Estimates as £500, but to whom the Government intend to pay £550 per annum. There was a vacancy in the office for four or five weeks, and I understood the officer was appointed at the salary of £500, but my honourable colleague tells me the of salary was fixed at £ 5 5 0 . Therefore the amount will have to be altered, and the total will be a little in excess in consequence. I thought it wise when we were combining the original and the additional Estimates not to make any more alterations than were necessary in the items, because that would involve alterations in the total, which would have to be carried into other places, and this might lead to mistakes and confusion.",36
190,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS, I should like to know whether the salary of £ 5 50 provided for the officer who was borrowed - from New South Wales is the same that he was receiving in that State?,36

192,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"What strikes me^is that the-salaries iff this depart' ment range rather-high. We have a secretary at £ 7 5 0 ; a chief clerk at £600, and, beunder him, another officer at £550 . Has this third officer charge of a different depart",36

198,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Yes . It was specially arranged when Mr Cohen came over that he was toreceive £ 1 per day as an allowance.

203,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"If the honorextent, able member for Maranoa knew all the cirthe cumstances he would not perhaps use quite as strong language as he has done. I am to some extent the culprit, because when the department was first started T had to look round and borrow officers as best I could. Mr Cohen offered his services as accountant, and as he had been a great many years acting as accountant in the Lands department in Sydney at a salary of be necessary. £ 5 0 0 or £550, I accepted his offer. I could not bring him here temporarily without giving him some allowance, as his. family remained in Sydney. It would be very unfair to bring an officer here temporarily, and expect him to be out of pocket for his expenses whilst he was here. Mr Cohen did expect a permanent appointment, but as he wanted a high position, which I was not prepared to give him, he returned to New South Wales.",37
204,Mr THOMSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I think the expenditure in this department must disappoint those who anticipated that under federation we should be able to effect a saving rather than increase the expense of administration. The department, as it at present exists, is not, in my opinion, justified. An amount of £5,39 5 is provided for the payment of an administrative staff, which has some relationship, and I presume is in some senses superior, to the other bodies that are growing up under the same en- department. The cost of this administrative staff is simply a duplication of State expenditure. We have an Electoral-office, though the necessity for - a separate department of the kind must depend largely on how we deal with the Electoral Bill.",37
205,Sir EDWARD BRADDON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,There ought never to have been an Electoral-office.,37
206,Mr THOMSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That is a question far consideration when the Electoral Bill is before us. This separate department will, if the provisions of the Bill be carried into effect, become large and expensive; and this is a duplication to a considerable extent of the State Electoral-offices. Then we have the expenditure of the Public Service Commissioner, whose salary, I notice, dates previously to his appointment.",37
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Thes e Estimates - were prepared before the appointment, and n the there are other similar cases.",37
208,Mr THOMSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The office of the Public Service Commissioner is, to a certain a duplication of similar offices in States. I quite agree that there should be a Commonwealth Commissioner, but we ought to be careful not to incur unnecessarily i heavy administrative expenditure in addition' to the cost of his staff. Then there is the. matter of the Interstate Commission.",37
209,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"-Thes e Estimates were prepared last September, and expenditure on an Inter-State Commission will not",37

219,Mr THOMSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I say that the departand ment has not justified its existence. There may be transferred services later on which will prove a justification for the existence the department, which at present is only running up expenses by creating sub-departbeing ments. Every year the Estimates will grow, until the expenditure amounts to a very when the rush is over. large sum in addition to the expenditure the States. Of course, some of the expenlarge diture has been taken over from the States but I am now. speaking of a new departbefore ment for which, as regards the sub-departtion ments named, there is really no justigreat fication. The Public Service Commissioner monwealth. and his staff have their work, and they simply require a political head for consulmember tation and instruction in the carrying out of the provisions of the Act.",38

221,Mr THOMSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"But we are creating another staff, for which, in my opinion, there as things are is no justification. If the Inter-State Commission comes into existence t can be placed under the Attorney-General. The Public Works department necessitates another administrative staff which will also grow. We may employ some professional inmen in connection with public buildings; but, as a rule, the work can be better dealt with by the departments which occupy the buildings-by the Post-office and Customs departments. The work would probably then be more efficiently done at less cost, as and certainly there would be no necessity through for a separate clerical staff.",38

In New South Wales before the Federal elections, a Commonwealth electoral office had practically to be created in order to prepare the rolls. The electoral officers have first of all to prepare the rolls which are altogether different from those of the States.",39

234,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I do not know whether a copy can be furnished now, but honourable member can obtain any informinutes mation from the department. tinuous investigation has been going on months, and will have to be continued, while still greater alterations will have made when we pass the Electoral Bill viding for one general franchise throughout the Commonwealth. That is one of the reasons why there must be an electoral office for the Commonwealth. If we allow the States to carry out the work of collecting information for, and preparing the rolls, what control will the Commonwealth have",39
235,Mr THOMSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I did not propose that.,39
236,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The work can only be done by means of a Commonwealth electoral office. I thought that the only objection which might be made would be that the electoral office was too small, sisting as it does of only four officers. Information will have to be collected in every State, and dealt with at the head office, and the total cost is £95 0 a yeai\ As a matter of fact all the offices provided for are not yet filled, and there is one officer who is not receiving the £45 0 a year which appears upon the Estimates, so that the actual expenditure at the present time is less than £95 0 per annum. The remarks made by the honourable member for North Sydney in regard to the Public Service Commissioner seemed to me to indicate that he considered that our public service should be governed by the State Acts, or, in some other way, through the Governments of the respective States. How is it possible for the service to be conducted without a commissioner ?",39
237,Mr THOMSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I did not raise any objection to the commissioner. I said it was unnecessary that the public service should be under the control of the department for Home Affairs.,39

240,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The honourable the member wishes to destroy the department for Home Affairs. These matters must be discussed with a certain amount of reason. of Let me tell the honourable member of the work done by my staff. During last month, I think, there were 8,000 communciations the dealt with, 5,500 separate letters and written, and 6,000 accounts, repreA consenting over £100,000, received and dealt for with, in addition to a great deal of incidental work in relation to returns and other to be matters. The honourable member will see, protherefore, that a good deal of work is being carried on by some half-dozen men in my department. All the offices are not filled up, and will not be filled until required. Only seven appointments in the head office the have been made, and I should point out that, with one or two exceptions, the care1 takers and messengers in the service are all included in the department for Home Affairs. In my department there are seven members of the administrative staff, two temporary clerks, and three messengers and cleaners.",39
241,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"There is a messenger conprovided for in the Estimates relating to the Treasury and also to the Audit-office. Sir WILLIAM LYNE . - I am nob quibe sure, but I believe bbey have been transferred bo my department. I think . I have five temporary messengers and cleaners. There are three officers employed in the electoral branch, and so far as the Government public service is concerned the commissioner is the only officer who has been appointed. At . the head office of the Commonwealth Public Works department there are seven men employed, including Mr. Blackbourn, the superintendent.",39
242,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"A salary of £ S 0 a year for a messenger is a poor one. Sir WILLIAM LYNE. - That relates to the salary of a messeng<2r in my departmentwho was very young, and only recently entered the service. The same remark applies to the caretaker, for whom a wage of £ 65 a year is provided in these Estimates. There is no extravagance in connection with the department. I should like bo know how the Commonwealth is going to carry on its public works? Works representing an-expenditure of £165,000 out of revenue have to be proceeded with at once. We shall also have various undertakings provided for out. of loan moneys. If the committee is going to talk of the States dealing with these matbers, we mighb as well sweep away the whole of this department , If the State departments are to deal with these works the honourable member for North Sydney will have the privilege of taking my place, or - of gettingsome one else-to fil l it, because as long as I have charge of the public works of the Commonwealth; and as long as I am responsible for them to this House,- I shall see for myself how they are carried out. I have tried to carry out our works as economically as possible, but I cannot make any arrangements with the-States in regard to the question of payments. That is why a sum of £5,000 has been placed on the Estimates to repay the Sbabes for services-rendered by bhem. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - Our trouble is that we cannot get works done even when they are authorized.",40
243,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The Commonwealth public works are subordinate to those of the States at the present time. In regard to the question of when any of' our works shall be undertaken, I am absolubely in the hands of the State Ministers and their officers. Mr HENRY.

244,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Yes .,40
245,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Is the Government spending any money on the Post-office in Newcastle ?,40
246,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That work was commenced before the establishment of the Commonwealth, and it is being carried on by the New South Wales Minister for Public Works on behalf of my department. I think that the cost is £26,000 or £28,000. In Hobart, another public building is also being erected by the State, which expects us to take it over. I have to make the best kind of arrangement I can with the States at present, and I have no power to expedite public works. When complaints of delay are made, I can only write to the State Minister and urge greater expedition. Other State works engage the attention of the State, departments, and I think honourable members will see that what I am proposing is after all a very limited Public Works department for the Commonwealth. I desire to have an officer in . eachState. The suggestion has been made by South Australia and Tasmania that one officer should be employed in each of those States, and paid jointly by the State and the Commonwealth Governments. I am prepared to fall in with that arrangement, but I insist that the officer shall be under the conbrol of the Commonwealth. I propose to have an officer in each of the larger States. We have taken over Mr . ; Blackbourn from the Victorian Government and he, with his staff, deals with Commonwealth work here. Mr Blackbourn cannot attend to all the work, but he communicates with officers of the Public Works department, and sees that our work is carried out as reasonably as possible. If he considers that any work is not done as well as it might be, he reports to me, and I direct that, the matter shall be investigated. I want, such an officer in New South Wales,. Queensland, and probably also in Western Australia.",40
247,Mr BATOHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"What provision has the Minister made ? Sir WILLIAM ' LYNE - The honourable member will find provision made for a public works superintendent. In connection with the Public Works department, I shall have a represenbabive officeri n the larger States, becausemost 1 work will be carried on there, and, if ' possible, I shall make some arrangement with the smaller States; but where an officer does duty in more than one State must be a Commonwealth officer. Commonwealth has taken over the control of a very large number of buildings, especially in connection with the Postal and Defence on the same trip. departments; and if the States raise any objection to the appointment of Common-: do that 1 wealth officers to look after the construction, maintenance, and repairs of such buildings, I think it might reasonably be suggested to them that it would be better for them to curtail their own public works exand penditure, though, of course, the matter one for them alone to deal with. It is experience, and I am sure that this stateorder ment will be borne out by honourable membut bers representing - country constituencies,. that I have practically no control over the carrying out of Commonwealth public works in places far removed from the State shall capitals. Although I may authorize them, and the money may be ready, it depends entirely upon the State Minister as to when works will be carried out. I want officer whose duty it will be to supervise construction of Commonwealth works, and to report exactly howthey are being carried out ; and if the States do not carry them out as we should like we must invite tenworks ders* That is the only alternative if the Commonwealth is not to be - at the mercy of the States. Most of the State Ministers have met me as far as they could, but naturally look after their own works first. I have not been able to come to a determination as to what payment should be made for the supervision ofpublic' works. I have suggested that a percentage should be given upon the total amount expended, but that has not been agreed to. suggestion has been made by one or two of the States that an officer's services be charged for according to the work done, and that where he is sent 2.00 or 300 - miles into the country, the Commonwealth should pay all-expenses-; but I do not think that that would be a satisfactory arrangement.  the keeping up of a Commonwealth staff.",40
248,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I think that would be more costly. If the.

The amount I ask for in to provide, not a Works-department, a supervising department, is not very large. I do not want to suddenly create a larger department. If , as time goes on, it. is necessary to enlarge the department, I have to come to Parliament for a larger vote. It is necessary that we should have some control over the works' that are being, carried out for us by the States, and are an being paid for out of. revenue and loan the moneys. When, defence works come to be undertaken, no doubt the expenditure will, be largely increased, and possibly in . the near future-we may have to undertake such, as the building, of the federal capital and the construction of the western railway.",41
251,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I appreciate the difficulties of they the Government in creating an organization, for their executive purposes; but - there can be no doubt that they should' accept theassistance of the States where possible, though the whole matter must be dealt with in a tentative fashion at first. I fear-' that in the past every The Minister has been going, too much upon his own lines, and I hope that, now the should Public Service Commissioner has been appointed, he will: be-asked; with the corporate advice of the Cabinet, to consider the arrangement of the departments, and w h at officers are necessary in a department like that now under consideration. The Works department is a spending department which, than will have to be carefully watched. No doubt it is necessary that the Comi t monwealth should carry out many of public works itself, or should, know exactly how they are being, carried out. to One of the officers forwhose salary Wales we areasked to make provision the Inspector - General of Works - will occupy a most important post, and I hope that the approval of the House will be obtained to his appointment. He will be practically the Commonwealth architect, and will probably be the man who will call for designs for the building of the federal capital, and will have to superintend the carrying out of that great work. I hope, therefore, that the Executive will be very careful in making this appointment. The person appointed will have an enormous responsibility, and an enormous amount of patronage; and he must be a very able man, in the prime of life, and one beyond reproach. In my opinion, a mistake has been made in these Estimates in calling too many officers "" secretaries."" Why should not the chief officer under the Public Service Commissioner be termed the "" chief clerk,"" instead of the "" secretary "" ; and why should there not be a "" chief clerk "" instead of a "" secretary "" as the principal officer of the Inter-State Commission? When I was in office in New South Wales, I saw that whenever a man was made head of a department, he required his own room, with its costly carpet and furniture, his accountant, his staff, and his messengers, and I warned the public servants that if they went on in that way they would eventually have to face a Black Wednesday; and a day of reckoning did come there.  here if we do not mind.",41
252,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"No f doubt, at the present time, the Federal will Ministers have to take the best rooms they can get ; but I hope that when we come have our own public buildings the system of giving every officer a separate room will discontinued, and that the banking-chamber style of construction, in which a department is at work in view of his chief, will be largely adopted. I wish know from the Treasurer if he intends put into the Appropriation Bill the total amount provided for in these Estimates, notwithstanding the fact that a great of the votes will lapse on 30fch June, and, required afterwards, must be revoted t",42

257,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,It is better to have all public works carried out under one control.,42
258,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That may be, but I am not at all sure that because the Minister for Home Affairs introduced the Public Service Bill, the Public Service Commissioner should be in his department. I think that he should be in the department of the Treasurer.",42
259,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,He is generally under the Chief Secretary; he was so in Victoria.,42

261,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"On e of the principal objects of the Public Service Commissioner should be to study - economj' as well as efficiency, and it would be much better if he were in close touch with the Treasurer as his administrative head rather than with the Minister for Home Affairs. That, however, is a matter of arrangement. I fully understand the greac difficulty of welding and dovetailing everything at first, and we must leave the Executive Governi t ment to act with the Public Service Commissioner in creating the service with the u l l understanding that a time of reckoning come if, in spite of the warnings of this Chamber, they do not manage economically to as well as efficiently. I should like the Minister for Home Affairs to give us his be assurance that great care will be taken in the appointment of the high public servant every man into whom I have referred.",42
262,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I have to a good deal of sympathy with the remarks to made by the honourable member for North Sydney with regard to the tendency of this department to grow beyond the proportions many which the amount of work to be done if would justify, and I hope the Minister for Home Affairs will remember that in criticising these Estimates we are only anxious vote that at this stage no unnecessary growth should take place of which we may Uy-andby lose control. Although I sympathize much with the fear expressed by the all honourable member for North Sydney, I can quite enter into the feelings of the Minister do when he points out that the amount of work to be done really necessitates the establishment of a staff of moderate magnitude. I agree, however, with the honourable member for Wentworth that a mistake is made in apparently setting up four or five departments under the department for ' Home Affairs by calling the head officer of each sub-department a secretary. It is quite clear to me, from my experience as a Minister, that hereafter all sorts of representations might be made to us that, because the Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales or elsewhere receives such and such a salary, therefore the Secretary for Public Works under the Commonwealth should be paid on a similar scale. The Commonwealth Secretary for Public Works however, is only one of five sub-heads under the Minister for Home Affairs, and I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth that it would have been better to speak of these officers as chief clerks instead of as secretaries. As matters stand now there is no distinction between these secretaries and the Secretary for Home Affairs. We have in all five secretaries of sub-departments, who might, by-and-by, claim a status far beyond the merits of their positions as subordinates. The Minister for Home Affairs told us that certain works upon buildings in connection with the transferred departments were being carried out by the State Governments, and I see some danger unless this matter is carefully dealt with. Every hononble member knows that at the present time the public works of New South Wales are being carried out on most extravagant lines. There are two elements at work; first of all the day labour principle and secondly the minimum wage.",42
263,Mr BROWN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Tw o very good principles. ' Mr Bruce SMITH - That is a matter of opinion. I think that it is State robbery of the public funds. I say advisedly that no man in any community has the right to ask from the State a larger amount of money for his commodity-n o matter whether it is labour or anything else-tha n it would fetch in the open market. If the people are taxed in order to give men more wages than they could secure in the open market, the Government are either making charitable institutions of the public departments or are taking money from the taxpayers for eleemosynary purposes.  speech. 36 R",43
264,Mr CROUCH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Is that a free-trade attitude 1,43
265,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Certainly; because it favours the open market. Is the Commonwealth to carry out its work upon the day labour principle 1 J ,43
266,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The honourable member is not the Commonwealth yet. We have to ask ourselves whether we as a Commonwealth should cany out our public works upon the day labour principle or call for tenders as other people do, and get our work done at the best possible price for the Commonwealth. The Minister told us that certain works were being carried out in New South Wales by the State Minister of Works, who would afterwards charge the Commonwealth with the cost. It is well known that in New South Wales, where work has been carried out on the contract system, and similar work has been performed by day labour, the work carried out by day labour has cost fifty or a hundred per cent, more than that carried out by contract.",43
267,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I think the honourable and learned member .must be mistaken.,43
268,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"No ; there was a case in connection with certain tanks, which was exposed in the Sydney Morning Herald. We shall be putting it into the power of the Ministers of the States to construct ourbuildings on the day labour principle, and then call upon us to pay what they represent to be the actual cost. My own opinion is'that the Parliament of the Commonwealth, taken as a whole- I know there are individual exceptions-wil l determine that its public works shall be carried out on the ordinary system, by calling for tenders and getting it done at the smallest possible cost,. in the same way as ordinary private citizens do.",43
269,Mr SPENCE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The contract system is, dead in New South Wales.",43
270,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"It is not dead in the Commonwealth. I should like the Minister for Home Affairs to say whether he intends to pay the Minister of Works in New 'South Wales whatever he chooses to say the work costs, and, secondly, whether he intends to continue the practice of delegating to the Minister of Works of the different States, the duty of constructing the buildings of the Commonwealth. There is no reason whatever why the Commonwealth should not cany out these works . for itself. The Minister has established a stafF, and I understand that he is ambitious.in a modest way to control this work from his own department. direct his attention to a practice which I endeavoured to carry out in New South Wales, of inviting competitive designs, not - only from New .South Wales, but from all Australia, for"" public buildings involving an - expenditure of not less than £1,000. The understanding was that the architect who submitted the plan which commended itself to the Minister of Works should be intrusted with the supervision of the work on commission at the rate of 5 per cent., or that he should receive 2^ per cent, in the event - of the department supervising the work. In many cases works had to be carried out at great distances from Sydney, sometimes as far away as Broken Hill , and we adopted the principle I have described, the department sending out its own officer to take over the building when completed. There is no reason why the Public Works department of the Commonwealth should not call for competitive designs for any large public fouilding, or for any considerable additions to existing buildings. The architect who sends in the successful design could then be employed to supervise the work and the Commonwealth Works Department could ultimately send its officer to take over the work from the architect on its completion. That is all that would be required. That would obviate the necessity of asking State Ministers of Works to carry out these works for us. Whether the Commonwealth adopts the principle of the minimum wage and day labour or not, it is a fact that if we delegate - our work to the present Minister of Works of New South Wales, we shall empower him to make political capital at the expense of the Commonwealth. If we authorize the - State Minister of Works to carry out - on the day labour system, at a cost of £1,500, work which would cost only £1,000 under the contract system, we shall simply be paying £500 to enable the State Minister to carry out* his own theories, and make political capital out of them.",43
271,Mr BAMFORD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Does the honourable learned member mean to say that the Miniscall ter of Works in New South Wales would 'rob us 1,44
272,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"No . There is a great difference between robbery in the down. criminal sense, and making political capital out of a larger expenditure than is necessary. That is what the Minister of Works is now doing in New South Wales. He is carrying out enormous works on the day I would labour and minimum wage principle, at a cost 50 or 100 per cent, in excess of the outlay that would be involved if they were carried out by contract.",44
273,Sir WILLIAMDYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,My experience is that works can be carried out more cheaply by day labour than by contract.,44
274,Mr BRUCESMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I have heard that before, but I have seen the experiment tiled. When I was Minister of Works in New South Wales day labour was tried, and the conclusion at which the officers of the department arrived-withou t knowing that there was any desire that they should bring out their results in a particular way - wa s that there was no comparison between the two methods.  order.",44
275,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"When a contractor is engaged upon a work he takes good care that.his men do a good day's work, and he pays them the .current wages. If , however, men are left to do just what work they choose, and the officer in charge is under a sort .of compulsion to leave them alone lest he should be reported to the Minister, and the wages are 50 per' cent, moire ihan the .men obtain in the open market, it stands to reason that work must involve much greater expense.",44
276,Mr MCDONALD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,The Minister who would do that would be a scoundrel.,44
277,Mr BRUC ESMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I did not say that the Minister was a scoundrel.,44
278,Mr MCDONALD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,But that was the inference.,44
279,Mr BRUCESMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I say that the New South Wales Minister is carrying out works at a cost of from 50 per cent, to 100 per cent, higher than would be incurred under the tender system.",44
280,Mr MCDONALD,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I challenge the honourable and learned member to prove that statement.,44
281,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The Builders' Association have challenged the Minister of and New South Wales over and over again to for tenders for some public work, and then to have it carried out by day labour.",44
282,Mr TUDOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The Minister offered to do that, but the Builders' Association backed",44
283,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I should like the Minister for Home Affairs to inform me whether he is allowing the Minister in New South Wales to carry out the work according to the principles I have indicated, and whether it has been agreed to pay whatever has - been the cost; or, on the other hand, whether it has been made a condition to have tenders called for in the ordinary business way. The difficulty which has been foreshadowed is only the same difficulty which has-to be met by some of the large .financial institutions. The Bank of New South Wales., for instance, has its head-quarters in Sydney, and carries .on business in every State. Of necessity this institution has to erect premises in other parts of the Commonwealth. I clo not speak from personal knowledge, but, from my business experience, I am satisfied that the course is to have plans and specifications submitted for approval by the board which is analogous to the Minister. When the plans are approved, the work is put into the hands of an architect, say in Victoria, to see the buildings completed; and no doubt an officer of the bank, either in Victoria or from the' senior State, eventually takes over the premises. There is nothing to prevent the Commonwealth adopting a similar course; and there is no necessity for permanent State inspectors to act as clerks of works in the - various States. The Minister told us something about a new post-office at Hobart, which the Commonwealth Government are expected to take over. I may have read the Constitution wrongly, but I understood that at a certain date the Commonwealth took over all the public buildings, and that compensation was a matter to be arranged afterwards by a separate Bill. If the Works department of Tasmania are carrying out the work on their account, I should like to know whether the cost is being added to the existing liability of the Commonwealth.",45
284,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The post-offices in use were taken over, but this work had just been started, and, prior to its being taken over, it is being completed by the Tasmanian Government. The post-office accommodation of Hobart will not be sufficient until this building is taken over.",45
285,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I understood that whatever works were constructed were taken over.,45
286,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The Commonwealth Government had no money to carry on with, and allowed the Tasmanian Government to 36 R 2 \ construct this work out of loan moneys, on the understanding that the amount expended would be taken into consideration when fixing the value.",45
287,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"But surely we are not bound to pay any price which the Tasmanian Government may pay 1 Sir ' WILLIAM LYNE - Not the actual cost, but that will be a good basis for negotiation. - "" Mr Bruce SMITH - It depends on how the work is being carried out. I think it will be found that when the public works were taken over by Gazette notice, whatever was built became the property of the Commonwealth.",45
288,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,The Tasmanian Government had only commenced to excavate the foundation.,45
289,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"And I suppose the building was allowed to go on subject to the Commonwealth being free to reject it afterwards 1 , Sir WILLIAM LYNE - There is an understanding that the post-office will be taken over.",45
290,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I understand the Minister to say that there is a new post office at Newcastle which has to be taken over. When I took office in the New South Wales Government I found that my predecessor, who was the representative of Newcastle, had prepared elaborate designs for a post-office to cost £35,000; and it was my pleasing duty to cut the estimate down to £11,000.",45
291,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"A good deal more than £11,000 has been spent.",45
292,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That has been spent since, but £11,000 was ample for the purpose. If the State of New South Wales is spending £28,000 on this work, I should like to know whether that is with the consent of the Postmaster-General. Since that time Newcastle has not increased to an extent to justify such an expenditure. I should like to know how the building is being carried out, and whether there is any undertaking to take it at cost price, irrespective of the methods adopted.",45
293,Mr SALMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I am strongly opposed to the continuance of the system of having Commonwealth works carried out by the States departments. The Public Works department of Victoria, for instance, has quite enough to d o ; in fact, it is a year or two in arrear, and it is absolutely fatuous to suppose that any 12880 Supply. [REPRESENTATIVES.] assistance can be given to the Commonwealth in this connection.  do not think it should exist.",45
294,Mr SALMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I am in a position to know the feeling of the Government of Victoria.  do not want another department running counter to them.,46
295,Mr SALMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"There will be no running counter. In Victoria the Public Works department had little to do with the Postal department, as new post-offices have not been erected to any great extent for some .years, while telegraph work, such as the laying of lines, is done by the Postal department.",46
296,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,That kind of work is done now by the experts of department.,46
297,Mr SALMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"It is very proper that it should be so. If it were possible, like to see each department carrying out its own public works. This is, or soon will be, the largest spending department of the Commonwealth. I recognise that there will shortly be an enormous demand on the department of Public Works, not only in connection with buildings throughout the Commonwealth, but also in - connection with the capital site; and these works should be expeditiously and economically carried out. It is in this department that we have the greatest danger of extravagant expenditure. I have a fear that the expenditure will increase by leaps and bounds, and if it is not checked at the very commencement, we shall have serious cause to regret our inaction. I beg Minister to use every endeavour to the department growing to an inordinate size, but also to keep eye over the expenditure. So long as public works are associated with the dedozen. partment, expenditure must grow, and there is, therefore, the greater need careful scrutiny. As to the electoral work, I do not think it should be carried out this department. The Attorney-General, who says that there are only four men his office, might very well take charge electoral matters.",46
298,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,But the staff bound to increase.,46

300,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,j All the rolls have to be supervised.,46
301,Mr SALMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"But the supervision is not done by the Minister-. In Victoria the supervision is not even done by the Under Secretary, but by a special officer in the Chief Secretary's department. My anxiety is to keep the department of Home Affairs as small as possible. I do not want it to deal with too many subjects. In my opinion, it is quite sufficient that it should carry out the public works, in which case the Minister will find his hands full enough.",46
302,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"If the Minister thinks he can control the department as at present, why take it away from him t",46
303,Mr SALMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,The honourable member for Robertson is satisfied to allow any Minister or member to take upon his shoulthe Postal ders any responsibility.,46
304,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,The only question is whether this is the best department I should to administer electoral affairs.,46
305,Mr SALMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Of course my opinion may not be worth much on this question, but I think this work should be undertaken 'by the Attorney-General's department. I am not going to decry the ability of, or express any want of confidence in, the Minister for Home Affairs; but I feel that if one or other, of the honourable members who have been interrupting were placed in his position, I should not place so much reliance on their powers; Notwithstanding the appointment of a Public Service Commissioner, there will be a great deal of work for the Minister in this connection.",46
306,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Will the the honourable member explain what public prevent works have to be carried out ?,46
307,Mr SALMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,A number of new a watchful offices are required.,46
308,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Not half-a,46
309,Mr SALMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I do not know whether for the honourable and learned member was present when I referred to the building of the by federal capital, which will have to be undertaken by the Public Works department. in The Department for Home Affairs offers of greater opportunity for expansion than does any of the other departments. We have is already laid down rigid lines upon which the Defence department is to be administered, and we need have very little fear in regard to it for some 'years to come. It is in the Department for Home Affairs that extravagance is likely to occur, and Parliament will blame itself if in the future it is found that insufficient care has been taken in its administration. I wished to give reasons why some of the branches controlled by the department for Home Affairs should be placed under other departments, and why, in view of the immense amount of work to be carried out, and the effect which it will have on the finances of the Commonwealth, we should have a Minister giving his undivided attention to public works. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Parkes as to the extravagant way in which public works are being carried out in New South Wales, but I do not agree with the reasons which lie gives for it . I believe that it is the magnificent Hibernian buoyancy of the Minister in charge of the department which is responsible for the extravagance. I do not think that he exercises sufficient care, nor do I believe that all the works which he is carrying out in New South Wales are necessary. I should be sorry to see him placed in charge of the Public Works department of the Commonwealth. I do not agree with the honourable and learned member for Parkes as lo the causes of extravagance in New South Wales with day labour. In public works in ""Victoria we have not had much experience, but after an extended trial we have fourid that the contract system, with a minimum wage clause, providing for a wage equal to or slightly better than that paid in the open market, works well; that under it our works are carried out more economically, and in a better way than was the case before. Those who undertake these works are able to secure the best labour, because they pay the best wages. It has always been my desire to see the minimum-wage principle adopted in all contracts for public works of the Commonwealth, believing, as I do, that the result will be better work, better conditions for the men who carry out that work, and greater satisfaction to the Commonwealth generally.",46
310,Mr SPENCE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I think that the Minister for Home Affairs has taken a wise step in making a beginning in the establishment of a Public Works department. I . fail to see how justice is to be done to the Commonwealth unless we have some representative officer in each of the State capitals to. look after our interests. If that is not done, State public works will always have preference. In the New South Wales Public Works department, for instance, the staff is not sufficient to carry out all the proposed works. Many of our works have been delayed for a long time, and if we had to depend upon the States service to prepare plans for a new building, we might never have the work carried out. We ought to secure the best architects obtainable, for in that way we should save a great deal of money. It has taken a long time to induce the State public works architects to recognise that some'regard must be had to the tropical climate of certain parts of Australia ; and in many cases buildings for State schools, police quarters, and other purposes have been erected which are simply ovens. Now, however, our Government, architects are erecting buildings suitable to the climate in which they are placed. Those who have travelled might quote many instances of stupidity shown in connection with the erection of public buildings in Australia, and yet it would be difficult to locate the blame. I have seen solid concrete provided by nature cut out, in order to make room for wooden blocks for a building. Of course the responsible department did not know that the natural concrete was there, and the work had to be done according to specification. I should like to ask the committee to disabuse their minds of the statements made by the honourable member for Parkes, as to the effect of the day labour system. We have got beyond the time when it would be possible for the committee to go back upon that principle. I deny the honourable and learned member's statement, that the day labour system has led to increased cost in the erection of public works.",47
311,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,As a rule it has led to a reduction of 25 per cent.,47
312,Mr SPENCE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Yes . The honourable and learned member for Parkes implies that labour in New South Wales is cut down to 3s. 6d. per day. I defy the honourable and learned member to obtain men to work for such a wage.,47
313,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I did not advocate the payment of such a wage.,47
314,Mr SPENCE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The honourable and learned member said that the work could be done for 50 per cent, less under the con tract system.",47
315,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I said the total cost of the work under the contract system would be 50 per cent. less.,47
316,Mr SPENCE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I chaUenge the honourable and learned member to disprove my statement. We have to take the whole result. We have all heard of the MCSharry railway abitration ease. The building of the line in question by contract imposed upon the people of the State the payment of an extra amount in freights and fares. The experience of New South Wales has proved that railways can be constructed cheaper and more expeditiously under the day labour system than they can be under the contract system. Where the contract system is resorted to a great deal of time has to be spent in carefully preparing plans and specifications in order to avoid extras, which always provide a way for contractors to get at the Government. I know of one case in which it was said that it would take six months to get ready for the first section of a line in my own State electorate, but when the officers were pushed the work was done in three months. They had been accustomed to the old method of preparing plans in a way that is unnecessary under the day labour system. It is obvious that the contract system is in itself the essence of cheating, inasmuch as it creates a tendency to slum work. I would remind honourable members from A'ictoria of what took place in connection with the Coliban reservoir many years ago. Sir JOH N QUICK - The tar brush ?",48
317,Mr SPENCE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Yes ; we have never had anything as bad as that in New South Wales. If a work is well done by day labour it will last longer, and even if the initial cost is greater than it would be under the contract system, it is less in the I am sorry that the honourable and learned member for Parkes is so far behind the times in this matter, because he is well ad-vanced in others. He ought to be consistent. He ought to oppose the erection of any post-office, and favour the letting of everything by contract. He should favour the letting out of Government by contract, the letting out of the work of Parliament by contract, and the giving of a bonus for the best work done. The contract system is the lowest in commercial ethics. It is a case of every man for himself. We have got beyond that principle, however, and-we should endeavour to deal fairly with our fellow men. A good deal of stir has been made in New South Wales in connection with public works, and the honourable member for Laanecoorie has heard a little of the noise which surrounds ""The O'Sullivau."" It would be a good thing if we had Mr. O'Sullivan here, for he has much, practical common sense. In New South Wales the minimum wage of 7s. per day is paid on public works, and trades union wages are paid to artisans and tradesmen. The buildings which it will be necessary to erect for the Commonwealth will not be very numerous, and I think the position is being exaggerated. My own experience is that it is very difficult to obtain anything from the postal department. In the construction of any of our buildings Ave should employ tradesmen, and we shall not be able to obtain their services at less than the trades union wage, because they are nearly all members of unions. Therefore my honourable and learned friend need not be alarmed. He would take advantage of the starving man, and grind him down as much as his necessities will allow. To be consistent he should try to get the old combination laws put into force, in order to stamp out trades unionism. When we build a post-office we put an official in charge of it at a decent fixed salary, and why should we not similarly fix always the wages of the men who construct the building ? What difference in principle is there between having an office built by contract, and letting out the performance of the work to be done in it by contract? I believe that the late Mr Eddy stated that the New-South Wales Railway Commissioners saved £10;000by carrying out theLocksley deviation works by day labour. There may be perhaps half-a-dozen instances in which small works near Sydney were performed unsatisfactorily by the unemployed under end. the day labour system; but the men in question were very difficult men to deal with, and the system cannot be judged by small failures of that kind. A big job was carried out in my own electorate under the day labour system, and I then insisted that no men should be taken on, either upon my own recommendation, or upon that of any Member of Parliament, but that the whole undertaking should be left entirely to the man in charge, who had had a long experience in connection with works of the kind. The result was that the work was done more cheaply than it would have been under contract, and was done well, and. without loafing on the part of the men employed. The success of the day labour system depends upon good management, but in any case the profits of the contractor are saved. While the honourable and learned member - objects to paying men so much per day, he does not object to contractors making their fortunes-, either out of the-taxpayers or by sweating their omploy&s. Where loan works are carried out by contract, the public burden is increased for all time by the profits of the contractor. I do not think that I need labour this question, because I think that the common sense of honourable members is with me. I know that the Minister for Home Affairs will stick to the day labour system, and I believe that his successors will also do so. I think ""that he is right in providing, for the proper supervision of works carried out for the Commonwealth. No doubt there will be a saving in getting minor works performed by the State departments; but all large works should be inspected by Commonwealth officials, and it is wise to establish the department now, so as to get ready for the work which will have to be undertaken in the future.",48
318,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"South Australia) I wish to know from the Minister whether the Electoral-office; the Public Service Commission, the Interstate Commission, and the Public Works department, will all be independent and responsible only to himself ?",49
319,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"No . W it h the exception of the Public Service Commissioner, the. heads of all the departments named will coniimmicate' with me through my Under-Secretary.",49
320,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I think that that arrangement will avoid the friction which often occurs whenthere are anumber of independent departmental heads.,49
321,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"But these departmental heads ought not to be called ""secretaries.""",49
322,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"It is a mistake to term all these chief clerks ""secretaries,"" and I hope that the Minister will make an alteration in that matter. Until the Electoral Act is passed, I see no necessity for an electoral-office. I believe that the chief electoral officer has already been appointed.",49
323,Sir WILLIAMLYNIE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"A gentleman who receives a pensionfrom the New South Wales Government, and whois paid by the Commonwealth only half the salary put down for the chief electoral officer, is performing the work temporarily.",49

325,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I am not sure about that.,49
326,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Has he had experience in connection with this particular kind of work ?,49
327,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Ye s ; in New South Wales. He has hardly done anything else.,49
328,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I do not know that his experience in New South Wales can be regarded as any qualification for administering quite a different electoral law; but, in any case, I do not see the need of an electoral-officeuntil we have an Electoral Act.",49
329,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The whole of the South Australian rolls and the rolls of the other States have been undergoing revision for the past twelve or eighteen months, and a great many alterations have been suggested. Preparations have been made for the issue of new rolls directly the electoral law is passed.",49
330,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"It is difficult to see what alterations can be effected until the electoral law is passed. The honourable member for Laanecoorie said that the electoral-office might well be placed under the Attorney-General, but I do not see anynecessity for that alteration, though the Attorney-General is likely to have fewer departments under his control thanthe Minister for Home Affairs, who, in future, will probably have to administer, in addition to his present department, an Old-age Pensions Act and an Industrial Conciliation Act. No doubt, the Minister will have aa enormous number of small departments which may grow into large ones; but it would have been wiser to place some of them under other Ministers. For instance, the Inter-StateCommission should surely have been placed under the Department of Trade and Customs. It will deal with all the trade relations between the various States, and particularly with the maintenance of freedom of intercourse; and, as the Minister for Trade and Customs will have little to do after the Tariff has once been passed, the Inter-State Commission might very well have been placed under his Department. I should like to know whether the public works 1 central staff have control of the works required to be executed in connection with the erection and maintenance of telegraph lines.",49
331,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,No ; that is done by the Post-office department.,49
332,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"There should be no real difficulty in making use of the State officers and State departments in carrying out many works. The whole of the works in connection with the transferred and other departments in South Australia have, for some time past, been carried out by the Superintendent of Public Buildings.",50
333,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,- B ut would the Superintendent of Public Buildings set aside his own works in order that he might execute ours ?,50
334,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I do not know that he would; but I do not anticipate any difficulty on that score. We should not why. submit to unnecessary delay in the carrying out. - out of our works, but on the other hand it would not be fair for us to require that federal work should havepreference over State work in all cases. I think that the honortract ? able and learned member for Parkes was speaking rather from prejudice than from experience on the subject of carrying public works by day labour; otherwise his experience must be very much out date. I defy the honourable member to show that it is more expensive to carry public works by day labour than by conto tract. In South Australia the Superintenthere dent of Public Buildings has discretionary power to carry out work by contract or day labour as seems to him fit. The perience there is that in some cases work more economically carried out by day labour than by contract, and that somehave times the contrary is the case. Generally speaking, however, the results are very favourable to the day labour system.",50
335,Mr VL SOLOMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,It is very difficult to estimate accounts in connection with labour.,50
336,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I know that statetakes ment is made by the opponents of the systo»a tem, but they have never proved anything of the kind. Mr VL SOLOMON, - In connection with certain ironwork which was being contractor .carried out by day labour, 500 tons of iron disappeared'and was never accounted for.",50
337,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I do not know what the honourable member is referring to, but I would direct attention to the fact during the last week the South Australian newspapers state that tenders were received by the South Australian Government for manufacture of 50 or 70 new boilers for locoworks motives. The locomotive department and one private firm tendered, and the tender of the department was lower than that of the private contractor.",50
338,Mr MACDONALDPATERSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Did the locomotive department have to pay rent 1,50
339,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"They had charged against their contract a proportion of the salaries paid to the officers and the cost of buildings, and so on. Notwithstanding the fact that the departmental tender was lower than that 'of the outside contractor, the work has been given to the latter.",50
340,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Why ?,50
341,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I do not know That is what we are anxious to find,50
342,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Why do all mercantile and financial people, whose principal aim is profit, carry out their work by con",50
343,Mr BATCHELOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I do not think that is so. It will be found that where out people have very important work to do, they take good care to have it done of under their own supervision, and not by contract. It stands to reason that where a out direct incentive is given to the contractor carry out the work as cheaply as possible, is much more likelihood of scamping and slumming than when the work by is carried out under the supervision of exthe officers who have to maintain and is repair it. I am quite sure that the honourable and learned member will find that those who had experience of the two systems in South Australia would not recommend that we should adhere rigidly to one system or the other. The question whether work can be carried out more cheaply by day labour day than by contract depends upon a number of 'conditions, and a wise administrator these into consideration when coming decision. If I could be certain of the contractor I should prefer, even from the point of view of the workman, that the work should be done by contract, because a good treats his men better on the whole, pig and allows them much more personal freedom, than do the Government officers. That is my own personal experience. I hope the Minister for Home Affairs will take care that his department does not grow too that large. We know that in some of the States the most extravagant methods are adopted in the erection of public buildings, but there the is no reason why the Commonwealth public should not be carried out by the State officers acting under proper Commonwealth control. It would not* be wise for us to permit the States to cany out works according to their own plans and in their own time, but if they are ready to do our work according to our plans and within a satisfactory time, we should not unnecessarily multiply our own staff.",50
344,Mr CONROY,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," A great deal of this discussion may be very valuable as affording a guide to the Minister in the conduct of his department in the future, but we cannot exercise much control over the expenditure because eleven months of the current financial year have already passed. I am more interested in knowing whether we are to pursue the practice hitherto followed of passing monthly Supply Bills or whether the Estimates for the forthcoming year will be laid before us within a reasonable time. We must make some provision for administrative work, but every advantage should be taken of the departments already within the control of the States. I understand that such is the intention of the Minister. It is absolutely necessary, however, that a certain amount of control should be exercised by this House, so that any friction may be smoothed over, and the creation of large additional departments, whether State or Federal, prevented. I shall reserve any further remarks I have to make until the Estimates of the forthcoming year are brought down, which will probably be during the next month. In the Estimates for the Home department there is £40,000, which properly should have appeared in the Defence expenditure. All departmental expenditure should appear under each department, although the control may remain with the Minister for Home Affairs. If we add this £40,000 to the £937,000 already voted for defence, we reach an expenditure of nearly £980,000. We ought to have all these m tters clearly placed before us.",51
345,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The Budget papers show the total expenditure for each department, and I have already promised that in the next Estimates the total amount will be thus shown.",51
346,Mr CONROY,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"In electoral matters we have created a difficulty by passing a Franchise Bill which extends the suffrage to women in certain of the States. In these States we cannot adopt the State rolls, and in this connection further expense will have to be incurred during the forthcoming year. I trust that in Western Australia and South Australia, where women already have the franchise, advantage will be taken of the system in vogue, and the rolls merely altered to suit the electoral boundaries. Even in that work some little care will have to be exercised, and some expense incurred, though I hope that expense will be small. I very nearly, if not quite, agree with - the views placed before the committee by the honourable member for North Sydney. From the utterances of several honourable members, the Minister will see the course of conduct the committee wish him to pursue, though that is a course he has already expressed his intention of following as far as possible.",51
347,Mr THOMSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," The Minister for Home Affairs seems to have misunderstood some of my arguments. For instance, he took it that I proposed the abolition of his department and the happy despatch of himself. I accept the. department as in existence, but I say that, so far as the sub-departments are concerned, it has not justified its existence, seeing that these sub-departments could with advantage be attached to other departments, and administrative expense thereby saved. I admit that other services may yet have to be transferred to the Commonwealth, and these will, no doubt, in the future fully justify the existence of the Home department. What I drew attention to was the creation of separate departments which are not altogether subordinate, secretaries having been appointed to each. Such work as that of the Electoral-office should be strictly subordinate, and, in fact, be carried out by the administrative staff of the department of Home Affairs. These separate secretaries demand higher status, because they are attached to separate departments, and if that sort of thing goes on, we shall create many absolutely separate establishments, with officials expecting to be placed nearly on a level with the head of the administrative staff. It is recognised by the public and the taxpayers that all the work proposed to be done by the Commonwealth in connection with public works was being done by the States before federation. If the Federal Government is going to create its own public works staff right throughout Australia-thoug h that, I understand, is not proposed by the Minister-w e shall find, side by side with the States' departments, a large and expensive federal establishment. . The Minister truly says that the States ought to be able to save if this work be taken over by the Commonwealth ; but at present we see no indication of saving, and the States cannot save in proportion to the new expenditure. The States have to retain the frame-work of departments, with the head officials, and the only reductions which can be made are in connection with officers of the lower grades. I understand that the Minister proposes that there shall be a federal works officer in each State, but that will probably mean in time that there will be demands for draughtsmen, clerks of works, and so on. Bit by bit, even in spite of the efforts of the Minister, unless Parliament checks it very strongly, we shall find a large and costly establishment, the officers of which will try to create work and increase expense. W it h the sub-departments which the Minister has chosen to take under his control, and the services which may be in the future transferred, it will in the plying of things requiring control be a very easy matter for this department to grow beyond his intention. I agree with those who ' have said that if an officer is to be appointed to the position of architect-in-chief, he should be a man to whom the Commonwealth can confidently entrust the important and, to a large extent, uncontrolled and distant work which will have to be performed. Such an officer will have to carry out his duties at a distance, and I hope he will be a man of character and ability, who will justify the confidence of Parliament.",51
348,Mr A MCLEAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I look with a great deal of apprehension on the manner in which this department is being arranged, with five or six sub-departments under the control of high-salaried officers. Almost the whole of the additional expenditure is absorbed by these high salaries, and when the padding is filled in with lowersalaried officers, we can imagine the magnitude to which the department may grow. We find that the services which are proposed to be carried out by this departeffect ment have hitherto been administered the States at a cost of about whereas at present they cost £144,000.",52
349,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,How does the the honourable member arrive at thesefigures?,52
350,Mr A MCLEAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,The figures with the asterisks are supposed to represent the cost of the services at the time of transfer.,52
351,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That is the amount which we are proposing to. spend this year on the services. ' Mr A.MCLEAN - Whatisthe£144,000 ?",52
352,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That is the total cost of the department. We could not ascertain exactly what had been spent on repairs, rent, and maintenance in the different States.",52
353,Mr A MCLEAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,What has the department to provide for more than the various services ?,52
354,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"There is a considerable amount of new expenditure, amounting to £47,000.",52
355,Mr A MCLEAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I am taking exception to that. I think that it is unnecessarily large, and I am perfectly sure that it will grow. We know from past experience that if a sub-department is created under highly paid officers-and here we are paying one officer £1,000 a year, another £ 7 5 0 a year, multiand several £600 and £500 a year-it is bound to grow. We clo not require an officer receiving a salary of £1,000 a year to supervise the work of one or two men. I fail to see why several of these services could not be carried out by the central or administrative department. At the present time the cost of the central department is about £5,300 a year. Surely its officers can find time to supervise these sub-departments, which, it appears to me, have been added for the purpose of justif]'ing the magnitude of the cost of the central office? I am anxious to assist the Minister in doing what is best for the-Commonwealth, but if we create these sub-departments, under highly-paid officers, before the necessity for .them arises, they will go on increasing year by year. I agree with those honourable members who. have said that some of the branch services now under the department for Home Affairs could be carried on by other departments. The electoral branch could be carried on by the Attorney-General's department.",52
356,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That would not . any saving. It would simply mean by the transfer of the expenditure to the"" £97,000, Attorney-General's vote.",52
357,Mr A MCLEAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I fail to see why the central office should not administer some of branches which it is proposed to create as special sub-departments. I strongly urge Minister to consider the suggestion, and see if he cannot so re-arrange the department that it wilL involve the least cost to the Commonwealth. Why, for should we sanction the cost of administering the deparbment of the Inter-State Commission 1",52
358,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That proposed vote will be withdrawn. It was inserted as far back as last September, when it was thought that the Inter-State Commission Bill would be passed.",53
359,Mr A MCLEAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I am glad to hear that. I hope that the Minister will see whether further reductions cannot be made in the number of these sub-departments. I trust that great care will be . exercised in making appointments to offices for which high salaries have been provided, and that the necessity for filling them will be demonstrated before the House is asked to sanction any appointment. It is no trivial matter to create bhese offices, and until the necessity for each service arises I hope bliab the Government will not ask Parliament to sanction their creation.  think that ib is being demonstrated every day that the chief object for which the Commonwealth was brought into existence was the creation 'of a number of deparbments so that Minisbers might provide fat billets for many of their friends.",53

I object to these so-called temporary appointments, when, as a matter of fact, the Minister knows that they are to be permanent. It is apparent that the committee is going to support the formation of a Commonwealth Public Works department. Why I do not know, when there are men in the State departments who would carry out our works. We are proposing to have a highly paid official practically to supervise his own movements in connection with public works. The same thing is going on in every department. Too many appointments have been made in every one of them. I shall lodge my protest against the proposal to create a Public Works department for the Commonwealth, and divide the committee upon it . I have sufficient confidence in the officers of the States departments to believe that they are able to carry out all the works that we require, and that if we entrust the work to them we shall avoid the duplication of expense.",54

371,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The point is that if there is a rush of work the State officials will do the State work first.  monwealth has taken over at least three very large departments, is it likely that the State officials will be overburdened with work-that things will be worse in the future in that respect than they have been in the past ? The creation of this Works department is a piece of gross extravagance, and the time will come when honourable members will regret it . I lodge my protest against it .",54
372,Mr BROWN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I think that the lines which the debate has followed have been largely due to the speech of the honourable member for North Sydney, and I am pleased that he has since explained his position, because the impression he first made upon me and others was that he aimed at the abolition of the Department for Home Affairs. He directed attention particularly to the sub-departments, which he considered would be better administered by other Ministers. It was suggested, for example, that the Electoral office should be under the control of. the Attorney-General or of the Postmaster-General, but if effect were given to such suggestions there would be nothing for the Minister for Home Affairs to do.",54
373,Mr THOMSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,There are other depart ments yet to be taken over which would justify his existence.,54
374,Mr BROWN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"It seems to me that the sub-departments which have been allotted to the Minister for Home Affairs come properly under his control. Not the least of them is the Electoral office, whose work could not be properly performed, either under State control or as part of some other department, without the infliction of great injustice upon the Commonwealth. The department is one whose functions practically give life to the Commonwealth, and it is of such large dimensions that itcould very readily become disorganized, which would tend in the direction of stultifying the movement. Objection has been taken to the fact that the heads of sub-depart ments have been termed ""secretaries,"" but it does not matter what they are called, so long as the committee keep a watchful eye upon the salaries proposed. This Parliament has provided for a special Commonwealth franchise, and is about to devise special electoral machinery. A number of the States do not recognise adult suffrage, and some of them recognise a property qualification, or impose limitations upon the suffrage, which we have not allowed. Therefore, it seems to me that if the. administration of the electoral office were left in the hands of State officials, our efforts to place the Commonwealth franchise upon a solid democratic basis must fall to the ground.  about the electoral office. I attacked the proposed Public AVorks department.",54
375,Mr BROWN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Well , other honourable gentlemen have suggested that the electoral office should be made part of some other department, but I am thoroughly in sympathy with the proposal of the Government to make it a special department. I shall have something to say later on upon the question who should be at the head of that department. The Inter-State Commission, the Public Service Commissioner's department, and the Public AVorks department are all very important departments, which must be kept separate in order to secure efficiency.  officers than private citizens eventually.",55
376,Mr BROAVN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"If that happens it will be the fault of the committee. It has been suggested that the Commonwealth Parliament should practically abrograte its functions, and hand over its administrative work to the States, the plea being put forward that that would lessen expense and save the duplication of offices. But it has been well said that no man can serve two masters.",55
377,Mr THOMSON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,There is only one master - the people.,55
378,Mr BROAVN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Unfortunatel y the public servants do not recognise the people as their master. If we are to maintain efficiency of administration and obtain cheapness, we must not delegate our powers to the States. I believe, from what I have seen, that the State officials are more inclined to recognise the heads of their departments in the States than to recognise the federal authority, with the result that federal work is neglected for State work. No doubt it will be possible to largely use State officials for the carrying on of minor works, but for larger works there must be proper Commonwealth control, and the purpose of the proposed Public AVorks department is to secure that control.  tion of offices.",55
379,Mr BROWN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I do not agree with the honourable member, but in any case the expenditure will be. less wasteful than where there is an absence of responsibility, as must happen under State, control. The honourable and learned member for Parkes and others have objected to work being carried out by State departments, upon the say score that the methods adopted in New South Wales, at any rate, are such as should not be sanctioned by any well regulated Government. I do not agree with them. In New South Wales, when the contract system was the only system under which public works were carried out, the Government were compelled to fix minimum rates of wage, not only in justice to the workmen employed, but as a protection to themselves. Prior to the adoption of that system, contracts were cut down to such an extent that decent wages could not be paid, with the result that the work done was very inferior, and the wages of the men were ground down to the lowest possible rate. The Government were eventually compelled to adopt a minimum wage provision, which was first introduced by Mr Young, the Minister for Works in the Reid Government. Later on, the day labour system was adopted, and to the honourable member for Parramatta-wh o was then PoslmasterGeneral in the New South Wales Government-the credit is due of first putting that system into practice in connection with a large work which was being carried out in his department. All the arguments which have been used by the honourable and learned member for Parkes were then employed with the object of discrediting that system, and the Minister for Home Affairs was among its opponents. A committee was appointed by the New South Wales Legislature to report upon the subject, and their decision was in favour of the departure made by the honourable member for Parramatta. it was the report of that committes which convinced . the Minister for Home Affairs that the system was the right one to adopt. Contractors grind their workmen down as much as possible, in order to increase their profits, and immense fortunes have been made by those who are now loudest in their complaints against the day labour system. In some cases that system does not appear in a favourable 'light, but these are few and far between, and they cannot be compared with instances which could be quoted against the contract system. One notable case in New South Wales,-which the honourable member for Parkes may remember, was the MCSharry case. That was one of the most putrid cases of a number of the same kind, and it practically killed the system of contract in that State by illustrating the methods by which the Government and the people were bled. The State is compelled to maintain an efficient staff for the supervision of the work done by contract, and this staff can be utilized with the best effect in carrying out works by day labour. The Government are relieved of all risks of heavy law costs, such as have been incurred under the conCommonwealth. tract system, and they are in a position to ensure efficient work, and the payment good wages to the workmen. Despite the charges brought against the Works departCommonwealthfor ment of New South Wales by the honortails able and learned member for Parkes, the authorities in that - State are prepared place day labour methods in competition with those of the contract system, and abide by the result. Recently the State Minister of Works invited such a comDefence parison in connection with the erection two new wings at the Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney. It was proposed that one should be erected by day labour, whilst the other was carried out by-contract, so that a comparison might be made between the respective systems, but advocates of the contract system were not prepared to face the result. In another case the Minister of Works in New South Wales called for tenders for a small work, and a contract was let for £120. The contractor, however, Estimates. finding that there was not a sufficient margin of p of it , threw up the work, and the Minister had it earned out by day labour at a cost, not of £ 1 2 0 , but of This is only one of many instances that the time. could .be adduced to show that works can be carried out economically with day labour, provided the management is efficient. The day labour system has on the whole through given much greater satisfaction than has the contract system in New South Wales. When we come to - the consideratotal tion of the items under this departNow, ment, I hope the Minister will, consent to postpone Division 16, which relates to electoral office. The leader of the labour party desires to make a few remarks regard to this most important department, and I am sure that the Minister is desirous that evei'y-opportunity should be afforded for f u ll discussion.",55

396,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Furnitur e and fittings cost only £3,500 in New South Wales; and repairs , and maintenance cost £3,150 in Victoria, as against £6,550 in New South Wales. The honourable member, will also observe that repairs and maintenance in the Defence department amount to £13,605 in Victoria, as against £9,482 in New South Wales. The expenditure depends on the exigencies of the service.",57
397,Mr VL SOLOMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,What I wish to point out is that the expenditure in this particular department promises - to be,57
398,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,It is not so great as on reunder the States Governments.,57
399,Mr VL SOLOMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I am inclined to believe that it is greater, and that it will be an increasing quantity. We find that the departments of the Commonwealth pay in rent, £21,000 odd ; for repairs and maintenance, £64,900 ; and for furniture and £15,590. In South Australia we have been crying out for an expenditure ©f £20 0 or £300 for repairs and additions to post-offices, which were approved before the Commonwealth was established, and all we have got is £1,350, as against £9,000 expended in this way in New South Wales.",57
400,Sir GEORGE TURNER,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The sum of £.4,000 is provided for additions in South Australia, as against £800'in Victoria.",57
401,Mr VL SOLOMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Althoug h I cannot see eye to eye with the honourable  as to the non-necessity of having officers in but federal employment, i think arrangements might, in many instances, be made, so as to avoid having departments in each State. is In regard to those departments which belong r to the States, and for which the States have to find the money, the local Governments be only too pleased to permit their officers to do their level best in arthe ranging and overseeing contracts for the construction of and additions to buildings.",57
402,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,What Ministerwould allow expenditure without control ?,57
403,Mr VL SOLOMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,The Minister would have control.,57
404,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I have no control at the present time.,57
405,Mr VL SOLOMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Althoug h the department is nominally under his control, does the Minister say that he should be the arbiter as to the cost of buildings, or how they should be erected ?",57
406,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Certainly .,58
407,Mr VL SOLOMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Does the Minister mean to say that, notwithstanding that it costs a great deal more to carry out work for which the States have to pay than it would do if we were to employ the services of officers in the State departments ? I am not speaking of the building of a Commonwealth capital, or of any Commonwealth offices. I am referring to repairs to post and telegraph offices.",58
408,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,That work is under the. Commonwealth.,58
409,Mr VL SOLOMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"It happens to be the work of the Commonwealth because the departments were taken over hurriedly. It would have been very much better if some of the departments had been allowed to remain with the States, during this session at all events. While the States have to pay the expenditure in connection with these departments, and to receive any balance of receipts, I think that every economy should be exercised, and that, if the State Governments are willing to assist us in the work of supervising contracts, we should accept their assistance. I presume that officers of the State departments advise the Commonwealth Government in regard to what is necessary in the shape of repairs and additions to postal and other public buildings, and that the Minister does not go himself or send over one of his officers to see whether an expenditure of £ 1 0 0 should be made in repairs and additions to public buildings at Quorn or Port Augusta. If he did the travelling expenses would very quickly mount up. As long as the States have to pay the piper they should have something to do with setting the tune. There are one or two items under the heading of ""miscellaneous,"" which I think the committee will dispose of after a very brief discussion. Eor instance, there is a proposed vote of £ 5 0 0 to provide fora memorial to be erected at Corowa to commemorate the formation of the first federal league in the Commonwealth.  ber vote against that ? Mr VL SOLOMON.'- I do not think that the committee would occupy much time in determining to strike out that item, because, if there is any proposed expenditure in the department which would be regarded as extravagant, it is this. It would be just as sensible for the State of Victoria to say that a statue of Mr George Meudell should be erected at Kyabram. Another item to which I wish to call attention is the proposed expenditure of £2,000 for expenses in connection with the valuation of properties taken over from the States. I am not aware that properties have been, taken over in respect of the valuation of which the amount named would be a reasonable charge.",58
410,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The item relates to expenses in connection with the valuation of the properties of the Post-office and Customs department, and so on, which have been taken over from the States, but which have not been valued up to the present time.",58
411,Mr VL SOLOMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I presume that the work of valuation is going on ?,58
412,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Not for the Commonwealth. The officers will be appointed very shortly.,58
413,Mr VL SOLOMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The officers have not been appointed, yet we are asked to vote this sum.",58
414,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Does not the honourable member know that the item to which he refers was prepared some time ago ?,58
415,Mr VL SOLOMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Then it will be struck out ? 1,58
416,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Probably . It was prepared with other Estimates nearly twelve months ago.,58
417,Mr VL SOLOMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Surely , before bringing down thehproposals, the Government should have omitted all items in connection with which no expenditure has taken place during the present financial year.",58
418,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,We shall omit them when we deal with the Appropriation Bill.,58
419,Mr VL SOLOMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"At the present time, when federation is not popular in all the States, and when our population is suffering from the worse drought we have had for many years, it is a great mistake to load up the Estimates. I hope that we shall be able to make a very large reduction in them, and a good many in those of the department for Home Affairs particularly.",58
420,Mr CROUCH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I think that the best point of the debate was that made by the honourable member for Maranoa, when he inquired from the Treasurer whether he approved of a certain allowance being made to Mr Victor Cohen. It really raised the question of the position occupied by the Treasurer in regard to the Estimates, and I think that the honourable member had a right strongly to desire an answer to his. In query. The Treasurer did not give him one. I know that the Treasurer has the confidence of the people of Australia, and particularly that of the people of Victoria, and when he sits at the table with the Minister for Home Affairs and supports him in regard to these items, he is really committing us who know him to be a careful, economical administrator to the belief that they have his approval. Mr. JOSEPH COOK,-Of course they must have his approval and that of all the Ministers.",58
421,Mr CROUCH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I am referring to someparticulars thing more than the mere solidarity of the Cabinet, or loyalty to fellow Ministers.",59
422,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I am these Estimates, and I shall have something to say about the matter to which the able and learned member refers.",59
423,Mr CROUCH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The Minister for Home Affairs is in charge of the Estimates relating to his own department, but the Treasurer has a larger responsibility in regard to Therefore, depending as we do upon the Treasurer to see that strict economy is served, I submit that unless he informs that he does not approve of certain appointin ments, we can take it that-he thinks that the payments provided for in the Estimates, department. including the allowance made to Mr Cohen, are satisfactory. I understand the solidarity of the support which is given by one Minister to another, but in regard to the Estimates, the Treasurer must have the dominant hand. I do not know that such is not the case, if it is not, the committee should be formed of the fact. The Minister for Home Affairs has a right to say that he requires the appointment of certain officers, but Treasurer, having the finances of the monwealth at his fingers' ends",59
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,I rise to order. Estimates for the Department for Home Affairs are under discussion ; but I have yet to learn that we are required to listen to debate upon the relations of Ministers.,59
425,The CHAIRMAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Will the honourable and learned member confine himself to Estimates for the Department for Home Affairs?,59
426,Mr CROUCH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Ye s ; but I desire refer to the financial aspect of the departcountant, ment, and to that extent my references the responsibility of the Treasurer 36 s strictly relevant. If the Treasurer considers that any of the offices provided for are unnecessary, or that any of the salaries are extravagant, he owes a duty to the Parliament and to the Commonwealth to tell us so. The committee would support him in any such action.",59
427,Mr SALMON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,We are not likely to have that until we have an elective Ministry.,59
428,Mr CROUCH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That will not be adopted for a time. ' I am glad to see that the Treasurer, by his silence, shows that the Estimates hav,e his approval. If they have, I fail to see any necessity for discussing the items in detail, we have not sufficient to take the responsibility. My confidence in the Treasurer is sufficient to lead me to support these items if they in charge of have his approval.",59
429,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I cannot allow honour the extraordinary speech made by the honourable and learned member for Corio to go without notice. I wish him to know that I am in charge of these Estimates ; that I and no one else administer the departthem. ment for Home Affairs. I am aware of the great confidence which the honourable oband learned member reposes in the TreaT us surer, and I hope that before I have been the Ministry much longer he will have all a little confidence in me and in my These Estimates have been prepared for my department, and if there is anything wrong, I am responsible. In reference to H r Cohen's expenses, 1I have only to say that if I had known as much in the first instance as I know now, there would but have been no need to obtain his services; inbut I held then, and I still hold, that the Commonwealth should not pay to an officer transferred from a State department a the smaller salary than he was receiving from Comthe State. While Mr Cohen was in Melbourne, his wife and familv were residing in The Sydney, and his actual expenses were probably nearly as large as his salary.  a mised that after a certain date no further allowances would be paid.",59

431,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Yes , - but the amount is less than would have been expended by the States under similar circumstances. I have compared these Estimates with the State expenditure of previous years.  that the next Estimates will not be increased ?",60
432,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"That will depend upon the requirements of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Gippsland stated that, whereas the amount expended by the State departments was something like £97,000, the amount which would be expended by the Commonwealth department under my control was something like £144.000, but, as a matter of fact, there is a difference of only £13,000, including every department under my control.  explanation in regard to the payment of the allowance to Mr Cohen justifies the division taken upon the Defence estimates. Minister's word cannot be taken, what are honourable members to do ?",60
433,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Pu t out the Ministry.  places a worse lot. I should be very sorry to see the honourable and learned member for Parkes in office. The Prime Minister told us that after a certain date no more allowances would be paid, and yet two officers in the Home Secretary's department continue to receive allowances.",60
434,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Who officer to whom the honourable member refers 1  According to the papers put before us by the Treasurer, he has been receiving day.",60
435,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The information that the' honourable member has is not correct. The allowance which the officer to whom refers was receiving was only 10s. a and it was stopped immediately the promise of the Prime Minister was given..  these Estimates are lower than the State Estimates. That is probably because some of the sub-departments have come into fident existence only a month or two beforethe end of the financial year. ' I should like know, in connection with the Public Service Commissioner's department, if a secretary, a clerk and shorthand writer, and a messenger, are to make up his whole staff.",60
436,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Yes , so far as I know.  so, but I am afraid that each of these sub-departments will require as large a staff as the administrative staff. The State departments have been growing year by year. The honourable member for Wentworth told us that when he was in office he had to tell the public servants of New South Wales that if things went on as they were going they would have to face a Black Wednesday, and something of that kind will happen in connection with the Commonwealth service if a tight rein is not kept upon the public expenditure. Has the Inspector-General of Works been appointed yet ?",60
437,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,No . I do not think I have appointed any officer in that department.,60
438,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"An y appointment made in the future must be made through the Public Service Commissioner. Ifa Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I am not sure that that applies to the Inspector-General of Works, but the Public Service Commissioner must be consulted.  North Sydney has raised the complaint that the Minister is making the head of each of these sub-departments a secretary instead of a chief clerk.",60
439,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I am quite pre-' pared to call them all chief clerks, if that does not affect their position - under the is the other Public Service Act.  clerks, we shall know what they are. My experience of secretaries is that they are as unapproachable as Ministers. W it h regard £ 1 a to the carrying out of Commonwealth public works, I think that we should be masters of the situation. I know that the Queensland Public Works department is he not quite what I should like to see it. The day, honourable member for South Australia,.  two Public Works departments; but if we take into the Commonwealth service officers from the State service; there will be no increase of expenditure,' and I am conthat, all things being equal, officers of the States service will have the preto ference when appointments are being made. The principle of the minimum wage to which the honourable and learned member for Parkes has taken so much objection has already been recognised in our legislation, because a provision was inserted in the Post and Telegraph Act that all persons employed in carrying out contracts under the Postal department should be paid the minimum wage. The honourable and learned member says that he is in favour of the contract system, but we know that for many years past contractors have been growing fat upon somebody-eithe r the workers or the Government, or perhaps both. The honourable and learned member also said that the wages paid by the Government for day labour were 50 per cent, higher than those paid by contractors.",60
440,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"What I that one method of working cost 50 per cent, more than the other.  I would point out that only a week or so ago the Minister for Lands in New South Wales called for tenders for theconstrue-' tion of baths at Coogee, and the lowest contract price was £800. This was considered to be too much, and it was decided to carry out the work by day labour, the estimated cost being £350; for which they are quite satisfied that they will be able to complete the structure. I know what contracting is, and I have made a fine thing out of the Queensland Government under the contract system. They, however, have closed down on all that sort of thing in the northern State, and are building their railways by day labour.",61
441,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"I suppose the honourable member took it out of the men,  could. I looked out for a good solid contiact, and my object was to make money. If I could put in a bad piece of' timber, and the inspector would let it go, I took care to utilize it . The minimum wage principle, as now adopted by most of the State Governments, is one of the greatest blessings in Australia. I can quite understand the honourable member'for Parkes being opposed to it, because he is the only hard-crusted conservative I have met in Australia. The Minister for AVorks in New South Wales is opposed to him in his fiscal ideas, and also in his notions of political economy.",61
442,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"He is also opposed to the honourable member in his fiscal ideas. 36 s 2  What I desire is to bring about good social conditions for the worker, and my present impression is that free-trade will best contribute to that end. Perhaps I may be convinced later on that protection will accomplish my object. I have been a worker, and I have been an employer, and I know the evils of the contracting system from every point of view. I worked at one time for Mr MCSharry, who was once represented by .the honourable and learned member for Parkes.",61
443,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The honourable member is quite wrong; I appeared for the Government on that occasion.  said was because the case was a smellful one from beginning to end. Recently the secretary "" of the A ictorian Employers' Federation was r travelling through the country, asking why the employers should be called upon to pay their men wages such as would enable them to get married, to go to the theatre, or towear suits of black clothes. It is ideas such as these which find support from the honourable and learned member for Parkes. W hy should the worker be sturdy, well-fed, wellclothed, and enjoy himself 1 Why should he take unto himself a wife 1 Do the employers wish to fill the Commonwealth with illegitimate children % It is very easy to be virtuous on £10,000 a year, but when any law is passed for the benefit of the worker, the honourable and learned member for Parkes says that it is against all sound economical principles, and that the workman should go into the open market, and sell his labour in free competition. That is free-trade, according to the ideas of the honourable and learnedmember, but not as I understand it .",61
444,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,W hy would the honourable member admit foreign made cheap goods?  them as cheaply as I can.,61
445,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"The cheapest goods do not come from the countries where the lowest wages are paid.  come from the countries where they pay the highest wages. So far as the Commonwealth Public Works department is concerned, I will stand by the Ministry.",61
446,Mr MAHON,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," There is one matter which I should like to mention to the Minister. I see that we are about to vote a certain sum for the office of the Public Service Commissioner. In the State of Western Australia the administration of the public service has, unfortunately, not been satisfactory to most of the employees, and they hope that an independent officer from one of the eastern States will be appointed as inspector under the Public Service Act. They think that such an officer will be in a better position to deal impartially with them, and that he will be more free from local influences than would a local officer. Of course, any qualified gentleman in the Western Australian service should be eligible for appointment .as an inspector in one of the other States, but the public servants in that State fear that the influence of the old regime may be perpetuated if an inspector is selected from the local service. The disorganization of the service may be gauged from the fact that - one great strike has already happened in the Post and Telegraph department, and many others have been narrowly averted. The strike to which I refer took place in 1.895, but the present condition of affairs in the service is very little better than at that time. W it h regard to the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Parkes --as to results of constructing public works on the day labour system; I may mention that in Western Australia the Government have been building railways by day labour, and have been able to carry out the work more - economically and speedily than under the contract system.",61
447,Mr TUDOR,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," The honourable and learned member for Parkes said that a majority of the members of this committee would probably be opposed to the adoption of the day labour system of carrying out public works under the Commonwealth, but I am convinced that very few honourable members, would follow the lead of the able and learned member for Parkes if he were to bring forward a resolution embodying the doctrines which he has enunciated to-night. This Parliament has adopted the - principle of the minimum wage so far as the .Postal department is concerned, and no - doubt any other opportunities which may pre ent themselvesforaffirmingthatprinciple will be availed of. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. posed vote agreed to. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION ACT . Motion (by Mr DEAKIN ) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",62
448,Mr CROUCH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS," I should like to draw the attention of the Attorney-General to the fact that under section 3, sub-section B, of the Immigration Restriction Act, an Australian native, named George MCCauly, who was born in Victoria, was in Western Australia, on the 12th May last, sentenced to be imprisoned for one month, and afterwards to be returned to Victoria as soon as possible by the steamer Ma/rloo, on the ground that he was a prohibited immigrant. The following is a report of the proceedings from the Perth Morning Herald of the 13th MayA one-legged man named George MCCauly was charged under section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Act with being a prohibited immigrant. Inspector M'cKenna stated that the defendant arrived in Fremantle on the 9th inst. b}' the s.s. Marloo, and on the following day applied for admission to the Old Men's Home. He had only one leg, and no money, and was likely to become a C ermanent charge on the State. ench to convict the defendant and have him He asked the sent back to Melbourne on the Marloo. MCCauly - I had £ 3 10s., but lost it on board the boat. The defendant was ordered a month's imprisonment, and to be sent back as soon as possible on the Marloo to Melbourne. The case was also reported in the Sydney Morning Herald of 13th May. I submit that when an Australian native passes from one State to another it is not the intention of the Immigration Restriction A ct that he should, even if poor and possessing only one leg, be dealt with in such a way.",62
449,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,The prosecution must have been under some local Act.,62
450,Mr CROUCH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"Accordin g to the rehonor- port the prosecution was under the Immigration Restriction Act. It is provided in section 3 of that A ct that a prosecution can take place only through a collector or some officer appointed for the purpose. I do not know whether Inspector MCKenna is a collector under the Act, but if he is, some explanation is necessary. If he is not, the prosecution appears to have been illegal, and it is the duty of the Commonwealth to protect its citizens, from whatever State Prothey come. This is certainly a case which demands inquiry. When we are trying in every way possible to remove the barriers between the States, we do not want to pass Acts by which it is possible for.a merely unfortunate man to be treated as a criminal. I ask the Attorney-General to make some inquiry.",62
451,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS, I shall certainly make some inquiry. I presume the Marloo is a vessel trading botween Melbourne and Fremantle 1,63
452,Mr CROUCH,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,Yes .,63
453,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,"In that case the prosecution could not possibly have taken place under the Commonwealth Imm gration Restriction Act, but must have been under some, local Immigration Act. Mr Citouen - But the prosecution was under a section which entirely agrees with the section of the Commonwealth Act.",63
454,Mr DEAKIN,EMPLOYME NT OF ABORIGINALS,It is quite possible that there may be a similar section in both the Commonwealth Act and a local Act. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 11.3 p.m.,63
