1,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,"-It is my melancholy duty toannounce to the House that the honofable member for Plinders (Mr Ryan), who has been a very highly regarded and valued member of this chamber; died at au early hour today, at the age of 68 yoars. The lnte Colonel Rupert Stunner Ityan enjoyed the great affectionand rospect of members of all political parties represented in this Parliament. He had been a member for Flinders since 1940, and was a member of the Social Security Committee until it ceased to function. As most honourable gentlemen areaware, he served with great distinction in World War I . , and attained the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He was mentioned in despatches five times, and gained the Distinguished Service Order in 1918. From 1920, he was BritishDeputy High Commissioner with theRhineland High Commission at Cobleng. In 1928, he was made a Companion of .the Order of St. Michael and St. George. Oh the llth October, 1950, he was appointed Deputy Chairman of Committees during the absence of Mr Speaker overseas, and at the time of his death he was a. Temporary Chairman of Committees and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The news of his - lentil has come with great suddenness to nil honourable members. I do not think that any of us was aware of any condition in the health of the late honourable member which could have caused his sudden death. It is my sad duty to place on record our sense of loss, both personal and political, in this chamber, and to convey, on behalf of the House, to the family of the late honourable gentleman an expression of our warm admiration and our happy memories of Ms performance of his duty in the Parliament of Australia. I move That this House expresses its deep regret the death ot Mr Rupert Sumner Ryan, C.M.G., D.S.O., who at the time of his death was Member for the Division of Flinders in the House of Representatives, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public Berviee, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.",12
2,Dr EVATT,Unknown," I second the motion. Colonel Byan was active in the House so recently that ordinary words of regret seem quite inadequate to meet this tragic occasion. As the Prime Minister (Mr . Menzies) has pointed out, the late honourable gentleman had a most distinguished military career. He made many i m portant contributions to the debates in this House, particularly on international affairs, of which ho was a keen student. It is very difficult to associate himwith ordinary party .politics, although he was, of course, an active supporter of his party. It is certain that we, on this side of the House, will feel his loss as much as any, and I join with the Prime Minister in expressing, on behalf of members of the Opposition, our deep regret at his death, and our tender sympathy with his relatives.",13
3,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,Unknown," I desire to associate the members of the Australian Country party with the sentiments of regret which have been expressed on the occasion of the dndth of the late honourable member for Flinders, Mr Rupert Byan, a man who endeared himself to all with whom he came'in contact. He was a kindly man, and will he greatly missed. ' He had a tolerant outlook, and was a profound student of world affairs, his knowledge being such that he was a most valuable member of the Parliament. I join with the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, in expressing, on behalf of the members of the Australian Country party, our deepost sympathy with his relative? in their bereavement. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. NA STEPHEN ROPER PIESS E.",13
4,Mr MENZIES,DEATH OF SENATOREDMUN D," It is my sad task to refer to the death on the 26th August of SenatoT Edmund Stephen Roper Piesse,"" of ""Western Australia; The honourable gentleman, who was 52 years of age, became a senator for Western Australia in 1950, so that the length of his parliamentary service was not great. However, long before lie entered this Parliament, he war prominently associated with the affairt of the Australian Country party in ""Western Australia, and had earned a high place in the regard of his colleagues. He was a member of the Australian Imperial Force in World War I . , and upon his return from active service became prominently associated .with the merino breeding industry. This activity lasted from 1919 to 1946. For ten years the late Senator Piesse was president of the Katanning Agricultural Society, and for three years he was a member of the Katanning Roads Board. He had extensive business interests in Katanning, and was .chairman of the Katanning Stock and Trading Company. It wil l be seen from that simple narrative of the facts that Senator Piesse brought with him into the Parliament a very large experience of country affairs. It is indeed a misfortune that after so short a period of service in the Senate he should have met a relatively early death. The late Senator Piesse is survived by a widow and one daughter. Although he was not a member of this House I am sure that it is the general feeling of honourable members that we should place on record OUT appreciation of the work done by him. our regret at his untimely demise, and our warm and profound sympathy with his relatives. I move That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of Senator Edmund Stephen Roper Piesse, a member of the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.",13
5,Dr EVATT,DEATH OF SENATOREDMUN D," I second the motion. We of the House of Representatives do not have the same opportunity as do our colleagues of the Senate to become acquainted with the newer members of the Senate, hut my colleagues from the Senate have asked me particularly to pay tribute to Senator Fiesse for liis broad outlook on national problems and for his frequent contributions of value to the Senate. Therefore, the members of the Opposition join with the Prime Minister (M.r. Menzies) and the House in expressing regret at the loss of a servant of the State and of the nation, and in expressing special sympathy and sorrow, with his relatives. Sir ABTHUB, FADDEN (MCPhersonTreasurer) - On behalf of the Australian Country party I associate myself with the sentiments which have been expressed concerning the untimely passing of Senator Piesse. I was not privileged to know Senator Piesse for very long. I had been acquainted with him only since, his election as a senator for Western Australia and as a member of the party which [ have the honour to lead. However, I knew him for a sufficiently long period toappreciate in him all the qualities of an outstandingly modest and conscientious man. W it h the Prime Minister (Mr . Menzies), and the Leader of the Opposition (Or. Evatt) I support the motion of sympathy for his wife, and daughter who are loft to mourn his loss.",14
6,Mr BEAZLEY,DEATH OF SENATOREDMUN D," Because the late Senator Fiesse frequently remained at Canberra for week-ends, as I do myself, I came to know him very well. I should not like to lose this opportunity to pay a tribute to him. Senator Piesse was a man whom T shall remember as being most charitable in his political judgments and as entirely free of the misrepresentations which form a large part of political conflict in this country. If any one word could be used to sum up his character, I think that it honestly could be said that he was a gentleman. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. ADJOURNMENT.",14
7,Mr MENZIES,DEATH OF SENATOREDMUN D," As a mark of respect to the memory of the deceased honourable gentlemen, I move That the House do now adjourn. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 2.43 p.m.",14
