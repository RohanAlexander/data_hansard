And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications. So it appears clear by the Constitution that the function of the Senate, if it wishes to perform it , is to send a message requesting omissions or amendments.",14

9,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"The Senate returns the Bill with the suggestions contained in the memorandum which I have read, in which suggestions it requests the concurrence of the House of Representatives.",15
10,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"That is the form amendment, not of suggestion.",15
11,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"That is the form applicable to any amendment, but i none the less applicable to a suggestion. The faot is that the Senate has observed its province so far as this matter concerned by making suggestions and questing concurrence. The precise form power. to he followed is not a vital question; is the spirit of the message which has be considered. The spirit which dictates' this message-withou t reference to other things, which I will advert to further on- mentioned in the Bill. is evidently that of suggesting to this House certain alterations in which the Senate requests our concurrence. The fact that i requests concurrence does not vitiate those suggestions in the slightest degree, nor does the fact, thattho request for currence has been applicable in the post amendments, make it any the less a sugstates gestion. The whole thing breathes the spirit of suggestion. Therefore I do not intend to quarrel with the message on the mere matter of form. As to the substance of it I shall have something to say sently, but I am not wholly in accord the suggestions. The position of the House of Representatives is that if it thinks fit moke any of the amendment suggested, with or without modification, it can do so. As to two of the suggested omissions, T ' think that the House can make them without any loss of dignity, or without givingaway any principle, so long as in respect of the third it maintains the position indicated for it by the Constitution. The suggestion, that I mention as the third is the one - which, in the memorandum, stands as No. 2, and it suggests that we leave out of the recital the wordsFor the purpose of appropriating the grant made by the House of Representatives.",15
12,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,M i g h t I suggest to my right honourable and learned friend that he might send for the Bill. The Bill might be distributed so that honourable members have it' before them.,15
13,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"I will have as many copies as are here handed round. As I have-, already said, I think that two of the requests can be acceded to without any loss to the position of this House, and while I think that non-accession to them would provoke an unnecessary delay in supply, and also an unnecessary fight about what is after all not a matter of principle, I consider that, of a matter of principle is involved in that which "" I have just. read. It is quite true, and every one will admit it, that t is the grant of supply is not complete until the Bill appropriating supply has passed, so that to that extent the-' is Senate and the House of Representaretives exercise a degree of co-ordinate: As to the matter, manner, it method, and time; and, as to the limits of to mode and so on, those questions are not involved here, .because the Senate have not attempted to alter any of the items of supply So long as they leave the Bill alone in respect of the supplies which we wish to be granted, the rest is a' t matter of form rather than of substance. But ' there is this one instance in which I do not propose to adopt the' suggestion of the' conSenate, and I intend to put before the to House a modification of it, which .really the constitutional position of this House, and to which, I think, the Senate cannot take any objection, unless it is very unwise. It will be understood, of course, that in this power of suggestion there is absoprelutely no power of amendment, t rests with with this House to make amendments in the Bill, or to refuse to do so, if we please. to That principle we strictly lay down, so that whatever there may be. in a' suggestion from the Senate, that suggestion can have no force or effect except this House chooses to accede to it . If we think that a suggestion is relevant to the matter in hand-if we think it is important, or one which can be acceded to without loss of dignity or privilege, we can accede to it , but only by making the amendments ourselves ; because the text of this Bill cannot be touched by the . ofcher House. principle I wish to be clearly understood, because I coincide with it entirely.",15
14,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,""" Suggestion"" is merely a colloquial term.",16
15,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"Suggestio n is, as I have been reminded, a colloquial term forfcheconstitutional righfc of the Senate. We shall not quarrel with the form of the message, because it uses this word "" suggestion "" instead of the word "" request,"" inasmuch as the word "" request"" might be a stronger term than the word ""suggestion."" The title of the Bill is- "" An Act to apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund "" a certain sum, and the first suggestion of the Senate is that we should insert two words, and call it - "" An Act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund."" The root of that suggestion is that the Senate claims that its concurrence is necessary in a grant. That is true to the extent that the grant cannot become law without the consent of both Houses, and for the grant to take effect in an Act, the consent of both Houses is necessary. The next suggestion is the more important one. But I will pass fchafc over so that I may deal with the third and less important suggestion. In clause 1 there are the wordsThere shall and may be issued and applied for or towards making good the supply granted to His Majesty for the service of the period ending the thirtieth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and one, the sum of four hundred and ninetyone thousand eight hundred and eighty-two pounds. The alteration suggested by the Senate is this-and it is, as I said before, an alteration that we need not make unless we please, bufc which I shall urge this House to assent to - thaf c after the word ""supply"" the word "" hereby "" be inserted. Now we come to the more important amendment which stands as No. 2 in the memorandum attached to the message. We have prefaced the enacting words by the wordsFor the purpose of appropriating the grant made by the House of Representatives. Then we go on to say- "" Be it enacted,"" and so forth. The Senate wish us to omit those words. I shall not, so far as I am concerned, concur in the suggestion of the Senate, but I propose to retain the words in a modified form which lays down our rights on the strict lines of the Constitution-the safest bed-rock for our stand to be made on. The 53rd section of the Constitution Act proThat vides :-Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. Thafc means that a Bill such as this must originate in the House of Representatives. The question between us on a written Constitution is the right of origination. W it hout origination on the part of this House it is impossible for supplies to be granted out of the public revenue. The main right, of this House-the inalienable righfc-and one which will enable it to maintain its supremacy in fiscal matters-h i matters of the purse-is that conferred hy the provision which I have read. I propose to deal with the suggestion in this way that we shall not concur with the Senate's request that these words be omitted, but that instead of using the wordsFor the purpose of appropriating the grant made by the House of Representatives, we shall say, in place of ""made by,"" ""originated in."" I think that is an amendment to be made by us alone. But it is an amendment which is reasonable, and which ought to meet the views of the Senate, whether it does or does not, and whether it does or does not give away any of the privileges we possess. I know there are those whose* training-whos e political experience as between Assemblies and Legislative Councilsis so bitter to them, and justly so bitter, that they cannot tolerate the idea of even a suggestion coming from such a body as the Senate. As between Councils and Assemblies, I am quite of their opinion, and always have been with honourable members in maintaining that attitude. But as between the House of Representatives and the Senate the position is, to a slight extent, and only to a slight extent, made different by the terms of the Constitution Act. By those terms it is made clear that Bills of this character cannot be amended by the Senate, bufc that they may be the subject of suggestions by way of request \ and unless these suggestions are acceeded to, the Bill must retain its original form, at"": the peril of rejection of supply by the Senate. That is a course which the other House would not be ready to take, except in a case of great emergency. I am not disposed to precipitate a crisis on the matter now, because the suggestions made, taking them altogether, are not serious in view of the fact that our rights are absolutely defined by the Constitution, and no terms or words can ever abrogate them or make them different. I also am not disposed to precipitate a crisis for the ofcher reason that if were a desire on the part of the Senate to do so it does not appear from the message that that desire is affecting them now. say so much in reference to what has taken place in the Senate, I may say that there is reason to think that this matter has been debated there with a freedom from vindicfciveness and temper which it would be just as well for us to mark. . There has not been, so far as I can see, any spirit of intolerance or aggression either in the debate or in the suggestions. Ifc may be that if it were intended to precipitate a quarrel with us, no other occasion would be better than this to seek for it-thaf c I quite admit-but , so far as we are concerned, it is no part of our desire to precipitate quarrels in respect to matters in which our rights in the Constitution are clearly defined, so long as no form of words interferes with our exercise of those rights. I fiud notliing in the form of words here which can in the slightest degree amount to an infringement of the exercise of our undoubted rights. I am inclined, as I think we all ought to lie, to fair dealing with the other House. We exact Hair dealing from them and we should be prepared to grant it in return. My solution of the difficulty is, I suggest, one that is reasonable and fair to both Houses. As has been pointed out to me by the Treasurer, this Bill goes to the Senate, bearing the Clerk's certificateThis Bill originated in the House of Representatives, and having this day passed, is now ready for presentation to the Senate for currence. We wish to retainfchafcmark of origination. Mr CoNnor - That is settled by 53, and we cannot alter it . The amendment is unnecessary.",16
16,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"I want to show, not only effect? by the certificate on the Bill, but by the retention of the words I haveread,fchafcthis is one of those Bills which can only originate in this House-whic h musfc originate here and nowhere else-and a Bill in regard to which constitutional practice had been followed. To that extent I think we ought to push our difference with the Senate, but there is no necessity to push it further. Having maintained the principle-and reinstated the words in the Bill - I think we have done enough. Honourable members will recollect that 1 spoke on this question last week, pointing out the tendency there in regard to' all enactments to dispense with the preamble and confine oneself to the enacting words. Thafc is a tendency If I may which has been exemplified in forms of legislation and even in Supply Bills in some of the States. The position now is that we have inserted words which bear indication that the grant has originated here, but if the form of words is objected co we can maintain the substance by saying in distinct terms that the grant was originated by us. I propose to go to that extent, but it would be fatal to go any further, because I see no real ground of quarrel between the two Houses. The real question was whether the Senate were going to suggest any interference with the sums and amounts and the method of their distribution which we in our grant originated in 'the House, and which were comprised in the Bill. As I find no attempt at such interference I am to a large extent content. If I found any attempt to interfere there I should fall back on the fact that, although the Constitution allows another House to suggest, it is still for us to determine whether we shall allow any grants to be interfered with, and in such a case I should be entirely on the side of this House. But I find no cause of quarrel here, and I propose that a course shall be adopted which I think will obviate any cause of quarrel- a course which does not tend to the whittling away one jot of any of the principles laid down or expressed in the Constitution Act, and one which in the spirit of constitutionalism as ordinarily accepted outside its conConstitution Acts has not the effect of whittling down anything that belongsfcous. - Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN - Does the right honourable and learned member accept the section suggestion to insert "" grant"" ?",17
17,Mr BARTON,Unknown,Yes . bir WILLIAM MCMILLAN - H as it any,17
18,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"I do not think so. The question is, where does the grant originate 1 Ifc originates here, and I will make that «lear in what I am going to propose. By retaining the words which it is suggested we should omit, and by inserting "" originated in "" for "" made^by "" we practically reiterate, if it is necessaiy to do so, the principle laid down in the Constitution. I am not troubled about the word ""grant,"" because in order that a grant may become an A ct it must be a Legislative grant, and the assent of the ofcher House is required. What I am concerned about is that this Bill should come back to us without any attempt to alter it in substance, and with nothing to invoke reprisals or quarrels, or calculated to whittle away any privilege that belongs to vtn. I shall presently movefchafcthe House of Representatives, having taken the Senate's message into consideration, returns the Bill to the Senate with a schedule of amendments entered thereon, and with . an intimation that the amendments are ours and not those of the Senate. I move nowThatfcherequested amendment of the Senate to insert ""hereby"" after the word ""Supply"" in clause 1 be agreed to. The ACTI NG CHAIRMAN (Mr Y . L . Bills, SOLOMON) - I take it the committee prefer to deal with each of the suggestions in order, and I shall therefore put them one by one, but there may be a general discussion on the first amendment, of course within the bounds of the message.",17
19,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown," I have very little to say on the subject. It seems to me that the Government are . taking the righfc course. Af t e r all, in reviewing the debate there is no doubt in my mind that under no possible circumstances can the rights of this House as contained in section of the Constitution A ct be interfered with. The only question which probably some of the legal members of the House may throw that some light on is the difference between the words "" made by "" and the words ""originated in . "" If we take the course proposed by the Prime Minister we simply keep to the Constitution, and certainly, so far'as this Chamber is concerned, the Senate can find no fault with the amend that ment except, perhaps, because it is surother plusage. Section 53 says that proposed Jaws plusage. appropriating revenue or moneys or posing taxation shall not originate in the Senate. That provision is quite clear, and we are simply re-enacting it by using the words "" for the purpose of appropriating the grant originated in the House of Representatives."" Looking at it in that way the words in the preamble are surplusage, re-enacting or copying the words of the Constitution to provide against any possible future inroads upon our privileges under the Constitution.",18
20,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"The insertion of these words might make our position worse, as it might lead to the inference that the grant might originate somewhere else, bufc that it originated in fact in the House of Representatives on this occasion.",18
21,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"That may be, but if I understand the course recommended byfcheGovernment,fcheobject is to prevent the slightest misunderstanding with regard to the rights and privileges of this House, although they are very clearly defined in section 53. An Honorable MEMBEB - We might re-enact the Constitution in every Bill.",18
22,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"We might do that, but so far as the present case is concerned we are dealing with Money and with the question as to the words to be used in these Bills in the future, and whilst I am not at all bound to the proposal now before the House, because it is much more a matter of legal construction than anything else, I think we ought to settle exactly the terms of the preamble of our Bills. . As a layman, I naturally speak with very considerable diffidence on this matter. It seems to me that in their essence the words are surplusage, and that we are simply repeating in a positive form that which occurs in the Constitution in a negative form as regards the other House. 53 The pointfchehonorable and learned member for Iudi takes is, I think, worthy of consideration, because it is a well-known rule if you limit your rights to any extent, you may possibly cramp yourself as far as your larger rights are concerned. However, I am inclined to be entirely guided infchismatter by the House, and especially by those who are authorities on constitutional subjects, although, at the same time, it seems to me the words cannot be objected to by the House, except on the ground of surim Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) - I would like, at the initiation of this discussion, to direct attention to the message whioh has been received from the Senate, and I would suggest that the Clerk should read it again.",18

24,Mr BAIITON,Unknown,We have had absolutely no time to provide copies. We received the message only whenfcheHouse met.,19

26,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"I would like to remind honourable members that unless this Bill is dealt with quickly-and that is why we could not adjourn the House for the purpose of allowing copies of the message to be printed and circulated-fchi s House will be involved in having delayed Supply beyond the period which it ouglit to be delayed, in which case the obligations of the Government, extending to the furthest parts of the continent, can only be met by warrants issued without authority.",19

That is all the Constitution authorizes. Senate, therefore, may suggest this proposiobjection, tion or that proposition, or this alteration or that alteration. But the Constitution does not authorize the Senate to go further, and request the concurrence of this Chamber in their suggestions, because, if it did, the distinction between suggestion and amendwish ment would be absolutely obliterated. would ask this Chamber whether, in this early stage of its history, it is going practically agree to an abrogation of that distinction. We are quite aware that there have been those who have contended that there is no distinction between "" suggestion"" and ""amendment,"" but I have always conits tended that there is an immense difwise. ference.

Probably the attention of the Prime Minister was not directed to the paragraph containing the words mentioned, and probably, without deep consideration, he has expressed the view that there is no objection. Bufc I think we ought, before considering the suggestions, to decide whether we are going to tolerate this form of message, because, if we are, farewell to the distinction between ""suggestion""and ""amendment.""

At the same time, I do not to assume any unnecessarily aggressive I attitude. I agree with the Prime Minister that the constitutional points involved in to this Bill, which were raised in the Senate yesterday, were discussed in a very calm, business-like, and conciliatory manner, and the same thing should obtain here.

The House complied, and ratified the principle of the preamble. Now we are asked to accept the view that preambles are unnecessary and have passed out of date. This seems to me scarcely a consistent for the Government and I hope we shall adhere to the form of preamble to be now agreed to. a As I said when this question was raised before, I am not wedded to any particular form preamble as long as the principle of initiation is placed upon the face of the Bill. an organic differencebetween Bills appropriattbe ing revenue and any other form of Bills.' regards other Bills, the powers of the two Houses are equal - but in the origination Appropriating Bills those powers are not equal. This House has the supreme power of origination, but messages from the Crown recommending appropriations must sented to this House alone; that is, must be presented to the originating House. that in these two features this House is essentially different from the Senate: in its exclusive right to receive messages recommending supplies, and in its exclusive righfc to originate appropriations. I contend that Bills so recommended, based upon a Royal message, ought to bear upon their such Bills. forefront the source of their origination, and the fact that we had agreed to the message to the Crown. I am not wedded to any form of words as long as words are put in that show, first, the origination appropriations, and, secondly, that they are the word "" grant"" is kept in. based upon messages from the Crown. An y words that are capable of conveying two principles I am willing to acquiesce and I think we oughtfcoexpect so much.",20
32,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member would agree to the word "" originate "" ?",20
33,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"Certainl y ; I agree to any form of words that shows upon the face of the Bill the fact of its origination. Bufc, afc the same time, I think it should go further and say that the Bill is based upon a recommendation from the Crown. TheCrown recommends by message. What then takes place isfchafcthe message is referred to a comn mittee of this House. It may be dealt with by the House as a whole, but as a matter of constitutional practice the message is always considered in Committee of Supply. In Committee of Supply a resolution is arrived at that supplies be granted to the Crown Thafc resolution is reported to the House. The House agrees to the resolution, and a Bil l is brought in based upon it . I bold that these Bills should bear upon fcbe face of them something to show that they are based upon a message from, the Crown, and attitude originate in the House of Representatives to take up, in accordance with the recommendation of the Crown. Honourable members may . ask what is the utility of this procedure ? The reason for it-and it k a very special of reason-is that questions may hereafter arise as to the constitutionality of these There is Supply Bills. They may come before High Court. The High Court will As judge of a Bill from what appears on the face of it , and if it appears that the Bill in of question was intended to make an appropriation within the Constitutional requirements, the High^ Court will know that it is dealing with a class of Bill different from be prethe ordinary form of legislation.",20
34,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,Then we should So have to put that in every Bill that is originated by a message from the Crown. A large number of Bills that are not Supply Bills are introduced by message.,20
35,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,What are they?,20

38,Sir GEORGE TURNER,Unknown,"If c is proposed to leave in the word ""grant."" We propose to make it read "" grant originated in .""",20
39,Sir JOHN QUICK,Unknown,"I quite agree with that, and am glad to hear that such is the.proposal of the Government. Bufc going back to the message from the Senate, I think that, before we proceed to consider the suggestions, a message should be returned to the Senate, and it should be pointed out to that Chamber that in asking the concurrence of this House they are exceeding their constitutional powers and rights.",20
40,Mr ISAACS,Unknown," I am quite sure that in this matter every one will agree that - we have no party question to deal with. We are all agreed alsothat it should be debated in the most solemn, careful, and, if I may use the expression, cold-blooded fashion. Further, I am thoroughly assured that the Government feel that they are doing what is right towards maintaining the Constitution and conserving the rights ancl privileges of this House, and are acfcu. ated by no desire except, while stoutly maintaining the real substantial rights and privileges of the House of Representatives, to. discard any rigid adherence to forms which they think may cause conflict. I go with the Government thoroughly in all that; but, notwithstanding, I cannot agree that, the course they propose to the House is the right one. We are now upon the threshold of a proceeding which may, by constant and'confcinuous encroachments, involve the whole future of responsible government. Much mischief may follow from a simple misunderstanding of the nature of these proceedings. At the outset I thoroughly endorse what has been said by my honourable and learned friend the member for Bendigo with regard to the form of the message from the Senate. We ought to refuse to sanction that particular form of message; because although it uses the word ""suggests""- a word notused in the Constitution-it asks the concurrence of this House in something which has been done by the Senate. This House is asked to ""concur""-that is the word used, I ^believe-wit h regard to the amendments suggested; and if a word not used in the Constitution-""suggests""-is used here, ar.d we are asked to concur in the suggestion, I see no practical difference between the Senate amending and asking our concurrence in their amendments, and their suggesting and asking our concurrence in their suggestions. The Constitution says that if the Senate wishes an amendment to be made, it is to request this House to make it, and then it proceeds to state that this House may, if it thinks fit, do what is requested. To my mind the word ""request"" in that collocation is of infimtely weaker import than the word ""suggest"" as used in this message. The - word ""request"" is, as it purports to be, a request to this House to do something if it thinks, fit. There is nothing to concur in, and we are left absolutely fco our own discretion to say whether anything shall be done or not. I therefore say thatfcheform of the message is not one that ought to be entertained. In the next place, on the merits, I'think a distinction has been lost sight of. When we speak of the Constitution, it should be recollected that our Constitution is not completely contained within the pages of a written document. We have behind those written pages a history. We have behind those words, which appear in cold type, a long period of constitutional usage. When we were building up our Constitution, we did it knowingfchafcwe were basing that fabric upon the bed-rock of what I may call the common law of the Constitution. When we formed our two Houses, we distinctly intended that, as far as possible, one House should have the predominant financial power. We had precedents to go upon which should not be disregarded. We know what is meant by the word ""grant."" In.Great Britain, no lessthan in Australia, a legal grant in one sense is not made, and cannot be made, except by the two Houses of Parliament. But there is another sense in which the word ""grant"" is used; and that is that it is done by a vote of the House of .Commons on the recommendation of the Committee of Supply and - with the sanction of the Crown. It is in that sense that the word "" grant"" is used in some portions of this Bill. I will take for. example, to illustrate what I mean, the last Appropriation Act passed by the Imperial Parliament.. There a "" grant"" is not made in the sense in which the Senate wishes us to limit the word, except by the concurrence of the House of Lords with the House of Commons. In the English Appropriation A ct I find the word "" grant"" used in two senses. In one sense it means a grant made byfcheHouse of Commons by itself by resolution, and in the other sense it is used in the signification of an Act of Parliament. We have in the first clause of the Bill before us the words "" supply granted,"" which can only mean the amount of supply granted by this House.. The insertion of the word "" hereby "" before the word "" granted"" would in my opinion distinctly alter the complete sense of what was done. Let me draw honourable members' attention to this provision. It says"" There shall unci may be issued and supplied for or towards making good the supply granted His Majesty."" How was that supply granted? It was granted by this House upon motion in Committee of Supply: By the insertion the word "" hereby "" the meaning is altered entirely. This Bill is a Bill forfchepurpose of appropriating money to make good supply previously granted by the House of Representatives. Let me read the terms the English Act of Parliament to which have already alluded. The following are the words of the preamble :Most Gracious Sovereign. We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, in Parliament assembled, towards making the supply which we have cheerfully granted your Majesty in this session of Parliament, resolved to grant unto Your Majesty the sum hereinafter mentioned; and do therefore most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may enacted. The word "" g r a n t"" there has distinct reference to the vote of the House of Commons; and that is the constitutional sense in which the word- "" grant "" is used. That also is the sense in which it ought be used in the preamble of this Bill. Thereand fore when we talk of the grant originating in this House we must mean that the grant originates and ends in this House in the sense in which that word is used in the lish Act. When we come to the enacting words of the English Act f urther on, we find that the word grant is used in a totally different sense. In fact, it is used in two senses in one section, which I will quote. Section 3 refers toAll sums granted by this Act and the other Acts mentioned in schedule A annexed to this Act of the said consolidated fund making good supply granted to Her Majesty. The word granted means in the second use thesupply granted by the Houseof Commons. Por these reasons I am absolutely opposed to altering the words "" made by "" to the words ""originated in . "" This preamble for the purpose of appropriating the grant made by the House of Representatives; and I will not be one to allow the idea to weakened in the least degree that the term ""grant""-the grant of supply-is solely fined to that sense. We ought to take care .that we do not abandon the position would which constitutional history has handed down to us from our English prototype, the House of Commons. W it h regard to the title and the words, "" An act to grant and to apply,"" I care very little. I think it would be stronger for this House to refuse to countenance even that alteration. But I care very little about it because when of the words ""and grant"" are added there, it means giving legal form to the grant made by this House in the first instance. a But with regard to the preamble and the words of the first clause I distinctly and of clearly offer my opposition to the suggesI tion made by the Prime Minister. For these reasons I think that at the very outset we ought to take our stand upon the position that this House represents in a special and perfect degree the taxpayers of Australia. We ought to be very caregood ful lest by withdrawing what are called to forms, but which are really more than have forms-whic h have been spoken of as danger signals, but which I think should be be regarded as standards marking out our territory-w3 surrender the rights of this House. We cannot be too careful lest argument be piled on argument and surrender called for after surrender. When we find that a Supply Bill was first brought down to to this House containing a certain preamble that it was demanded that we should alter it, and we did alter it j and that when we sent it up again it was demanded fchafc we should again alter it, it is time we Engtook a stand. Whilst desiring to recognise to the full degree the rights of the other Chamber, and with, a full belief that the Prime Minister is actuated by the very best and the highest of motives, in endeavouring to get the business of the country done with the least possible friction, I feel called upon to say that the strongest opposition out should be offered to all the amendments the which the righfc honourable and learned gentleman has proposed.",21
41,Mr CONROY,Unknown," I very much regret that the Ministry, by their action in having neglected to exercise a little thought and care, have placed this House in the posiis tion of having to back downfcothe Senate. We must of course back down, because the Senate is undoubtedly in the right. Ministers be are very blameworthy for not having carefully considered these matters. If they had condevoted a little attention-eve n h'alf-anhour-to the first Supply Bill, that measure not have been returned by the Senate. This House on that occasion was so clearly wrong that the Ministers tossed the Bill under the table and brought in a fresh one.",22
42,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,Why did the honourable - member pass it ?,23
43,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I pointed out that we - were rushing matters through in such a violent hurry that this Ministry would be known as the slipshod Ministry. very strong proof of the accuracy of my predictions in the way matters are now being conducted. In the second Supply Bill the Ministry inserted the words "" for the purpose of appropriating the grant made by the House of Representatives.""",23
44,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Was . not that made in response to a suggestion from the opposition side?,23
45,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Certainly not. Honourable members are well aware that quite halfa-dozen of us were cognisant of the fact when the second Supply Bill went up to the other House that the Senate would send it back, as has now been done. We are not getting parliamentary legislation here, because things are rushed in such a way that honourable members have not fcime to consider them. This House will have to go back upon this matter, because the Senate is in the right upon it. The Ministry have put members in fcbe wrong, but, because of that, this House is not going to put itself in the wrong. In two matters the Ministry have recognised that the Senate is right. I ask, did they not save us from this humiliation of having to back down 1",23
46,Mr OMALLEY,Unknown,The honourable member looks upon the Senate as infallible.,23
47,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"I look upon the Minist r y as wrong, and if we adopt the first part of this preamble, the Senate, acting within their rights, will send the Bill back to us again. Section 53 of the Constitution clearly states that these Bills shall originate in the House of Representatives. If any constitutional point is going to arise in connection with it, 1 would refer honourable members to section 76, which says that any matter arising under this Constitution, or involving its interpretation, shall come under the notice of the High Court. Of course, the form of the preamble would not come under the notice of the High Court, bufc the legality of acts done by one House or the other might and should come under its jurisdiction. Honourable members are too much under the old idea that the Lower House is 'all paramount. But we have departed from that very sound principle- a principle which was built up by ages of struggle-and we have granted to the Senate certain rights under this Constitution. Since the Constitution confers those rights we cannot deprive the Senate of them. No amount of assertion on our part can take them away. I have I find no desire to help the Ministry, but when I see the disabilities which may ensue if this Bill is not passed, I musfc say that I think that the Government should accept the suggestions offcheSenate. By so doing they will be acting strictly within constitutional limits, and even if they do not do so",23
48,Mr OMALLEY,Unknown,The honourable member will put them out.,23
49,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"If honourable members on the opposite side of the House are still disposed to support the Ministry-althoug h the latter had to submit the Acts Interpretation Bill twice and the Public Service Bill with six pages of new clauses-it is not our fault. I wish to state that the members of the opposition side of the House would not have fallen into these mistakes. We should never have precipitated a collision with the other Chamber, and if we had sent; anything up there we should have stood to our guns. I would point out to the Ministry once moi^-a sfcheyare very anxious, to gefc this Why, Supply Bill through-that the words in the preamble are utterly unnecessary. If we take them away it cannot be said that this House gives away one iota of its rights. I think that is the proper course to adopt, and, in so doing, we shall not be sacrificing one principle.",23
50,Mr BARTON,Unknown," I wish, if possible, to put this matter so clearly that we may be enabled to send this Bill back to the Senate while that House is waiting for it, in order that our public obligations may be legally mintained.",23
51,Mr CONROY,Unknown,"Wit h the permission of the righfc honourable and learned gentleman may I point out that there is one thing of far more importance than any alteration in the preamble. The Senate bas agreed to every item that we have sent up fco it without any suggestions, and if this House is wise, it will accept every suggestion now made by the Senate, because the principle has been established that the items in a Bill of this kind shall pass unchallenged.",23
52,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"In tiding to make this . matter a little clear, I can quite understand that there are those who, having opposed this Constitution from start to finish on the ground that it gave too much power to the Senate, are now seeking to elevate the Senate into the superior House. The . whole air rang during the referendum contest with the complaints of gentlemen such as some whom I see in the Senate, who are trying now to arrogate to the Senate superior power, although the Senate has not been with them, and who all through the contest were endeavouring to make out that this Constitution could not be assented to, because it gave undue powers to the Senate and made it the supreme House. I wish to put the matter on a purely constitutional basis, and I think I am doing so. I want to bring it back to the honourable and learned members for Indi and Bendigo that the suggestion that - this matter depends on the relations between the Commons and the Lords might be right if we were a Legislative Council fighting with a Legislative Assembly, but has absolutely no reference to ' the Constitution which has been passed. I wish to maintain the relative positions of the two Houses-to maintain the rights of the Senate, but to make no undue concession to that Chamber. Of course, there must be a certain amount of mutual ""courtesy in the carrying on of the relations of the two Houses, otherwise these Houses could neverbe the working engines of the Constitution. But apart from that, there must be a reasonable and strict adherence to our rights, and I ' propose to consider those rights as laid down in the Constitution. Whoever heard of the suggestion before that there is anything in our Constitution which places the Senate in the , position of the House of Lords? The powers of the Houses in respect of legislation are clearly defined in sections 53 and 54. Section 53 says :Except as provided in this section, the Senate shull have equal power with the House'of Representatives inrespectof all proposed laws. Sub-section (2) states that fcbe Senate may not amend "" proposed laws"" imposing taxation or appropriating revenue. This is a proposed law appropriating revenue. If weinsisfc on our Constitution, do my honourable and learned friends wish fco make those words nugatory? If they do not make them nugatory, does it not become apparent that if they wish them to be liberally and [94] broadly construed they musfc liberally and broadly construe every other line of it: The honourable member for Indi has quoted the practice between the Commons and the Lords, which, with all due respect, I submit is not applicable for the purposes of this discussion. I am sure that, coming as we do from a profession in whioh warmth of argument is permitted, my honourable and learned friend will understand that when we argue warmly we respect each other none the less. There is no foundation for the analogy, unless that analogy is set up by sections 53 and 54, because otherwise the words I have quoted would - have been put in as a delusion, to cause the people of the smaller States to vote for a Constitution, in which it was assumed that certain rights which were given were not to be exercised in fact. Our true position is to concede tofcheSenate its legal rights, and to insist upon having our own legal rights; These proposals of mine are simply upon those lines. Ifc is quite clear from this Constitution that a proposed law, which appropriates revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government shall not originate in the Senate. But an3'tliing to be an appropriation must have the assent of both Houses. Although a proposed law appropriating revenue must originate in the House of Representatives, that does not detract from the constitutional result; that there cannofc be an appropriation without the consent of both Houses. Now it is asked that words should be inserted indicating fchafc which is the form prescribed by the Constitution. It might have been as well if the Senate had passed this matter over, because the Constitution regulates our rights. Bufc if i u one of these amendments we assert our right to originate, as I propose to do, it is done by way of showing that if the Senate assert their right to be participants in the grant, we can only admit that right i ffcheyadmit our reciprocal rightfcooriginate the grant.",24
53,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,Will the right honourable gentleman tell us how the Senate'can dispute our righfc when it is set down in the Constitu tion ?,24
54,Mr BABTON,Unknown,"The Senate cannot dispute our right to originate the grant, and in the same way we cannofc dispute their right to participate in the grant. The position is that we will concede to the Senate their undoubted constitutional position, if the Senate will concede our undoubted constitutional position ; and if they make an oner to accept what we propose in return, the true position between us has been reached, and no precedent has been set to injure the prestige or power of either. I do not propose to follow the suggestions of the honourable ancl learned, member who last addressed the committee. No doubt we are a slipshod Ministry, as the next and every Ministry will be; but the Ministry does not always go about with its football boots on. Still, though we are a slipshod Ministry, I ask honourable members how far they credit the statement made by the honourable member that he would not be a party to such a mistake. The honourable member said ""We would not have fallen into thismistake."" Honourable have had experience of that honourable member, and are able to say what mistakes he would fall into, and what mistakes he could avoid ; and I shall now leave the honourable member alone, merely suggesting that after all it is not those who have the least experience amongst us, who should suggest any undue concession to the Senate. To those who consider the matter fairly, it is clear that if we demand any denned rights for ourselves, we must be prepared to concede the denned rights claimed by other people. The Senate are undoubtedly entitled to participate in the grant by helping to give it the form of law. They are entitled to make good to the extent that they the form of law by their assent.' They are not entitled to go any further, and if we make that plain by showing that the grant originated in the only place it could possibly have originated, we have not given way one tittle in regard to our reciprocal rights under sections 53 ancl 54. That is what the message, which I shall presently read in its fuller form, proposes to do. It may be true that the message that has come down has been framed more with relation to a state of things in one of the States where this power of suggestion has been created by standing orders, than with relation to the exact words of the Federal Constitution. But I do not propose to ask honourable members to haggle about form, when they have matters of substance to consider. I see no difference in principle or in effect between requesting House to make an amendment making a suggestion in which this House is requested to concur. Because, if Mr Barton. concurrence be asked for, we are requested to make an amendment, and the difference is merely that between tweedledum and tweedledee. There, again, is the danger of our being, led astray by the mere fact if some form of procedure, or. an assimilation to some form of words which has been used on the occasion of certain quarrels, is used in connection with a message under a Coil:stitution which substantially preserves the rights of the House which makes the suggestion, without encroaching on the rights of the other House. I do not think it is business-like or constitutional, in the higher sense, for us to string out a debate on a subject of the kind, because we all know that the Senate does not mean to make members any encroachment on our rights, and that we do not intend to encroach on the Senate's rights. If we set forth this form of words which makes the matter abundantly clear, I surely think we shall have done our duty to the Senate. The Senate is not a House of Lords; it is a popular House, as we are. The Senate represents the States, no doubt, as politicial entities, but the electors are exactly the same as the men and women who returned the representatives to this House-ther e is a differenee in the distribution, but not in the personnel of the voters. 1 do not say that that means that the Senate is to derive undue financial rights, because we know there must* be unsupply, doubted financial supremacy in one House, give it under any Constitution providing for responsible government. But short of that limitation, the fact of the Senate being elected by the people gives them a right which we should be foolish not to recognise, while, at the same time, we must make no surrender of the right of originating ana finally determining supply, without which right no Constitution could , proceed under any form where there is responsible government. The message came down to iis only at two o'clock, when we met, so that I have not had much time to consider it. I propose to deal with this matter as if the ordinary form of the Constitution as laid down in sections 53 and 54 had been followed word for word. T intend to follow that form, so far as the committee will allow me, in regard to the amendments which the Senate requests, by saying that we this agree to two of the requested amendments and and makefchemi nfcheBill, and that as to the third requested amendment, we have made it with a modification which will appear infcheschedule. Throughout I intend to treat the message as one requesting menb, and that will be a guide for the future.",24
55,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"Does the Prime Minister use the word ""amendment"" or ""suggestion "".?",26
56,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"I use the words ""reafctack quests for amendments."" I emphasize the fact that I wish to use a form of message which will leave no doubt that we are dealing with the matter on absolutely conI stitutional grounds, and following the forms of the Constitution. I do not think we ought to say we will not accept the form message sent when we know it meaus same thing as the Constitution indicates and requires. I do not think we have righfc to interfere unduly with the internal procedure of the ofcher House, any more the Senate has to interfere with the internal procedure of this House. We might have suggested that they modify the terms of their message by using the word ""originate,"" but I think the Senate recognise that have no right to interfere with our internal procedure, and I do not think we have any fco sit righfc to dictate to them asfcothe form their message when we know what the sage is, and what in substance it means. The message I propose reads : returns to the Senate the Bill entitled "" An Act to apply out of the Consolidated Revenue the sum of four hundred and ninety one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two pounds to the vice of the period ending the thirtieth day June, one thousand nine hundred and one,"" and acquaints the Senate thatfcheHouse of Reprelar sentatives has considered the message of the Senate requesting this Honse to make certain amendments in such Bill, and has made the requested amendments numbered 1 and 3, and in the case of requested amendment numbered litis mude such amendment with the modifications appearing by the schedule. That puts it in plain terms that, though requests,fcherequests are theirs; the amendHouse ments are ours, ancl ours alone.",26
57,Mr MCCAY,Unknown," I am not going to detain the House for any length time onfchisquestion ; but feeling, as I that matters of great importance are volved, ['deem it my duty to express my opinion briefly; ancl, if opportunity is given, fco vote in accordance with those opinions. The Prime Minister, by the form of message he proposes to send back- I will not discuss the form now, because I have heard it only once-and by the remark he has made as to the absence of evil intention on the of the Senate, practically admits, as everyamendbody else must, that the message fco the Senate was wrong in form. If the Prime Minister be right now, he was wrong before. It is all very well to say the Senate means nothing, and I grant they do not intend to our rights or to attack our Constitution in any way ; bufc the fact remains that if messages keep going and coming in a certain form they have their constitutional effect. t does not matter whether bhere is a written Constitution or not, there are these constitutional effects of a very fa:--reaching of character. I venturefcosay that the present the relations between the Commons and the Lords in Great Britain has been largely any determined by the form of messages from timefcotime adopted byfcheHouse of Comthan mons. It is perfectly true we have a written Constitution here, and that section 53 defines the relative powers of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. Bufc if the Prime Minister himself, or any other they eminent lawyer in the House, or if all the eminent lawyers in the House were' clown together to determine of what the section exactly means, I defy meshim or them to come to a conclusion. In the section there are elements of elasticityfcoan extent which we cannot at present foresee. What does, ""originate"" mean or include ? Does it merely include the reFund ceipt of the message from the Governor General 1 Thafc could be argued, bufc I sershould say the word includes a great deal of more. The message we got in this particucase was to the effect that the Governor General transmitted to the House of Representatives Estimates of Expenditure for the period ending 30fch June, 1901, and recom2 mended an appropriation from the consolidated revenue accordingly. The House of Representatives received that message, and the Speaker having left the chair, the went into Committee to consider the message. The Committee resolved to grant .the money, and reported that resolution to of the House, and then a Supply Bill was do, brought into carry the resolution of the inCommittee into effect. In my humble judgment, the origination includes not only the receipt of the message, but also the resolution of the Committee to grant the money, and the reporting of that resolution to the House, which causes the bringing read in of the Bill under which the money is actually granted in the legal sense of part the word. That is at any rate a tenable view, in spite of the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, who says that the Senate are undoubtedly right and that we are undoubtedly wrong. So far as I am concerned I have not yet had sufficient experience in law to say that anything is undoubtedly right or undoubtedly wrong. In this particular case the origination in the proper sense of the term used in section 53 does not cease until the House has determined that the money shall be granted. The honourable and learned member for Indi is perfectly right in referring to the history of the hundreds of years behind us. Ifc is absolutely certain that all the members of the Federal Convention bad more or less in their minds the history of the mother of Parliaments, which sits in London, and also had in their minds the historical facts relating to that principle which - we are endeavouring more or less adequately to apply to the state of affairs existing between the two Commonwealth Houses. If we remember what the course of procedure is, and whatfchefacts arc, it appears to me that section 53 is an attempt in certain matters, though not in all, to put into words what has been the practice between the two Imperial Houses. In the ""Annotated Commonivecdtfi Constitution,"" by Quick and Garran, in a note with regard to the word "" originate,"" it is stated that fcli is is an attempt to put into words the practice that has prevailed. I believe that is so, and if it be so we musfc interpret the words in the light of history. If you simply look at the word "" originate "" in its dictionary meaning, you will not be carried very much further, because the dictionary says to originate is to begin, and the.question with us is, if I may use the expression, where the beginning ends. Further we must satisfy ourselves asfcowhen the first stage called the beginning is complete, and I say fchafc it is clearly not complete until the committee has resolved that the money be granted ; and equally if it is not complete t the word ""grant"" used here means granted in the Committee of Supply of this House, and a Bill is afterwards brought in which supplies the money out of the consolidated revenue.",26
58,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,In the ofcher sense the House of Commons has no right to grant.,27
59,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"No ; not in the sense of making the money legally available. In effectfcheysay, we agree to let fchis money be legally available, and this House of Representatives does exactly the same thing; and the King and the Senate resolve that the money shall be made available in accordance with the express determination of the House of Representatives. If that view be correct, the two alterations suggested by the Senate and prepared to be agreed to by the Prime Minister are direct and important infringements of that right which the Constitution grants to us byfcheuse of the word ""originate.""",27
60,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,The amendment is perfectly consistent with the wording of the Constitution.,27
61,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I do not think it is. The words ""grant made"" are not used in the sense of legally granted, but are used in the sense of a grant that the House of Representatives has determined shall be made. Ifc may be stated that the word "" originate "" includes the word "" made"" ; but if we use the word "" originated,"" it cannot be used to mean more than ""made,"" because it is certain that the other House will never agreefcothe ideafchatthe word "" originated "" is larger than "" made"" bufc ratherfchafcifc is less than "" made. "" We musfc look not fco the meaning that we ourselves attach to the words, but to the meaning which other people will ascribefcothem.",27
62,Mr ISAACS,Unknown,"They will say that it is not "" made "" in any sense until they agree to it.",27
63,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,"I say that it is ""made "" in the sense in which the word "" originated "" is used i u this Bill, and although the rules *of the House of Commons in this matter are no guide to us, the language of British Acts of Parliament has been a guide to us i nfcheconstruction of the laws of the Commonwealth. If you look at the words "" supply granted to His Majesty,"" it seems to me that that means supply granted on the Governor General's message '- in the House of Representatives. It is not supply legally granted. ill then, The first clause provides fchatThere shall ancl may be issued and applied for or towards making good the supply granted. Now, if ""supply granted"" means legally granted, what is the use of making an Act to legally grant that which has already been granted ? This would be an Act to grant what has been legally granted, and therefore the words musfc have a different meaningf rom that which might ordinarily be-attached to fchem. Furthermore, the grant made by the passing of the Act must be a fuller thing than is meant by the words ""-supply granted."" Therefore, the word ""granted"" in clause 1 must mean less than a grant legally made. Consequently the words "" hereby granted "" are wrong. "" Hereby granted"" would mean that this was an A to grant to the Crown a thing which had already been granted. I think 1I have made clear the reasons which have induced me take my present attitude. 1I have not been actuated by any hostility, bub by a feeling that, although section 53 of the Constitution is in black and white, the section may be construed as meaning half-a-dozen things, and may require a great deal of discussion. This A ct can not"" be discussed in the courts as other Acts may' be, unless with the consent of Parliament, because it pressly excluded by the wording of the A from reference to the courts. Therefore the only judges are the House of Represenmatter. tatives and the Senate, and the House Representatives should be slow, if there is any doubt that we are right and the Senate is wrong, to accept views which are do inconsistent with its alleged or claimed supremacy in relation to Money Bills. Some honourable members, from their experiour ence in State Legislatures, are perhaps little embittered in their feedings towards other House, but during my short experience in the State Assembly, I had no such*feeling towards the Upper Chamber. I feel, over, fchafc resting as we must upon this Constitution, we have to consider first the Constitution is to be interpreted, in light of what precedents it has to be interon preted, and what the words as used actually mean. I have no objection to the first gestion of the Senate. So far as the second suggestion is concerned, although ""origifche nated in "" probably includes "" made by cannot expect the Senate to accept my view. I propose that we should leave the preamble as . it is, and cannot agree to the Government's proextra posal. Regarding the third proposition, cannot consent bo the insertion of the ""hereby"" because that is changing the meaning of ""granted"" from its proper confect stitutional meaning to something quite ferent, which results in the A ct saying it is going to do what has already been clone. Ifc seems to me that the mespeople sage from the Senate itself is an enterests croachment. People say that these are only matters of words, but words become very potent forces, ancl have 'meanings attached which we never expected them to possess in the beginning. Words are the expressions of thoughts and facts, ancl these words ultimately become the most potent of instruments. They are the ct beginning of what we cannot see the end of. I must confess to some feeling of surprise that the Prime Minister, in his proper to anxiety,fcoavoid a dispute and to gefc his Supply Bill through, should have been so quick to practically agree to what the Senate asks. If I am wrong as to the importance of fchis matter, and the Senate is constitutionally"" righfc, I should cheerfully agree to the course proposed, but it seems law to me that there is so much more involved than a mere question of expediency, that if is exwe are right we are bound to maintain our c t rights afc all costs and all hazards. I do not believe there will be a crisis over this We should show, just as clearly of as the Senate has shown, that we are going to stand up for the real letter of our rights. The Senate has shown its determination to this several times, and we have taken no offence. We have recognised the propriety of their conduct, ancl they will recognise propriety in endeavouring to fully maina tain our position and rights. If it were the intended under the Constitution to give the Senate more powers than are possessed by the House of Lords, it was hownot intended to diminish the powers of the House of Representatives. If the small how States came into the Federation on the the faifch of the powers given to the Senate, the other hand the large States came in xm the faith of the powers given to the sugHouse of Representativesand it would be just as much a breach of faith to yield to Senate more than it is entitled to, "" I as it would be for the Senate to yield to the House of Representatives more, than we are entitled to. We are elected by I the people and so is the Senate; but the powers fchafc were granted to the I Senate were a concession from the point of word view of popular and democratic government, which we represent on the more perbasis, and which we should maintain difin its entirety. We represent the people that according to population, and to that extent we differ from the Senate; and as the pay the taxes, and expect their into be directly represented by us, we should be very chary of yielding auy rights that we consider we are entitled to. This is not a case in which we wish to create a new departure which would enlarge our rights, but a case in which we are called upon to oppose a course which would .have the effect of diminishing them.",27
64,Mr GB EDWARDS,Unknown,"South Sydney) I think the committee may possibly listen for a moment or two to a layman on the subject. Undoubtedly this Bill originated in the House of Representatives, but there was a condition precedent to its origination in this House, namely, that we pass first of all a grant in Committee of Supply. Consequently I think the form of words used in the Bill as it left this House, "" Por appropriating the grant made by the House of Representatives"" is perfectly legal and correct, and I cannot see any reason for altering it. But the whole matter appears to me to be one of ""words, words, words."" There is no question whatever of the undoubted rights of this House being called in question. The rights of the House are not affected; nothing which can be inserted in this preamble will in any way affect the prerogatives and rights of this House to originate taxation Bills. It is for this reason that I suggest that the best way out of the difficulty will be to return Bill as it left this House, with the exception of the preamble, which we might well strike out altogether. We have it on the authority of the Prime Minister that the whole tendency of modern draftsmanship is to disregard the preamble. The difficulty has arisen by inventing a preamble in which in some absurd way we assert our privileges. I maintain that our rights are embodied in the Constitution, and we may very well rely upon that. The easiest way out of the difficulty will be to return the Bill with a message striking out the preamble, ancl agreeing to the other two suggestions of the Senate. A most important matter has been referred to by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, ancl that is in regard to the way this message is framed. The Constitution Act says in section 53 that""The Senate may at any stage return to the altogether. House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting by message the omission or amendmenb of any items or provisions therein."" Not "" suggesting"" amendments, as blie Senate seems to take it thab the Constitution Act says, but "" requesting "" amendments or omissions. The message is not at all consistent with that provision of the . Consbibution Acb. As the honourable and learned member for Bendigo suggested, this opens up the question of whether we are nob in this respect giving away more than we are called upon to. surrender. But I invite the attention of the honourable and learned member to secbion 57, which deals wibh the difficulties whioh may arise between the two Houses, and refers to amendments "" which have been made, suggested or agreed to."" There the term ""suggested"" is used. I do not know what that means, unless ib refers to the provision which I have read about "" requesting amendments."" Therefore it seems that the Constitution itself, in regard to these two sections, is somewhat inconsistent. Further, in the concluding words of section 57 the same phraseology is adopted. It says that afber the dissolution of two Houses, if the House of Representatives a,gain passes the proposed lawWith or without any amendments which had been made, suggested, or agreed to by the Senate. Thereby showing that ib is taken for granted that the Senate may suggest amendments. Furthermore, suppose as the Prime Minisber has baken for granbed, that the Senate only sent down a message ask the ing this House to make certain amendments, how could we deal wibh that message if we declined to consider suggestions from the Senate? If the Bill goes back to the Senate in the shape in which it was sent up, it has only the same effecb as if we declined bo accept the suggestion. Here again, however, I think we are only debating about "" words, words, words."" I repeat that from a layman's point of view it appears that the easiest way oub of the difficulty would be to strike oub the preamble altogether. The Prime Minister has said that the rights of this House are defined by the Constitution, and no form of words used in a Bill can abrogabe them. Therefore this endeavour to frame a preamble by which we may assert our rights is a mistake, and the best way out of the difficulty, as i have already said, would be to strike oub the preamble Question-That the committee concur in the requested amendment of the Senate to insert the word ""hereby""-put .

PAIK",29
65,Mr HIGGINS,Unknown,"Northern Melbourne). we have made some alterations in this Bill, for the second or third time, may I ask if the Ministry have ascertained that in its present form the measure will be acceptable in another place? Last week I suggested that there should be a friendly talk between those responsible for upholding the dignity of this House, and those responsible for maintaining the dignity of the 31 other Chamber, and I think, if my advice 15 had been acted upon, the difficulty would have been much more readily solved than by 16 all the talk which has taken place between the two Houses. Have the Ministry any AY KS. ground for believing that the Bill, as now put forward, will be accepted in another place 1",30
66,Mr BABTON,Unknown," I think the committee will see that it is not advisable that there should be negotiations between the two Houses except by the methods provided by the Constitutio n or standing orders. Of course, it is inevitable that there should be colloquial discussion as there is in all'cases. I have had no more means t h a n have been Tellers. open to other honourable members of knowing how this Bill will be regarded in another place: but if I may judge by the tone and temper of the discussion in the Senate yesterday, I have not the slightest doubt that this solution will be acceptable to both Houses.

A very clear statement was made in the newspaper mentioned, by one who said he was an eye-witness of certain occurrences these islands, and the question appears to me to be a very important one, in relation to the recruiting that is going on for sugar plantations.",31
70,Mr BARTON,Unknown,"Hunter-Minister f External Affairs),- I have seen the article referred to, which appears to relate to ah outrage committed by persons, not British, on an island the territory of a foreign power.

Under the regulations which govern recruiting for the Queensland plantations, only British subjects may be employed on the vessels, and an agent of the Government is on board each vessel.",31

76,Mr BARTON,Unknown," It is unfortunate that the motion, has been interfered with, as it has been, by the intervention of public business on Friday, 1I have already explained, in answer to a question by the honourable member for Wentworth, that I shall be prepared Comto move to extend the time available on Fridays by beginning earlier ; bufc there is no sign ot congestion in Friday's business, and the two interruptions that have occurred have been accidental. The greater part of yesterday's sitting was occupied with a private member's motion which the Government consented to have heard out of the time otherwise available for public business. When I find that Government business may be likely to terminate at an earlier '.hour than usual upon any night, if the honourable member for Northern Melbourne will come and see me I will try and make the best arrangement I can.",31

I have several other motions which are important, to my constituents at least. I pledged myself on - the platform to submit those motions, and get the House to decide whether they should bo carried or not.
