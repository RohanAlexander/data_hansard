Skills Australia Amendment (Australian Workforce and Productivity Agency) Bill 2012 Returned from Senate Message received from the Senate returning the bill without amendment or request. Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Clare. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
2,Mr CLARE,Unknown,"Blaxland-Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (09:02): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Measures No. 1) Bill 2012 contains several amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995 (the Customs Tariff). This bill does three things. The first thing it does is provide for the listing of Serbia as a developing country for the purposes of the Australian System of Tariff Preferences, with effect from 1 March 2012. This is covered in items 1 and 2 of the schedule to the bill. This listing accords Serbia a reduction in customs duty on a defined range of goods imported into Australia. This action is consistent with Australia's approach to other states which were formerly part of Yugoslavia. Secondly, item 7 of the schedule to the bill reinserts subheading 5308.10.00, applicable to coir yarn, in the customs tariff. BILLS This subheading was incorrectly omitted from the customs tariff in the Customs Tariff Amendment (2012 Harmonized System Changes) Act 2011. Coir yarn is typically used in the manufacture of mats and ropes. These first two parts of the bill were previously given effect through the tabling of Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2012 in the House of Representatives on 16 February 2012. The remaining amendments in the bill correct a number of technical errors that have occurred in the customs tariff. These corrections maintain the quality of the text of the customs tariff and ensure that Australia's customs tariff is correctly aligned with the International Convention on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System that forms the basis of the customs tariff. These corrections do not affect the classification of goods or customs duty payable. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. Statute Stocktake (Appropriations) Bill (No. 1) 2012 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Gray. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
3,Mr GRAY,Unknown,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (09:05): I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Statute Stocktake (Appropriations) Bill (No. 1) 2012 is the fifth statute stocktake bill since 1998, and forms part of an ongoing process to clean up the statute book by repealing legislation that is redundant. The bill also furthers the government's deregulation agenda. The government has stepped up its deregulation reform program, including the progress made at the Business Advisory Forum in May 2012 and the Prime Minister's economic forum in June 2012. The government considers that it is important that continued progress is made in this important area. The bill would, if enacted, repeal:  93 redundant appropriation acts from 1984 to 1999;  35 redundant supply acts from 1984 to 1997; and  three acts containing redundant special appropriations from the portfolio. The bill would also continue the government's commitment to a regular review of the special appropriations and maintain effective legislative housekeeping, including by repealing three superannuation related provisions containing two redundant special appropriations from the finance portfolio. Regarding the 128 appropriation and supply acts from 1984 to 1999, this bill would repeal as many as 13 appropriation and supply acts for one financial year (for example, in 1992-93) and as few as six appropriation and supply acts for other financial years (for example, four in the financial years between 1994 to 1996 and 1997 to 1999). The bill does not appropriate any money. Rather, it seeks to repeal whole acts and to repeal special appropriations within acts that are redundant. In addition to the appropriation acts that will be repealed by this bill, the government is reviewing appropriation acts since 19992000 to determine whether more recent appropriation acts are also redundant and could be repealed. I commend the bill to the House. Debate adjourned. NA Public Works Committee Reference",19
4,Mr GRAY,COMMITTEES,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (09:07): I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Defence Logistics Transformation Program. Treasury The Defence Logistics Transformation Program is a key strategic reform initiative that will deliver a modern robust and efficient logistic system to support the Australian Defence Force. The program will modernise defence logistics infrastructure and mounting bases, introducing new technologies and refine the business practices across the whole defence logistics network. New warehouses and maintenance facilities are to be constructed in Moorebank in Western Sydney; Ipswich and Townsville in Queensland; Darwin in the Northern Territory; Perth in Western Australia; Adelaide in South Australia; and Wodonga in regional Victoria. The capital investment in the program will have economic benefits in these locations for local industry, with significant opportunities for subcontractors and the construction industry over the next three years. The total capped budget for the program is $899.6 million, which includes $752.7 million plus GST, which provides for the construction costs; management and design fees; furniture, fittings and equipment; contingencies; and an escalation allowance. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in late 2012 and is planned to be completed on all sites by mid-2015. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to.

5,Mr GRAY,COMMITTEES,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (09:08): I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Development and construction of housing for Defence members and their families at Kellyville, Sydney, New South Wales. Defence Housing Australia, DHA, proposes to develop a four-hectare greenfield property at Withers Road, Kellyville, New South Wales. The site is approximately 21 kilometres from the Parramatta CBD, 47 kilometres from the Sydney CBD and 24 kilometres from RAAF Base Richmond. DHA purchased this well-located land from the private market via a private treaty in late 2011. The site was selected due to its close proximity to established shopping and service facilities at Rouse Hill and its central location between RAAF Base Richmond and the Parramatta CBD. The proposal will involve development of the site over two stages with stage 1 consisting of general, civil and roadworks for the development of 65 serviced allotments; and stage 2 consisting of the construction of 34 dwellings for defence personnel use in the form of 26 integrated townhouses and eight detached dwellings. The estimated overall project cost is $22.834 million, including GST and excluding the cost of the land. The cost will be met by DHA and recovered through the sale of surplus lots and the DHA sale and lease-back program. Subject to parliamentary approval, civil construction is expected to commence in April 2013 with dwelling construction to be completed by December 2014. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Reference",21
6,Mr GRAY,COMMITTEES,"Brand-Special Minister of the State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (09:10): I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: High Voltage Electrical Distribution Upgrade, Liverpool Military Area, New South Wales. The $19.5 million Liverpool military highvoltage electrical distribution upgrade project proposes to provide increased electrical supply and an upgraded electrical distribution network in order to support existing and planned growth in infrastructure and facilities within the Liverpool Military Area. The project will upgrade and replace inadequate, outdated and non-compliant electrical infrastructure that will subsequently improve the overall capability and functionality of the Liverpool Military Area. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in early 2013 and is planned to be completed by mid-2014. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Reference",21
7,Mr GRAY,COMMITTEES,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (09:12): I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Moorebank Units Relocation, Holsworthy, New South Wales. On 23 April 2012, the Australian government announced its commitment to facilitate delivery of an intermodal terminal by mid-2017 at Moorebank, New South Wales. The future Moorebank Intermodal Terminal is to be developed on land currently occupied by a number of Defence units and facilities, the largest of which Australian Army's School of Military Engineering. Through the Moorebank Units Relocation project, the affected Defence units will be relocated from the Moorebank site into the new facilities to be constructed at the nearby Holsworthy Barracks by the end of 2014. The project proposes to establish five new precincts within the existing Holsworthy Barracks cantonment, which will include the provision of new working, training, living and support facilities for all relocated Defence units. As part of establishing the new precincts, the project also proposes to improve the overall capability of the base by upgrading or replacing inadequate and non-compliant essential engineering services. Within the new entry precinct, the project also proposes to provide upgraded security arrangements and a new entry to Holsworthy Barracks to address local traffic congestion issues, which will involve the development of a new intersection on Heathcote Road. In addition to the facilities required at Holsworthy Barracks to support the relocated Moorebank units, several new multi-use facilities are also proposed to be provided by the project to better support the increased base population and to achieve improved the cost efficiencies and operational synergies. Redundant facilities beyond their economic life in the vicinity of the proposed new works will be demolished. With about 2,000 construction jobs to be generated by this project over the next three years, it is expected that this project will provide major economic benefits for the wider Sydney region and local industry. The decision to deliver an intermodal terminal at Moorebank has provided Defence the opportunity to consolidate its activities at Holsworthy Barracks and to achieve costis the effective capability upgrades. This is consistent with extant Defence policy of colocating units to achieve enhanced operational outcomes and improved operating efficiencies. The estimated out-turned cost of the proposed work is $869.999 million plus GST. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, the main construction program is scheduled to commence no later than January 2013 and all works are planned to be completed by late 2015. I commend the motion to the House. Question agreed to. Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights Report",22
8,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights I supply the House with a report on the committee's action. Members will recall that the committee is established under the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 and was appointed in March this year. The committee has been established as part of a concerted effort to enhance the understanding of, and respect for, human rights issues and to ensure the appropriate recognition of human rights in the legislative process. The role of the committee, set out in section 7 of the act, is to examine and report to parliament on the compatibility of bills and legislative instruments with Australia's human rights obligations under seven core human rights treaties, specified in section 3 of the act. The committee is able to examine existing legislation and conduct broad inquiries into matters relating to human rights as referred to it by the Attorney General. Members will appreciate the potentially huge task before the committee. Since its establishment, the committee has been actively considering the scope and purpose of this task and how it will contribute meaningfully to the consideration of human rights by this parliament. This will be an evolutionary process, and my statement today is intended to outline the committee's first tentative steps. The committee is not completely stepping into the unknown and is mindful of the experience of similar committees in this and other parliaments. The committee is grateful for the input of a number of key individuals and organisations who have generously made time available to brief the committee on various practical aspects of its work. The committee has arranged further briefings and will continue to arrange briefings as required. It is clear from the outset that the committee must prioritise its work. If the committee is to assist the consideration of legislation before this parliament in a meaningful way, it cannot possibly consider every bill and every instrument in detail. Therefore, the committee is developing a triage process to assist it in this regard and will publish this process on its website in due course. Our understanding is that this is consistent with the practices of other similar committees. It has been the experience of these committees that an appropriately qualified specialist legal adviser is a necessary resource. The committee has now agreed to a selection process to engage a legal adviser. In the interim, the committee has begun to consider bills currently before the parliament. There are a number of avenues open to the committee in considering the compatibility of a bill with human rights. Most of these turn on establishing an effective dialogue with the relevant ministers and departments. In some cases, the committee will decide in the first instance to write to the minister seeking further detail in relation to a bill before deciding upon any further action. The committee may ask the minister's department to provide the committee with a briefing. In some circumstances the committee will take evidence in public and may call for written public submissions. The committee will then report its conclusions to the parliament and publish these reports on its website. For the time being, the committee is approaching bills on a case-by-case basis and endeavouring to tailor its approach to suit the circumstances and, where possible, the legislative program of the parliament. The committee hopes that in due course, the parliament will take account of the work of the committee by factoring time for the committee's deliberations into the legislative program. In deciding whether to consider a bill further, the committee will have regard to the work of other parliamentary committees where this is relevant to the committee's work. The committee will also consider any correspondence received from members or senators or from key stakeholders. The committee will consider what, if any, specialist advice it will require. I encourage anyone who wishes to draw matters to the attention of the committee to write to the committee. However, I would like to emphasise that any matters raised will of course be considered by the committee as a whole and that the committee will decide what action, if any, it will take in response such correspondence. In this context, the committee has received two pieces of correspondence asking it to examine particular bills currently before the parliament. The Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS, together with a number of cosignatories, has asked the committee to examine the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Fair Incentives to Work) Bill 2012. The committee has decided, as a first step, to invite ACOSS and the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to attend a hearing on Thursday, 21 June to provide evidence in relation to the concerns raised in the ACOSS letter. Following that hearing, the committee will meet to consider the evidence raised and determine its next steps. The second piece of correspondence is from the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples and asks the committee to examine the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory bills. Before determining how it will proceed with this request, the committee has written to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services Indigenous Affairs seeking her advice on the compatibility of the bills with human rights. These bills were introduced prior to the requirement for a statement of compatibility. The committee would like to afford the minister the opportunity to provide her assessment of the policy objectives of the bills against Australia's human rights obligations and clarify for the committee the justification for any limitations on rights that the bills will impose. The committee views statements of compatibility as a key element in consideration of human rights in the legislative process. The requirement for each new bill and each legislative instrument to be to accompanied by a statement of compatibility has the potential to significantly increase transparency and accountability in the development of policy and legislation. It is obviously also a significant starting point for the committee's consideration of a bill. I would like to emphasise the importance of statements of compatibility including an actual assessment of whether the bill is compatible with human rights. The committee is guided by the explanatory memorandum to the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 in this. The EM states that a 'statement of compatibility must include an assessment of whether the bill is compatible with human rights as defined' in the act. The EM goes on to confirm statements are intended to be succinct and should contain 'a level of analysis that is proportionate to the impact of the proposed legislation on human rights'. It is early days in this process, but it is clear that, while most bills have been introduced with a statement of compatibility, not all statements of compatibility conform to these expectations. However, the committee is pleased to observe that the and overall quality of statements appears to be improving as ministers and their departments become more familiar with the requirements. The committee is grateful to the Attorney General's Department for the training and support that it is providing to departments to assist them to identify rights and to draft statements of compatibility. In time, the committee intends to be able to support these efforts through the publication of guidance materials of its own. I would like to acknowledge the work of the two Senate scrutiny committees in supporting the work of this committee to date. Since the introduction of the requirement for statements of compatibility commenced, the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills and the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances have been considering statements within the context of their own terms of reference. These committees have written to ministers to draw attention to concerns regarding the level of detail provided in the assessment of compatibility. The committee is grateful to the two scrutiny committees for taking the initiative in this regard and acknowledges the intersection of their work with that of the committee. The committee looks forward to working productively alongside them as it develops its own approach to the scrutiny of legislation. As I said at the beginning of this statement, my purpose here today is to take this early opportunity to outline the approach the committee is taking to its role. I intend make a similar statement at the end of this sitting year when I hope to provide greater clarity around the committee's approach and working practices. On behalf of the committee I express my gratitude to Jeanette Radcliffe, the secretary, and the other members of the secretariat for their hard work in the establishment of the committee and our work so far. I personally place on record my thanks to the Deputy Chair, the member for Hasluck, and the other members of the committee for their diligence and collegiate approach to the work of the committee. I am sure that that will make our journey much easier. I thank the House.",22
9,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"The member for Hasluck, in his role as deputy chair of the committee is seeking leave to make a short statement. I am sure there is no objection.",25
10,Mr WYATT,COMMITTEES," by leave-As Deputy Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights I would like to associate myself with the statement by the member for Scullin. The details within that statement reflect the discussions, the deliberations and the thinking of the committee in the way that it intends to address its responsibility with respect to the work that we have to do. Equally, I am pleased to be working under the stewardship of the member for Scullin and all members of the committee to enhance a broader understanding of and a respect for human rights issues, which must also be balanced with individual and collective responsibility. One of the things that we can pride ourselves on, to some extent, in this parliament is that there are many committees which undertake work around key issues. Many of those key issues are considerations of the fundamental human rights, access to government services and the protections of to people's rights within the context of Australian society. I certainly look forward to the work that we will undertake and the deliberations that we will have in respect of the bills. Certainly I believe that this process will enable the parliament to better address the rights of people. Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Pay As You Go Withholding Noncompliance Tax Bill 2012 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",25
11,Mr HOCKEY,COMMITTEES," This package of bills before the House deals with a range of measures. Schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012 seek to make directors personally liable for unpaid superannuation. Directors' penalties cannot be discharged by placing the company into administration and directors and associates are liable for PAYG withholding non-compliance tax where a company has failed to pay. Schedule 2 of the tax laws amendment bill seeks to retrospectively legislate changes to the taxation financial arrangement scheme, which includes related changes to consolidation tax cost-settings arrangements outlined in schedule 3 of the bill. Finally, schedule 4 of the tax laws amendment bill and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill seeks to double the final withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. I can state at the outset that the coalition will not be supporting the passage of this legislation through the House. Firstly, I want to deal with schedule 1 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill and Pay as You Go Withholding BILLS Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012. As I outline the coalition case for opposition to this package of bills, I will do so sequentially, starting with schedule 1 of the tax law amendment bill and the related pay as you go bill, which contain provisions dealing with Bill 2012 director penalties and phoenixing activities. The changes being put forward in relation to director liability and phoenixing activities seek to (1) expand the application of the director penalty regime to unpaid superannuation guarantee charges-and this is what I said before, (2) ensure that directors cannot discharge their director penalties by placing their company into administration or liquidation when PAYG withholding or superannuation guarantee remains unpaid and unreported three months after the due date and (3) in some instances makes directors and their associates liable for PAYG withholding non-compliance tax where the company has failed to pay amounts withheld to the commissioner. This is the second time that the government has moved to legislate this issue. The first was in November last year, when the government moved an amendment to excise the provisions from TLAB 8 and the associated Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill. This was after a House Standing Committee on Economics inquiry noted concerns from the business community that these bills could apply to all directors, whether engaged in phoenix activity or not. The committee made a bipartisan recommendation that the government should seek to tighten the provisions in those bills to better target actual phoenix activity. The House economics committee has now inquired into the provisions of the government's second legislative attempt. The coalition have noted in our dissenting report to the House economics committee that this legislation still fails to appropriately target phoenix activity. When is the government going to get it right? We have expressed concerns that 'liability would apply indiscriminately to all directors, including those of charities and not-for-profits that are limited by guarantee'. This is a classic example of further red-tape burdens on business and now further red-tape burdens on charities, and the coalition still views as a considerable impediment to getting on with the job of life. The coalition condemns the practice of phoenixing-we always have-which involves a company intentionally accumulating debts to improve cash flows or wealth and then liquidating to avoid repaying the debt. As I have noted to the House previously, phoenix activities are actions by directors to strip out assets to a new company with the intention of liquidating the old company, which is left with net debts. The directors use the corporate veil to protect themselves against any personal liability for the old company's debts. The directors then run the old business through the new company. The old operation rises up from the ashes. The coalition is concerned about the effects of this activity and we recognise the need for legislative safeguards in order to prevent it from occurring. However, just as the government failed to address our concerns last time, this bill fails to implement protective action that is directed and focused on phoenix activity. The coalition still views these reforms as sweeping changes to deal with a relatively small number of criminally minded individuals. The possibility is very real that innocent directors will be caught in the net. As I said before, I say again: when will the government and ASIC properly use and explain the existing powers and where the existing powers have failed rather than introducing more red tape, more regulation, more legislation? It is smashing a nut with a sledgehammer. Schedules 2 and 3 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 retrospectively deal with changes to the taxation of financial arrangements, TOFA, and consolidation tax cost setting arrangements. Schedule 2 of the bill deals this with the taxation of financial arrangements in the context of tax consolidation. The TOFA legislation which commenced on 26 August 2009 contains tax-timing rules applying to accruals and realisations relating to financial arrangements. The TOFA provisions generally apply to financial arrangements that a TOFA taxpayer entered into during income years commencing on or after 1 July 2010 unless the taxpayer elected to have the TOFA provisions apply early. The amendments in schedule 2 are to be applied retrospectively to 26 March 2009. The background appears to be the May 2011 Board of Taxation report to the Assistant Treasurer, Review of the consolidation rights to future income and residual tax cost setting rules, which examined the issue of liabilities in the tax consolidation regime. The Board of Taxation noted that there may be some circumstances in which it would be appropriate for a future tax deduction to be denied for the amount of a liability of a joining entity. Schedule 2 will affect the taxation treatment applying to TOFA liabilities that are assumed by a head company, or a lead company, when it acquires another entity joining the consolidated group. The effect of the amendment will be to deny a deduction to the head company when the liability is eventually discharged. What makes this retrospective change worse is the fact that it will have an even greater impact on one set of consolidated groups in respect of their pre-TOFA acquisitions. Those most disadvantaged are those consolidated groups that made an election to apply TOFA rules to corporate acquisitions of joining entities they had effected before the TOFA legislation started. This is referred to as ungrandfathering. Taxpayers, advisors and professional bodies are aggrieved at the retrospective nature of these amendments. There will be some corporate groups who have made important investment decisions based on the law as it stood when TOFA commenced. There will be some that made the important election whether to apply TOFA to their existing financial arrangements based on the law as it then stood. Again, in the wake, in the last 24 hours, of the government's retrospective amendments to transfer pricing, here is legislation that is dealing with retrospectivity, further creating sovereign risk. The submission by Deloitte to the exposure draft on the proposed changes to the consolidation regime noted that it was unfair to deny deduction in the circumstances. It said: The retrospective application of the proposed changes to TOFA and consolidation interaction provisions 26 March 2009 is unfair to taxpayers who relied on the existing tax legislation when making significant business decisions on acquisitions or deciding whether or not to make a transitional election to apply the TOFA rules to their existing financial arrangements. These taxpayers would have acted on the belief that would be entitled to certain deductions which not be available if the proposed changes apply retrospectively. In this place last night we had divisions because the government was going back seven years to change the law in relation to transfer pricing. Here we have businesses that entered into agreements in good faith relating to transfer-pricing arrangements and the government says, 'Look, even though the law didn't exist at the time, we're going to retrospectively change the law to make things that you thought complied with the law unlawful, even though that law did not exist at the time.'! Now, within 24 hours, here we are again-Groundhog Day!-retrospective tax legislation, in this case going back to 26 March 2009-and in this case, even after the tax office had given private rulings approving of transactions. Even now the government are saying: 'Look, we're going back. We are changing the rules. We can't claim enough tax from people going forward; we're gonna claim tax off people going backwards.'! This government just can't get enough tax out of you. So they are not only going to claim more tax out of you for all you do tomorrow; the government are going to claim more tax out of you for what you did yesterday, because what they are getting today just isn't enough to meet their wasteful ways. Then they say to us, 'You guys are responsible for negativity out there.' That is what they say to us. They blame us for negative consumer sentiment. They blame us for negative business sentiment. It is all our fault. It's all Tony Abbott's fault; it's all Joe Hockey's fault-as if we write the speeches for Ivan Glasenberg in London when he says, 'We are getting greater business certainty out of Congo than we are getting out of Australia.' Or Marius Kloppers or Jac they Nasser at BHP when they warn of uncertain will business times in Australia. As I said yesterday, we do not write the press releases for Gerry Harvey, John Singleton or John Symond. We do not write those releases, they do, because they have to deal with this type of legislation-retrospective tax legislation. They have to deal with it. How can anyone have confidence about the future when there is a government that is changing today's laws tomorrow? Why would you take a risk? Why would you go out and borrow money to buy a new house? Why would you do that in this environment? Fewer and fewer people are doing it, because they are nervous about the government. There is a sovereign risk, and before the House for the second day in a row we have retrospective tax legislation. No wonder people are afraid to take a risk. How do you price-risk when a government says, 'We're going to change yesterday's laws'? How do you do that? And where are the accountable people in the Treasury or in the Australian Taxation Office? Who are the people that are going to be held accountable for what is deemed to be original drafting errors? Where are they? What heads have rolled? Because, if you are writing retrospective tax legislation that involves billions of dollars back taxes being claimed at a time when there were legitimate business investments, someone is going to be sacked out there. People are going to lose their jobs. Of course they are. Where billions of dollars are transferred from the private sector to the public sector, someone is going to have to pay. Of course there will be job losses. There will be investments that will stall. Who is accountable in the government? If it occurred under a previous coalition government and now it occurs under the Labor Party, who are the public servants that were responsible for these drafting errors? Is the minister going to answer that? This is serious stuff. It involves billions of dollars, as I understand it, and yet there is no accountability. They think: 'Oh well, we'll just shuffle it through the House of Reps and the Senate. It'll be okay.' But out there real people will lose their jobs. They have to, so who is going to be accountable here? This is what kills confidence. The government confidence. It kills confidence when it changes the laws that applied yesterday, but also it kills confidence when it changes the laws as they stand. We have seen it in relation to company tax, carbon tax, mining tax, superannuation tax, taxation of employee share schemes and now it seems there is an endless list of retrospective taxes. The mountain that we have to climb if there is a change of government is just getting bigger and bigger every day. Schedule 3 is another complex amendment to the tax consolidation legislation. At Senate estimates last month in response to coalition question, Treasury advised that the amendments in schedule 3 addressed issues that arose out of amendments to the tax legislation enacted on 3 June 2010. Treasury's advice was that there had been extensive public consultation over of a number of years prior to the 2010 amendments being passed. Despite that, the Board of Taxation noted in its report I referred to earlier that in 2011 the ATO were aware of claims and potential claims by consolidated groups for deductions of over $30 billion in respect to the 2010 amendments. This amount did not include interest or the revenue associated with transactions that have taken place since 30 June 2010. The Treasury is to be commended for carrying out an internal examination of why the revenue risk associated with the amendments was not recognised prior to passage. But there are questions that remain. The fact that the amendments took effect from the commencement of the consolidation regime on 1 July 2002 only partly explains the quantum of the claims. Evidence given by Treasury at estimates was that the information given to Treasury through the consultation process did not fully draw out the downside risks with the legislation. kills Quality control in relation to taxation legislation is crucial. This is even more so where transactions are large and involve considerable commercial complexity. Tax consolidation legislation is almost a category of its own. Quality control starts with competent and capable personnel. It involves appropriate supervision and monitoring of compliance with the department's standards, having regard to the huge sum of revenue associated with the claimed deductions. There must be careful oversight by Treasury into the quality and risk processes associated with developing tax policy, drafting the requisite legislation, and ensuring that consultation is open and frank, including the participation of the ATO. This process would not have been helped by the fact that the government has had no less than five Assistant Treasurers since coming to office only 4½ years ago-five Assistant Treasurers in 4½ years! The pickup and put-down of legislative priorities for this particular portfolio by the various ministers wandering through the revolving door of the Labor ministry seems to have negatively impacted the consultation processes, reviews, stakeholder feedback and deadlines for taxation legislation. Quite simply, this is not the way to run a country. It is not the way to run a taxation system. In summary, the changes contained in schedule 3 seek to modify the consolidation tax cost setting arrangements and rights to future income rules so that tax outcomes for consolidated groups are more consistent, in the view of the government, with the tax outcomes that arise when assets are required outside of the consolidation regime. This raises a number of concerns, given that the government is retrospectively amending the consolidation tax cost setting arrangements according to the time when the corporate acquisition took place. The changes within the bill will impact acquisitions that took place on various The first period is prior to 12 May 2010, being the date when the amending legislation was passed by both houses of parliament, when what are referred to as the 'pre rules' will apply. The second time period is after 30 March 2011, being the date the Board of Taxation was asked to review the 2010 amendments, and referred to as the 'prospective rules'. The final period is the intervening period, known as the 'interim rules'. Did you hear that? And this is a government committed to simplification! Given that the changes passed on 12 May 2010 relates to amendments that date back to 2002, some of the amendments related to consolidation within this bill will have effect from 2002-that is, 10 years of retrospectivity. They are cheering out there in business land. Ten years of retrospectivity! Entities affected by the proposed changes in schedule 3 will be adversely impacted by the retrospective changes, in particular, those changes editing the acquired rights to future income. This is because, for tax purposes, many of these rights will now have a cost base of zero, as opposed to those entities outside the consolidation's regime with a cost base equal to that of the purchase price. The resetting of the cost base to nil for entities of the consolidation regime, combined with its retrospective application, will disadvantage taxpayers that have elected to be in the consolidation regime. The coalition opposes retrospective application. That is a position that we on this side of the House uphold. In its submission to the House Standing Committee on Economics, the Tax Institute referred to a number of factors that weigh against the retrospective amendments proposed in schedule 3. Another relevant point, made by CPA Australia, that it is inequitable that a dates. taxpayer who has lodged a ruling or amendment request prior to 31 March 2011 receives a different treatment simply because it is not actioned by the relevant cut-off time, which at the time of the lodgement was not a factor. They said: Taxpayers should not receive differing treatment in circumstances where they have no control the outcome. It is because of their retrospective application that the coalition will not support the measures contained in schedules 2 and 3. Schedule 4 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill, along with the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012, seeks to double the final withholding tax on management investment trusts from 7½ to 15 per cent from 1 July 2012. The coalition understands the minister is going to be moving an amendment to excise schedule 4 of the tax law amendment bill and the related managed investment trust withholding tax bill. How about that? After announcing it in the budget, the government rushes in the legislation and now are they going to excise it! I am sorry, is this meant to be a key budget initiative? This is the third backflip from the government and the financial year has not even started! It seems like yesterday that the Treasurer delivered the budget-now we have got the third major amendment to the budget. The first is that they were dumping the company tax cuts, but now they are back on the table-those tax cuts that were only recently dumped in the budget are an article of faith, according to the Prime Minister. The second one is the passenger movement charge, remember that? The government has now dumped the CPI increases that they said were a part of the budget. The CPI increases have now gone. Now, there is the third factor-three strikes. The third one is that they are now dumping their determination to increase the withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. You wonder why people are uncertain and why business is confused. Look no further than the actions at the hands of the government over the last three weeks alone. over We had already announced that we would be opposing the measure after the Labor government previously reducing interest on withholding tax-which we praised. They reduced it and now they want to double it. What does that say to investors? The government make a decision-it is the same political party; it is the same Treasurer-and they reduce the interest withholding tax and then they wake up one day and decide, 'We are going to double it'. And you wonder why people like Ivan Glasenberg are giving speeches in London, saying that it is easier to deal with the Congo than it is to deal with the Australian government. Well, there is the evidence. David Denison, President and CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board stated-and this is what we hear all the time: In this era of fiscal restraint and additional direct and indirect taxes, we are becoming increasingly concerned that some risks associated with ownership of infrastructure are expanding. For instance, it is easy to envision the regulatory rate setting process becoming politicized instead of objective and fair. The same could occur with taxes-in fact, Australia's budget that was tabled last week effectively doubled the tax burden on our real estate and infrastructure holdings in that country. If we conclude that these kinds of risks within any country become significant enough to call into question the predictability and stability of cash flows that are at the heart of the investment rationale for infrastructure, our response will be very quick and rational-we will simply stop investing there. That was the head of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. He is saying it is too hard to do business. I did not write that speech. Tony Abbott did not write that speech. These are international investors that are saying, 'Hang on; this sort of sovereign risk in Australia is becoming just too hard. We will stop investing in infrastructure.' The chopping and changing of the MIT withholding tax has yet again reduced our predictability, our stability and our certainty in the eyes of international investors when they want to come here. They want to come here. They want a stable place to invest for the long term, and Australia as a net importer of capital needs that. But they have a government that keep screwing it up. In 2008 they reduced the interest withholding tax from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent, and now they want to double it, as they announced in the budget: 'Sorry, we've changed our minds; now we're taking it out'. Why? Why can't the government hold a policy position? Forget four years, three years or two years; why can't they hold a policy position for three weeks? Why can't they hold a policy position for two months? I know the minister at the table is one who frets about this. He was sent out into the coalface and told to sell a carbon tax package that the Labor Party promised they would never deliver-but, of course, they have. And they wonder why there is uncertainty. The coalition does not support the doubling of final withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. We are going to ask the minister at the table, who is responsible when this amendment is being moved by the government, to explain himself. Why can't the government hold a tax policy together? Why does the government now go deep into retrospective tax legislation in order to try and fund its budget? As I stated earlier, the coalition will supporting the passage of this package of bills through the parliament. We believe on many fronts that the government has failed to listen to the community. We believe that the government gives lip service to consultation with stakeholders. We keep getting this feedback, saying, 'Oh, the Treasury, the Australian Taxation Office and the government have consulted with the business community.' The business community is over that feigned, pretend consultation. It does not seem to move the government during what is meant to be a fair dinkum consultation process. No, the government is so determined to proceed that it then goes and announces initiatives in the budget, goes and introduces legislation into the parliament, and then changes its mind. What a dysfunctional rabble we have running the place in Canberra. This is tax policy. This is not tens of millions of dollars or a program here and a program there; it is billions and billions of dollars. It involves international confidence in our nation. The more the Treasurer and the Prime Minister talk about Australia and the Australian way, the more they are ridiculed by their actionstheir actions in having retrospective tax legislation yesterday going back seven years, in having retrospective tax legislation today going back 10 years, in announcing policy in relation to interest withholding tax and then changing their mind a few weeks later, in the passenger movement charge and in the company tax cuts. This is a government that cannot be trusted. It is an embarrassment, and the Minister for Resources and Energy knows how embarrassing it is to be a part of a government that cannot keep its promises or make up its mind. (Time expired)",26
12,Mr NEUMANN,COMMITTEES," I speak in support of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012, the Pay As not be You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. There we saw a pitiful and pathetic attempt by the shadow Treasurer to oppose these bills. Gough Whitlam, the former Labor Prime Minister, once said that only the impotent are pure. Well, I tell you what, there is not much purity on the other side when it comes to retrospectivity, as the Assistant Treasurer outlined yesterday in this place, with example after example of those opposite bringing in retrospective taxation legislation. So do not come into this place and lecture us about this, when we are fixing up a problem that has operated in one of these respects, on the shadow Treasurer's admission, since 2002. Who was in power in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and for most of 2007? Those opposite were in power, and they did nothing about fixing up the problems, as we are doing here. The shadow Treasurer said in relation to the passage of these particular bills that it involved billions and billions of dollars of taxpayers' funds. Have a look at the financial impact that the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill is going to have. The revenue impact this year of schedule 1 of the bill will be $32.5 million; the impact of schedule 2 will be $66 million; the impact of schedule 3 will be nil; and the impact of schedule 4 will be $65 million. So it will not be the billions and billions of dollars the shadow Treasurer referred to time and time again in his speech. He made exaggerated claim after exaggerated claim, and the same thing is happening all the time. The shadow Treasurer talked about sovereign risk and said that the passage of these bills and the operation of this government present a sovereign risk to this country. He spoke as if there has been a great exodus of investment from this country, when in fact half a trillion dollars has been invested in the mining sector-in iron ore and in coal. You can see Australian ships carrying iron ore and coal lined up one after another in places such as the Pohang steelworks in South Korea. People came into this country and made massive investments notwithstanding the GFC. In 2009 and 2010 we saw massive foreign investment in this country. In 2009, there was an 11.1 per cent increase in foreign direct investment in Australia. This was followed by a 7.5 per cent increase-a total of $474 billion-in 2010. Are all the foreign investors coming to this country stupid? No, they are not. Do they have economic idiocy running through their brains? No, they do not. But to believe the jeremiads from the shadow Treasurer about these bills is to believe that all these barons of capitalism and captains of industry-these mining companies and these superannuation funds trustees-are all dills. Why, if you believed a word that those opposite have said, would they invest in Australia? Why would all these shadow ministers and opposition backbenchers invest in these companies-as we have seen them do time and time again-if you believed a word of what the shadow Treasurer said was true? He is like a profit of doom. He is like some sort of Old Testament prophet-woe is me! I half expected sackcloth and ashes to be thrown around the chamber during the shadow Treasurer's speech! It was nonsense. He said not a word about how schedule 1 of the bill protects the superannuation entitlements of workers and therefore the revenue base of this country by making directors liable to pay superannuation and preventing them getting credits through collapsing their companies and not paying the PAYG withholding obligations. There has been not a word from the architects and the apostles of Work Choices over there about protecting workers. There has not been a word about that from them, but that is what schedule 1 of the bill is all about-making sure that workers' superannuation entitlements and government revenue are protected. The shadow Treasurer is not worried about workers or the revenue base of the country. Those opposite are not interested in either putting in place deterrents to phoenix operations or strengthening and extending the director penalty regime-the DPR-to cover superannuation obligations. It currently only applies to PAYG withholding obligations. The shadow Treasurer said nothing about that-and just waxed on, way off beam. These bills are important because we do not want people to fail in their obligations to workers, as has happened in the past. I am sure that as members of parliament all of us have had people come up to us at street stalls, at mobile offices and at electorate offices and have talked to us about fraudulent phoenix activity. I am sure that there is not a member of this chamber who has not had someone come and say to them: 'I'm working for a business, and that business has failed. It's unable to pay its debts. I had superannuation, and they didn't pay the superannuation guarantee. They didn't meet their taxation obligations.' We are making sure that these directors are more accountable for what they fail to do. We are making sure that there is a deterrent in place to prevent directors doing just this sort of thing. We are making sure make sure that they fulfil their obligations. We do not want taxation liabilities left unpaid, and that is why these bills are before this chamber. We do not want outstanding debts, and we want to make sure that these directors are liable. If the company is unable to meet its withholding amounts to the commissioner, the directors must place the company into voluntary administration or liquidation. Currently the Commissioner of Taxation has the ability to penalise the directors an amount equal to any PAYG withholding that has fallen overdue, but the director penalty regime in the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill makes them personally liable. We want to expand the responsibility and the scope of liability of the directors to cover unpaid superannuation guarantees to employees; remedy any possible escape from liability by preventing the discharge of the director's penalties when a company is placed in liquidation and PAYG or superannuation obligations remain outstanding; and impose obligations on directors and their associates to pay PAYG withholding non-compliance tax on withheld PAYG amounts that have not been paid to the commissioner and so forth. I did not hear much from the shadow Treasurer about those measures, which, in my view, are the principal reasons for bills such as those that are before the House. We are committed to making sure that we protect workers' entitlements. This Labor government has a proud record of getting rid of pernicious and arbitrary legislation imposed on Australian workers by those opposite and of standing up to protect the revenue base of this country when those opposite set themselves against government on taxation issues, as they always seem to do. Schedule 2 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill deals with problems that have been around for a while. It amends the taxation of financial arrangements-consolidation interaction provisions-in the Income Tax Assessment Act and balances these adjustments with other legislation to make sure that the tax treatment of financial arrangements is part of assets and liabilities in a merger or takeover, that it is consistent with the TOFA tax timing rules and that it takes into account changes in the value of financial arrangements or liabilities. This is important legislation. It amends legislation to make sure that our provisions are consistent, it makes sure that we have a good arrangement protecting the taxation bases. It ensures that taxation treatment of financial arrangements is consistent with the rules we have put in place in terms of timing and I support that. Schedule 3 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act, modifying consolidation of tax cost setting rules so that the tax outcomes for consolidated groups are more consistent with the tax outcomes that arise when assets are acquired outside the consolidation arrangement. We amended the regime in relation to consolidation in 2010 as clarification. For some assets this reset tax costs from the original tax costs, in the case of consolidation of corporate arrangements. We want to make sure that it is used as a taxing point when it later arises for the purpose of the assets. Shortly after that some unintended consequences arose. We have taken steps about that. The opposition say they are not supportive of what we are saying, but the Board of Taxation was asked to look at these arrangements and recommended that we conduct the kind of legislative amendments that are necessary. The board concluded the scope of the new rules was broader than was originally intended at the time of the announcement in 2005-when we were not in power-and could allow some consolidating groups to access deductions that were not available to other taxpayers outside the consolidation regime. So it is a long standing problem that operated before we came into power. This is fixing up a mess that happened on the watch of the previous government as well. I will let the minister talk about schedule but I want to make a point about criticisms made of us that we reduced the withholding tax rate paid from managed investment trusts. We reduced the MIT payments to foreign residents from the rate of 30 per cent to 15 per cent. We did that as part of our election commitment back in 2007 when we went to the polls. That is consistent with other countries. The United States and the United Kingdom have 15 per cent. It was 30 per cent under the previous coalition government. We are a government that is interested in foreign investment. We welcome foreign investment in this country. We think it is important. We do not have sufficient population or dollars and cents to develop our country-vast continent that it iswithout foreign investment. We are a country that has grown by virtue of immigration and having people come to this place. They come as employees and employers. We welcome them when they come to the rural, manufacturing and the mining sectors. We, on this side of the chamber, are people who believe both in free trade and fair trade and believe that the criticism of our support of foreign investment is unjustified and exaggerated. We saw that well and truly on display by the shadow Treasurer whose words were nonsensical and alarmist in this regard, once again so much like some sort of Old Testament prophet going around saying, 'We are all doomed and no-one should have any confidence,' and then having the temerity to criticise us when we say that they are putting a dampener on consumer and business confidence in this country. I support the legislation.",32
13,Mr ROBB,COMMITTEES," It is always fascinating to follow the member for Blair. He seems to have one theme, no matter what he is talking about. It is always 4 contradictory when you sit and listen. He stands up and, in the most virulent manner, accuses the opposition of endless negativity and then proceeds for the length of his 15minute contribution-or whatever it may be-with endless negativity. The government seem to be obsessed with abusing this side of politics and the member for Blair is a classic example of that. I think it reflects the fact that, even though they are the government and should have plenty to say because they are responsible for introducing measures and legislation and defending that legislation, they have nothing to say really. The member for Blair read what is contained in the bill and in essence gave no argument of any consequence in support of those measures. The bill has been in the public arena now for some weeks. There have been some very trenchant concerns and frustrations about some of these provisions. There have been statements made not only by the opposition-let us put us aside-but by the people in the businesses and investors who will be affected by the changes that are proposed. At the very least the lead speaker for the government on this bill should provide some critique of the concerns that have been raised by important members of the community, people who are creating thousands of jobs, looking to promote billions of dollars of investment, looking for certainty, looking for the absence of sovereign risk. You would think that the member for Blair would address some of these concerns that have been listed over several weeks very prominently in the newspapers and elsewhere, yet he went on an exercise of simply reading out what is in the legislation in between all these histrionic attacks on the opposition and inflammatory language about the way in which we have expressed our concerns over the legislation. I must say it is a pathetic contribution and it adds nothing to this debate. It does reflect the morale that we see on the other side and the concern by the adults on the other side that this government is one of the most inept, if not the most inept, governments in our lifetime. It is a government which has lost any sense of direction, if it ever had any. It is a government that is confusing people all over this economy and, externally, with investors in foreign markets. It is a government that has, at its root-because of its incompetence, inconsistency, flip-flopping and lack of direction-very materially created a crisis of confidence amongst households in this country. They have been saving disposable income at a rate of 12 per cent over the last year because they are afraid to spend. They are building up reserves and paying off the mortgage because of their fear. They are worried about their jobs. There is a crisis of confidence. They have pulled $90 billion of discretionary income out of the marketplace. No wonder our retail sector is on its knees. It is because of the lack of confidence. It is because they are waking up at 2.30 in the morning worried about whether they are going to have a job. We see endlessly, each week, reports of companies that are going to the wall and putting off thousands of people. Sure, we are blessed with what is going on with the mining boom in the west and in Queensland. Put that aside, and the rest of the country has stopped. The investors, major companies, have got serious money on their balances sheets that they are not investing because there is a crisis of confidence not only amongst households but also amongst businesses. This sort of legislation is another classic example, another symbol, of the deep sense of confusion and lack of confidence and uncertainty that is now riddled through our economy-at a time when we are blessed with the mining boom. It is a boom that has been going for 10 years and has been wasted by this government. Every dollar of the $800 cheques that are going out is still being borrowed. Can you believe it! After 10 years of a boom and the highest terms of trade in our history-monumentally higher than anything we ever had before-we still have $800 going out to households, every dollar being borrowed. And then there is the flipflopping that is represented in this bill. We will not be supporting this set of as my colleague the shadow Treasurer announced, because it adds to the great uncertainty and concern about consistency, flip-flopping and the litany of sovereign risk issues that now confront investors who may be looking to put their money in Australiaor investors in Australia looking to take a risk and invest in and create jobs. The changes proposed under the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2011 do not appropriately target phoenix activity. The government has failed to argue a strong enough public justification for the retrospective application of proposed changes contained in schedules 2 and 3 of the tax laws amendment bill. This is in relation to consolidation tax cost-setting arrangements and related changes to taxation and financial arrangements. My colleague the shadow Treasurer went through in some detail-and with great clarity-the way in which schedules 2 and 3 are a lazy attempt to plug some spending holes that this government has. It is a lazy attempt to use retrospective legislation to grab some tax from years ago. The retrospective application of these changes heightens our sovereign risk profile. As an opposition we have very strong inprinciple opposition to retrospective tax changes and if anything were ever to be done it would need enormous justification. The reasons this government has put forward are very shallow. In fact, if you listened to the member for Blair he gave no justification of any consequence for the retrospection. All he did was criticise and defame the shadow Treasurer and others on this side of the House. Our opposition stems from the fact that retrospective tax changes can change the substance of bargains struck between taxpayers who made every effort to comply bills, with laws prevailing at the time the agreement was entered into. People who acted lawfully are now going to be slugged, potentially some years later, with an unexpected and in some cases highly significant tax grab by this government. We are opposed to retrospective changes because they can expose taxpayers to penalties in circumstances where taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps, at the earlier time, to mitigate the potential for penalties. We oppose retrospective changes because they may change taxpayers' tax profiles. This, in turn, can materially impact on the financial viability of investment decisions and the pricing of those decisions-years after they were taken, years after people acted in good faith and made a case based on the prevailing legislation. They did their ROI assessments and deals with other companies and took risks based on the prevailing legislation. Now they find they will be lumped with an unexpected, highly material and in some cases debilitating tax bill. It will also leave a mark on their reputation. For many if not all who have acted within the law they will feel they have been unjustly labelled as tax cheats. In some cases, businesses will go to the wall because they took decisions at the time based on the prevailing law. We are opposed to retrospective tax changes because they could increase Australia's level of perceived sovereign risk. Added to these changes is the litany of sovereign risk issues from the introduction of a carbon tax, which was promised never to be introduced, and from the introduction of the mining tax, which exists nowhere else in the world, and, again, the incompetent way in which that has been dealt with over the last 18 months or nearly two years. Then there is the way in which they handled the live cattle job. They have actually created a long-term poisoned pill in the middle of our relationship with Indonesia-our closest neighbour, with a population of nearly 300 million, and a big part of our future, and yet our trade with country is smaller than with New Zealand and its four million people. Can you believe it? And yet this government has gone out of its way to compromise and frustrate and demean that nation by, overnight, with absolutely no forewarning, announcing, via email, that we were going to cut off 40 per cent of their imported protein, indefinitely, because of a television program three nights before in Australia. Can you believe it? This is the sign of a government which is just amateur hour, and people see all of these things. Now we have a whole raft of changes which have retrospective elements to them. The final element of these bills is the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. We hear rumours now that it is going to be withdrawn and possibly some grubby deal is to be done with the Greens. Maybe we will see it introduced, who knows? Nothing will surprise us. Nothing will surprise the rest of business. It will only confirm the judgment they are making: 'Let's not invest. There's too much uncertainty. This government's got no idea.' They have already made a change, yesterday, in the CPI matter, for the passenger movement charge-only a lazy $140 million! But they have withdrawn that. Now, today, we hear that they may well have withdrawn this bill, which increases the withholding tax on foreign investment from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent-just another lazy $265 million! It is the only reason they introduced it in the first place. It was a measure that they introduced some four years ago and received great commendation, including from ourselves. It was an inspired move, to reduce the withholding tax to 7½ per cent. And it has had a material effect. There have been literally billions of dollars, especially coming into the housing and construction sector. We were starting to see billions of dollars being invested in that infrastructure through this mechanism. Now all of that will be put on hold. We are literally sacrificing billions and billions of dollars of investment, and a decision, which got commendation around the world and certainly within this country, has now been turned on its head for a miserable $264 million. We even have a situation where research subsequently conducted by Allen Consulting Group is saying that, for every billion-dollar drop in investment-and there will be billions, many billions-from the increased tax, it will raise $40 million less in revenue from the tax increase in 2015-16, than the $75 million predicted by the government. So it is not even going to raise the money they expected. So they have taken this step which has again materially affected our sovereign risk for no good reason. So we have a $400 million hole in the budget. And today we see the Reserve Bank has indicated that the forecast sharp swing to budget surplus next financial year mostly reflects shuffling of spending that will limit the scope for further interest rate rises. The RBA has just confirmed that the budget surplus is a hoax-it is a con. It is a fiction. What we have been saying all along-and what businesses suspects, and what everyone suspects, everyone knows-is that the oneand-a-half-billion-dollar surplus is a con. It is never going to happen. Again, it is a sovereign risk issue now. All of these things are adding up-adding up to a point where this is very dangerous for the country. We are opposed to these bills. This government is out of control. It is all over the place. It must be stopped. The only way this will happen is with an election. (Time expired)",35
14,Mr MELHAM,COMMITTEES," I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012, the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012 and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012. I want to address a couple of points that the member for Goldstein made in his contribution. The first thing I want to say to the House is: I am not opposed to retrospective legislation in circumstances. That has been a feature of legislative reform over the years-obviously, not in every single case, but it is warranted in a number of cases. Indeed, it is warranted sometimes in the criminal law. Indeed, when we had the war crimes legislation under the Hawke government, it produced retrospective legislation against abhorrent conduct that occurred at the time of the Second World War. That legislation was supported, and it made criminal acts that should have been criminal at the time. So you just cannot rule it out. Today we see on the front pages of the newspapers a shyster, a solicitor, who was overcharging his clients and who, some 12 months ago in New South Wales, transferred to his wife millions of dollars worth of assets, be it his share of the family home for a dollar, or his share of a farm for a dollar. is said that his assets can be recovered. That is what is being said in the papers. But I say to you, Madam Deputy Speaker D'Ath: if that shyster's assets cannot be recovered then the New South Wales government should introduce legislation and it should be retrospective legislation that enables it to recover his assets, because he was under investigation and during the period of that investigation has transferred his assets, for a dollar, in some instances, where the value was much more. What are we supposed to do as legislators-do what the coalition does in a number of instances: be like moo cows, watching the passing traffic? No, in my opinion, you come in and you legislate, and a retrospective feature is warranted-not in all circumstances but in some circumstances. The reason I rise to support this particular legislation has to do with features of it in terms of phoenix activity. I go to the explanatory memorandum, which says: Schedule 1 to this Bill strengthens directors' obligations to cause their company to comply certain with its existing Pay As You Go (PAYG) withholding and superannuation guarantee requirements. These amendments reduce the scope for companies to engage in fraudulent phoenix activity or escape liabilities and payments of employee entitlements by:  extending the director penalty regime to make directors personally liable for their company's unpaid superannuation guarantee amounts;  ensuring that directors cannot discharge their director penalties by placing their company into administration or liquidation when PAYG withholding or superannuation guarantee remains unpaid and unreported three months after the due date; and  in some instances, making directors and their associates liable to PAYG withholding non-compliance tax where the company has failed to pay amounts withheld to the Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner). The explanatory memorandum goes on to It summarise regulation impact statements and explain other aspects of the bills. In particular, it says at paragraph 1.7: The director penalty regime makes directors of companies that fail to comply with their obligation to pay amounts withheld under the PAYG withholding regime to the Commissioner (or fail to pay an estimate of their PAYG withholding liability) personally liable for the amount that the company should have paid, through imposition of a penalty. It continues in paragraph 1.11: Phoenix activity poses a significant threat to employee entitlements, government revenue and the economy as a whole. In its most basic form, a fraudulent phoenix company is used to intentionally accumulate debts and then is placed into voluntary administration or liquidation to avoid paying those debts. The business then ‘re emerges' as another corporate entity, controlled by the same person or group, but free of debts. However, some aspects of the director penalty regime limit its efficacy in ensuring cause their companies to comply with their obligations, including in phoenix cases. Some evidence was put before the Standing Committee on Economics on 27 October 2011 by Mr Grant Darmanin, a senior director and the Phoenix Risk Manager of the Australian Taxation Office, that is worth mentioning. On page 29 of the committee report, he says: Our best estimate is that at any given time there are around 6,000 phoenix companies operating in Australia, and we estimate that, given that not all of them have a single directorsome have two directors-somewhere between 7½ thousand and 9,000 company directors could be exposed in particular to this legislation. These are fraudulent phoenix operators; they are not just people making business decisions. That is what he says in evidence. Then on page 31 he says: Fraudulent phoenix operators, almost to a person, do not report, they do not lodge and they do not pay. We have to go out and identify them and quantify the liability, sometimes using forensic-style investigative or audit techniques. I think it is important to put on the record that on page 32, Mr Darmanin says: There are, but phoenix operators, particularly the fraudulent ones, are very adept at flying under the radar, so to speak. When they come back into the ATO's systems, they will quite often use as the director someone who is not directly related to the former group. It might be someone that they engage, pay or hire or a name they pick from the telephone book. When we profile that individual when it comes through, quite often the direct links to that former business are not obvious. I take your point, though, that if we ask them questions we may get some answers, but phoenix operators do not like telling the truth. Then on page 33, the chair says: Okay. So there are 6,000 to 7,000 that you know about. Do you have an estimate of how many you might not know about and how many new ones come in every year? that directors Mr Darmanin responded: No, we do not. There have been various studies done over the years, not so much by the ATO but by other committees and organisations, that have made various assessments of the impact of phoenix activity on the Australian economy. The most recent one was a 2004 parliamentary joint committee inquiry into corporations and financial services. That put the impact on the Australian economy at that time-2004-as being between $1 billion and $2.4 billion per annum. That is the most recent hard data we have to work with. Since that time, all the ATO's experience is that fraudulent phoenix activity has continued to increase not decrease, despite the ATO having a targeted approach to try to address this behaviour since the late nineties. The chair then asked: How much is it increasing every year? Mr Darmanin responded: It is hard to be definitive around that. When I say 'increasing', the indicators that we look at are the number of complaints being lodged by individuals whose entitlements have not been paid and we look at those companies and find that they are involved in repeat phoenix behaviour. We have incidents of companies incurring repeat liabilities-companies who are given an income tax adjustment the first time who choose to liquidate and continue their business through a new company rather than pay those assessments, for example. We have break-outs in different parts of our business, as I talked about before. A lot of phoenix activity in previous years used to be at the lower end of the SME market; now it is across the whole of the SME market. It is active in the micromarket as well. Originally, it used to be PAYE and prescribed payments, when we had that system; now it is in the superannuation, GST and income tax. The member for Goldstein talks about sovereign risk. What I see here is risk to the ordinary taxpayer-to the hard working individual-from shonks. The parliament should go after the shonks and set a legislative framework, even if it requires retrospectivity, that puts these people on notice that they will be personally liable and that we will come after them if they engage in this sort of behaviour. And we should not apologise for it. Recently we saw a situation where the High Court came down in terms of directors' liabilities and duties to do with a particular company dealing with asbestos. I welcome that unanimous decision of the High Court, because what it says is, 'If you want to be a director, don't bother just picking up your director's cheque. You actually have to do your homework. You have to read your papers. You have to read the press releases before they go out.' What it means is that directors have to take responsibility as directors, not just occupy those positions for the sake of an honorarium or some remuneration, and that they can themselves be liable. What we had in the James Hardie case, I think, was the High Court being spot-on in terms of the liability of those directors-those that tried to hide behind the claim, 'Well, I didn't read the press release, so I'm not liable.' In relation to phoenix companies, which are much worse, we should not apologise for the action that we are taking, even involving a level of retrospectivity in this legislation. When the member for Goldstein talks about sovereign risk, I think he is using an expanded definition of 'sovereign risk' to bring this sort of activity that the government is involved in into the definition of 'sovereign risk'. I am concerned about sovereign risk, as we all are, but I am also concerned about employees' entitlements, because time and again we have seen under this government and the former government companies going belly-up and employee entitlements going out the window. Here we ordinary are talking about activity that is despicable activity, deliberately setting up companies to do the wrong thing, maximising the money to certain individuals and minimising any liability. So I have no hesitation in standing up in the House today and supporting this legislation, notwithstanding the fact that there are elements of retrospectivity in the legislation, because what I would say is that it should not cause concern if the conduct that we are talking about is captured retrospectively. It is not outside the bounds. This notion of 'retrospectivity never at any cost' is rubbish. I believe in retrospectivity in appropriate cases. When it comes to phoenix activity or dishonourable behaviour, you can legislate retrospectively to pick it up, because the threat of that retrospectivity of itself is a powerful deterrent to the shonks. It says to them, 'You're not going to be able to get away with it.' What it is about is greed, so you have to attack the greed and the loot that they are looking for with, in some instances, the threat of retrospectivity, which might stop certain behaviour. That is the only way. When you talk about deterrent effects, I say to you: when it comes to money and when it comes to this sort of behaviour, deterrence does have an impact in the corporate sector for some of these shonks. If they think they can transfer assets to their partners, their relatives or whatever with immunity and it is not going to be captured or picked up if they are caught out, they will do it. I am not arguing for retrospectivity in every instance-I am not saying that-but what I am saying to you is that in some instances it is warranted. In this instance, to me, it is certainly within the realm and within the principles. It has been, I think, pointed out by other speakers that there has been retrospective legislation in the life of the former government. So they did it-not as a regular occurrence, but on a number of occasions it was done. So let us not be too precious in relation to that. I commend the bills to the House.",38
15,Mr BUCHHOLZ,COMMITTEES," What an interesting group of bills: the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012; the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Amendment Bill 2012, which has the retrospectivity linked to it; and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012. It is quite a complex group of bills. However, I rise today to speak about the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill, the Income Tax (Managed Investment Trust Withholding Amendment Bill and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill. I express my concerns in relation to these bills because I believe they are inadequate in their process and assessment and they fail to pay consideration to a number of associated issues and recommendations. In particular, the government has not adequately addressed the bipartisan concerns of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics inquiry into the government's previous attempts at legislating these measures. A prospective undue increase in taxation and proposed retrospective measures without proper justification to raise automatic and indiscriminate liabilities to directors add pressure on investments and are not acceptable. The potential automatic increase in the liability of directors under PAYG bill raises concerns about the preservation of natural justice and the considerable burden to business. Before I go on, I just want to start with a very basic point. Let us get a determination on what a company director is. When you think of a company director, depending on your background, does your mind go to someone who is maybe taking a board position on one of the major banks or an influential organisation and who could be paid enormous amounts of remuneration, or does your mind go to your local mechanic or butcher, who could have a net household income of around 100 grand a year and who could have taken advice from their Tax) accountant that, because they are around that $100,000 level, it is more advantageous for them from a tax perspective as a small family business to set up a company structure as opposed to a partnership? This bill captures the mechanic. It captures the butcher. It captures the bloke in the main street. I have not heard anyone from the Tax) other side stand in this House to defend the rights of the common man and the worker. This bill is doing them over. I want you to take your mind to a place where when you hear the word company director during the debate on this bill you think of the mechanic, the bloke who has grease up his arms. Do not think of the bloke in the suit in Collins Street on a million bucks a year-or a million bucks a month in some cases. Making directors personally liable for the failure of someone else will only add more red tape to the business and will add more bureaucracy, and would most definitely cause most potential directors to run a mile in the other direction. What will happen to the future of Australian business and thus the economy? Phoenixing is a terrible practice. We do not support phoenixing in any capacity the whatsoever. For those of you that may not totally understand what phoenixing is, it is a horrible practice where a business bloke might see that he is getting into trouble and is going to go out the back door, so he transfers the assets out of his business with the distinct intention of avoiding paying super and other liabilities that his staff are entitled to. We will not have a bar of that. We will crack down on phoenixing and assist in whatever capacity we can because we do not support that. Phoenixing is corrupt and there is enough corruption going on in this nation as it is. The previous speaker spoke about evidence the Taxation Office gave to the House of Representatives Committee on Economics. I happen to sit on that committee. This bill seeks to give the Taxation Office enormous, overreaching powers. The tax office claims this will give it the capacity to stop phoenixing. But guess what? These powers reach to every single business in the nation. The evidence was there are only 6,000 cases of phoenixing. But this bill allows the Taxation Office, under the auspices of investigating phoenixing, to go into your business, to tear the place apart, find whatever other anomalies that may be happening in your business and go after it. This is just a trigger to get through the front door of your business to try and grab more cash. One of the people who gave evidence to the economics committee was John Colvin. He is the CEO of the Australian Institute of Company Directors. He said: The bill was conceived to target phoenix operators. The regulatory impact statement prepared in June 2011 in respect of the bill only addresses the measures the context of phoenix activity. There have been some minor amendments to that regulatory statement as we understand it; however, the premise of the bill and the way it is constructed is basically still targeting or based on phoenix activity. Even if you accept the ATO figures which have been put forward, less than half a per cent of directors be engaged in phoenix activity and yet the bill potentially imposes liability on the whole 2.2 million. That is a very big and damaging net to catch a few fish, we would contend. If you are serious about wanting to shut down phoenixing then why, when a business shuts down one day, do you give a tax file number to directors to open up the next day? Would it not just be easier to not give them another tax file number? Where did that idea come from, out of the blue? Do not let them start up again. Your mechanism is so big and so clumsy you do not know who they are. There are not enough rigorous checks. The Standing ACCC has powers already that can prohibit it but they are not exercised. The Taxation Office has powers that can stop this type of practice but it is not exercising them. What does this government do? It continually says the answer is: 'More red tape, more bureaucracy! We'll fix it and we'll go and affect every other small business in the nation.' I say that is wrong because I stand on this side of the House as a small businessman who believes in less government, less interaction, less bureaucracy. Let the punter on the street, the bloke who is trying to drive the prosperity of this nation have a go. I am not going to support anything that goes towards fraudulent activity where staff liabilities are in question, but please let common sense prevail on phoenixing. You have provisions that already exist to stop phoenixing in its tracks by not giving directors a tax file the very next day when they go to transfer. You are going to affect the lives of 2.2 million businesses, company directors and mechanics; that is the link. Do not think we are chasing the end of top end of town. This affects everyone. It is a bad bill. This bill would impose liability to all directors, including those of charities and may not-for-profit organisations. They are limited by guarantee, as many directors are. Many of these organisations are the lifeblood of the community and should not be placed under unnecessary stress and inconvenience. Overall these bills will punish taxpayers who, in good faith, abide by prevailing laws. This bill is nothing more than a blatant tax grab, an attempt to remedy Labor's erosion of the Australian fiscal position. The bill represents a number of issues each of which has been examined at length by the House Standing Committee on Economics. The first issue I raised today was in relation to making directors personally liable for unpaid superannuation guarantee amounts to their company employees. I raised the question as to whether directors of companies may be liable for these measures if they join the board after the fact. The government cannot answer this question about if an existing board is in place. Now we are back at the top end of town, and the organisation has been going for 15 or 20 years. I go on and take a position on that board and, because of my diligence and my strong governance procedures, I investigations to make sure that we have contingent liabilities for staff entitlements. As a result of those investigations, I the company that I have just joined may be negligent in that and I want to remedy it. As a result of this, I am in the tin for the 20 years of liability. So what is my motivation then as a company director? What is the actual intent of this legislation? It is encouraging me not to say anything, because I am going to be liable for it. Why aren't we promoting good faith for directors to come out and be transparent? Who knows? One of the most important aspects that has been omitted from these bills is that phoenixing activity, and I could go on all day about that. According to the Australian Institute of Company Directors, there are some 11,700 companies in Australia that are limited by guarantee. We are talking about charity organisations, grower groups, and businesses that serve the Australian people. As John Colvin from the Australian Institute of Company Directors mentioned in his speech to the parliamentary estimates committee, it targets almost all of Australia's 2.2 million directors including those who volunteer their time to work with charities and community organisations. Mr Coleman also pointed out that following submissions to the parliamentary estimates committee in 2011, the committee recommended the government investigate whether it was possible to amend the bills to better target phoenix activity. Yet the government has made virtually no attempt to target phoenix activity in revising the bill. But it has not just been to the economics committee, it has been to a Senate committee. They raised concerns about this part of the bill, and still there is no amendment. It is just typical of Labor's instigate attempt to burden the directors of those companies, even where there was no illegitimate activity, with undue liability. find that And why, I ask: because the Labor government has no interest in the successful operations of business in Australia. These bills also look at amending the taxation of financial arrangements provisions, TOFA, to ensure that the tax treatment of financial arrangements that are part of a consolidation event is consistent with the TOFA tax-timing rules. This is both a revenue protection measure and a revenue gain over the forward estimates. These amendments are said to protect a significant amount of revenue over the forward estimates and generate a revenue gain of $253 million over that period. The consolidation tax cost-setting arrangements and related taxation of financial arrangements are in simple terms retrospective tax changes. The government have failed to justify the retrospective aspect of this legislation. The government describe this measure as 'revenue protection', but have not quantified the amount of tax revenue which would be lost if the tax measure was not passed. That is important-a lot of this stuff is important. The government describe this measure in the bill as 'revenue protection', but have not quantified the amount of tax revenue that would be lost if the measure were opposed. So they are saying that it is not going to have any impact on budget if it goes through, but if it does go through we are going to have to find some money. I just do not get that part of it. Retrospective measures can expose taxpayers to penalties when taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps to mitigate the potential for penalties to be imposed. As an opposition and as a coalition, we fundamentally oppose retrospectivity. When you pay your tax bill on 30 June each year, it is fundamentally the security of your business to know that you are clear. What a horrible day it is when you wake up the next day and find that you have got an eight-year tax bill, knowing that in good faith you had paid your tax. This bill is bad for the country. It is bad for business confidence, confidence that is lacking in our market at the moment. Thank you. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (10:56): In speaking on the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and the package of bills before the House, let me also join with my colleagues, the shadow Treasurer, the shadow minister for finance and those others from this side of the House, who spoke in this debate in reiterating our opposition to these bills. The shadow Treasurer outlined in great detail, schedule by schedule, the deficiencies with this legislation. In my contribution today I particularly want to focus on one aspect of the legislation that is before the House, which has received some debate this morning and that of course is the schedule that deals with the managed investment trusts withholding tax for foreign investments. The shadow Treasurer this morning outlined some of the government's history on this legislation. He also indicated that the government has tabled an amendment to delete these very schedules this day, so it appears that we are witnessing, apparently-not that the government has said not anything discernible at this point-a U-turn in slow motion on this issue. Let us focus on this issue because it says so much about this government's approach to taxation. In the budget the government announced that it would double from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent the withholding tax for foreign investments for managed investment trusts, and the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance have outlined the great damage that announcement has done already and the flawed nature of that announcement. They have also outlined in great detail how this is completely contrary to earlier actions and statements by the government. I just said the government 'announced' this in the budget. That is being too generous to the Treasurer. In my cursory look at his budget speech just now, before beginning my contribution to this debate, I could not find any mention of it. On a closer reading maybe there is a word or two there, but I suspect not. I start from the position with this Treasurer that if there is some bad news to announce it will not be in his budget speech. He has got great history on this, of course. This is the Treasurer who refused to name the debt or deficit figures in his budget speech in 2009. I will take the House through the history of this because it exposes so much: not only the incompetence of those opposite but their complete lack of understanding on matters of taxation. If you go back to the Treasurer's budget speech of 2008, he very clearly outlined the government's plan to cut this particular tax. He said: Our nation has the potential to be a financial services hub in the Asia-Pacific Region-the fastest growing region in the world. To support this ambition, the Budget begins the process of significantly reducing the withholding taxet cetera, et ceterato a final rate of 7.5 per cent … He was quite happy to make great fanfare of it in his speech. That 7½ per cent rate was to be doubled in this year's budget. There is no parallel statement, and it must flow that if the government thought the 7½ per cent rate was so necessary for what they wanted to achieve, a doubling of that rate indicates a change of policy; and if what they said was so important and so beneficial, a doubling of that rate must therefore be detrimental. Look to the statements of some of those who have spoken in the debate-it is a wonderful thing Hansard, Madam Deputy Speaker, as you know. We have had in this House today a number of those opposite trying to defend the indefensible. My friend the shadow Treasurer was a bit harsh on the member for Blair, who speaks on all of these tax law amendment bills. My friend the shadow Treasurer rightly pointed out that he had not addressed the substance of this issue. I can tell you why: the member for Blair is a good bloke with a bad brief. What this Treasurer has asked those opposite to do is to vote to cut this particular tax to 7½ per cent and then in his budget to double it. They will be able to go around Australia saying, 'We've supported a cut and an increase in the same tax.' I have said this before in this House and I cannot be sure that every member will know what I am talking about here, but I know the minister at the table will because he has a great understanding of Australian history and a great understanding of sporting history.",42
16,Mr Crean,COMMITTEES,"I do know what I'm talking about. Mr TONY SMITH: Many years ago when I was a mere kid, and the minister at the table was probably in his 30s, there was an Australian opening batsmen called Graeme Wood. No-one wanted to bat with him because he was famous for saying, 'Go, stop, wait, no, go back!'-and you would always end up standing next to him at one end of the pitch. You see that on tax policy with those opposite. Let us remind them of their words. The Assistant Treasurer introduced these bills on 24 May announcing the increase in this tax rate, the doubling of it. Let us look at what he said almost four years ago to the day. On Wednesday, 18 June 2008, here is what the now Assistant Treasurer said as a backbencher in the newly minted government who were going to create a financial services hub here in Australia. Talking about the cut to 7½ per cent, he said: That will be a very clear signal, a marker to global capital that this is the place to invest-that Australia is a country where you are able to invest and you are able to get a reasonable rate of return without being slugged with excessive levels of tax, as may be the case in other jurisdictions. I regret to inform members opposite that the Assistant Treasurer at the time went further. In introducing the legislation, the member for Prospect and then Assistant Treasurer, now the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, had this to say, again on 18 June 2008, on why the government was cutting the rate to 7½ per cent: Why did we do that? Get ready for this. He said: Because you do not create a financial services hub with tinkering. What did they do in this year's budget if they didn't cut the rate to 7½ per cent, and they announced they're increasing it to 15, if that's not tinkering, if that's not a doubling, if that's not change? Right back then you had this new government, this new band of brothers, and they were going to cut the rate to 7½ per cent. Now they are doubling it to 15 per cent, and no mention can be found in the Treasurer's speech. I will go on and continue to quote the then Assistant Treasurer: You do not create a major policy reform by working around the edges. We took the view that if we could give Australia the lowest withholding tax rate in the world this would be a major advance in making Australia the financial services hub of Asia. We took the view that a withholding tax rate of 7½ per cent was an appropriate way to promote Australia as a financial services hub. Well, you do not have that view now. In the budget it was doubled. It says so much about this government that their approach on these issues creates uncertainty, leverages risk and sends out the message to international investors that this is a government that chops and changes. Think about what the effect of that budget night announcement was on international investors. They got the message from the new government in 2008: 'Come here because we have a 7½ per cent rate'-and, as the shadow Treasurer said, they invested on that basis. If they were listening to the Treasurer's speech on budget night that would not have mattered but once they digested the detail they discovered that the rate was to be doubled. What impression about tax policy in Australia does that leave in international quarters? Let me be very blunt: it shouts out the message that the government cannot be trusted on tax. It shouts out the message of uncertainty-and uncertainty is toxic in the world environment. It says, 'Whatever this government says, you're at great risk of that tax rate being changed on you retrospectively.' You do not have to take my word for it; you can take the word of so many commentators. That would take up a lot of time in this House but I do want to quote one because this gives a real world view to those opposite about the effect the government's conduct has created. The shadow Treasurer quite rightly quoted David Denison this morning. David Denison, president and CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board addressed it directly: In this era of fiscal restraint and additional direct and indirect taxes, we are becoming increasingly concerned that some risks associated with ownership of infrastructure are expanding. For instance, it is easy to envision the regulatory rate setting process becoming politicized instead of objective and fair. The same could occur with taxes-in fact, Australia's budget that was tabled last week effectively doubled the tax burden on our real estate and infrastructure holdings in that country. If we conclude that these kinds of risks within any country become significant enough to call into question the predictability and stability of cash flows that are at the heart of the investment rationale for infrastructure, our response will be very quick and rational-we will simply stop investing there. The shadow finance minister made the point that the member for Blair did not have a lot to say-he had got word that the amendment I mentioned earlier was being tabled. The member for Blair, who speaks on all of these bills, was elected in 2007; he sat there in 2008 and hailed the reduction to 7½ per cent. He voted for it and then on budget night discovered that the 7½ per cent rate was doubled. Those opposite understand-at least the member for Blair does-the impact of this but they have a Treasurer and an Assistant Treasurer who have no idea on these matters.",46
17,Mr Baldwin,COMMITTEES,"Incompetence personified! Mr TONY SMITH: That does damage. My friend at the table said, 'Incompetence personified'. That raises a very important point: lack of competence in Canberra creates a lack of confidence outside Canberra. (Time expired) Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (11:12): Once again we stand in this House, less than 24 hours since I last spoke on another piece of legislation that contains retrospectivity and lacks clarity and detail. As the member for Casey has so well pointed out, it adds to the level of uncertainty in our business community about the future direction of tax policy in this country. I will go through this package of bills, the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and related bills, one by one and have a look at the various schedules. We fully support some of the ideas contained in this legislation. We have always supported the notion that phoenixing activity should be minimised as quickly as possible because it has lots of deleterious effects on confidence, particularly in the construction industry. I saw that first hand on many occasions when my father worked as a ceramic tiler. Building companies would close for business on Friday and reopen as a new company on Monday; they would ring him up to work on new projects but had not paid him for the old ones that he was working on in the weeks prior. We will start with a look at schedule 1. It refers to the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2012, which makes directors personally liable for unpaid super. It means directors' penalties cannot be discharged by placing a company into administration and looks to make directors and associates liable for PAYG withholding non-compliance tax where a company has failed to pay. It seeks to expand the application of the director penalty regime and ensure that directors are held to account for their activities. What is important in legislation is that it is not just about phoenix activities. Once again, we see a failure to clearly articulate what phoenixing activity actually is. The changes are justified in the explanatory memorandum as being part of an attempt to combat phoenix activities. This is the second attempt by the government to make these types of changes. The first attempt was made in the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 8) Bill 2011 and the associated Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2011. An inquiry into these bills by the House Standing Committee on Economics made a bipartisan finding that the provisions in the bills did not add to existing requirements but instead applied a more effective penalty regime to phoenix operators who were abusing the law to obtain an unfair competitive advantage. I do not think there is anyone in this House that would disagree with that notion to achieve that outcome. However, the committee noted concerns from the business community and its representatives that the bills would potentially apply to a broad range of directors, whether they were engaged in phoenix activity or not. This is the crux of the matter. The committee unanimously recommended that the government should investigate whether it would be possible to tighten the provisions of the bills to better target phoenix activity. After the House economics committee tabled its report, the government withdrew the relevant provisions from those bills, including withdrawing the Pay As You Go Withholding Noncompliance Tax Bill. The House economics committee has now inquired into the provisions of the package of bills currently before the House. The coalition members of the committee have again found that the measures proposed by this the government are not properly directed to or focused on phoenix activity. The coalition members found that the measures were, instead, 'broad based and not targeted' and would impose such onerous obligations that company directors would become more focused on compliance, rather than on performance and running the business. A particular concern expressed to the committee was the liability that these provisions would apply to board members of charities and other non-profit organisations, and that this liability would act as a disincentive to undertake those roles. When we consider the time and effort that these people put into volunteering their skills and their talents to important charitable institutions in our community, this would be of grave concern. It is a point I would particularly like to emphasise, because in my electorate the not-for-profit community organisations and their volunteers are one of the key pillars of strength. I have no doubt that that would be reflected in many other electorates around Australia, if not all. The government continues to introduce ad hoc and piecemeal measures to deal with phoenix activity. However, as I have touched on previously, the government has yet to provide a comprehensive definition of what phoenix activity is. It has continually failed to target the measures so that they apply to directors of phoenix companies without imposing onerous new obligations on directors of the vast majority of companies that continue to comply with their legal obligations. Within the current regulations-within ASIC, within the Corporations Act and within the tax act-there are more than sufficient provisions to prevent those directors from being able to be issued with tax file numbers or re-registered as directors of new companies. As I have touched on previously in this House, it is a matter of enforcing the regulations that are already there-not seeking to impose new levels of regulation because our regulators failed to apply the laws that are already in existence. I reiterate that the coalition is strongly opposed to fraudulent phoenix activity-and I have already given a personal example of that-and supports all appropriate measures to stamp out this practice. As I said last year in debate on the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures Bill), phoenixing is a cancer that is eating away at the foundation of trust upon which our business community and the broader community are built. It sours relationships and creates a distrust that means people can no longer rely on those they do business with. We remain concerned that the government's approach to this important public policy matter is again confused, ad hoc, piecemeal and not appropriately targeted. Schedule 2 makes changes to the taxation of financial arrangements provisions, both as a revenue protection measure and as a revenue gain over the forward estimates. These changes apply to consolidated groups and work together with provisions of schedule 3 that have a retrospective impact. It also changes the consolidation tax cost setting arrangements-that is the retrospective component. As I mentioned last night in the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Cross-Border Transfer Pricing) Bill (No. 1) 2011, the coalition is opposed to retrospective taxation changes as a matter of principle. We are opposed to these changes for a number of reasons. Firstly, the proposed changes can change the substance of bargains struck between taxpayers who have made every effort to comply with the prevailing law at the time the agreement was entered into. They can expose taxpayers to penalties in circumstances where taxpayers could not possibly have taken steps at an earlier time to mitigate those potential penalties. Secondly, they may change the tax profile of taxpayers, which in turn can materially impact the financial viability of investment decisions and the pricing of those decisions. Thirdly, they can increase Australia's level of perceived foreign risk. I again make the point that the perception of sovereign risk these days with this government is no longer perceived or real and actual. How can taxpayers be expected to have complied with laws they did not know existed at the time they were supposedly expected to have complied with them? Earlier today I received an email from a constituent who made the following remarks in relation to the retrospective effect of the proposed cross-border transfer pricing amendment bills debated last night. He said: The retrospective effect of this legislation is particularly abhorrent because it goes back much longer than tax records are required to be retained. My understanding of the bill before us today is that the retrospectivity actually goes back 10 years rather than the eight we were discussing last night. He goes on to make the point: The whole tenor of the bill is predicated on the fact that the courts have ruled on the effect of the law as it is written and have dared not to support a 'policy' position taken by the Commissioner of Taxation. The law is now absolutely clear and the government should accept the ruling of the courts like all other citizens are required to do, or appeal if it thinks it has good grounds. If these proposed changes were made prospective from the date of announcement, which in the case of the transfer pricing was 25 November 2011, then we would be inclined to support these measures. Schedule 4 in the outlined bill is proposed to double the withholding tax on managed investment trusts from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. We heard this morning that the government will now make changes to this schedule, and we wait with bated breath to hear what they actually are. At the end of the day, we still call on the government to scrap its ad hoc, piecemeal approach to double the tax on managed investment trusts. Our focus should be on encouraging further investment from our foreign counterparts through internationally competitive taxation arrangements so we can grow our economy more strongly. As all of us in this House well know, we are a nation and an economy that relies on foreign capital to grow and build our economy and our wealth. The first example that springs to mind here is how destructive the world's biggest carbon tax is going to be for competition in this sense. I have spoken with an export business in my electorate that is considering shutting down operations for periods during the year, forcing staff onto annual leave or leave without pay in an effort to stay below the 25,000-tonne threshold for the carbon tax. This is in order to keep them competitive in their export markets against other countries that they compete with, such as the USA. Getting back to the proposed changes to the managed investment trust withholding tax, as they stand, they would double the managed investment trust withholding tax for foreign investment from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. I will continue on this, despite the fact that the government is proposing changes which none of us have seen. Again, they would be retrospective in that they would apply to all income distributions made after 1 July 2012, irrespective of when the original investment decision was made. In 2008, when the government reduced the rate of withholding tax progressively from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent, the coalition did not oppose that; we actively supported it. However, at the time, we did express concerns that the reduction was not a genuine reduction for international taxpayers because, through the operation of the double taxation agreements, any reduction in taxation paid in Australia might simply lead to higher taxes being paid in other jurisdictions. At the time, the coalition expressed concerns that the bill had not been subject to proper scrutiny as the government had not allowed the bill to be considered by the Senate Economics Committee, that Labor's costings of the measure may have been underestimated and that the government had delivered a tax cut to foreigners but had not delivered a tax cut for Australian taxpayers. It is the government's constant chopping and changing in relation to the withholding tax that is yet again reducing our predictability in the eyes of international investors. If passed, this legislation will undermine Australia's objective of becoming a regional financial services hub in the Asia Pacific. Attracting more foreign investment is as important as ever to achieve stronger economic growth for our future. (Time expired)",47
18,Mr BALDWIN,COMMITTEES," I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 and the Income Tax (Managed Investment Withholding Tax) Amendment Bill 2012. I rise to speak on these budget measures, which are of huge significance to the tourism industry and our ability to ensure the infrastructure pipeline. I have to say that I have never seen a government more out of touch with the tourism industry, one that has so breached trust with the tourism and one that has so failed in basic communication between ministers. I say that because on 2 May this year the government announced a tourism investment guide to market Australian tourism investment to potential foreign investors in Shanghai. It is true that this government needs to lift their game to attract these investors. For example, they need to restore the Survey of Tourist Accommodation and a comprehensive way to deliver a complete also industry-wide performance model. They need to reduce government borrowing, which competes with tourism accommodation providers when they seek finance to improve their properties. They need to set KPIs for Austrade officials around the world to find inward investment, and they need to reduce red tape that currently makes residential property development more attractive than developing tourism accommodation stock. Despite this, I welcomed the initiative that day and I commended the minister, saying, 'It is a good first step towards improving Australia's accommodation stock.' Depending on which model we assume to be true, we will need to provide somewhere between 30,000 new beds and 70,000 new beds to reach the Tourism 2020 targets. The opposition would help the sector help itself, by properly restoring the Survey of Tourist Accommodation. Under Labor the requirement for small boutique accommodation providers to report guest Trust numbers was scrapped. Hotels and motels offering fewer than 15 beds are not required to report on occupancy. While this saves the ABS less than $1 million, it means Australia no longer has reliable data on occupancy and no way for bank managers to determine returns on investment sought by providers. Work has begun within the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism to restore reporting, with an online system to replace its expensive and slow phone interview based system. However, important parts of the sector have been dismayed by the lack of industry-wide consultation, by the extended delays in this project and by the government's long-term commitment to the project itself. The exclusion of small accommodation providers from the data capture represents a lost opportunity to establish complete research platforms upon which to base important tourism decisions. The government's prospectus was a totally powerful measure so long as it was part of the broader policy to deal with underinvestment. I was dismayed therefore to learn that, six days after launching its prospectus, the government doubled the tax on international hotel investors. The increase to managed investment trust withholding tax is one of the measures announced in the budget which have set the tourism industry into an absolute spin. In this budget, the government has directly attack the tourism industry. For example (1) there is no carbon tax compensation for tourism, and this stands to destroy 6,400 jobs, mostly in regional and rural Australia and cut 10 per cent from industry profits; (2) the budget for Tourism Australia has been reduced by 6.2 per cent, which is $8 million in real terms; (3) the passenger movement charge has been increased from $47 to $55 per passenger, and a desire has been expressed to index it by the CPI; (4) $118.1 million in costs for AFP security at airports has been passed on, and these will be passed on to airlines, who will pass them on to tourists; (5) there have been 90 headcount cuts to Customs staff, so increasing tourist waiting times at airports; (6) duty-free concessions have been reduced; (7) the visa label charge will increase by $10; (8) there is a $7 million investment in SmartGates at the same time as the government is cutting $10 million from elsewhere in Customs' budget, and this will take the form of further staffing cuts; and (9) there are tax-loss carrybacks only for companies, and these are limited to two years. Australian Federation of Travel Agents CEO Jayson Westbury says: If the Government has a budget black hole, it is not reasonable to hit the one industry that provides long term and career based jobs to everyday Australians, who already contribute significantly more than their fair share of taxes.",51
19,Mr Bradbury,COMMITTEES,"Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the matters to which the member is referring have no relevance to the bills that are being debated.",52
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES," Thank you, Minister. I have been listening to the member for Paterson, who has strayed quite a few times from the legislation before us. I would ask him to come back to the legislation.",52
21,Mr BALDWIN,COMMITTEES,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I am exactly on the legislation. Like many on this side of the chamber, I followed proceedings in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics and the questioning by the member for Wright. As that committee learned through testimony and from its publication a week ago of the report by the Allen Consulting Group, the net effect of the MIT bill will be that by 2016 there will be less money for government to spend-$172 million less, in fact-and that there will be reductions of $533 million in household consumption. In short, the tax will wipe out a large proportion of the household discretionary spending that tourism relies on for financial stability. I am aware of a range of tourism investments threatened by the MIT bill, but I will not add to the pressure already put on developers by disclosing commercially sensitive information and citing individual cases. The Allen Consulting Group report made known to the House economics committee indicates the following: a one per cent increase in the rate of tax reduces the level of investment activity by three per cent; there will be a $1 billion decline in foreign capital results by financial year 2016; there will be a net overall reduction in federal tax revenue-that is, a substantial decline in economic activity will wipe out the entire estimated revenue rise; there will be a $172 million reduction in government spending capacity; 4,640 jobs will be lost; and there will be a reduction in household consumption of $533 million and in GDP of $580 million. The Allen Consulting Group concludes that an increase in withholding tax will be self-defeating. The Property Council of Australia and the Financial Services Council have evidence that the $1 billion decline has already occurred. In advance of this debate many members will have been sent a copy of the Business Council of Australia's study into Australia's capital project investment pipeline called Pipeline or pipe dream? Securing Australia's investment future. As Business Council of Australia CEO Jennifer Westacott said when launching the study: The study provides for the first time a total picture of how capital investment is driving the economy, and underlines why policy priorities a stronger economy must help focus on the delivery of Australia's investment pipeline. The study highlights how important the effective delivery of major projects will be to the future shape and health of the economy and living standards. The $921 billion pipeline is not assured, and we are becoming a high-cost place to invest. The government's changes to the managed investment trust taxation, which fly in the face of the week-old Shanghai launch, are prime examples of the ways in which this government is making Australia a poor choice for investors. The BCA launched their report at the Prime Minister's Economic Forum last week. As reported in the media, the Tourism and Transport Forum opted not to attend that event-and they were wise not to do so. The last time they attended a similar event, their Deputy Chair, Ann Sherry, appeared at the future tax summit to advocate accelerated depreciation of assets to drive investment in the sector. The outcome was a budget plan scotched at the last minute to do just the opposite for aircraft. When the Prime Minister was quizzed on the TTF's nonattendance her pat response was to say Labor has been meeting with the tourism sector-and especially the cruise sectorand talking about their needs. Labor has lost all credibility with the cruise sector over two recent decisions. Firstly, where is the Prime Minister's decision to allow Carnival Corporation and P&O Cruises access to Garden Island as an overflow facility? Secondly, Labor completely disregarded Orion Expedition Cruise's very reasonable expectations, which were put to Labor through the shipping reform bills process. Instead of attending the Prime Minister's Economic Forum, TTF CEO John Lee came to my electorate along with others, including Jayson Westbury, the CEO of the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, and John Hart, for CEO of Restaurant Catering Australia, to meet with our shadow Treasurer. They and the others who came to speak with the shadow Treasurer about managed investment trust withholding tax and the passenger movement charge know that the coalition will both listen to and act on their concerns. They were reassured by the shadow Treasurer's comments on the need for a stable, predictable and sensible approach to policy. They have seen him respond by arguing the case on managed investment trust withholding tax and the passenger movement charge. These are the two key concerns facing tourism and hospitality out of this year's budget. With these bills today, the government proposes to add to the cost of hotel management where a property is owned by a managed investment trust. According to Tourism Accommodation Australia, most MIT hotel investment in Australia is from Singapore and Malaysia and feedback from these investors is not good. According to John Lee, CEO of the TTF, the new tax impost in these bills will create instability and uncertainty for specific transactions. He says: It is bewildering that such a long-considered policy, we understand developed over 2½ to three years, would be changed overnight without consultation or regard for the potential ramifications for the hotel and investment industry. Minister Ferguson attended the National Tourism Alliance post-budget wrap-up with me the day after the budget was handed down. During the Q&A session he would have heard Rodger Powell of the Tourism Accommodation Association refer to advice from lawyers Baker & MCKenzie recommending: … non-residents holding Australian assets through MIT structures consider whether a MIT remains the appropriate structure for their investments in light of the government's decision.  week, in which he advises: MITs are the vehicle through with much of the investment in Australian accommodation occurs. The Government's inconsistency in doubling the tax on MITs at a time when Tourism Australia is broadening its remit by actively seeking foreign investment in the Australian tourism industry is alarming. You are, of course, well aware of the need for new investment in accommodation to ensure Australia is able to offer the travel experiences being demanded by our key tourist markets. The only way this can happen is by offering an attracting investment climate.  increasing the MIT withholding tax will: 1.Threaten existing projects and deter new investment in accommodation 2. Reduce tax revenue; 3. Damages Australia's reputation amongst foreign investors; 4. Increases Australia's reliance on foreign debt; 5. Undermines Australia's ability to serve as a regional financial hub; and 6. Scare off investors committed to long-term investments. Of course, Labor will highlight that the rate was 30 per cent under the coalition. However, the Howard government brought down a range of taxes relevant to tourism, whilst creating Tourism Australia and lifting its funding to its highest level. As my colleague Senator Cormann said on 29 May: Labor's zig-zag approach to withholding tax on Managed Investment Trusts has also yet again increased Australia's sovereign risk profile. The Gillard government has yet again managed to reduce the confidence of international investors in the stability and predictability of our taxation arrangements. More important than the rate per se is the paramount importance that we give to hotel investor confidence in their 10-year investment plans that they will not change on a whim. Howard had a plan to pay off Keating's $96 billion debt and provide assistance to business and individuals through easing tax pressures. Labor talks good when it comes to help meeting our Tourism 2020 targets which include boosting accommodation growth stock so that we can meet potential growth from China. As former Minister for Tourism Nick Sherry was quoted in a leading tourism industry publication Travel Weekly: Unlike other sectors of the economy, investment in the broad tourism industry has ""not been particularly good. Tourism Research Australia says investment growth in tourism is lagging behind the rest of the economy,"" been a struggle to reach investment growth of 2% a year which is insufficient. The stark reality is that there has been no meaningful addition to Australia's accommodation supply for a decade or more. Sherry was further quoted as saying: The sad fact is that much of Australia's accommodation is outmoded and outdated and Chinese visitors in particular ... are used modern facilities in their own country. There is a great challenge in tourism to invest in the modernisation of facilities. I urge the House-and particularly those members on the crossbenches to whom the tourism and hospitality industry looks for support-to consider the following facts: tourism's contribution to the Australian gross domestic product was $73.3 billion, or a 5.2 per cent share of the Australian economy. Total gross value added tourism was $69.1 billion, representing a 5.3 per cent share of the Australian economy. In Australia, tourism directly and indirectly employs 907,100 persons, representing 7.9 per cent of total Australian employment, and shrinking. Australians spent 130 million nights abroad in the year 2010. During its peak under the Howard government, Australian tourism made a profit of $3.584 billion. Next year the sector will stand to make a net loss of $8.7 billion. Since 2008, Australia has slipped from fourth to 13th place in the World Economic Forum Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index rankings. Let us look past the nonsense of this tax. I encourage the government to back down on this, as they are doing on the CPI aspect of the passenger movement charge. They need to understand the industry. They need to work with the industry. You actually create growth and investment by reducing taxes, not increasing taxes, on individuals and companies. That is why this part of the budget is an absolute farce and the Assistant Treasurer sitting opposite should recognise Sherry said. ""It's these facts.",52
22,Mr BRADBURY,COMMITTEES,"Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (11:41): Firstly I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. Schedule 1 amends the tax law to better protect workers entitlements to superannuation and to to very strengthen the obligations of company directors to help prevent fraudulent phoenix activity. The failure to withhold tax and pay superannuation amounts impacts all aspects of the economy. These amendments aim to ensure that compliant businesses and employees are not being disadvantaged by companies that fail to meet their obligations. Those opposite will say that they oppose this bill because the director penalty regime can apply to all directors whose companies fail to meet their obligations. What they fail to recognise, and what they fail to admit, is that the existing regime has applied this way for pay-as-you-go obligations since 1993 and for the entire time that they were in government. It is no surprise, of course, that those opposite are willing to come into this place and to vote against a bill that seeks to protect workers' entitlements. We know that they are not interested in the superannuation of hard working Australians. They opposed superannuation when it was first introduced and the now Leader of the Opposition is on the Hansard as having said that compulsory superannuation was the biggest con job ever foisted on the Australian people. They are strong words.",55
23,Mr Hockey,COMMITTEES,Why are we keeping it?,55
24,Mr BRADBURY,COMMITTEES,"The member opposite says, 'Why are we keeping it?' Well, one may well ask why they have so vociferously opposed this government's efforts to increase the superannuation entitlements of working people. Of course, we know that they have opposed and have voted against our plans to increase superannuation to 12 per cent. This for a 30-year-old worker on an average wage, under our reforms, will mean that they will retire with an extra $100,000 of retirement savings. And it should come as no surprise to any of us that, once again, we have the opposition, the member for North Sydney and his colleagues, coming into this place opposing workers' entitlements. I note that there are some references in the Australian Financial Review today to a speech that was given by Liberal senator, Senator Sinodinos, who has indicated that changes to industrial relations are on the coalition's agenda.",55
25,Mr Hockey,COMMITTEES,"They're on your agenda, too!",56
26,Mr BRADBURY,COMMITTEES,"The member opposite who interjects and protests so loudly was the handmaiden, the one who was left carrying the baby when it came to delivering and inflicting the pain upon the Australian working community that Work Choices ultimately delivered. They are the party of Work Choices. They come in here and they want to vote against workers' superannuation entitlements.",56
27,Mr Baldwin,COMMITTEES,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The same minister who stood up and asked me to be relevant to the debate has now strayed so far from the debate that I ask you to bring him to the point. Or does he not understand his own bills?",56
28,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES, There is no point of order. The member for Paterson was heard in silence,56
29,Mr Baldwin,COMMITTEES,That is not true.,56
30,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,In the time. I have been in the chair he was heard in silence. The member for Paterson will desist from interjecting and the Assistant Treasurer will be heard in silence.,56
31,Mr BRADBURY,COMMITTEES,"The bill very specifically and very clearly goes to the protection of superannuation entitlements of working people. That is what those opposite are voting against. They are voting against protections that we want to put in place that will ensure that a regime is in place that provides some accountability with respect to the provision of superannuation entitlements. It is a shameful thing. I can understand why the member for Paterson does not want to accept the fact that that is what he is voting against. When he was talking about the bill he preferred to focus on other parts of the bill. But it is no surprise that the opposition come into this place and launch a further attack on the entitlements of working people. Schedule 2 of the bill amends the taxation of financial arrangements, the TOFA regime, to ensure that the tax treatment of joining/consolidation events is consistent with the TOFA tax-timing rules and that financial assets and financial liabilities are treated symmetrically. Schedule 3 amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to modify the consolidation tax cost-setting rules. The changes are necessary to take away unexpected retrospective benefits arising from amendments to the consolidation regime that were made in 2010. There is an important point to make. Amendments were made in 2010 that provided retrospective benefits. These amendments merely recognise the fact that unanticipated and unintended benefits flowed from those amendments. It is widely recognised that it is appropriate to correct it to ensure that a more balanced outcome is achieved. These changes demonstrate the government's commitment to maintaining equity, fairness and integrity of our tax system. The changes implement recommendations made by the Board of Taxation for future consolidations and will ensure that companies inside consolidated groups do not receive tax benefits that companies outside consolidated groups are unable to receive. Following extensive consultation, the changes affecting a corporate acquisition will depend on the time when the acquisition took place. The changes affecting corporate acquisitions that took place before 12 May 2010 are necessary to ensure deductions are claimed only when it was intended and to protect a significant amount of revenue that would otherwise be at risk. Changes for the period between 12 May 2010 and 30 March 2011 will largely protect taxpayers who made business decisions on the basis of the current law, before the Board of Taxation was asked to review the law. For corporate acquisitions after 30 March 2011, the changes will increase certainty for taxpayers and will implement the board's recommendation to apply a business acquisition approach in certain cases. Those opposite talk about these changes to the consolidation regime, going back to the start of the regime in 2002. They say that they will oppose this bill, because taxpayers were right to act based on the law at that time. This reveals their complete ignorance about what these changes are actually doing. What they fail to understand is that under law at the time, between 2002 and 2010, taxpayers could not claim immediate deductions for what were essentially capital items, such as goodwill. The 2010 amendments changed this position. What we are now doing is taking away the unanticipated and unintended windfall gains arising from those changes. In fact, this bill confirms that consolidated groups will still be able to claim more deductions for those years between 2002 and 2010 than they would have been able to under the law as it stood when the coalition were last in government. Schedule 3 to this bill removes unintended windfalls from the 2010 changes that would provide consolidated groups with inappropriate tax benefits, benefits that are not available to companies and small businesses outside the consolidation regime. Taxpayers who did act on the law at the time, between 2010 and March 2011, are largely protected. Taxpayers who have written advice from the tax office or who have already finalised their tax returns are also protected. We are acting appropriately to protect the integrity and fairness of the tax system and to remove these unintended windfall gains. It is true that we need to backdate these changes to the start of their respective regimes. The government never takes lightly the decision to make retrospective changes but there are circumstances where retrospective legislation is justified. The Board of Taxation said that the 2010 changes went much further than was intended and the Australian parliament rightly considers each proposal for retrospective legislation on its merits. Like this case, this is generally only done where the law is operating in a manner inconsistent with the parliament's intention and where there is a significant risk of revenue loss. The revenue at risk here from the these unintended windfalls is definitely significant. This bill protects over $6 billion of revenue at risk. To demonstrate the lack of credibility of the opposition on this question of retrospectivity: they seek to come into this place and, whiter than the snow, suggest that they have never supported, and they never will support, retrospective legislation, particularly in the tax context. Do not have a look at what they say; have a look at what they did when they were in government. They introduced numerous measures, many of which were backdated by up to several years, in order to go back and ensure that the original intent of a policy was actually delivered, and there were numerous examples. This particular bill also seeks to protect the rights of working people, which they are seeking to oppose. In the very same week when these matters are being debated, when they come in and say that they never support retrospective legislation, when they have done that in the past, their New South Wales Liberal colleagues are supporting retrospectively ripping away the entitlements of workers with changes to the workers compensation scheme in New South Wales. So retrospectivity is something that they say they oppose, but when they were last in government they embraced it, where it was appropriate or where they deemed it to be appropriate, and in New South Wales this week we see them retrospectively ripping away the rights of working people. Do not listen to what they say; look at what they do. I will also be moving an amendment to remove schedule 4 to the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012, which will be introduced into parliament at a later date. I commend the bill to the House.",56

35,Mr HOCKEY,NOES," This is the third roll-back on the budget and we are six weeks in. It has been six weeks since the budget was delivered and this is the third change to a budget that has not even started. Aren't you embarrassed? You cannot hold a budget for six weeks! Company tax cuts back on the agenda, dumping the CPI increase on the passenger movement charge and now you are dumping your own tax increase on interest withholding tax. What sort of rabble are you guys? We used to joke that the Labor Party could not hold a policy NA from Lateline to lunchtime. Now you cannot hold a budget for six weeks. How embarrassing! Where is Swannie? Here he is! How do you feel about that? So much for the surplus.",59
36,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, The member for North Sydney will refer to individuals by their appropriate title.,59
37,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS,So much for the surplus that was promised. The member for Lindsay wrote to his constituents in a recent newsletter. He said: 'Guess what? We've delivered a surplus!' He said to his constituents,59
38,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for North Sydney needs to talk to the amendment.,59
39,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS,"I am talking to the amendment, Madam Deputy Speaker. The Labor Party is dumping and trashing its own budget and now, without any explanation whatsoever, the Labor Party amends a bill it introduces from the budget. They roll back the before they get a chance to roll forward. The Labor Party reduced interest withholding tax from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent and they are so committed to getting back to surplus they said, 'We're going to have to increase interest withholding tax to 15 per cent. But wait, there's more. We're going to pull it back. We're not going to tell you what we're gonna do.' This is the confusion. This is the indecision. This is the incompetence that has writ large of Labor in government. This is what the Labor Party is about: absolute total taxation incompetence and absolute total policy incompetence, whether it be the carbon tax or the mining tax or employee share schemes or the alcopops tax or company tax cuts, which the government was so determined to deliver that it dumped them when it came to the budget. But wait. The Prime Minister, in a moment of great revelation to the business community, came down from the top of the mountain and said: 'Our top priority is company tax cuts.' But then the Passenger Movement Charge, and today they are dumping the interest withholding tax changes.",59
40,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for North Sydney needs to come back to the amendment.,60

42,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The previous two were not; the previous discussion was.,60
43,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS,"It is the Labor Party dumping a key budget commitment to increase the tax on managed investment trusts, and today they are dumping it. The Assistant Treasurer has not even got the guts to explain why. So come on: the Assistant Treasurer should get up here now and explain why the Labor Party is dumping its own budget promise. Why is the Labor Party doing this? I thought this was your budget. The Treasurer stood up here six weeks ago and said this was a key component, and now the government is dumping and trashing its own budget. It is okay to dump a Labor leader, but your budget-come on, guys, what is this?",60
44,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for North Sydney is now straying.,60
45,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS,"But I am straying to the right place, Madam Deputy Speaker. The budget has not lasted six weeks and already there are three amendments. The Treasurer said solemnly at budget time that 'if there is anything that is going to affect our $1.5 billion surplus, you know what, we're going to increase taxes'. So far they have had three measures that have affected their $1.5 billion promised surplus. This is why you cannot trust Labor. This is why Australians believe the government is incompetent. Don't blame us for the negativity out there: it is all at the hands of the Labor Party. Now Assistant Treasurer, get up here and answer: why are you dumping your own budget today? ",60

50,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. He is now abusing the process of consideration in detail. This is consideration in detail; it is question time. There is no automatic right under the standing orders in consideration in detail for anyone to answer a question. The question is that the amendments be agreed to.,61
51,Mr ROBB,PAIRS," This amendment goes to the fact that this government has now compiled a litany of sovereign risk issues and this is another classic symbol to investors both in Australia and overseas that this is no longer a safe place, a stable place or an effective place in which they can trust investment dollars. There is a great onus on the Assistant Treasurer and the Treasurer to come to this dispatch box and explain why they would trash further our reputation as a safe and stable destiny for investment in this country. This is a government that has introduced a carbon tax against an iron cast commitment. They have introduced a mining tax with a level of incompetence that incomprehensible plus it is something that does not exist anywhere else in the world. They have handled the live cattle job in a way which has added to sovereign risk. They have introduced retrospective taxation in this very bill, more retrospective taxation. In doing so, they have again added to the litany of sovereign risk issues in this country.",61
52,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," Order! The member for Goldstein has the call. Could people who are having conversations around the room, please go outside. This is the parliament and the member for Goldstein has the right to be heard in silence.",61
53,Mr ROBB,PAIRS,"Thanks, Madam Deputy Speaker. I suspect the conversation reflects the attitude that is now prevailing across the community. No-one can take anything that this government is doing seriously. People not have made up their minds. There is a level of crisis of confidence, and no-one is prepared to engage. Even their own backbench, their own front-bench, have not got the commitment to engage in these sorts of substantive issues. Even the Assistant Treasurer has spent most of his time jawboning-probably about football or something else. These issues are not taken seriously, yet they have caused an amazing crisis of confidence in this country. It is absolutely critical that a decision such as the doubling of the withholding tax on investment funds-a decision that some four years ago received great commendation from both us and investors around the world-now without any explanation, they increased it. Now without one scintilla of explanation, they are going to dump it. What other deals are going on behind the scenes? What more responsibility can you have than to explain is the actions that you have taken? You have dumped measures in this budget. If you put it together with yesterday's decision on the indexation of the departure tax, we are now talking a $400 million hole in the budget. What was the surplus? $1.5 billion. What have they now in the space of 12 hours sacrificed? $400 million. Could you explain, Assistant Treasurer, where you are going to get that $400 million to deliver the $1.5 billion surplus? Nearly one-third of the surplus has gone as a consequence of two decisions taken in less than 24 hours. More than one-third of the surplus is gone. What a joke! And now on the front page of the Financial Review the Reserve Bank is saying that the surplus is worth the paper it is written on, that the whole thing is a series of money shuffles. What has everyone been saying? Exactly that. And now we have the Reserve Bank saying that not only was this budget never an accurate account; this government is even making that case worse; $400 million has gone out of their budget literally in the last 12 hours. Now we have, on top of that, an addition to the great sovereign risk that government has created, with endless decisions, and this final one, this one of dumping the 7½ per cent and increasing to 15 per cent the withholding tax. We need an answer to this. The Assistant Treasurer cannot just sit there with a bland look on his face. Come to this dispatch box and tell us why. Give us one reason why you would dump this, why you would create a black hole in your budget surplus?",61
54,Mr BRADBURY,PAIRS,Lindsay-Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (12:15): The government is not abandoning or dumping anything. The government remains committed to the managed investment trust withholding tax arrangements that were outlined and proposed in the budget. We will be separately reintroducing those measures as part of a separate bill. In relation to the matters that are being raised,62
55,Mr Robb,PAIRS,At 15 per cent?,62
56,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, The member for Goldstein has had his opportunity.,62
57,Mr BRADBURY,PAIRS,"The member opposite says 'at 15 per cent'. He should remember that when they were on the government benches, the rate was 30 per cent; not 15 per cent, not 7½ per cent, but 30 per cent. They came into this place-I remember the debate well-the member for Casey came in here and started quoting some of my comments. I not remember it well. I said that we need to make sure that we have a competitive rate, and we will have a competitive rate. Once these amendments are passed-and I am confident that they will be passed by the parliament-then we will have a competitive rate. At 15 per cent we will be competitive. It is exactly the same rate as Japan and the United States; and the UK is 20 per cent. But, most this importantly, our rate will be very competitive with the rate that existed when they were last in government-30 per cent. It will be much better than that. So, on the question of the competitiveness of the rate, we are confident that there will not be any difficulties. The member for North Sydney in his haste-amid all the hyperbole that we often get, the huff and puff and the bluster that we get from him in this place-started talking about interest withholding. That demonstrates that he either does not get it, he does not realise that we are talking about withholding tax rates in respect of distributions from managed investment trusts-distributions, not interest-or he has not read the bill. I am not sure which of the two it is. People can go back and have a look at the Hansard if they like and have a look at some of the comments that he made there, which betrayed a fundamental lack of understanding about the key measure. He does not know the difference between interest and a distribution from a managed investment trust. He wants to hold himself out as the alternative Treasurer, but he cannot get a fundamental issue like that right. It is no wonder he has a $70 billion black hole. Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (12:18): At last the admiral speaks",62
58,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," The member for Casey will withdraw and refer to members appropriately. Mr TONY SMITH: I withdraw. It took the Assistant Treasurer four occasions, in a government dealing with a tax bill, to answer a question on an amendment that he moved. The shadow Treasurer asked him on three occasions to justify why this amendment has been moved. The shadow minister for finance had to ask him. But the default position of this Assistant Treasurer is to sit there at the dispatch box in this parliament and say nothing. That speaks volumes about the Assistant Treasurer's incompetence and the incompetence of this government on tax policy generally. The government made a great fanfare four years ago of the fact that they had cut rate to 7½ per cent. They were like a band of brothers, they were better than anyone else, and the reason they did that was they wanted to send a signal to the international community that Australia would be a financial services hub and this is where they wanted people to invest. They also made the point that they needed to take that step to show that we were different. They made the point that you could not tinker around or muck around with this. As the shadow minister for finance rightly pointed out-and nothing illustrates it more than their conduct and their actions on this issue-the signal this government has sent time after time on tax policy is uncertainty. They have sent uncertainty right around the globe. Even when they change their minds, they cannot explain it. The Assistant Treasurer sits at that dispatch box with the shadow Treasurer asking him for a simple explanation of why they have moved an amendment to delete an entire schedule from their bill, an entire schedule that was a major budget announcement just six weeks ago. And the Assistant Treasurer in this government says nothing for three occasions. That was his default position; like a battery operated kid's toy run out of batteries. Maybe the parliamentary secretary at the table changed the batteries. Sitting there with a glum look on his face. There might be an explanation. Let's give him a break. Perhaps the shadow finance minister has been too hard on him. Perhaps he does not know why the amendment has been moved in his name. The one thing this Assistant Treasurer can do is go around Australia on this issue and he can say, 'Whatever your position is, I have adopted it at some point in time.' He came into this House four years ago, and proudly advocated the 7½ per cent and said why that this tax was important and he introduced the legislation to double it. As I said earlier in the debate, this is an important part of the government's budget, as the shadow finance minister pointed out. I do not think you will find it in the Treasurer's budget speech, though. That is the best indication of any significant measure the government is moving that they think might be unpopular; just like the time the Treasurer forgot to mention the debt and deficit. It was only when the shadow finance minister spoke after the shadow Treasurer had spoken three times that the Assistant Treasurer was prompted to get up in the debate-not to tell us, but to tell the public and the parliament. Here in the House of Representatives we have an Assistant Treasurer who will not explain and will not talk. I will tell you why: it is because he is not sure that it will not change again. And he meekly says that they will be introducing separate legislation. Finally, when pushed, he talked about 15 per cent being competitive. I would like him to confirm that the separate legislation will be 15 per cent. I think the international community would like to know from the Assistant Treasurer what today's policy position is. As the shadow minister pointed out, uncertainty is toxic in the international community. The Assistant Treasurer will not take the word of the shadow finance minister-I know that-but he ought to take the word of international investors: people like David Denison, the President and CEO of the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board. Mr Denison said: ... in fact, Australia's budget that was tabled week effectively doubled the tax burden on our real estate and infrastructure holdings in that country. (Time expired)",63
59,Mr FLETCHER,PAIRS," I am pleased to rise in the consideration in detail stage of this bill to seek some further clarification from the Assistant Treasurer as to precisely what the government is doing here. As all in this House would be aware, at this stage of the process the opportunity is presented for ministers at the table to explain to the chamber the details of the merits of the particular amendments that are being moved by the government. It tends to raise eyebrows when the government is moving amendments to its own legislation at this late stage. It tends to suggest that it is a government that is making things up on the run. It tends to suggest that it is a government that is not certain that it is able to deliver what it is seeking to deliver, because of the need to engage in constant negotiation with the Independents. Unfortunately, what goes on in this chamber has enormous implications for the economy of Australia, for the financial services sector of Australia and for international investors who are considering investing in our country. It is an uncontentious proposition-it is shared by all here in the chamber-that the rate of withholding tax is a question of the highest importance in determining the incentives for foreign investors to invest in Australia. That was the basis on which the government announced changes to its policy some years ago. That has been the basis on which questions have been raised about the policy change announced with not very much fanfare during the budget recently. We now find ourselves, here in the House of Representatives-the people's houselast weighing up, as we are charged to do, the merits of legislation put before the House by the government, particularly the merits of a specific amendment put before the House now by the government. We find ourselves charged with assessing the merits of a particular amendment, when it is very difficult to understand the full intent of what is proposed. Let us remind ourselves that the government in its budget announced that there would be a change in the withholding tax for these kinds of vehicles-managed investment trusts-which are, as we all know, of the first importance as a vehicle for foreign investment into Australia. The Treasurer announced on budget night that this withholding tax would increase from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. As we all know, that was consistent with a budgetary strategy of seeking to return the budget to surplus. That is an aspiration with which we can all agree, even if, on this side of the House, we entertain very serious doubts as to the government's capacity to deliver on that stated aspiration. We now find that an element of the strategy laid out by the Treasurer only a few weeks ago which was going to be used by the government to achieve its stated objective of a surplus of approximately $1.5 billion is, by virtue of the amendment put before the House this afternoon by the Assistant Treasurer, going to be removed. That is to say, the measure which the Treasurer announced only a few weeks ago, under which the withholding tax rate will increase with a view to securing additional revenue for the Commonwealth, is now to be removed. Yet we have no clear explanation as to why that is happening. We have no clear explanation as to what the implications are for the budget and the achievement of that promised $1.5 billion surplus. We have no clear indication as to whether the government is now abandoning its policy of increasing the withholding tax rate and we have no clear demonstration of a government calmly and consistently implementing a strategy. On the contrary, we have all the indicators of a government making it up in a panicked rush as it goes along, apparently impervious to the disastrous implications that that has for confidence in the Australian economy on the part of foreign investors. So I repeat the question to the Assistant Treasurer which has been put by colleagues on this side of the House: what on earth is going on here? Please give us an explanation.",64
60,Mr BUCHHOLZ,PAIRS," I rise in this consideration in detail debate in absolute amazement as to why we cannot get a simple answer out of the Assistant Treasurer. I, too, ask the question: why? I think the whole principle of this comes back to trust. Managed investment trusts make a conscious decision to come into our country to invest. As a nation we are net importers of capital. We are net importers of funds. They have been a fundamental building block in creating the quality of life that we have. In the Standing Committee on Economics hearings we took evidence from Martin Cordina of the Financial Services Council. This may help in understanding why the government has chosen to offer the amendment today. In response to a question at the hearing, Mr Cordina said: We were disappointed that we were not consulted prior to the announcement being made on budget night. This bloke is from the Financial Services Council. Whenever I have the opportunity to take evidence from the Taxation Office or from Treasury, their words are always: 'We have consulted extensively with the market. We have consulted with industry.' Guess what-industry did not have a clue that this was coming. Mr Codina went on to say: Since this government came into office in 2007, we have issued something like 10 media releases which were supportive of subsequent changes that have been made, either to our tax system or regulatory-wise, that essentially had their origins in the Johnson review. We were one of the leading participants in the Johnson review, involved in much of the work that was conducted there. So I guess all I can say is … in this area, that the announcement was made without any prior consultation. So here you have it-Martin Codina from the Financial Services Council saying that they were not aware that we were going to see, overnight, a doubling of the rate, from 7½ per cent to 15 per cent. We are asking the Assistant Treasurer why. When you listen to the rest of the evidence provided by Mr Codina, it becomes crystal clear. He was asked: Is there any evidence for that flight of capital occurring? That was asked by a member of the government, and he was inquiring whether or not, if there were an increase from 7½ to 15 per cent, there would be a flight of capital out of this country. Mr Codina replied: There is absolutely evidence of that. Collectively we have quantified in excess of $1 billion, some of which has been made public and some of which is highly sensitive, because of the nature of the foreign investors. In some cases you have sovereign funds-in other words, it would be akin to a foreign government being critical of the Australian government as a consequence of the change. When you look at the wafer-thin budget surplus that has been forecast and when the Financial Services Council of Australia-a body not to be dismissed or taken lightlyhave identified in good faith a potential flight of $1 billion of capital out of this country, is no wonder these guys are now standing up and saying, a couple of weeks after the budget, 'We got it wrong,' and that we are now having to make amendments. All we need is for the Assistant Treasurer to stand up and answer our question as to why, because it does come back to trust. Foreign investment in this country is raised on the back of us providing good government. What happens in this room fundamentally underpins the confidence of foreign investment markets in our nation-it is what happens in this room, the way we carry ourselves, our integrity. Business confidence is at an all-time low. Do not take my word for it; have a look at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and IndustryWestpac survey for the last 17 consecutive quarters. The biggest inhibitors of investment in business at the moment are government taxes and red tape. We in this room need to get it right. The shadow Treasurer needs to get to his feet and explain the backflip made a couple of weeks after the budget, because we have to gain the trust of other nations-they have to know they can depend on us-if we want investment in this nation.",65
61,Mr BRIGGS,PAIRS," Madam Deputy Speaker, thank you. I appreciate you recognising me in this debate. Mr Bradbury interjecting",66
62,Mr BRIGGS,PAIRS,"Sorry, Parliamentary Secretary, I was just being polite.",66
63,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," Thank you, Member for Mayo.",66
64,Mr BRIGGS,PAIRS,"The Deputy Speaker is doing a terrific job in current circumstances and I think being polite to someone doing their job in these circumstances as well as she is doing deserves that. I congratulate her for it. Deputy Speaker, while your circumstances, acting in this position, are it unique, this is also a unique event in the history of this House-a budget unravelling before our eyes, a budget which was only delivered some six weeks ago, in the current parliamentary session. The normal procedure of bills following the budget to implement the measures announced on budget night by the Treasurer is unravelling, without explanation. I think it is extraordinary of the Assistant Treasurer, who is not known for not wanting to talk and explain the government's views or his own views on things like immigration policy up near Darwin. In fact, he is such a detailed researcher that he looks in great detail into issues which affect his constituency. We know during the last election he took the trouble to travel all the way to Darwin to see about the situation in relation to",66
65,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The member for Mayo will return to the amendment.,66
66,Mr BRIGGS,PAIRS,"That said, I am utterly surprised that on this occasion",66
67,Mr Bradbury,PAIRS,How did that FOI request go?,66
68,Mr BRIGGS,PAIRS,"We are still working through it, David. On this occasion we are utterly surprised that he has decided not to explain to the House why the government's budget is unravelling in front of us. Why is it? The most important statement that a Treasurer can make, arguably-in effect, Australia's own version of the state of the union speech-made just six weeks ago, is now falling apart before us, without explanation. We know there are lots of discussions going on privately within the government. We just saw that in the chamber during the division-lots of small chats and quiet discussions working out what to do next. Obviously this is happening with their budget as well. On budget night, the Treasurer announced a plan to deliver a surplus. He did not a surplus. He delivered a plan to deliver a surplus-unlike the misleading information being sent to some constituents around the country, which I find very concerning, that they have delivered a surplus. Of course, the Australian Labor Party has not delivered a surplus for 20 years, so the member for Lindsay in his capacity as the local member is telling his electorate that is of course wrong. And now we have this bill, this backdown, without explanation",66
69,Mr Bradbury,PAIRS,It's a fantastic piece of material-you ought to have a look at it.,67
70,Mr BRIGGS,PAIRS,"I will get a copy and have a look at it, and I will give it good consideration from my own material, because we on our side know what it is like to deliver a surplus. Nine out of 11 budgets under the Howard-Costello government were surplus budgets. That is why we left you money in the bank, Assistant Treasurer Bradbury. Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, you were here when Peter Costello was Treasurer. You remember those days very fondly, I know. You would remember that Peter Costello, when he announced a budget, followed through with the budget. He put the bills into the parliament, followed them through and had them delivered in the face of unrelenting opposition from the Labor Party, which opposed every decent measure. He delivered the budget. He did not come into this place, or send his Assistant Treasurer into this place, to unwind budget revenue measures without explanation. Why is it that this measure, which was announced on budget night, is being unwound without explanation? This is a very important question because it gets to confidence in the budget and to the ability of the government to deliver its surplus. Will the government have enough money to deliver its surplus? deliver Will foreign investors know what the withholding rate will be when they invest in our country? We need this investment to help develop our great country even further. These are important questions. The Assistant Treasurer-soon to be shadow Assistant Treasurer-has announced that there will be another piece of legislation. What will be in that legislation? Answer us that question. Will the revenue be the same? Give us an explanation-that is all we ask. (Time expired)",67
71,Mr HARTSUYKER,PAIRS," May I commend you, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, on the very fine job you are doing in the chair since your ascension to this high office. I look at these amendments to the Tax Laws Amendment (2012 Measures No. 2) Bill 2012 with some amazement. On page 65, lines 1 to 21 were written and printed only weeks ago. The ink is barely dry on this document and we have an amendment to the government's own budget. The ink is barely dry on the legislation and the government is amending it. What does that say to the Australian people? It says that we have a government that lacks the competency to implement the budget that it handed down just back in May. One of the really interesting things about that budget night was looking around the galleries when the Treasurer was delivering the budget. What did we see? We saw galleries that were half empty for the Treasurer's speech. I have never seen that before. I have never seen a Treasurer deliver a budget where he could not even fill the galleries. I think that is because the Australian people have no confidence in this Treasurer. They have no confidence in this government. The fact that this amendment is being put before this House to effectively rescind a proposal within the government's own budget-delivered only six weeks ago-shows the lack of competence in this government. It shows the lack of ability of this government to maintain a policy position. It shows the lack of ability of government to follow through and provide the sort of certainty that the Australian people need. These amendments are a worry not only because they rescind a measure announced in the budget but also because they reflect the wider competence of this government, and that is why consumer confidence is so low. That is why business confidence is so low. The Australian people lack confidence in this government. It is quite astounding. We have had the promise: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead,' and no sooner did the Prime Minister get into office than-what do you know?-the government changed its mind. In this case, we have a proposal to change the withholding tax contained within the budget and only weeks later the government has changed its mind. How can business plan for the future when we have a government that cannot maintain a position for more than a few weeks? Australian business needs to make long-term decisions based on sound policy and we have a government that is doing backflip after backflip on its own budget document. That is hardly inspiring the sort of confidence that Australian business needs to make the investments that are going to drive future jobs and employment within this country. No wonder small business is doing it tough. No wonder the customers are not coming through the door. They are concerned about the competence of this government. They are concerned about the fact that they cannot rely on the word of this government, the Prime Minister or the Assistant Treasurer. I think the Assistant Treasurer will go down as Nostradamus: being able to forecast and claim a budget surplus when he has not delivered it. He is, indeed, showing up Nostradamus, because this we will not know whether this government has delivered a budget surplus. It has so far delivered the four biggest deficits in this nation's history. Now we have the Assistant Treasurer already claiming a surplus, but we are not going to know whether that surplus is delivered until September next year. I do not know that the electors of Lindsay will accept this rather Nostradamus-like prediction that this government is going to deliver a surplus. We see the sorts of measures contained in this amendment eroding the very surplus that this government is claiming to be able to deliver over the next financial year when the Australian people have no faith in that at all. They do not have confidence in this government. They do not have confidence in the ability of this government to maintain a policy position. They are certainly showing that they are concerned about this economy through poor consumer confidence and poor business confidence, and this government is at fault on all counts.",67
72,Mr KEENAN,PAIRS," On the Australian political landscape there is one big set piece speech given every year and that is when the government brings down its budget. The budget is the most important document that any government brings down. It outlines the government's priorities and where expenditure is going to be. It really is a blueprint for how the government is going to govern in the following year. Indeed, it is a blueprint for how the government is going to govern in the following few years after that as well. It is a vitally important document. If I cast my mind back to the budgets for which I have been in this parliament, the idea of Prime Minister Howard or Treasurer Costello bringing down a budget which they would subsequently amend would be completely and utterly unthinkable. Unfortunately, the unthinkable has become the norm under this incompetent Labor government. We are debating a bill here today and, astonishingly, the next bill we are debating is going to show the government moving to amend its own budget document within 1½ months of that document being brought down. I think a government that cannot bring down a budget",68
73,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," I remind the member for Stirling that this is consideration in detail on the amendment before the chair. I have allowed a very wide-ranging debate, but we do need to get back to what is before the chair, which is the amendment we are now debating.",69
74,Mr KEENAN,PAIRS,"I appreciate that, and I am dealing with the withholding tax on managed investment trusts. I am concerned about the fact that we have a government that is unable to produce a document for the Australian people which is supposed to outline its priorities, which is supposed to outline where the expenditure is for the coming year and for the forward estimates period, which is supposed to provide some certainty for both domestic investors and international investors. When a government cannot do that, you really have to wonder whether it has forfeited the right to continue to govern. I think that this bill and other debates we will be having in this parliament later on today are a great indicator for the Australian people that minority government is a failed experiment.",69
75,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"The member for Stirling is now straying considerably from the amendment before the chair. I have allowed a wide-ranging debate, but this is an amendment and the bill cannot be canvassed again, nor can whole ranges of things. It is a very defined piece of legislation we are looking at.",69
76,Mr KEENAN,PAIRS,"I am looking at the amendment, but I am doing so within the broader context of the government.",69
77,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,You actually cannot. That is my ruling.,69
78,Mr KEENAN,PAIRS,I will restrict my remarks specifically to the amendment as per your instructions.,69
79,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,I thank the member for Stirling for his candour.,69
80,Mr KEENAN,PAIRS,"I do believe it is important to establish the context in which we are having this debate today. What is very important is that a government can set a course and stick to it. It is important that they can provide certainty for investors in Australia. What business needs when it comes to making investment decisions, the time frames of which can sometimes be years or even decades out, is knowledge that when a government gives its undertakings about what is going to happen, those undertakings will actually be delivered. When you have a government that cannot even deliver a budget document six weeks after it has been brought down, clearly that investment climate is being sabotaged. Sovereign risk is a very important issue. It is not one which investors in Australia traditionally would need to be concerned that about. Something that we as a country have been able to go out and sell as one of the vital parts of the investment climate in Australia is the fact that, when you invest in Australia, you are not subject to the types of sovereign risk that you would be subject to if you were investing in other parts of the world. That reputation for stability is being trashed by this government. It is being trashed by the fact that they cannot hold onto a budget document for even six weeks after it has been brought down. It has been trashed by the fact that the Assistant Treasurer cannot even today give some certainty to investors about what is going to happen going forward with this particular measure. It has been trashed by the other measures that the government has taken to destroy the investment climate in Australia. You wonder why consumer confidence is low in Australia. You wonder why people who have the money are not prepared to invest it. This amendment we are discussing here today is a great example of why. This government cannot even bring down a budget and hold on to it for six weeks. This is the greatest indication that minority government has failed, and the only way to address that is via an election. Mr VAN MANEN (Forde) (12:48): As the previous speakers have touched on, once again we see the government succeeding in adding to the uncertainty in the business community rather than adding to certainty. As I touched on in my earlier speech, one of the key things that has allowed us to grow our economy well over the past 20 or 25 years is some certainty and understanding about the direction of tax policy. Again we see a schedule or bill put up to double the rate on managed investment trusts and all of a sudden have it pulled. As numerous speakers have asked, where is the explanation from the Assistant Treasurer? Why can the government not explain the rationale?",69
81,Mr Bradbury,PAIRS,Weren't you in the chamber when I spoke? Did you listen? Mr VAN MANEN: It was no explanation. Mr Bradbury interjecting,70
82,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS, The member for Forde has the call and will speak to the amendment before the chair. Mr VAN MANEN: This removal of this schedule and the inability for this government to stick to its plans is adding continually to the uncertainty in the business community and the international community that is looking to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in this country over the coming years in the mining industry and in a number of other areas.,70
83,Mr Lyons,PAIRS,You told us the mining industry was going to die! They went out and bought shares! Mr VAN MANEN: I did not say the mining industry was going to,70
84,Mr Lyons,PAIRS,"Yes you did. Mr VAN MANEN: How many shares have you guys bought in the clean energy companies? None. That is how confident you are about the clean energy market. The hypocrites sit over there. But let me get back to this. It is another backflip of this government and the trashing of the budget. We see $400 million being removed from the surplus that we are supposed to see in September 2013, tax yet there is no explanation of how that is going to be made up and what the rationale is for pulling it out of this bill and seeking to maybe reintroduce it at some point in time. There is no certainty about when it is going to be reintroduced or what tax rate it is going to be reintroduced at. It is just another of the myriad examples of the inability of this government to create certainty and a clear direction for the future of this country and the future of our economy. In addition, we have seen the retrospective nature of a number of things proposed in bills last night and again today. It is just a sad indictment the failure of this government to engender any confidence in our economy for the future.",70
85,Mr HARTSUYKER,PAIRS," I certainly welcome the opportunity to speak again on this amendment, because it does raise an area of concern for me with the issue of certainty. It is a matter that I have previously, in an earlier contribution, but that cannot be reinforced too much, because when you look at markets they are adversely affected by a lack of confidence. This amendment before the House today can only reduce the confidence that exists in our financial markets and the confidence with which foreign investors will view this country. Heaven forbid! We have a situation where Australian consumers have virtually given up hope and Australian business is losing hope, and now we want to encourage overseas investors in Australia to lose hope as well. That is a very worrying trend-all because this government cannot maintain a policy position from budget day to the present. The ink was barely dry on this document, and they are already making amendments. It shows a lack of competence. It goes to the very heart of the problems that have beset this government since it was first elected. When the Australian people have lost faith and international investors are losing faith, what does that leave us with? It leaves us with a very poor outcome for the people of Australia. This government is charged with the responsibility of governing wisely for all Australians. What we have is a government that governs incompetently on its own behalf. It is governing for the Australian Labor Party rather than for the people of Australia. It is incompetent in the extreme. It cannot manage its own budgetary process, as we see now. Not only does it run up massive deficits; it cannot even manage the budgetary of process, let alone the finances of Australia. We have seen you cannot manage the finances of Australia, and now we find you cannot even manage the budget process. That is, I think, a new low point in public administration, even by this government's already low standards. But we do have some optimism. We have raised the member for Lindsay, the Assistant one Treasurer, doing his Nostradamus impression and claiming a surplus 13, 14 or 15 months before we are going to know what the outcome is. That is a very brave and very courageous minister-to claim a surplus now, Nostradamus, when you do not have one shred of proof or evidence based on your past performance that you are actually going to deliver a surplus. So we have the Australian people and Australian business in a state of dismay at the performance of this government, we now have overseas investors disillusioned as a result of the performance of this government, and they still try to claim somehow that they can maintain some shred of credibility in the economic community or the international community. I think that that is pure delusion. We have a government that has failed the test. It has failed the test in relation to delivering a balanced budget over the time that this government has been in power. It has failed the test with regard to the degree of competency that is required in the budget process. It has failed the test with regard to the need for consistency of policy announcement and policy implementation. This is a government that has failed spectacularly. It is a government that continues to fail, and it is of great concern to the Australian people. That is why this amendment is so significant. It goes to the very heart of the lack of confidence in this government and this minister, who is boldly predicting a surplus that he has little prospect of delivering.",71
86,Mr Keenan,PAIRS,At least he's optimistic.,72
87,Mr HARTSUYKER,PAIRS,"Yes, at least he is optimistic-thank you, Shadow Minister. He is at least optimistic. That is more than can be said for the Australian people and Australian business, who have lost faith in this government. I know that as time goes on the continued failings of this government, unfortunately, are only going to grow and grow and grow. The people of Australia will have their chance to decide on their level of competence at the next election.",72
88,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS, I am surprised that the Assistant Treasurer has not explained yet why the government has decided to go down this path and pull this particular measureMr Bradbury interjecting,72
89,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS,"No, the government simply moved an amendment to its own bill. He has not explained, after all the encouragement we have given him. We want to encourage you, old sunshine! We want him to get up there and tell the truth. Let the sun shine in-that is what we say. Let there be a transparent hung parliament. Let the Independents-like the member for Lyne, the member for New England and the member for Denison-come in and help the sun to shine, because now the government is amending its own bill and it will not tell us why. Oh, dear. Do you know why? He does not know why. He does not know why they are amending their own bill. Given that we have had five assistant treasurers in 4½ years, you would think that by the time they get to the fifth they would get it right. But no. We have him coming to this place. Old Swannie has wheeled him out. He said, 'You go out and do it, Admiral. You tell them that we're pulling this out of the bill.' The old admiral, taking instructions from the 'chief of defence', says, 'Righto, sir. I'll do it.'",72
90,Mr Lyons,PAIRS,"Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the member for North Sydney referred to the Assistant Treasurer as something other than his proper title, and I ask him to withdraw.",72

95,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS,"From our perspective obviously we welcome the government dumping this initiative but we are not sure they are dumping it, because they have flagged now they are going to reintroduce it.",72
96,Mr Bradbury,PAIRS,We are not dumping it.,72
97,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS,The minister interjects 'we are not dumping it'. So what is it going to be? What is the interest withholding tax going to be? Mr Bradbury interjecting,72
98,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS,Say it in the chamber now. What is it going to be?,72
99,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,The question is that the amendments be agreed to. Mr Bradbury interjecting,72
100,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS,"The minister is interjecting across the table that he said it all. I invite him to get up again and say it so that not only the whole of Australia can hear it but, most importantly, so all those international investors can hear it. I have just been handed a press release from TTF Australia. TTF Australia was headed by Chris Brown, who was well known to the Labor Party-he was even a member of the Labor Party. It is now headed by Mr John Lee, the brother of Michael Lee. I would not necessarily say John Lee was a card-carrying member of the Liberal Party. In fact, I seriously doubt he is anything other than a card-carrying member of the Labor Party. Perhaps he has torn up his card because he says that the decision not to proceed with a doubling of the withholding tax rate for managed investment trusts will go some way, not all the way, to restoring foreign investor confidence. He said: The proposal to double the withholding tax rate for managed investment trusts stopped foreign investment in tourism in its tracks. That is exactly what we said. As investors were suddenly facing a tax bill twice the size jeopardising their returns. This announcement in the federal budget came as a complete surprise to industryit has obviously come as a complete surprise to the Assistant Treasurer as wellas there was no consultation on this issue despite repeated requests for any changes to at least be flagged with the sector. It also flew in the face of the release less week earlier of the tourism investment guide, which detailed 100 investment opportunities to improve Australia's tourism product offering. Following consultation with members, TTF raised its concerns about the impact this would have on tourism investment and has been actively pursuing this issue with MPs. This is the part-get ready ladies and gentlemen-where he said: Thanks must go to the coalition for its recognition of the impact this measure has caused and will continue to cause in the future. This is from a strong Labor member. While some damage has been done to Australia's reputation as an investment destination, the decision not to proceed with doubling the withholding tax rate will help to restore investor confidence and renew interest in Australian tourism products. We welcome this amendment because it dumps it. But you know what? The Assistant Treasurer now says it is not dumped. He now says it is coming back. What is it? Is it morning or night or afternoon or evening? I do not understand where the Labor Party is going. But what I do understand is it is not the Liberal Party, Tony Abbott, Joe Hockey or Andrew Robb who are raising these concerns; it is in fact the Ivan Glasenbergs, the Marius Kloppers and the Jac Nassers. It is the Gerry Harveys, the John Symons and the John Singletons and now the John Lees. These are the people who, by their own words, are saying this government is incompetent. This is a government that is inconsistent. This is a government that simply does not understand that what investors are crying out for are stability and certainty and predictability and reliability. So when the Treasurer stands at the dispatch box and gives a budget speech, Australia and the than a world do not expect that within six weeks three key components of the budget will be dumped before the financial year has even started. And yet our Prime Minister has the gall to go overseas and give them a sermon on the mount about the Australian way. The Australian way, as Labor defines it, is to have three different policies in three days and to have a budget that does not last six weeks. It is their policy to dump and rebirth leaders from time to time and now it is their policy to add to the sovereign risk of investment in Australia. So I say to you: do not start giving us a lecture about negativity. Do not give us a lecture about poor consumer confidence. Do not give us a lecture about poor business confidence. It comes back directly to the actions of this incompetent government, a government that cannot hold the policy, a government that cannot be consistent, a government that deliberately intentionally misleads people when it comes to core policy responsibilities of a day-today government in Australia. Shame, Labor, shame! Shame on you for being incompetent. Get out of the way and give us an election so we can give Australia a predictable, stable, reliable and trustworthy government again.

106,Mr KEENAN,BILLS," Hot on the heels of the government's backdown, where it has just moved to amend its own budget, this is the second time today that it will move to do exactly the same thing. It is extraordinary that we are now in a position within this minority government that six weeks after they bring down what is supposed to be the seminal document outlining their priorities for the coming year that we are debating in this chamber for the second time today moves by the government to amend its own document. In this case we are dealing with the increase in the passenger movement charge, which is really just another dodgy tax that they are using to try to cobble together this dodgy surplus that nobody in their right mind believes they will ever achieve. In this case, they are doing two things. They are increasing the passenger movement charge by $8, from $47 to $55, which means that since the Labor Party came to office they have increased that particular tax by 45 per cent. They are also doing something that concerns the coalition greatly, and which we have moved successfully to get them to cease: they were going to link this particular tax for an annual increase every single year to the CPI. The extra tax on the tourism industry would be indexed to CPI. Every year under the government's proposals announced in their budget-which of course they are slowly abandoning-we were going to see an annual increase on the tourism industry, an increase that was going to affect an industry already struggling because of the lack of confidence in the Australian economy and other factors such as the high Australian dollar. We did not think that was fair and we did not think it was justified, we joined with the tourism industry to get that measure stopped. We would have loved to have knocked off this measure completely. The coalition parties do not believe in tax increases. We do not believe in making life harder for small businesses such as those small businesses in the tourism industry. But unfortunately we are faced with the reality of Labor's wasteful spending where they have wasted moneybillions of dollars on pink batts, billions of dollars on their border protection debacle, tens of billions of dollars in mailing cheques out to people through the second stimulus package-and because of the wasted money and the appalling fiscal situation that Labor has now got Australia into, we were faced with a situation where we did not think it was feasible to stop the increase from $47 to $55. If we were in government though, this would not be happening. We would not be levying extra taxes on small business. We would not be levying extra taxes on the tourism industry. We would not need to be doing so because we would not have wasted the money that has forced the government to take these measures in the first place. The government is now reaping what it has sown. The fact that it cannot control its expenditure, the fact that it has wasted so much money, means that it has to run around finding these sorts of savings and increasing these sorts of taxes in a way that the people who are subject to them can ill afford. I would like to commend the tourism industry for taking this stand against this particular tax. They launched a campaign called Stop Taxing Tourism and they showed that the industry has had it up to here with the incompetence of this Labor government. I particularly acknowledge the Tourism and Transport Forum, the Australian Federation and of Travel Agents, the National Tourism Alliance and the Australian Tourism Export Council for their excellent advocacy on behalf of the industries they represent; for saying, 'The tourism industry is doing it hard; we cannot afford these extra taxes,' and for joining with the coalition in trying to get these taxes stopped. They are also outraged that they have been lied to yet again by this government. This government has a problem with the truth. Increasing this tax is just another grievous example. As recently as 2 March 2012, at a full board meeting of the National Tourism Alliance, the Minister for Tourism told the industry that there would be no increase in the passenger movement charge. Two months later this became yet another broken Labor promise. Sadly, this is a government with a very long history of deceiving the Australian people on everything from the carbon tax to border protection. The tourism sector is particularly worried about the introduction of the carbon tax. one of Australia's most exposed industries with Australian Tourism Export Council modelling showing cumulative electricity prices will go up as much as 30 per cent. Labor has refused to model the impact of the carbon tax on the tourism industry. The change that the opposition are championing here today will at least give this industry some much needed relief by knocking off this budget measure. The reasons the coalition is proposing to knock off this CPI indexation are many. We do not believe it is a good way of making public policy to have an automatic tax increase for a particular industry. The passenger movement charge itself is already set at a far higher level than the service which it purports to pay for. The government spends about $240 million currently in processing passengers through our major airports, but the total revenue from the passenger movement charge will be $655½ million this financial year and almost $800 million in the coming financial year. This is opposed to the government's own budget estimate for the cost of processing passengers of $240 million this financial year and $230 million the following financial year. Over the past few years many levies and charges have been added to the passenger movement charge in response to specific measures-for instance, foot-and-mouth disease. There were significant costs associated with processing passengers in and out of Australia when the threat of foot-andmouth disease existed, so the then coalition government increased the passenger movement charge by $8 to offset that. It is a good example that, no matter which government is in power, there is really no such thing as a temporary tax. Once a tax has been introduced it is very rarely rolled back. It is Those increases to the passenger movement charge are still in place, but at least they were made in relation to extra costs the government faced in processing passengers to and from Australia. There is no direct correlation between CPI increases and the increased costs associated with passenger movements. By the government's own figures the cost of processing passengers is going down. This is one of the most insulting things about this bill-at the same time as the government is increasing this tax, the cost is going down because it is ripping money and personnel out of a service it purports to fund. The government has cut, and is cutting, funding significantly for passenger facilitation through our eight major airports. What they are saying to the Australian people and international passengers coming to Australia is: 'You are going to wait longer when you come through our eight major international airports and we are going to charge you more for the privilege.' The CPI has the capacity to move up and down at varying rates. The fact that the tourism industry could not have any certainty that this tax was going to be in line with CPI in any given year was a cause of great concern for the industry. The tourism industry needs to set prices well in advance. They did not know what this tax was going to be and that created another layer of uncertainty, making it harder for this very significant industry to do business. A government tax that is going to impose an automatic increase on the price of travel to and from Australia, without any regard for the global marketplace or the need for travel and tourism operators to price competitively, is not something the coalition is prepared to support. Any suggestion that the travel and tourism industry will be in a position to absorb this automatic increase year on year without any other economic factors being considered is a clear demonstration that this government just does not understand the global ramifications and the competitiveness of the travel and tourism industry. It is an insult to an industry that already contributes significantly through a range of other taxes and is, importantly, a key source of employment for Australians. It is pretty shocking to me and to other members of the opposition that the tourism minister is not actually listed to speak on this bill. He gave a commitment to the tourism industry that the government was not going to increase the passenger movement tax as late as March this year yet he has not deigned to come into this House to explain himself. He is not going to talk on a bill that will clearly have an immediate impact on the industry that he is supposed to support. The tourism industry can draw its own conclusions about the fact that the Minister for Tourism is not prepared to come into the House to address what is a very significant measure within his own portfolio. This is a cause of great concern to the opposition and, quite frankly, leaves its members flabbergasted. This bill has been thoroughly examined by both houses of the parliament. The House Standing Committee on Economics, which looked into it, was very concerned about the impact the bill will have on the industry. In their submission to that inquiry, the Australian Airports Association wrote that their main request to the government was that it remove the CPI indexation attached to the 17 per cent passenger movement charge increase and that moneys received through the passenger movement charge be directed to funding Customs staff and technology at the primary line. They further said in their submission: The AAA is most concerned about this indexation due to the impact it will have on Australian tourism. The significant increase to the PMC with indexation attached comes at a time when the industry is incredibly vulnerable. Airports are at the front line of this Labor government's incompetence. At the same time as the government is increasing the costs associated with people entering and leaving Australia, it is ripping funding away from Customs' ability to process those passengers. As the airports themselves will tell you, this is leading to increasing delays at our major international gateways. They have come to see me about this and they have lobbied the shadow tourism minister extensively about this. They are very concerned about what the government is doing. The government's own KPIs show that the time for processing passengers coming in and out of Australia is increasing, and that is grave cause for concern. The House Standing Committee on Economics looked into this measure, and the dissenting report by the coalition members explained: It is evident to the Liberal members of the committee that the Government's increase of the Passenger Movement Charge (PMC) is patent revenue raising and will effectively be a ‘tax on tourism'. However, for the industry, it could not have been introduced at a worse time. Specifically in relation to the CPI increase, the Liberal members of the committee said The indexation of the Charge is patently illthought-out and it is further evidence of this being a ‘cash grab' by the Government. To have the charge increase automatically, serves no other purpose than to generate additional revenue … Mr John Lee of the Tourism and Transport Forum, who has been quoted extensively in the parliament today, gave evidence to the committee. In his submission he said: As a minimum, MPs should stop the indexation. There is no other indexation on a tax. In terms of pure philosophical, hard Keynesian economics, you should reject it on that basis alone. Liberal members of the committee were particularly concerned that this additional charge would only serve to make other destinations more competitive to visitors considering Australia or, for those who do wish to come-if they do come-to make them spend less on discretionary items or services. Mr John King from the Australian Tourism Export Council gave evidence to the committee pointing out the additional disadvantages Australian tourism operators face in the form of excessive regulation. Mr King said: As well as battling a high Australian dollar, our tourism exporters have been hit with an almost endless tsunami of government regulation, red tape, the carbon tax, inflexible and inappropriate labour laws and imposed costs, all of which are increasingly destroying our competitiveness. Australia unfortunately is now one of the most expensive and difficult countries to get to and travel in. The Labor government seems intent on ruining a core Australian industry-an industry that employs over 900,000 people, representing almost eight per cent of total Australian employment. And this is shrinking as the industry is choked with Labor's penalising measures. With the emergence of new and highly competitive destinations overseas, Australia's share of global tourism has fallen. Australians heading overseas outnumber visitors coming to our shores. Since 2008, Australia has slipped from fourth to 13th place in the World Economic Forum Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index Rankings. The 2012-13 budget did not help the tourism sector to reverse this trend. I know that my friend, the shadow minister for tourism, will be speaking more about the concerns he has for this industry within his remarks. I want to turn my attention",75
107,Mr Baldwin,BILLS,"Unlike the minister, who is not going to speak.",79
108,Mr KEENAN,BILLS,"As the shadow minister has pointed out to me, this is unlike his opposite number, the minister, who has actually refused to come into this House and speak on this debate-something that I think says everything about this government's attitude to this vitally important Australian tourism sector. At a time when the tourism sector is suffering, our airports are being hit with these new taxes. The Australian Customs and Border Protection service-an agency that has been systematically savaged by Laborhas faced specific budget cuts to the line that they have for processing passengers throughout Australia's international terminals. Customs and Border Protection have been slugged with staff cuts, they have to been slugged with budget cuts and Labor has specifically cut the budget for passenger processing. Last year, Labor hit Customs with a $34 million cut to the passenger facilitation program and this year, astonishingly, they cut a further $10.4 million from that program at a time when passenger numbers are expected to increase from approximately 32 billion to 38 billion in just four years. So passenger numbers are increasing, the government is charging people more to come now to Australia and to leave Australia, yet it is cutting the services associated with processing those passengers. I note that as well as the tourism minister, who has refused to speak on this issue, the Minister for Home Affairs will not speak on this measure either. He is responsible for this from a Customs perspective, and he has not addressed these issues when he made his contributions. The $434 million hit that Customs took has already had the effect of taking 70 staff off the front line for processing passengers at Australia's international airports. A further funding cut will clearly make these waiting times worse. Airports are already shortstaffed and we actually need to put more Customs officers in, not fewer. If the government refuses to do that, and if it refuses to reverse the measures that it has taken to take those front-line staff out, then we are going to find a situation where passenger processing times-which are already increasing-are going to continue to get worse. According to the government's own figures, Customs has a target of processing inbound passengers within 30 minutes when they come to Australia. In the past they have managed to do that for 95 per cent of inbound passengers, but now they have had to adjust that figure down to 92 per cent. A 30-minute processing time is, quite frankly, not that great. If you are moving about airports around the world, you would expect at more efficient airports that you would get through in a better time than 30 minutes. The Australian benchmark, as set by the government, is 30 minutes. It is not a particularly competitive benchmark, compared to our international competitors, yet the government is not even managing to meet that and, of course, according to its own figures it is getting worse. It is getting worse specifically because the government has cut funding and personnel to the agency that is doing this job, and it has done that time when it is allegedly taking more money from passengers moving in and out of Australia to provide that service. The Australian Airports Association have highlighted their concerns about government cuts in this area. They wrote a discussion paper in 2011 that highlighted Labor's cuts and they stated that those cuts have led to an increase at our major international gateways of Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth for peak-period inbound processing of an extra 24 minutes processing time. So people coming into Australian can expect to wait and have been waiting an extra 24 minutes because of the government's cuts. Since then, those government cuts have become more severe, so those waiting times are going to increase and the extra time that people wait at Australia's major international gateways is likewise going to continue to rise. Customs, of course, have been hit by more than just these particular budget cuts. They are also cutting 190 staff from Customs in this budget, which will put increased pressure on passenger processing times. Indeed, globally, since Labor has come to office, they have cut 750 staff from the Customs and Border Protection Service, an agency that is clearly being pushed to breaking point by a Labor government that has failed them in so many ways but particularly, of course, in regard to border security. Customs staff numbers and resources are not increasing in line with the increasing numbers of people coming to Australia. Indeed, as I have outlined, they are decreasing. International passenger numbers coming through our airports increased by almost nine per cent between 2009 and 2010, from 23.6 million to 25.7 million. An estimate by Customs showed that international visitors to Australia will increase by more than 150 per cent and at a international departures will increase by more than 500 per cent over the next two decades. Yet the government's plan to deal with this is to continue to attack the agency that provides this service. It is not the only way they are doing so, sadly. In this year's budget there has been another major blow for Australia's national security agencies, in particular, the aviation sector. Airports have been slugged with a new tax on services provided by the AFP for national security policing at our airports. Labor's lazy accounting and their requirement to prop up their dodgy surplus have led them to raise $118 million over four years from airports to cover what should be a federal government responsibility. The Australian Airports Association highlighted what they believe is the inequity of this measure when they wrote directly to the Prime Minister and said that airports are a major critical infrastructure where the AFP predominantly play a counterterrorism role. Security is a national issue and therefore should be paid for by the Commonwealth government. The policy debate about it being inappropriate for entities such as airports to pay for the AFP in a rent-a-cop scenario has already been had. That is why the Labor government agreed to pay for these services in 2010. Airports have found, as so many other sectors in the Australian economy have, that you cannot trust the Labor Party their word. If they tell you something, there is no guarantee that they will follow through with it and there is no guarantee that it will be delivered. Airports around Australia have found this to their detriment with this $110 million slug to provide policing at our airports. Labor have also placed additional pressure on airports and Customs through the budget measure of cutting duty free allowances for tobacco from 1 September this year. This will have significant impacts on delays for passenger processing times at the primary line. Labor have not given Customs any extra resources to deal with this change and have not boosted funds for cargo Customs screenings to deal with the expected influx illegal tobacco that will come through our borders, instead cutting $58.1 million from the cargo screening program, again, at a time when cargo numbers are increasing. All of these cuts and proposed measures serve only to hinder passenger movement and slug the tourism industry, and make Australia a less attractive destination for international visitors and an inconvenient and expensive experience for Australian passengers passing through our airports. This measure that we are debating today is another deceitful budget measure from a Labor Party that can never be believed at their word. The Minister for Tourism promised the tourism industry that this was not going to happen two months before they brought down their budget. The increase is nothing more than an unjustified tax grab, and it is occurring because Labor have wasted billions of dollars through their failed programs that I outlined at the start of my speech. The greatest insult, of course, is the fact that they are increasing the passenger movement charge and trying to say that this at is just a charge for people coming to and going from Australia. At the same time they are doing it, they are cutting resources to the agencies to process passengers and they are increasing the waiting times for international visitors and Australians travelling internationally. People entering and leaving Australia are going to pay more to wait longer. We do not believe that this is justifiable. As I said at the outset of my comments, we would have loved to have stopped this tax in its entirety. It has no relationship to passenger processing. It is purely about propping up a dodgy surplus. What we have been successful in doing is convincing the crossbenchers and forcing a government backdown on the automatic of indexation that Australian international passengers were going to have to pay on this passenger movement charge. The government will have you believe that this is their amendment. They will have you believe that suddenly, six weeks after the budget, they had a change of heart and decided that this indexation was unjustifiable. It was just yesterday that the coalition circulated its amendment to this bill, and the amendment is very simple. It reads very simply, and I have it here. It is a very straightforward amendment. It did the job that we wanted it to do, which was to stop this unjustifiable increase on the tourism industry and to stop this annual tax increase that they can ill afford as they are struggling to cope with the extra imposts that have been put on them by this Labor government. We circulated our amendment at about midday yesterday. Suddenly, later on that afternoon, the government had a change of heart and they circulated their own amendment to their own bill, a bill that implements measures from their own budget brought down just six weeks ago. If you examine both of the amendments, as I am doing now, you will see that they are word-for-word, letter-forletter, exactly the same. There is not one difference between the opposition's amendment that was circulated early yesterday and the government amendment that was circulated a few hours afterwards. The government will have you believe that they had some sort of change of heart, but we all know what happened here and we all know it is another great example of why minority government is not working and why this parliament has been judged by the Australian people to be a failed experiment that they are just itching to end. When you cannot bring down a budget and stick to it for six weeks, when you have to amend the measures that you announced just six weeks ago, that is a sign of a government that is failing.

110,Mr ALEXANDER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Last Sunday I attended the Marist College Eastwood 75th anniversary mass at St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney. The college's principal, Daniel Delmage, was most welcoming as parish priests and local representatives joined current and former students and parents and staff to celebrate the great history of this important local school. Most poignantly, the attendance list included Father Jim Maloney, the first of 107 students to enrol in the college when it opened its doors in 1937. Since this time, the school has grown in physical size, in student numbers and in acclaim within the local community. By 1970 there were 900 students enjoying a high level of academic education as well as a dynamic syllabus including religion, art, science and music. The modern and contemporary learning centres in Eastwood today would make the college founders very proud. As a Catholic school in the Marcellin tradition, the school is deeply rooted in its history and conscious of its dutiful purpose. The school also enjoys the service of lay teachers and administrators and has operated under lay leadership for the past 25 years. I congratulate Marist College on its achievement in educating more than 5,000 young men over the past 75 years and producing an enviable quantity and quality of leaders of our local community. One of these leaders is Victor Dominello, the New South Wales Minister for Citizenship, Communities and Aboriginal Affairs. Fowler Electorate: Australian Chinese Buddhist Society",82
111,Mr HAYES,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to speak about the Australian Chinese Buddhist Society and Mingyue Lay temple in Bonnyrigg, which is within my electorate of Fowler. The Mingyue Lay temple was established 25 years ago and is one of the largest temples in Sydney. The temple is of a classical 12th century Chinese design, and the main shrine houses more than 37 bronzed Buddhas. Thousands of people-such as my good friend Kenrick Cheah and his family, who live in Chatswood-come from all over Sydney to see the temple, participate in celebrations, pray and pay their respects. It is great to see our young generation participate in the opportunity to learn about each other's religion and culture. I thank president of the Australian Chinese Buddhist Society, James Chan, who is a very hard worker. He prepares the temple every year to receive tens of thousands of visitors. I pay tribute to his family and his very supportive wife, Jenny Chan, who is a close friend of my wife, Bernadette. I also thank the management committee and volunteers, among them Jensen Tran and Vinh Trang, who have participated in many of the functions I have attended and who are supportive of many different community organisations and charitable fundraisers. The Mingyue Lay temple serves as a beacon of tolerance, acceptance and inclusion in the very diverse community that I have the honour to represent. Ryan Electorate: Chapel Hill State School Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (13:48): I rise to recognise one of the Ryan electorate's outstanding schools, Chapel Hill State School-students and teachers from which are here today with us in Parliament House-along with its principal, Mr Stewart Jones, and the teachers and parents. Chapel Hill State School plays an important role in our local community. The role it plays is due primarily to the school's wonderful staff, students and families. I recently attended the farewell assembly for outgoing principal Ross Perry. Ross worked tirelessly in both the school and the broader community. In recognition of his dedicated service, the school named their new building the Ross Perry Resource Centre. Ross was also integral to Chapel Hill State School being recognised as a school of choice. The students are among Queensland's best and brightest, and they excel in the NAPLAN testing. In fact, in the 2011 tests, 100 per cent of the school's students were at the or above the national minimum standard in 12 of the 15 categories. I take this opportunity to wish Ross Perry well, and I look forward to working with the school's new principal, Mr Stewart Jones, who happens to be the brother of the member for Herbert and who I know will continue to  future remains bright for Chapel Hill State School students. Afghan Youth Cricket Support Organisation Mr KELVIN THOMSON (Wills) (13:49): I rise to acknowledge in the parliament the importance of the Afghan Youth Cricket Support Organisation and the work of Coburg West Primary School students in trying to attract donations to support this important organisation. The Afghan Youth Cricket Support Organisation provides an opportunity for young Afghans to pick up a bat or a ball instead of a gun. Coburg West Primary School is trying to get donations so as to ship a container of cricket equipment to Afghanistan with the intention of influencing Afghan children in a constructive way. Grassroots campaigns such as this offer support for families whose resources are consumed by everyday necessities and who, if the Taliban are present in their area, are constant fear of their lives. For women and girls in Afghanistan things can be particularly difficult, as they face discrimination or, worse, are the victims of outrageous crimes such as acid attacks. I applaud the work of the Afghan Institute of Learning. It has been helping Afghans to lift themselves above the devastation of war by providing education, training, health care and health education, and by empowering women with new skills and by promoting women's rights. I applaud the efforts and unselfishness of the students of Coburg West Primary School in wanting to make a difference to the lives of young Afghans through their support for the Afghan Youth Cricket Support Organisation. It is inspirational, and I am very proud to see young people in my electorate doing their bit to make the world a better place. Dawson Electorate: Carbon Pricing",83
112,Mr CHRISTENSEN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Despite the government's claims to the contrary, ratepayers across Australia are going to face increased costs because of the carbon tax. The truth has come out in Mackay, where the council announced yesterday that ratepayers will face a $23.40 increase in their waste management levy because of the council's inclusion by the Clean Energy Regulator in the liabilities for the carbon tax. The Mackay council is going to have a bill, after it has done its mitigation, of $36.4 million over 40 years. The $23.40 increase will raise the levy for ratepayers to $165.65. Meanwhile, charges to commercial customers will go up, with a gate fee of $20.02 per tonne. The council has mitigated by installing a gas flaring system at the landfill they have. in But this has still not completely removed the cost of the carbon tax, so the mayor has said that she has no option but to frame the budget in such a way as to raise the levy because the council is collecting it on behalf of this federal government. The council has no choice in the matter. This is absolutely disgraceful. It proves a lie to the government's statement that there will be no cost on ratepayers. I congratulate the council on their efforts to mitigate and condemn the government on this cost to ratepayers. Assistance Dogs",84
113,Ms BURKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today I want to put on the record the deep feelings of loss on behalf on my constituent, Alexis Smith. Alexis has lost her dog Toomba. We might scoff at this and say it is a family pet but, for Alexis, Toomba was her life. It was her independence, it was her ability to get around, it was her ability to come to my office and volunteer, it was her ability to attend university. Toomba was the saving light. As she writes to me: I need another mate, my heart is empty. I am going to struggle to study for my exams next week. I cry often and feel lost. Margaretwho is Alexis's sisterand I are deeply and truly upset. Toomba is too young! We only got to be soul mates for about 4 years. Why is Toomba so special? Toomba was an assistance disabled dog. Alexis has a severe disability and is in a massively heavy wheelchair. She often complains that in medical terms she should not still be with us and has defied logic and is still alive this day at 46. For her to get around and to be able, she had this amazing dog. I struggle to call Toomba a dog because we often referred to him as a person in our office. Toomba was just there as Alexis says as her soul mate. Toomba picked up things, Toomba protected her, Toomba answered the phone, Toomba opened the door. Toomba could even turn on the computer in my office. This was an amazing dog and we are all sad that she has gone but we want to pay thanks to the Assistance Dogs of Australia who provided this amazing creature that made the life of Alexis that much better. Darwin RAAF Housing Mrs GRIGGS (Solomon) (13:54): Today Gerry Wood, Northern Territory Legislative Assembly independent member for Nelson said: … both the Commonwealth Government and the NT Government should be ashamed of themselves when it comes to doing something about helping people get a roof over their head … the bulldozing of houses at Eaton owned by the Commonwealth Government, Government, whilst many people struggle to get enough money to buy land and house or rent, is disgraceful. I could not agree more. In this very place in June 2011, this parliament unanimously agreed with me that the Darwin RAAF base houses known as Eaton should be made available to Territorians. I along with many Territorians agree with the other statement of Gerry Wood that the Gillard and Henderson Labor governments: … seem to be about putting obstacles regulations in the way when it comes to finding solutions to reuse these houses, so that an affordable option be given to those in need. It is an absolute outrage and disgrace that these houses are being knocked over in the middle of a housing crisis. This government is out of touch and cannot be trusted. It should be building houses not knocking them down. Shame on you Minister Snowdon and shame on you Chief Minister Henderson. Territorians deserve better. Information Technology",84
114,Mr BANDT,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," In February this year I met with Jenny Anderson, the CEO of an information and communications technology business in my electorate of Melbourne. Jenny explained to me some of the challenges that the Australian ICT sector is facing. One of those challenges has been the recent decision of Austrade to restructure resources towards emerging markets. As the Greens spokesperson on science and research as well as industry and innovation, I am concerned that Australia's cutting-edge businesses in sectors such as ICT and biotechnology may be at risk as a result of those decisions. Examples of changes that will create difficulty for businesses like Jenny's are the elimination of information and communications technology in Austrade and the refocusing of representation to a Labor developing markets. The honourable Craig Emerson, the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness, has advised that Austrade has placed greater emphasis on emerging markets because of the value a badge confers on governments with less open regulatory processes. I suspect this change in emphasis probably relates to mining exports and has been made at the expense of the intellectual potential of our ICT industry. The government should be supporting innovative business in Australia with a view to long-term prosperity. I am proud of the progressive industry in my to electorate. I will continue to work with these businesses to identify how we can support their development. Lavis, Mr David",85
115,Mr MORRISON,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise to pay tribute to rural fire service captain David Lavis. David was a well-known face and friend to many in the Sutherland shire rural fire service. More than that, he was a genuine local hero. He served as a proud member of the rural fire service for 30 years and as captain of the Kurnell brigade for 17 years. Sadly, he passed away this month at the age of 62 after a long battle with cancer. The rural fire service do a stellar job protecting lives and communities. It is a gruelling job but nevertheless David's daughter, Rebecca, said, 'His biggest love was the fire brigade.' He was involved in responding to all major incidents and bushfires in the shire but it was not just a summer job. Rural fire service volunteers work right throughout the year, from hazard reduction in the cooler months to rescue efforts assisting the SES and on rare occasions attending to incidents at the Kurnell refinery. Our local community gathered this morning at the South Chapel in Woronora to farewell David. His RFS colleagues donned their yellow gear to provide a guard of honour. Our thoughts are with his wife, Carolyn, his family, Matthew and Jennifer, Rebecca and David, Rachael and Paul and his eight grandchildren. David was a generous man who gave much to his family, his community and to our shire. At Kurnell the new headquarters and new station for the rural fire service will be an everlasting tribute to his great service and memory. World Refugee Day",85
116,Ms PARKE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I note that today is World Refugee Day, a day on which we recognise and raise awareness of the more than 15.2 million registered refugees and the 26.4 million people around the world who have been displaced from their homes due to violence, persecution, famine, drought and global warming. Australia's share of the world's refugee crisis, capped at 13,750 places per year, is a very small one. I hope that we will do more. This year the theme for International Refugee Week is restoring hope by significantly increasing our refugee intake, both from among those desperate people waiting in camps in Africa and elsewhere for resettlement, and those people barely existing in Indonesia and Malaysia. We could restore some hope and lessen the incentives for people to undertake dangerous boat journeys across our oceans. This would also be welcomed by our neighbours who bear the brunt of the refugee influx and who are far less resourced to cope than we are. The evidence shows that, for those who arrive in Australia by whatever means seeking asylum, measures like detention do not reduce demand. They merely increase mental illness among people already traumatised, most of whom will ultimately become Australian citizens. I welcome the majority findings of the recent select committee report into immigration detention chaired by the member for Banks and trust that its recommendations, including with regard to establishing an independent review process for refugees with negative ASIO security assessments and alternatives to indefinite detention, are being seriously considered and will be implemented as soon as possible. Italian Community",86
117,Ms GAMBARO,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The Italian community is an important part of the Australian story. The contribution Italian migrants have made through their work ethic, family life, culture, food and music have added colour and vibrancy to the Australian way of life. Many of those early migrants are now aged and in the caring hands of a welfare organisation, Co.As.It. For 25 years Co.As.It has been providing community care services for the Italian aged community and aged-care facilities in Australia. Since 2005 Queensland Co.As.It has been successfully providing training for staff at Italian nursing homes, community health centres and hospitals in Brisbane.",86
118,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Order! In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. NA Carbon Pricing",87
119,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I remind him of this month's report on electricity price increases, released by the ACT Labor government's independent regulator, which states, 'The majority of the increase in electricity prices is attributable to the introduction of a price on carbon. It represents just under 80 per cent of the absolute change.' How does the Acting Prime Minister reconcile that with his statement to the House that 'the great bulk of increases in electricity prices have nothing do with a carbon price'?",87
120,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," opposition leader is continuing with his campaign of deception and deliberately spreading misinformation around our community. As I explained to the House yesterday, nationally the carbon price is only expected to make up nine per cent of an average household bill in 2012-13. Those are the facts and, as I pointed out to the House yesterday, over the last five years electricity prices in New South Wales have increased by 80 per cent. We had this extraordinary statement from the shadow Treasurer yesterday about the alleged impact of a carbon price. This is what he said: 'Electricity prices in Sydney have risen 66 per cent since federal Labor came to power.' That is just a straight lie and it is just so typical of the misinformation being put around by those opposite. We on this side of the House on a point of order. I would ask the Acting Prime Minister to table the document from which he is reading.",87
121,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I withdraw, Madam Deputy Speaker. But I ask this question: how can the power price rises that Sydneysiders haveMr Dutton interjecting",87
122,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, Order! The member for Dickson is warned.,87
123,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"How can the price rises for electricity, of 80 per cent, that have been in place for over five years in New South Wales be the responsibility of a carbon price? How could that be? It is not the case. We have explained the impact of a carbon price overall-less than 1c in the dollar; 0.7 per cent. But of course there will be an to impact on the overall price level, small as it is. That is the reason we are putting in place assistance to families and assistance to The industry. That is what we have been doing. So we stand by all of the modelling that we have put out, including when it comes to electricity prices. We understand that there is a price impact and that is why households are getting assistance. The average household assistance is over $10 per household. The average electricity price increase is just over $3. That is a fact. There is nothing that those on that side of the House can do when they come in here to deny those essential facts. The Leader of the Opposition will say anything, do anything and wreck anything for political power. He is constantly talking down our economy, he is constantly misrepresenting the impact of a carbon price and it just shows how unqualified he is for high office.",87
124,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My supplementary question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Does the Acting Prime Minister deny that the carbon tax is almost 80 per cent of the power price increase in the ACT?,88
125,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, The facts are as I have just outlined them. These are the facts. The fact is that the carbon price expected to contribute up to nine per cent of the average household bill in 2012-13. Economy,88
126,Ms ONEILL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Will the Acting Prime Minister update the House on the outcome of the G20 Leaders Summit? What does this say about the importance of keeping our economy strong?,88
127,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Robertson for her very important question. The G20 Leaders Summit in Los Cabos is a very important meeting, particularly given the volatility in the global economy and the situation in Europe. In Los Cabos the G20 did resolve to put in place work which will support recovery in the global economy and also to progress a solution to the problems in Europe. Importantly, it is united in its resolve to support growth and jobs. Growth and jobs are what this government has always been about. The G20 agreed to the Los Cabos Growth and Jobs Action Plan, which recognises that you can support growth and jobs and maintain fiscal discipline at the same time. The G20 also moved to limit the continual fallout of the problems in Europe. Of course, European leaders resolved and committed to take all necessary steps to safeguard the integrity and stability of the euro area. The G20 did welcome those commitments. What we must do is limit the impact of the contagion to the rest of the world from the troubles in Europe. These are all positive steps. The fact is that Greece and Europe still confront very substantial economic challenges and they will not be resolved overnight. We will need to see further action by European leaders over the months and years ahead. Australia is not immune from is these global developments, but we certainly face this global turbulence from a position of strength. One reason we have this position of strength is that at the height of the global financial crisis and the global recession we acted to protect jobs and growth. As a consequence of that our economy, almost uniquely amongst the developed economies, avoided a recession. We have not suffered here the impact of high and prolonged unemployment and all of the capital destruction that we have seen across other developed economies. The result is that we have the best combination of impressive growth, low unemployment, record investment, contained inflation, low interest rates and strong public finances. The result is that our economy is 10 per cent bigger than it was prior to the global financial crisis, where many other developed economies are still smaller-not even getting back to that most basic starting point. This is a record that everybody on this side of the House is proud of: 800,000 jobs in the period that we have been in office, and interest rates coming down-someone with a $300,000 mortgage is now paying $4,000 a year less than they were when the Leader of the Opposition was last in government. We are proud of that record. We think it is something that should be celebrated in this country and not talked down by those opposite. Carbon Pricing",88
128,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer. Why has the government set its carbon tax at $23 a tonne when analysts Thomson Reuters yesterday slashed their forecast for international permits until 2020 by 59 per cent to a mere $4.30 a tonne?,89
129,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," information I have, which may be somewhat different from what the shadow Treasurer has quoted, says that analysts believe the price for European permits may increase by $8 in 2013 and rise to around $22 to $23 by 2015 if the EU legislates current policy proposals. So he has been caught again misrepresenting the facts. As I have said in this House on a number of occasions, the Europeans reconsidering their approach to their emissions trading scheme. They are looking at making changes. What that means is that we could well see a rise in carbon price in the European Union. But this goes to the very heart of the deception that those opposite continue to put forward in this House. There is no figure they will not bend. There is no policy impact they will not exaggerate in their attempt to deny the science of climate change and to go on and deny that the price impact of the carbon in this country is 0.7 per cent-less than 1c in the dollar. So, once again, the shadow Treasurer has been caught out with his figures. The Thomson report does not necessarily prove the point that he was making. What we say is that we have the right balance between market incentives and giving business certainty. And what we saw from the IMF yesterday was another endorsement of our scheme. Family Payments",89
130,Ms LIVERMORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs at and Minister for Disability Reform. Will the minister outline to the House how the government is helping Australian families as we work to build a strong economy? How is this supporting families in my electorate of The Capricornia, and how can we continue to make sure families are not forgotten?",89
131,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Jagajaga-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (14:10): I thank the member for Capricornia for her question because, from today, 1.3 million Australian families will get some extra help with the costs of sending their children to school, are extra help that families need when they have to pay out for those new uniforms, shoes, schoolbooks, computers, school excursions-all of us know the list goes on and on. And, from next year, families will get the help when they need it: at the start of term 1 and the start of term 3. This is going to include families like the family we visited this morning. The Acting Prime Minister and the member for Canberra and I went to Hughes Primary School and met with a family-Elizabeth and Anthony price and their children Liam and Lauren. This family will receive $818 straight into their bank account this fortnight to help them with the costs of their children's education. We, of course, are sure",89
132,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,89
133,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have comments from those opposite about paying it back. Well, one thing is for sure: you are going to take it back off them.",89
134,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,89
135,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, Order!,90
136,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We know that those opposite will take it off them if they get the chance.,90
137,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,90
138,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,90
139,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is exactly what will happen-each and every one of you want to take this money off them. What we know is that this Leader of the Opposition talked about families having confidence in him-saying that, when it came to judging him, they could judge him on his record. He talked about the forgotten Australians, the forgotten families. Well, we know who forgot them! Each and every one of you forgot about Australian families when you voted no to the schoolkids bonus. And of course the member for Sturt has let the cat out of the bag today and made it absolutely plain that if you ever get the chance you will rip this money off families-claw it back; take the money out of the pockets of families-because it is only this side of the parliament that wants to help families. You just want to rip the money off them.",90
140,Mr Forrest,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In regard to standing order 65, can I plead with you to urge people in this place to address their remarks through the chair. It is there for a special purpose: it question. is less confronting. It is a matter I have addressed to previous speakers. I am hoping you will attend to the matter.",90
141,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I appreciate the member for Mallee's assistance. The use of the word 'you' is inappropriate because it means I am doing it, and I am sure I am not. It is inappropriate. But the volume of noise in the chamber is also making it very difficult, and I would ask everyone to observe the standing order in respect of noise. Carbon Pricing Mr JOHN COBB (Calare) (14:13): My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer to the statement in a report by Growcom, one of Australia's largest representatives of vegetable growers, that farmers will be hit with immediate cost increases of between $5,500 and $45,000 a year because of the world's biggest carbon tax. Does he expect farmers to absorb the massive increase in their costs, or to pass it on to consumers through higher prices for their groceries, and, if so, how?",90
142,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I do not necessarily accept the validity of those figures at all. Just as we have had, day in and day out in the parliament, we will continue to have gross exaggerations made by those opposite. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition has gone around this country claiming that the price rises will be unimaginable. He has said we will see the end of Whyalla. He has said we will see the destruction of whole industries.  on a point of order on direct relevance: the Acting Prime Minister was asked about Growcom's figures for vegetable growers in Australia; he was not asked about any other matter. He has to address himself to that",90
143,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The Acting Prime Minister has just begun his answer, and I call him to the question.",90
144,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I have said repeatedly in this House, the impact on the overall price level is 0.7 percent, or less than 1c in the dollar. But it is true that it will have an impact on some costs and it will be more in some sectors than in others. That is why the government has put in place a Household Assistance Package as well as an assistance package for industry. We have done that because of those costs. But for those opposite to come into this House and exaggerate those price impacts day in, day out is simply reckless and irresponsible. What they are determined to do is talk down our economy and the hard work of millions of workers and tens of thousands of small businesses in our country. The Leader of the Opposition is now running away from some of his more outrageous statements about the impact. We have heard about how we are going to have not a cobra strike but a python squeeze. But, of course, we all know that the Leader of the Opposition is simply a snake oil salesman slithering around this country making all sorts of poisonous accusations. Mr John Cobb: Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the Deputy Prime Minister is defying your ruling. This about the costs to farmers.",90
145,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Calare will resume his seat. Points of order are not an opportunity to reintroduce debate. The Acting Prime Minister has the call.,91
146,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will conclude by making this point. We are providing $15 billion of household assistance over four years. That is $15 billion in the pockets of customers walking through the doors of Australian businesses. NA,91
147,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS," Before I recognise the member for New England I do want to welcome back to the House a former Speaker, Steve Martin. I hope he is enjoying the view from the gallery. The member for New England has the call. NA National Rural Health Students Network",91
148,Mr WINDSOR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Health. The minister would be aware that the National Rural Health Students Network are in the parliament today. Could the minister explain how the government is ensuring that regional students who wish to study nursing, medicine and allied health can do so in regional Australia, thus training local people to meet the needs of local communities? Will the minister also consider using the Higher Education Contribution Scheme rebate as an incentive for graduates to locate in regional Australia?",91
149,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for is New England for his question. I have very much enjoyed my visits to his home town and I have been able to witness his strong commitment to his local community. My office met today with the National Rural Health Students Network-and they are in the gallery today as my guests, if they want to give us a wave. I am terrifically pleased that we have students of such high calibre who will be the doctors and allied health professionals of tomorrow. We know that people who come from, or study in, rural and regional communities end up working in and staying in those communities. James Ross, from Orange, is here. He is studying medicine in Geelong. He grew up in a regional town and he understands the particular needs of a regional town. Ben Croft, from Tamworth, is here. He is studying pharmacy in Armidale and, no doubt, he will one day be filling scripts for the member for New England. And also here is Simon Reid, from Wollongong, who is studying medicine in Sydney and wants to return to coastal New South Wales when he graduates. James, Ben and Simon grew up in regional Australia and want to study there. We know they will be returning to those country towns in the future and serving the needs of those towns. It is also great that, as well as coming down here to lobby, they have been taking time out to talk to more than 300 high school students to encourage them to think about a career in rural and regional medicine. We have a very proud record of support for rural and regional students in Australia. We fund 17 rural clinical schools. We fund the John Flynn Placement Program to support 300 students each year to undertake training in medicine, nursing and allied health, encouraging the recruitment and retention of health professionals in rural areas. This we are offering 241 clinical placement scholarships for allied health students undertaking a placement in rural or remote locations. We are investing in medical, nursing and allied health accommodation through the Health and Hospital Fund, with $2.6 million in Ballarat and $5.2 million in Alice Springs. As the member for New England indicated in his question, we also have a HECS reimbursement scheme for medical students. We spent $7 million on the scheme last year, with 530 participants working in rural communities. Of course, I am happy for my colleague the Minister for Higher Education to look at whether that scheme should be extended to allied health professionals also. Carbon Pricing  question is to the Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. What are the drivers of electricity prices and how does the carbon price rate amongst them? What is the government's approach to helping families deal with this and how does this differ from other approaches?",91
150,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:20): I thank the member for Moreton for the question. When the government announced the carbon price package last year, we were upfront about the modest impact of the carbon price on electricity prices-$3.30 a week for the average household, an average increase of up to 10 per cent. We were upfront about it. It is a modest impost compared with the massive increases in electricity prices around Australia in recent years. They are increases that have nothing to do with carbon pricing; year they are mainly driven by investments in poles and wires. They are increases from which the state governments are reaping dividends. These are the figures. In New South Wales in the last three years, power student has gone up by 55 per cent; in Victoria, 37 per cent; in Queensland, 39 per cent; in South Australia, 43 per cent; and in Western Australia, under the Barnett government, a whopping 57 per cent, or $552 a household. As prices have skyrocketed in New South Wales, the O'Farrell government has been happily accepting hundreds of millions of dollars from households when they pay their electricity bills. Last year the O'Farrell government took in $640 million in dividends, and it is forecasting over a billion dollars in dividends paid by householders through their electricity bills for next year. All of that has happened without as much as a bo-peep from the Leader of the Opposition. All that has gone on, with not a word from the Leader of the Opposition-a 55 per cent increase in power bills in his home state of New South Wales and a billion dollars taken in dividends next year. That is all fine, not worth a word. But a much smaller increase which is offset by an average of $10.10 a week in cash assistance to households that comes from carbon pricing is unimaginable! It is beyond human conception, that increase of 10 per cent! the wrecking ball! It is the death of industries! It is the cobra strike! It is the python squeeze! It is the end of the world-a 10 per cent increase, $3.30 a household, matched by $10.10 a week in assistance. But a 55 per cent increase in New South Wales and billions ripped off New South Wales householders by the O'Farrell government is just like cuddling a teddy bear! That is nothing! That is not worth a word from the Leader of the Opposition, who has nothing to say about the rest of the price rises around this country. This is the only government that is helping people with rising electricity prices. From today the schoolkids bonus starts being paid, and it makes a difference. (Time expired)  Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. You mentioned rising electricity prices, Minister Combet. How is the government assisting the people of my electorate with the modest impact of the carbon price on electricity prices?",92

152,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, Order! The Minister for Climate and Energy Efficiency has the call and will be heard in silence.,93
153,Mr COMBET,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Charlton-Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (14:24): I thank the member for Moreton for the supplementary question. As I said earlier, when the government announced the carbon price package last year we were upfront about the modest impact of the carbon price-a $3.30 a week impact for the average household, matched by $10.10 a week on average in cash assistance for households. In the electorate of Moreton, what that translates into is that 55,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut. The tax cuts It is start from 1 July, and 55,000 taxpayers receive a tax cut. Out of those, 45,000 will receive a tax cut of at least $300 a year. More than 17,200 pensioners and 1,900 self-funded retirees in Moreton will receive an extra $338 a year if they are single and an extra $510 a year for couples combined. On top of that, more than 2,700 students will get up to an extra $177 a year. In addition, in the budget, of course, a supplementary allowance was provided for to assist young people, the unemployed and many others with utilities bills, and from today, as I remarked earlier, the schoolkids bonus of $410 for a primary student and $820 for a high school student starts being rolled out. (Time expired) Carbon Pricing Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (14:26): My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to Brisbane City Council's statement that the world's biggest carbon tax will add 1.9 per cent to every resident's rates, or more than double the figure he told the House yesterday that councils should need to raise their rates by. How does the Acting Prime Minister reconcile that with this letter from the Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innovation to Brisbane councillors claiming that they were exaggerating the impact of the carbon tax?",93
154,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I think there is a very clear explanation for this, because this is just another cash grab by the Liberal Party in Brisbane. That is what it is, and I think the Brisbane City Council are going to have a lot of trouble demonstrating the claims that they are making. For example, $11 million is claimed to cover a rise in inflation of 0.7 per cent, but that is based on the average price increase for households, and councils will be subjected to smaller price increases-and the list goes on. The fact is that those opposite are going to come into this House every day and exaggerate the impact of the carbon price because they do not have any policies in particular; they just have this reckless negativity of the Leader of the Opposition. But, of course, as we get closer to 1 July he starts to run away from his previous positions. First of all the price rises were going to be absolutely through the roof. Then Whyalla was going to be destroyed. Then whole industries were going to go down the gurgler. They are clearly not, because what we have here is not a Leader of the Opposition; we have a snake oil salesman who is slithering around the country peddling his falsehoods because he does not have any policies and he is trying to cover up the fact that he wants to rip out the tax cuts that are coming in on 1 July and to get rid of the tripling of the tax-free threshold. He has also saidMrs Prentice: Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. While snake oil salesmen are relevant to the Acting Prime Minister, they are not relevant to",93

156,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that what we have here is a political strategy They do not care what damage they cause to confidence or to the views of Australians about the importance of dealing with dangerous climate change. They will say anything and do anything to justify their political position, which is rapidly declining, because as we get to 1 July he is going to be running away from all of the extreme claims that he has made. He will be simply a hollow man in a cul-de-sac without any policies at all, because then he is going to have to explain to the Australian people what he is going to do about a tripling of the tax-free threshold and what he is going to do about the increase in the family payments. He has already indicated today that he is going to knock off the schoolkids bonus. We had that also",94

160,Mr GEORGANAS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. What will be the impact of the carbon price on transport infrastructure in regional communities such as Whyalla in my state, especially in aviation? How does this compare with some of the impacts that have been forecast?",94
161,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (14:30): I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question and for his honesty when it comes to the reality of dealing with climate change and meeting the challenge of putting a price on carbon. We saw just a couple of weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition once again talking down a business in the regional aviation industry, preaching doom and gloom and disaster when it came to the impact of the carbon price. He has got some form on this. I am asked specifically about Whyalla. On 27 April last year the Leader of the Opposition said: Whyalla will be wiped off the map … He went on to say: … Whyalla risks becoming a ghost town, an economic wasteland if this carbon tax goes ahead It was like a scene from Mad Max. Special Minister of State, Gary Gray, will be over in Whyalla. He is a Whyalla local. He will be going to visit his mum on 30 June to check that everything is still okay when 1 July comes through. For a place to become a ghost town, people have to leave it. One of the ways you leave a town is on a plane. So, as transport minister, I thought I would check on what has been going on in Whyalla. I found an article in the Whyalla News dated 4 June. The mayor of Whyalla Jim Pollock said, 'We are processing something like 75,000 passengers a year.' So I asked my department how do the numbers compare? And I found out there were 68,000 in 2011 and 64,000 in 2010. The year before there were 62,000. It is growing! The opposition might say that is all the people leaving town, but I checked. As many people are going into Whyalla as are leaving Whyalla. I checked also on what the local region was saying about Whyalla airport. They are making representations to the minister for regional development to expand the airport. They want a new terminal. They want to fix the runway. There they are out in Whyalla promoting the growth of a town that the Leader of the Opposition said would be wiped off the map. But now we see he is running from his over-the-top comments faster than he ran from the parliament. He could not get out of the parliament. He was beaten by the gazelle over there.  on a point of order. How can the minister be relevant to the question without mentioning that Wayne Hanson from the Australian Workers Union said Whyalla would be a ghost town.",95

NA Carbon Pricing",95
165,Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that the Master Builders Association has declared today that the carbon tax will reduce output in just this industry by $24 billion between now and 2020? How can the government continue to claim that the carbon tax will have little or no impact when it will add more than $5,000 to the cost of the average home?",96
166,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I do not think we should be surprised that there is a lot of dodgy modelling around. There are a lot of untrue claims being made and we have heard a lot of them in the House today. But the truth will be there from 1 July onwards and then we will be dealing with the reality of a carbon price: what impacts it will have on the overall price level and how it will flow through our economy. We had a very good endorsement yesterday of the carbon price from the IMF, which goes through endorsements we have had and work that has been done by groups as diverse as the Productivity Commission, the OECD and many other international agencies. The fact is our economy will continue to grow, and grow strongly. Our economy will continue to generate jobs and it will continue to generate prosperity. But, in the interim, those opposite are hell-bent on the scare campaign we are witnessing today and it is not surprising to anyone on this side of the House that they are joined in that by some sections of industry, but it does not make it right. The fact is that our economy will grow strongly, wealth will be created and we will be a better country because we will be more energy efficient and more powered by renewable energy. That is a good thing for all Australians. But we have seen all sorts of exaggerations over the past couple of days. This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say yesterday: … electricity prices in Sydney have risen 66% since Federal Labor came to power. This increase because of the carbon tax just adds further to cost of living pressures … I rest my case. Workplace Safety",96
167,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation. Minister, what are the government's policies for supporting workers who are injured at work? Are there any obstacles to this support and why is it important that we have proper scrutiny and questioning about policies to support workers?",96
168,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (14:38): I would like to thank the member for her question. She has always taken an interest in people in life who are doing it hard. I think it is important that this House notes that if you are unlucky enough to be injured at work in Australia you had better hope there is a Labor administration in charge of your safety laws and your compensation. Let me use, for example, the case of John. John works in the Territory at a remote mine site. In November 2009 he was injured in a motor vehicle rollover. He fractured his C2 disc, dislocated C6-C7 in his vertebrae, was airlifted to Darwin, then to Adelaide for immediate surgery. He received rehab after surgery, returned to Darwin and, thankfully, has returned to full-time work with the rehabilitation and support he has received under Comcare. He has received incapacity payments, medical and specialist treatment, surgery, medication, travel by air ambulance, aids and appliances, rehab assistance and physiotherapy. He continues to receive this under a federal Labor government. He can receive incapacity payments if, despite his best efforts to return to work, remains unable to return to work in the future due to his injury. He can apply for and, indeed, receive permanent impairment payment. If you have to have an injury, which is bad, at least have it under a Labor government. But there is an obstacleOpposition members: This is pathetic.",96

174,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ashley is a nurse. She injured her back in 1998 moving a patient. She tried to go back to work and in 2004, again at work, exacerbated the back injury. She has struggled with chronic pain for the last 14 years. Without the support she received under the old workers comp system in New South Wales she would have had to retire, she would have been on the DSP, and people would have given up on her. Unfortunately, now she lives in New South Wales with a Liberal government. Where she is injured, unless she passes the 20 per cent whole person impairment test-which is unlikely-that is it in 12 months time: no medical help and put on the scrapheap. What this means for the 600,000 Australians who get injured is: you cannot trust the New South Wales Liberals to look after you if you get injured at work. Look at those people opposite-they think it does not happen. Six hundred thousand he people get injured, and you cannot trust the Liberals if you are injured at work in New South Wales. What is more, you cannot trust the federal Liberals because they will not rule out doing the same thing nationally. They do not have an IR policy or a workers comp policy and we do not trust them to look after workers. (Time expired)",97
175,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Madam they Deputy Speaker, I have a supplementary question. Minister, in light of your answer, can you explain the difference between the Commonwealth and the New South Wales government policies on helping injured workers, with particular reference to someone like Sydney father Tom Rigby, who was injured at the Kurnell desalination plant four years ago and whose case is reported in today's Daily Telegraph?",97
176,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Maribyrnong-Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (14:42): I thank the member for Page for her question and I am grateful for the coverage in the Daily Telegraph today about what happens when you have a New South Wales government stripped of compensation. The case which the member for Page refers to, which is also detailed in the Daily Telegraph, is about a fellow working at a desalination plant four years ago at Kurnell. I will tell you what happened to him. He lost half a foot, muscles from his thigh and half his abdomen. He doubts he will get a job again in the same industry. His medical costs pile up. He is watching his kids grow up but, because of his injuries incurred at work through no fault of his own, he cannot share the same experiences in parenting as someone who has not been put in this situation. It is bad enough that you get injured at work, but even worse that you get injured again when Liberals get into power. If this person does not reach the 30 per cent threshold, if he were ever to return to work he would get medical payments for one year-as if your foot grows back when you get injured; as if your abdomen grows back. In Liberal land, where the workers come second, after 12 months you get it in the neck.",97

211,Ms SMYTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. Minister, what assistance is the government providing to families to help with the cost of school education? How does this build on the significant investment the government has made in school education?",100
212,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Kingsford Smith Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (14:51): I thank the member for La Trobe for her question because today the schoolkids bonus will start being paid to around 1.3 million families around Australia, benefitting over two million kids who are going to school in those families. A typical family will receive around $760 but larger families will see more. From next year the schoolkids bonus will be guaranteed-an amount of $410 per primary school student and $820 per secondary school student paid in two tranches at the beginning of term 1 and the beginning of term 3. This is because we know that Australian families do face education costs, whether it is books, whether it is track shoes for kids who are going to the sport or whether it is uniforms that kids are growing out of. This will provide much needed support for Australian families raising their kids and getting them through school. We know that the Leader of the Opposition discounted the schoolkids bonus by simply saying that Australians families would blow it on the pokies. We know that the shadow Treasurer called it a sugar hit. Even today, we had the member for Sturt weighing in and confirming that the opposition has been totally opposed and would be opposed to providing support to families in this way when he said, 'I would be very surprised if the schoolkids bonus made it through a coalition policy process.' I am not so surprised because all they seem to be able to do on that side of the parliament is say no. In this instance they have said no to providing support to Australian families who make hundreds of decisions every week about how they want to support their kidsenabling those families to be able to support their kids with education costs. I am asked how the schoolkids bonus builds on significant investment this government has made in school education. It is absolutely the case that this Labor government has made significant investments in school education, almost doubling what was spent previously by the coalition. But we have also transformed schools. So when the member for La Trobe goes into schools in her electorate she can see the benefits of some $110 million spent on 118 projects which have benefited 61 schools in her electorate. For the first time, we have a national curriculum. For the first time, we have transparency in information on the My School website. For the first time, we have a concerted effort to lift investment in digital education by providing computers for kids in schools as well because we know, in the 21st century, those skills are so important. Opposite us in this House is a coalition that has opposed the schoolkids bonus, that wants to take $2.8 billion out of education funding. But primarily it is a coalition that does not understand that we need to significantly commit ourselves to education in this House and that is what this government is doing. NA",100

214,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Acting Prime Minister, Mr Swan. I remind the Acting Prime Minister of his statement to the House on Monday that there are no plans for a detention centre in the Cocos Islands. How does he reconcile that statement with the fact, confirmed by Customs, that the current quarantine station and cyclone shelter are being considered right now for the housing of future illegal arrivals?",101
215,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for his question. I will say it again: the government is not building or operating an immigration detention centre in the Cocos Islands and has no plans to do so, which is what I said yesterday. But when they arrive, if they are not flown off the island, they have to be accommodated for a short period somewhere on the island. That is just common sense. The government has no plans to build a detention centre on the island: I want to repeat that. This is just part of the attempt by those opposite to demonise asylum seekers and conduct their political campaign. Yesterday I was asked a question about rodents on the island. I am not surprised to get that sort of question because those opposite spend so much time in the sewer. I was not surprised at all. The truth is there are no plans to build a detention centre in the Cocos Islands. Family Payments",101
216,Mr LYONS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Community Services, Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development and Minister for the Status of Women. How will the government's schoolkids bonus, which began to be delivered into the accounts of 1.3 million families today, make it easier for mothers and parents to meet their children's school costs?",101
217,Ms COLLINS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Franklin-Minister for Community Services, Minister for the Status of Women and Minister for Indigenous Employment and Economic Development) (14:57): I thank the member for Bass for his question. I know that my fellow Tasmanian understands the importance of the schoolkids bonus to the 6,900 families in his electorate and, indeed, to the more than 35,000 families in Tasmania who will be receiving this payment. I am sure the member for Bass will be interested to know that there is a total of $37 million going to families in our home state of Tasmania. This money is to help parents with the cost of essentials like schoolbooks and uniforms. We know, and parents know, that sending children to school is not cheap. This Labor government knows that. As the Minister for the Status of Women I know from talking to parents that it is often the mums who do the running around to get the kids ready for the start of the school year. We know that they do not want to have to keep track of their receipts or fill out paperwork at tax time to get some help with the schoolkids' costs. But it seems the only people who do not really understand that are those opposite, because we have had the member for Menzies here say he thinks it is actually not that difficult collect the receipts for the amount of money which is required. I think he needs to get out a bit more-he should come down to my electorate and talk to the mums at the school like I did last week. They were telling me about how difficult it is to keep track of things at the start of the school year-the school shoes, the uniforms, the books and the pencil cases. Then they have to work out which are eligible deductions, keep the receipts and remember where they put them. This government is responding to the needs of mums and dads. We understand that they are busy. Before the schoolkids bonus, 80 per cent of families were missing out on their full entitlements under the education tax refund, and this Labor government does not want families to miss out on their entitlements-the $410 per primary school child and the $820 per secondary child. That is why we are making this change from today, and people will start receiving the schoolkids bonus in their bank accounts from today. From next year, they will receive it in two payments, in January and in July. We know that this will be great for working families, particularly for those mums who are going around at the beginning of the year helping their families out. One million families will now benefit more. A typical family will get $720 extra a year. But let us be very clear about what the Leader of the Opposition is saying. He does not think that mums and dads can be trusted to spend this money appropriately. He does not understand that they are busy. He does not understand that they actually make decisions day in, day out for their families. Those opposite voted against the 1.3 million Australian families who will start receiving this bonus from today, and that is because those opposite do not think those families should have the bonus. They have voted against it. They speak negatively about it. to The member for Sturt today let the cat out of the bag-their plan is to scrap it. Immigration",101
218,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Can the minister explain why he was unable to act to use his powers under section 109 of the Migration Act to cancel Captain Emad's visa before he fled the country, and why the minister had no knowledge of the people-smuggling allegations against Captain Emad until the day before Captain Emad fled the country?",102
219,Mr BOWEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I think the member for Cook has come back to clean up the problems from yesterday, Madam Deputy Speaker. The fact of the matter is that when a visa is cancelled, or when a visa cancellation process is begun, it is a very serious matter, and it must be handled with due consideration of the facts and the case in hand. When you are considering a visa, it must be based on all the evidence before you. I asked my department to thoroughly examine the claim made by Mr Al Abbasi and then, after thoroughly examining that claim and in coordination with sister agencies overseas, the notice of intention to cancel announcement was made. There is a right way and a wrong way to cancel a visa. If you cancel it the wrong way, not only can the visa be reinstated but also the taxpayers of Australia can be required to pay very substantial compensation to the individuals concerned. If you want a tip on how not to do it, check with the member for Menzies.",102

221,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, Order! The member for Cook has asked his question. The member for Banks has the call. Electoral Reform,103
222,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity. How will the amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act currently before the Senate improve participation by Australians in our electoral system?,103
223,Mr GRAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Brand-Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (15:03): I thank the member for Banks for his question. The member for Banks has an enduring interest in electoral matters and in electoral reform, and is of course Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The bills to which he refers, if passed, will enhance the integrity of the electoral system, which depends on upon a sound electoral roll. The Australian Electoral Commission estimates that today up to 1.5 million Australian electors are not on the electoral roll-that is, 1.5 million eligible are not on the electoral roll. The ABS estimates that there are 15.7 million eligible Australians but only 14.2 million are currently on the roll. That significant gap represents an average of 10,000 people in every federal division. That gap challenges the very concept of universal adult suffrage, which has been the cornerstone of Australian electoral practice since before the creation of our Constitution. Indeed, the Constitution requires that members of this place be directly chosen by the people. The AEC acknowledges the gap. It has launched the Year of Enrolment and it has been working hard to get as many people as it possibly can to correct their enrolment or to enrol. Transactions have increased to 20,000 new enrollees or enrolment transactions per week since that campaign started. The two electoral amendment bills listed for debate in the other place, if passed, will help the AEC further close the gap for the 1.5 million electors. The bills respond to concerns from the AEC, which has for many years urged successive parliaments to take action to enhance the integrity of the Australian electoral roll. The bills will give the AEC the capacity to update the roll from third-party sources of information. These third parties will include the Australian Taxation Office, motor registries, and state and territory electoral commissionseffectively harmonising the Commonwealth electoral roll with those rolls in New South Wales and Victoria. Since the equivalent changes have been made in New South Wales and Victoria, around 100,000 new electors have been added to the roll in New South Wales alone; in Victoria, the number is probably closer to 10,000. We know that these measures work. We know that they improve the integrity of our electoral system and we know that they Australians produce a better roll. It is important to emphasise that these reforms are a safety net. The bills will not change the grounds upon which a person becomes entitled to enrol and vote. I call upon all those members opposite to support these measures as the bills retain the integrity safeguards of the current system and more. The bills are fundamental to maintaining strong levels of electoral participation and ensure the strength, resilience and integrity of our electoral law. I commend them to the House. (Time expired) Marine Conservation",103
224,Mr CHRISTENSEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities. Is the minister aware that his marine parks proposal is opposed by the Queensland Seafood Industry Association, Marine Queensland, Sunfish Queensland, the Australian Marine Alliance, the Australian Recreational Foundation, the Commonwealth Fisheries Association, the Australian Fishing Trade Association and ECOFishers Queensland? Can the minister tell the House if there is any representative organisation that has given the tick of approval to his marine parks plan other than his mates in the Australian Greens?",104
225,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (15:06): I think the best example of an endorsement that would matter to the honourable member is this one: To ensure the future health of the Coral Sea, Government's final plan must be strengthened: the proposed marine national park needs to protect more reefs and more of the deep waters that provide a blue highway for whales, turtles and other ocean giants. … … … This is one of the biggest public consultation responses in Australian conservation history. The enormous show of support includes school children, recreational fishers, divers and tourism businesses. That was written and published in the Courier-Mail by Peter Lindsay. Peter Lindsay used to be, as best as I remember, a member of parliament on that side who had a good understanding of the pristine nature",104

229,Ms SMYTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is for the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. Can the minister outline the support that is apparent for the National Broadband Network?",104
230,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Water, Transport) (15:08): I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. Indeed there is a great deal of support for the National Broadband Network out there-the National Broadband Network, which people know the will transform communications not just in terms of overcoming the tyranny of distance between ourselves as an island continent with a vastly spread population but also with our neighbours in the fastest-growing region of the world, right here in Asia. That is why we want to bring Australia into the 21st century after the 19 failed plans of those opposite and develop an appropriate national broadband network. Yesterday up in the Federation Chamber I had the opportunity, as the minister representing Senator Conroy, to hear representations about the Broadband Network. Members will not be surprised that the backbenchers on this side of the House were pretty keen on the NBN, but what was surprising was that some people on the other side were pretty keen as well. The member for Forde was pretty keen on the National Broadband Network. That did not surprise me that much; I do not know him that well. But I must say I am surprised by the question of the member for Mitchell earlier on in parliament today which shows he pays attention to pamphlets that go out to electorates. He might like to pay attention to his own pamphlets. Here he is, Alex Hawke MP, federal member for Mitchell: 'Mitchell misses out on NBN'. 'The following suburbs: Baulkham Hills, Beaumont Hills, Bella Vista, Box Hill, Kellyville, Maraylya, Northmead, North Rocks, Rouse Hills and the vital Norwest Business Park.' So they come in here, they vote against it, they rail against it, they offer it up in even though it is off budget because it is an investment that will deliver a return to the government, but they get basic economics wrong. They are in here bagging it, but out there in their electorates the member for Mitchell is at the forefront saying, 'Give us the NBN.' You cannot have it both ways. This Leader of the Opposition runs, but he cannot hide, and we will hold him to account over the NBN, over the price on carbon and over all the other scare campaigns. We will also hold the Three Stooges to account for the $70 billion black hole.",104

238,Mr MORRISON,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yesterday in the House the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship stated that I had taken out of savings context things said by his ministerial colleagues. The things that I referred to in my question said that Captain Emad, also known as Ali Al Abassi, was on the movement alert list. I refer to the statement made by the Minister for Home Affairs, and I made reference to that in the question. On 8 June 2012, the Minister for Home Affairs gave an interview with Fran Kelly and made reference to the movement alert list. The ministers would be aware that there is only watch list that is run by the government that is called the movement alert list. The Minister for Home Affairs said: What happens is that we've got a movement alert list. And he's been on that movement alert list, like a number of people across the country, for some time. Clearly, yesterday it was the minister who was in error, and he was seeking to contradict his own Minister for Home Affairs.",105

I argued the case against this and said: … except this is yet another Labor liewhich it isIf Wayne Swan had bothered to punch the numbers into his calculator he would have realised the price increases due to Labor's carbon tax make up almost half of the total price rise for NSW electricity customers.",106

250,Mr HOCKEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Okay. The Treasurer said, and I said: According to the latest Consumer Price Index figures, electricity prices in Sydney have risen 66% since Federal Labor came to power. This increase because of the carbon tax just adds further to cost of living pressures for Australian households.

Question agreed to. NA NA Marine Conservation,114
267,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," I have received a letter from the honourable member for Wide Bay proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The adverse impact on fishing and coastal communities of the Government's marine reserve declarations I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",114
268,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE," The government's unilateral decree to lock up another 1.3 million square kilometres of our seas, more than doubling the number of marine reserves from 27 to 60, has nothing to do with sustainably managing marine environments or fisheries. It is just another empty gesture for the environment; but it is certainly a barb for many coastal regions. This has a lot more to do with hooking a few Greens preferences at the next election or renting the Greens support for another week in this parliament than it has to do with anything about the environment-and that is the real catch. But it has real consequences for Australian commercial and recreational fishers and the regional communities which support them. When 'lock it up!' is the government's approach to vast areas of Australia's territorial waters, is it any wonder that our supermarkets are overflowing with imported seafood? It is a remarkable fact that Australia imports a massive 72 per cent of the seafood we eat. For a vast island nation surrounded by sea, that is simply bizarre. We control much of the area of the planet's oceans. Australia's exclusive economic zone in terms of sheer scale is third in the world behind only the United States and France, yet we are not allowed to feed ourselves with our own fish. There is no doubt, of course, that we must conserve our oceans and be conscious of the breeding grounds and the seasons so that they can be sensibly harvested. Indeed, to swim or snorkel or dive on the Great Barrier Reef is one of the truly remarkable experiences of life. The wonders of our oceans and the reefs are truly awe-inspiring and they must always be preserved. Our fishing industry understands this only too well and is at the forefront of managing sustainable fisheries. Our recreational fishers and our marine tourism industries understand that the value of their entire industry is dependent upon having a sustainable environment, but they have been ignored. The government's claim of consultation is a sham. Nor has there been any attempt to justify these new parks on the basis of science or transparent evidence. At no stage has there been fair dinkum feedback or a cruel willingness to listen to the communities. Rather we have seen bureaucrats descend on communities and lecture people about what to expect. They have not been genuinely engaged in taking on board industry or recreational fishers or community concerns. In reality, the government has no appetite to negotiate on the details of its marine parks decree. The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has presented it to the people, the businesses and the community as a fait accompli, saying to take it or leave it. There is supposed to be a 60-day consultation period but in his media release on 14 June 2012 the minister said: It's too late for people to say I want this shifted or I want this zone painted a different colour. The question now is very straightforward: do we go ahead with the most comprehensive marine park network in the world or do we not? Minister, is there going to be a genuine consultation period or is there not? If your press release is be relied upon, then the issues are all closed, and the government is not going to even listen to the concerns of people who are affected. The extension of Australia's system of marine reserves according to the Pew Environment Group is a consequence: … of a determined coalition of 15 Australian international conservation groups … This coalition was made up of almost half foreign groups, funded from overseas and doing very little in their own countries sometimes about creating environmental and sustainable fisheries, but seeking to impose upon Australia an enormous addition to our environmental reserves. Between them these sorts of people are opposed to virtually every element of human existence. They want to ban wild catch fisheries, yet they oppose virtually every aquaculture application that is ever proposed. They do not want us to eat meat, they do not want us to use farmed animals and they do not want us to harvest native animals. They do not want us to grow crops because crops might use water or fertiliser or chemicals. Well, what are we expected to live on in this country if every hectare of sea and of land is to be declared a national park? Over the last 30 years Australia has led the way in developing management plans for the sustainable use of our fishery resources. Since the introduction of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, all Commonwealth fisheries have been required not only to guarantee the line sustainability of the targeted fisheries but also to ensure the sustainability of the impact of removing target stock on other species. This might be the impact of predators of that stock or the impacts of bycatch populations. A comprehensive investment by Australia in the use of bycatch reducing devices and innovative fishing practices to eliminate the interaction of iconic non-target species like sea birds, turtles and seals have now been adopted and recognised around the world as the best sustainable fishing practice. We do not see the propaganda of the Labor government and the Greens showing images of whiting or flathead or prawns. and Instead we have pictures of seals, manta rays, turtles and seahorses. No-one in the scientific community would suggest that these are being exploited by Australian fisheries or that they are at risk in any Australian jurisdiction. The reality is the Australian people were taken aback when the government chose its location for this great announcement. It was an aquarium with a backdrop of stingrays and coral and conveniently passing turtles. These species are not at threat. It will be no surprise to both coastal communities and recreational fishers that they have never targeted any of these creatures by their activities.  through to the Coral Sea.",114
269,Mr TRUSS,IMPORTANCE,"If you go to the Coral Sea declaration, the eastern boundary of the declared closure adjoins waters that are heavily finished by foreign fishing vessels. We know that the presence of Australian vessels is something of a deterrent to fleets targeting our fish in our own waters. That has to be the case because the government has so downgraded surveillance of our fisheries that there is going to be no-one there to actually supervise and ensure that other countries simply do not take up the fish that we are seeking to preserve. With the level of surveillance we have on our waters at the present time, the only vessels that will be fishing in these new marine reserves will be those who are not Australian. Other vessels will simply come in and take the fish that we have nicely fattened up for them in our reserves and they will sell them on around the world. The government cannot have a credible reserve policy unless it also has an appropriate surveillance policy. For as long as I can remember, I have been listening to claims by environmental extremists that the Great Barrier Reef is being destroyed, it is being ruined. They claim the crown-of-thorns starfish destroyed the whole Barrier Reef at least five times a year, if you listen to the media. The coal mining is going to destroy the reef, the ships running aground have destroyed the reef-all 2,000 kilometres of it. Captain Cook ran aground there. That must have destroyed the reef as well. The farmers, of course, are always destroying the reef with chemicals and fertilisers. The tourists destroy it, the dams and the urban development destroy it. The droughts, when there is not enough water for it, destroy it. When there are floods, it gets destroyed again. If you listen to the environmental groups, the Great Barrier Reef has been destroyed every year. You know, when I visit the reef, it is just as beautiful. magnificent and awe-inspiring as it has ever been-a true wonder of the world that needs to be looked after and needs to be carefully managed. But what this government is doing is in fact damaging the capacity to manage that area rather than enhancing it. We all know that the Coral Sea declaration is not about protecting the environment; it is about green votes. In May 2009 the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts used emergency provisions in the EPBC Act that gave him the ability to declare a conservation zone. The conservation zone provisions are meant to provide emergency protection over an area-protection from some sudden, unexpected, emergent threat-to give the minister some breathing space to consider what long-term protection might be needed. This move was a clear and obvious abuse of the act. There was no emerging threat. There was none. There were no applications for new fishing licences, no applications for mining. There was nothing. The minister did not even try to make one up. He just abused the act. According to marine scientist Professor Ray Hilborn, from the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences at the University of Washington, the motives for nongovernment organisations going into denial about the fisheries management in Australia are deplorable. He recognised our fisheries management as the best in the world. I have heard the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities proudly boast that our fisheries management is the best in the world and I agree with him. But Australia has been subject to a relentless antifishing campaign that is causing the doom and gloom myths from misrepresentations of overseas examples of inadequate fisheries management. Hanging up a 'no-fishing' sign over so much of Australia's coastline is just another stunt so the Prime Minister can laud herself at the United Nations Rio Plus 20 conference in Brazil this week. She is now tired of lecturing Europeans on economic management. After all, with her $174 billion deficits, she does not have much to boast about. On fisheries management we do have a lot to boast about, but the Prime Minister is going to overlook that and instead look to the massive increase in areas that are being locked up around Australia's coastline. As I said before, we import 72 per cent of the seafood we eat, despite having one of the largest fishing zones in the world. In 200910 Australia produced 171,000 tonnes of seafood from wild catch. These statistics are stunning. By comparison, New Zealand's catch was 441,000 tonnes, from an area half as big as Australia's. They caught three times as many fish in an area half the size. Thailand catches 14 times more fish than we do, despite having a fishing area 10 times smaller than ours. So it is not hard to see the government's marine park declarations have nothing to do with environmental management of our seas. We are exporting our demand for seafood to countries less concerned about marine management than we are. Australia harvests fewer than 30 kilograms of fish per square kilometre of its ocean territory, compared to a global average 20 times greater than that, at around 750 kilograms per square kilometre. So we are not raping and pillaging our fisheries. There is no-one in the world that can match our management record, but there is a human cost. About 100,000 people are still left directly employed in the Australian fishing industry and 3.4 million people engage in recreational fishing each year. Senator Conroy confirmed in the Senate on Monday that these parks will have a significant impact on the recreational fisheries. In fact, recreational fishermen, in an area inside 100 kilometres from shore, will be shut out of a staggering 63,000 square kilometres. So the reality is that this will have an effect on fishermen, their families and their communities. Labor is penalising the wrong people. Australian fishers have been doing the right thing, going about their business in a sustainable and environmentally conscious way. Now, all they are going to be offered is some more compensation. Some of these people have already had several lots of compensation. They have been moved from place to place. I acknowledge that sometimes it was at the hands of our government. But at least under our government $250 million worth of compensation was supplied-not that that was much comfort to the families who had been so adversely affected. But this government is now offering only about a third of that amount of compensation-we are told $100 millionand yet the area to be affected is vastly that greater. It is clear that there will not be decent compensation available to all those fishermen affected, let alone to the communities around Australia which have been adversely affected. This is a policy response that is in search of a problem. The problem is not that Australian's waters are overfished. We harvest only 30 kilograms of fish per square kilometre. The global average, as I said before, is 20 times greater. We import so much of the fish that we eat. We are now going to import it from fisheries that do not have the standards of management that we have in this country. So, please, Minister, do not respond flippantly. Many families and businesses are affected. Some have already been hurt many times. The majority of fishermen have already left the industry, but there are many who will want to continue to work in this industry. We should certainly not be expected to continually increase our reserve areas just because environmentalists demand more and more and more.",115
270,Mr BURKE,IMPORTANCE,"Watson-Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Population and Communities) (15:35): It is a pleasure to be here today and have the opportunity to respond to the MPI from the member for Wide Bay. I think there are some very useful things I could do elsewhere, but it is always a pleasure to be here with you. You get about as much sunshine in the meeting room over there as I expect you do in a meeting room over here, but it is a pleasure to be here in tropical Canberra. I want to deal with a few issues at the start that were raised by the member for Wide Bay. First of all, the claim that there is a lack of a scientific basis for the work that is being undertaken is more than a little bit silly. The member for Wide Bay, Leader of the Nationals, may well presume that the document I held up in question time, I think, two days ago with a photograph of the member for Wentworth in it is the only document underpinning the science as the basis for the decisions that are in front of us. Of course, the document that I held up was in relation to the scientific work that had been undertaken only on the south-west marine region. But similar volumes have been done, all of which are available publicly for the east marine region, the north marine region and the north-west marine region. We then had the additional drafts for consultation, which have been done across the north-west, north, south-west and temperate east regions. You cannot judge quality of science by the kilo, but it is a lot more than what the member for Wide Bay was wanting to claim in terms of scientific underpinnings. At the core of the argument that the member for Wide Bay has put-and I think it is important for us to deal with this directly-is a presumption that this is a fisheries management decision. The member Water, for Wide Bay knows full well and he would not have to talk to the member for Wentworth for very long to understand that this is not a fisheries management decision; it is not done for those purposes. The science underpinning it is not done that way-in the same way as the science you do when you determine where a national park will be is different from the science you do when you work out whether or not a state forest is being overharvested. It is the exact same principle. You have your overharvesting rates in a state forest, where you know how hard you can go to make it work sustainably. That is how our fisheries are managed, and our fisheries are managed under those methods very, very well. If you do not have a policy belief that there is a value in having some areas of our land and of our oceans preserved as national parks then you would never support the sort of science on which this is based. But if you have a view, which most Australians do have, that there is actually value not in having the whole country as state forests but in having some areas reserved as national parks, in picking some areas that you reserve for nature-if you see value in that-then that is where you get the difference in the scientific underpinnings of this. You could run an argument that says, 'But the Royal National Park could be sustainably harvested,' and there would be a pace at which you could do it. But you would wreck something pristine and magnificent, and you would do something that Australians do not believe ought to happen. That is the principle. That is the basis of the decisions that have been made with respect to our oceans. I do have to remind the Leader of the Nationals when he talks about how close in these areas are with respect toMr Ian Macfarlane interjecting",118
271,Mr BURKE,IMPORTANCE,"The desperation from the member for Groom really says it all. Please do not remind us how far out these areas are. If you are in Airlie Beach, to get to one of the new areas of protection you have to travel for 340 kilometres. If you are in Brisbane, you have to travel for 445 kilometres. If you are in Bundaberg, you have to travel for 492 kilometres before you get to a place where you cannot drop a line. I had a question yesterday from the member representing the area of Darwin, the member for Solomon, where the distance to get to the nearest spot where you cannot drop a line is 680 kilometres. We had photographs in the West Australian-which I am sure delighted members of the opposition-when the maps were put out which showed people casting a line from the beach, with a headline as to how people were going to be denied access to fishing. Now I know there are people who can cast a line a fair way, and I have checked: the world record goes just under 250 metres. But if you went out as far as the longest cast can go and you kept going and you kept going and you kept going, after about 30 casts off the Western Australian coast, you may well get to an area where it is a problem to drop a line. On the Queensland coast, you are looking at a massively greater distance. So, please, do not pretend that for the ordinary recreational fisher they are somehow locked out of fishing. The Leader of the Nationals talked about a no-fishing sign up on our coastline-on our coastline! Unless he has some concept that when you stand on the coastline you are actually looking at something that far beyond the horizon then the argument is misleading in the extreme, and the Leader of the Nationals knows it. There have been some issues raised. Some members of parliament who have gamefishing tourism operations in their electorates have questioned to what extent these could have an impact within the Coral Sea, because I have added a number of reefs-Osprey, Vema, Shark, Bougainville and Marion reefs-to what was originally in the draft maps. I would ask members to have a think about what sort of fish those game-boat operators go out to catch, because they do not go out travelling and powering out for more than a day in order to catch the reef fish that they could have caught in fishing zones in the Great Barrier Reef. If they are going all that way out, then they are going out for the big pelagic fish; that is what they are going out for-chasing the marlin and those sorts of tours. Have a look at the maps. With the exception of Bougainville Reef and the northernmost end of Osprey Reef, when you look at the rest of the maps you will see that the shape of the highly protected zone follows very close in, within the contours of the reef. And the recreational fishing organisations understand this. Some of the game-boat operators have been told things that are false, but if they go through the maps they will see that. Bougainville is different; Bougainville has been done in a square. But that is a much smaller reef than the others and not a particular spot where you have tourism operations. But if you actually have a look at how the maps have been drawn for those big pelagic game-fishing operations, they have not been drawn in a way that will cause any challenges for them in being able to have those fishing tours. They will not be able to go to the key dive sites where the areas are further out because, once you do get a few hundred metres away from the reef, at those points, you are much less likely to catch a big pelagic fish. But, as you get further south on Osprey and as you go through Shark, Vema and down to Marion, you do get close enough that those tours will still be able to run. There has been a lot of misinformation given to those individual businesses. But all I would say is: for the best evidence, go and have a look at the maps themselves. I was asked in question time today, and it is relevant to now: 'What are the views of the different organisations?' I was asked for just one. I thought Peter Lindsay was not a bad one, as someone who was as representative as somebody could be within this parliament, but I accept the criticism that the Liberal National Party is not a representative organisation. I fully accepted the point of order that was taken. So let us look at some of the people who actually live in those electorates. Col MCKenzie, the deputy director of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators said: I am sure there are some fishing charter operators who will be concerned actually improve tourism generally from the fact it will increase Australia's profile overseas, particularly among high-end tourists who have high environmental awareness. Chris Makepeace, Executive Officer of the Amateur Fishermen's Association of the Northern Territory said, 'Basically, there is virtually no impact for recreational fishermen in the Northern Territory, and that is good news.' Paul Anderson, Eurobodalla Shire Council General Manager, said the changes were not likely to have a big impact on recreational fishing in the area. Darren Kindleysides of the Australian Marine Conservation Society said: 'This is a landmark announcement for our seas and one of the most significant advances for environmental protection in Australia's history.' Daniel Gschwind, the Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief, said: 'Most concerns on better protection of reefs, dive sites and game boat access had been met and this was welcome.' Then there is Tony Lagana, manager of the Bermagui Fisherman's Co-op, and this is from the commercials. He said: It is a good outcome for the far south coast (of NSW). We have had a lot of discussion with the government and Tony Burke has done a great job for Bermagui. That is my favourite of the quotes! We are dealing with an opposition that dearly wants to run a line that you can no longer go to the end of a jetty and drop a line. The problem is that in Australia we do not have jetties that long. In Australia we do not have jetties that go for the full length of a state border. We do not have jetties in Australia that reach these sorts of watersand most wreck fishers never get out to these waters at all. The ones who do, if they are in a commercial operation, are chasing the large pelagic fish that they will still be able to access everywhere other than at the principal . . . but it will dive sites. No matter how many times the National Party try to dress this issue up as though it is something about minor parties in this parliament, make no mistake, environmental protection for more than three decades has been a cornerstone of what Labor does. We do not need to feel there is some sort of pressure from any other party in this place. The Greens, let us not forget, were critical of these proposals when they came out. What we have here is something proudly in the Labor tradition of environmental reform. We do not need to feel that there is some sort of pressure out there. This is what Labor does-in the tradition of the party that saved the Franklin, in the tradition of the party that saved the Daintree and in the tradition of the party that protected Coronation Hill and made sure that we expanded Kakadu National Park. Every time we did one of those things, those opposite ridiculed it and those opposite opposed itevery single time. When we said we were going to protect the environment, those opposite said: 'It will be a disaster and you can't do it.' They have done this every time, without exception. When it was the Franklin, they said no. When it was the Daintree, they said no. When it was Kakadu, they said no. We now talk about being the world leader on protection of the oceans, and what did they say? No. That is the only way they ever respond to environmental reform. Then they will come up with some sort of plan at election time where, in a few suburbs here and there, they will go around planting a whole lot of trees-and that apparently makes them good environmental warriors! The public is onto the con. The public realises the environmental vandalism that lies at the heart of the arguments put by opposite. The public understands that, effectively, the view of the oceans put by those opposite is that they should do less than what happened under the Howard government. The arguments they put forward mean the member for Wentworth would never have taken action in the south east at all. It would have been done on the basis of fisheries management, which effectively means the entirety of our oceans get run as though they are nothing more than a water version of a state forest. This side of the parliament understands there is essential value in some parts of our planet being pristine. We have an understanding that Australians-as a nation of people who not exclusively but overwhelmingly live along our coastlineshare a relationship with our oceans and they value them being protected. To establish a national parks estate in our oceans is something sufficiently good that Labor stands here and does it. It is something sufficiently right that Australia has no hesitation, under a Labor government, of being the world leader. It is something which those opposite know strikes a chord with Australians-sufficiently strongly that not one of them has said they have the guts to undo it. So they are playing the same old pattern. Did they, when they got into government, try to undo the Franklin? They made all the noises about it but when it came to it they knew that we were on the right of history. Did they end up revisiting Joh BjelkePetersen's ideas to clear-fell parts of the Daintree rainforest to make it a major residential development? They railed against it for years. They are railing against it right now. Did they have the guts to write to the World Heritage Committee and ask for it to be delisted? Absolutely not. Did they then those want to turn Coronation Hill back into a uranium mine and undo the work of Kakadu National Park? Not a chance. Then we have the crocodile tears they cry right now-all backed up with a campaign trying to make people believe a lie, trying to make wreck fishers believe that there are impacts they know are not there, trying to run an argument that says there will be an impact on commercial fisheries way beyond one to two per cent of the gross value of production. They try to make up every single argument but, at the heart of it, if they believed a word, if they believed that they were on the right side of history with those sorts of mincing words, they would promise to undo it. Listen to the next speakers. Ask why none of them have done it. Ask why, when it was so important for me to be here this week, not one frontbencher was willing to chance their own to ask a question about it. Why have they put it all off to the backbench and let them run their local stories but not one person from the front-bench put themselves forward? It is because they know the core question to them is: Would you undo it?",119
272,Mr RAMSEY,IMPORTANCE," I rise to speak on this matter of very great importance to the public. The widespread proposals for locking up millions of square kilometres of Australia's waters by the environment minister, Tony Burke, is yet another grandsweeping statement-one of those grand gestures from Labor. In harness with Christine Milne and the Greens, Tony Burke has decided that he, the minister, is going to single-handedly save Australian waters from the marauders. He has a bit of form in this area. He was previously the minister for agriculture and four years ago he led a delegation to discuss Australia's southern bluefin tuna quotas, along with that other great green warrior, the now education minister, Peter Garrett. He meekly surrendered almost 30 per cent of Australia's tuna quota. He was out of step then and the science was out of step. It was later proved tuna numbers were well and truly on the increase already. Some of that quota has been returned already. This minister was on the wrong side of science then and he is on the wrong side of it again. We do not know as much about our deep waters in Australia's care as we would like to. In fact, this grand statement has the possibility of becoming another monument to the government like the Building the Education Revolution or even perhaps the Prime Minister's own favourite, Medicare Gold-you might remember that one-or pink batts. In fact, there are many in the industry who maintain that this park declaration is the new live cattle dispute. The focus has been on the Coral Sea, and I will briefly touch on that before I get to South Australian waters. Walter Starck, from the Townsville based Australian Environment Foundation-and, according to Keith De Lacy, the former Labor Treasurer of Queensland, one of the foremost proponents, one of the greatest experts in this area-has said: ... well-managed reefs around the world can sustain an average seafood harvest rate of 15,000kg per square kilometre per annum. The average harvest rate for the Great Barrier Reef is 9kg. That's right, 9kg, or if you like a minuscule 90g per hectare. That is really walloping the waters, isn't it? He says further: Australia has by far the largest per capita fishing zone in the world yet we import two-thirds of our seafoodIn fact, he is not quite correct; I think it is 72 per cent. So we are underperforming in a major way in our Australian waters. We import 72 per cent of our seafood from countries that are overpopulated and are probably overfishing their waters. If the government were really serious about saving fish in the world, they would ban seafoodbut I do not see them sticking their hand up for that. I will turn to South Australia, my home state. My electorate of Grey contains around 70 per cent of the coastline. So, consequently, we have a fair bit of the fishing. The South Australian marine industry and our aquaculture industry are centres of excellence. They are well managed by anybody's standards and, in fact, are recognised around the world for their fisheries management. The wild catch in South Australia is worth around $300 million per annum and the aquaculture contribution is around $200 million. You might think that is not linked but it is, because the bulk of the aquaculture comes from farmed tuna; in fact, initially wild caught tuna-something I spoke about before with respect to the minister's previous decisions. It is a very interesting industry. They steam hundreds of kilometres into the Great Australian Bight, where a very sophisticated surveillance system identifies the schools of tuna. The fishermen net them and then drag the tuna hundreds of kilometres back to Point Lincoln where they are grown out in tuna farms. That industry was developed because that fishery, during the seventies, was fished to the point of extinction. At one time fishermen were catching around 40,000 tonnes a year and then it crashed. The fishermen, the industry and the government recognised that we had a serious problem and that is when serious fisheries management was put into place, the farms were established and the industry has recovered. In fact, we have never fished any species in South Australian waters into extinction. At the same time as the Commonwealth is planning its new parks, in a related matter, the South Australian government have been on the same boat. They have been out there declaring marine parks willy-nilly all over the place. In fact, they wanted to lock up 40 per cent of state waters in marine parks-19 marine parks, 16 of which are in my electorate of Grey. I can tell you that there has been absolute public outrage, and it is being reignited by the Commonwealth's grab for an enormous patch of water around Australia. The public outrage has forced the state government back to the renegotiation process-back to the drawing board. The Australian Marine Alliance CEO, Dean Logan, has said South Australia will be hit by a double whammy with state and federal marine parks joining up. I told you a bit about the tuna. Let me you about another fishery on my patch, and that is the South Australian Spencer Gulf prawn fishers. There are 39 boats operating in this industry and they turn around about $40 million a year. They are in state waters, but this is one of the best managed fisheries in the world. I have been on board these prawn trawlers. With every drag of prawns they deliver on deck, they report back to the fleet commander on the size and the quantity they have managed to fish in that area and, as soon as the size drops, they pull out of the area; as soon as the quantity drops, they pull out of the area. This is incredibly sophisticated and well managed, and it has industry backing. This is the kind of management we see across South Australian waters, and the fishing is not under pressure at any point. The rock lobster industry is well managed and the abalone industry is well managed. The minister was just on his feet a few minutes ago telling us that the new parks are not about fish; this is not about fisheries management. Well what on earth is it about? Once you get into these off-coast waters, noone else goes there. It is only the commercial fishermen. These are the industries that sustain Australia. I do not think in many cases we fully understand what is in these waters. Let me tell you another thing about the tuna industry: the tuna's food once in the fish farms is pilchards. We import most of our pilchards, for crying out loud. A pilchard industry has been established near Point Lincoln. Because of the price of imported pilchards, they can only afford to steam around 150 kilometres before they return to Port Lincoln. Going further-to 200 kilometres-it starts to become too expensive to harvest them. Around 10 or 12 years ago we had an enormous kill-off of pilchards. They tell virtually disappeared from our waters. This was a great calamity. No-one knew what caused it, but there was this enormous killoff of pilchards and we wondered how quickly stocks would recover. It recovered in about four months. You could not find a pilchard in the water, and four months later they were back again. There is only one explanation for that: it is actually part of a far, far bigger fishery than was previously understood. That has not led to a greatly expanded pilchard fishery as yet because of the economic concerns that I outlined. But it shows us that we do not fully understand what fish species and what numbers are in these areas that the minister wants to now lock up and make sure that no-one ever even finds out. When it comes to compensation, the South Australian industry has lodged a claim against the South Australian government for $500 million worth of damage for losses due to the state marine parks. The federal minister has said, 'Well, $100 million will be enough for all of Australia.' In fact, the estimate is-this is Dean Logan again-40 times that amount, around $4 billion. I would like to read a little bit from Brian Jeffriess, who fronts up the tuna fishermen's association, but is a good spokesman for a lot of South Australian fisheries. He said: … The Government has acted very logically in fisheries management up until now - this was never required, … What is symbolic about this is in the minister's statement itself - all this about the biggest and best, the biggest and best in the world and you have to believe that's what it's about, beating your chest in front of the rest world rather than good ecosystem management. (Time expired)  with great enthusiasm that I rise to speak on this matter of public importance put forward by the Leader of the Nationals, Mr Truss, on the adverse impact on fishing and coastal communities of the government's marine reserve declarations. I deliberately wanted to read out the title, because anyone listening to the previous speakers from the Liberal National Party coalition would notice that they have not actually touched on that at all. They have been spinning a yarn and trying to engage politically, but they are not actually going to the respected science in this whole process and the actual consequences. Let us get a bit of the history on the record straight away. This process has been underway since Prime Minister Paul Keating was in the Lodge. Since then, there was a Liberal-National Party coalition in government for 12 years. They oversaw the same process, the same regime, the same science and the same process in terms of compensation. So let's get the facts on the table right from the start. We have had crazy suggestions in question time from, I think, the member for Dawson, that there are no collective groups that actually support this process. I just looked through my Courier Mail-I do actually read the Courier Mail, the paper of record in the great state of Queensland. It is worth having a look at it, because there is a full-page ad from 19 and 20 MayMr Ian Macfarlane interjecting interjection from the member for Groom. It is a full-page ad that says 'It is time to protect Australia's Coral Sea'. If you had been reading the Courier Mail, you would have seen it. This is by Gary Heilman from of the DeBrett seafood and on behalf of the longline fishermen in the Coral Sea. It is cosigned by Daniel Gschwind, the CEO of Queensland Tourism Industry Council, and Mike Ball from Mike Ball Dive Expeditions. So the reality is there has been a great consultation process overseen by the Keating, Howard, Rudd and Gillard governments. Why is it important to get the facts on the table upfront? Because the reality is that, when it comes to protecting the environment-something we take very seriously as parliamentarians-when you strip out the politics, both sides of the chamber in Australian politics respect the environment and do our bit. Australia is a nation where most of us have come from across the sea. Our roots go across the sea; 98 per cent of Australians have roots stretching across the sea. We know that the ocean is important. Australia is responsible for 11 per cent of the world's surface-an incredible amount of the world that we look after. We are a trading nation, so we understand how important it is to make sure that we have good connections with the rest of the world but we also know how these opportunities to protect the environment only come along every now and then. We heard the environment minister, Minister Burke, talk about those great moments in history-the Franklin, and those other ones-where people made decisions. I seem to recall it was actually the environment minister, Mr Newman, the father of Campbell Newman, the Queensland Premier, who actually took on Joh BjelkePetersen over something called Fraser Island, and said: 'No, Joh, you've got it wrong. You don't just strip-mine the lot. We are actually going to protect this significant piece of Australia.' That is the approach to significant blocks of earth of Australia that can only have certain biodiversity. You protect it for our children. So thank goodness that the environment minister, Mr Newman, had the courage to stand up to Joh Bjelke-Petersen. This is our chance to be that brave and protect the planet. I was up at the War Memorial yesterday laying a wreath with a veteran of the Coral Sea-Hollyoak was his name. When you have the RSL, the French government through New Caledonia, the Howard government and the Labor Party all on the same ticket, it takes a special Leader of the Opposition to break that unity ticket. When you can get the French and the RSL and the Labor Party and the Howard government all on the one page, and then get Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, to come in and break ranks with that unity ticket, that is a special knack; that really is incredible. Why is that? Let's have a look. Let's go back to the 2010 election and Senator Boswell's duplicitous campaign in Queensland. It was a very sneaky, quick campaign that we did not have a chance to rebut. It did not get a lot of traction in Moreton; that is why I am here telling you the truth. Perhaps in Bonner it did get a little bit more traction. Thankfully Moreton is a little bit far away from the jetties where people go off into Moreton Bay, despite the name of the electorate. The reality is that Senator Boswell managed to fool some people hook, line and sinker and say that there was going to be no fishing basically because of the Labor-Greens alliance. It was disgraceful misrepresentation. Mr Ian Macfarlane: You said there would be no carbon tax.  price carbon; that is what we said. The reality is that we went to the 2007 election saying that we would price carbon, and that is what we have achieved. You know, member for Groom; you were in the negotiations. I heard those negotiations in Taipei. So, remember that we did have a CPRS deal where we priced carbon and, but for one vote in the coalition party roomwhere someone actually spoiled a ballot paper because they could not vote for Turnbull or Abbott-we would have had a CPRS. If we had had the Greens vote along with the vote of Senator Sue Boyce from Queensland, who had the courage to join Senator Troeth from Victoria, we would have a CPRS and Tony Abbott would be consigned to the pages of history. The protection of the Coral Sea and the seas in the rest of Australian is a great moment in the history of this parliament. We can actually protect something for our children and our grandchildren. The reality is that we are yet to see the emails flowing into our offices from people saying, 'We can't go fishing.' The electorate of Moreton is a long way from the Coral Sea, but I am proud to say I married a North Queenslander, a Trinity Bay High girl from Cairns. All my in-laws are in Tully, Babinda and Innisfail and they have tinnies, and they go fishing. They go to the reefs. But I can tell you that they do not go 450 kilometres out. I trust my in-laws-mostly!-but I am not going 450 kilometres out in any tinny; I can tell you that. The reality is that we will still be able go fishing. There is a great history, going back to Lee Marvin. If you go to beach resorts you can see those photos of Lee Marvin. Back in the seventies fishing was bringing Hollywood to North Queensland. Tourists went out after these pelagic fish; they went to catch marlin. Since then North Queensland has been world famous, when it comes to bringing tourists in. And this legislation will complement it. That is why you have Mike Ball, from Mike Ball Dive Expeditions saying, proudly, 'Get this done.' We will have a great product to sell around the world. North Queensland is suffering at the moment in terms of jobs and tourism. Mr Christensen interjecting part of the product. It is niche tourism than the mass brand. We have to have a niche market, and North Queensland can market itself as the pristine environment. The reality is",122
273,Mr Christensen,IMPORTANCE,"Very niche!  member for Dawson's concerns that he will not be able to stand on the beach at Mackay and cast 450 kilometres out to the Coral Sea as he used to! He will have to go out with an expedition or the like. The reality is that the Coral Sea marine reserve is important in so many ways. The scientists agree-the same scientists that advised the Howard government. It was the same process that the Howard government went through, when that crazy left-wing environment ministerMs Livermore: Kemp!  get the brothers mixed up. He understood. Peter Lindsay-for heaven's sake!recognised that this was something to be proud of and that we should be taking a step to in history and doing the right thing. I would suggest that he was not exactly a crazy leftwinger!",126
274,Mr Christensen,IMPORTANCE,"Well interjection from the member for Dawson. He knows him a bit better than me, obviously. This is the right thing to do in this parliament's history and we should be signing up for it proudly.",126
275,Mr NEVILLE,IMPORTANCE," As a person who lives at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef and in close proximity to the Coral Sea, I have found this debate extraordinary. Before I got into parliament my job was in regional development-specifically, in industry and tourism. So I know a bit about the Great Barrier Reef and the coastal areas rather of Queensland; they were my bread and butter, so to speak. I was in on the early days of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. So I do not come to this debate with any sense of ignorance and I am not speaking against science. But I have seen the most vibrant fishing industry in Australia decimated over the last 15 years. It has been decimated by bureaucracy and government intervention. We first had a thing called the east coast trawl plan. Under the east coast trawl plan a decision by the federal and state governments took out 250 of the 750 vessels trawling along the Queensland coast. In fact, when the compensation was paid it was actually 40 more than that-290 came out. It meant a substantial decrease in effort. Not long after that, we were told that the reef was now sustainable and that fishing could go ahead, but that GBRMPA would need another small amount-perhaps about 20 per cent. People, in good faith, said, 'Well, I suppose that's fair enough.' But when the maps came out it was not 20 per cent; it was 34 per cent. And frequently those fishing areas-the green zones that were put into the Barrier Reef Marine Park-were right over traditional fishing areas. In fact, is alleged that the log books of the fishermen were used to some extent to plot these areas. The spanner crab industry off Bundaberg won an award as the best controlled fishery for the year before it was closed. How silly can you get? We then had to have another reduction. It worked out in my area-the southern end of the reef: fishermen from Gladstone, Bundaberg, Harvey Bay, Tin Can Bay and perhaps some even down to Mooloolabathat the fishing industry was reduced by 73 per cent or 74 per cent. On top of that we had the state government saying, 'We want to have complementary state zones,' which diminished still further the area available for fishing. A lot of people, with those earlier compensations, bought vessels that could go into the Coral Sea. But now they are also going to be excluded-or, if not excluded, almost totally contained. Not that many people go there. About 20 entities go into the Coral Sea. A maximum of about 30 to 32 vessels are spread out across 1.3 million square kilometres-half the size of the state of Queensland. That is the size of the area we are talking about. As someone said earlier, there is no way in the world that the state or the Commonwealth are going to be able to control or look after this fishery, and imposing these rigid rules on ourselves is creating an absolute motza for people who want to come in on the northern side of the Coral Sea and fish the ones we have fattened up for them. What sort of idiots are we? You might say: 'Paul, you're generalising a bit. Where's your scientific proof?' Professor Walter Starck has had 50 years experience as a marine scientist. He has a PhD from the University of Miami. He is totally familiar with our environment. What he said about this is: it Australia's fishing industry is under threat, not from depleted fish stocks but from governmentfinanced and sanctioned extreme environmentalismnote that, 'extreme environmentalism'and crippling bureaucratic controls. Interestingly, during the recent Senate estimates, a Mr Oxley from the department admitted to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee that was questioning him on aspects of these new marine areas in respect of the Coral Sea that there was no new scientific evidence. Professor Starck has said that, for the 347,000 square kilometres of the Barrier Reef, we are allowed to take 3,061 tonnes of fish. That means the weight of fish per square kilometre per year is nine kilograms. But, across the reefs of the Pacific that Dr Starck has also studied, the figure is 7,700 kilograms per square kilometre. Note the difference: nine and 7,700. We are being bureaucratic to a ridiculous level. Even the World Resources Institute, which you might say are not totally friendly to fisherman, have said that 4,000 kilograms per square kilometre is an acceptable, sustainable amount. And what are we taking out? Nine. You might say, 'Why are you using the Barrier Reef?' Well, I want to move from the Barrier Reef now to the Coral Sea. The Coral Sea is a vastly bigger area. We are going from 347,000 square kilometres to 1.3 million square kilometres. We have only 20 entities with about 30 or 32 vessels going in, and we are going to close it up. If they trawled over that for the next 50 years they would not do it any damage. And all those fishermen will be the first to tell you that you leave specific sensitive areas alone. All the fishermen I have known in my lifetime want to leave a resource there for Australia. They want their sons and grandsons to have the opportunity to go out and fish those areas. They are not rapists; they do not go out just to deplete the stock, and we impose all these rules and regulations on ourselves as Australians. The rest of the world must sit back and laugh. The international trawlers that will come in on the northern side of the Coral Sea, which is outside our sphere of control anyhow, will have the time of their lives. You can see how silly it is. The point is that this is not smart science. This is a terrible block. Recently, and I told this to the party room, Margaret asked me to go out and get some seafood marinara mix. While I was in the shop, after taking my number, I had a look at the big refrigerated fish cabinet. There were nine big stainless steel trays in there. Eight the nine had foreign fish on them. We are importing, as the Leader of the Nationals said, 72 per cent of the fish we eat. We are not saving the planet or the environment. We are not providing fresh fish for Australians. What we are doing is shifting the effort somewhere else. In doing that, we are depriving ourselves of a rich and healthy resource, of export industries that could be sustainable for generations into the future.",126
276,Ms PARKE,IMPORTANCE," A constituent recently recounted to me a story about an encounter she had had with a resident of Albany. This person was considering the case she had heard for marine parks. She recounted that she came from a former whaling family. She said, looking back, that the experience of transitioning out of whaling in the seventies was hard for her family and they opposed it at the time but that they had come to realise that it was the right thing to do. After some consideration, this person, whose family had subsequently moved into commercial fishing, felt that the move to put in place a network of marine sanctuaries was another of those important moments-the right thing to do. Last week, the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Tony Burke, on behalf of the federal Labor government announced the single biggest conservation decision in this nation's history: the world's first comprehensive network of marine parks and the world's single largest marine park. This week, as the world's leaders, including our Prime Minister, go from the G20 meeting in Mexico to the Earth Summit in Rio, Australia's decision to protect its oceans takes centre stage. With this unprecedented decision Australia is leading a global turning point in the official understanding and recognition of not only the critical of importance of the oceans to sustaining all life on earth but also the devastating impacts of damaging fishing practices, overfishing and the damage that oil and gas drilling can have, and the need to act decisively to set aside key areas from extraction. As the member for Fremantle I am immensely proud of the strong stand my constituents have taken in calling on the Australian government to acquit its responsibility to protect Australia's unique marine life. In particular I am humbled to have been part of their creation of a vision for the protection of one of the most intriguing and important underwater features in Australia's ocean territory: the magnificent Perth Canyon in Fremantle's very own oceanic backyard. With federal Labor's leadership the Perth Canyon and the incredible underwater ecosystem that this dynamic feature nurtures will be recognised, boosting the livelihoods of the great community of Fremantle, whose history, culture and very life force comes from the ocean. I am particularly proud that the campaign for marine parks in WA's south-west marine region led the charge nationally in achieving a prioritisation of high-level protection for the most biologically important and threatened part of our oceans: the continental shelf. In Australia's south-west corner the marine worlds collide with the meeting of the wild Southern Ocean and the vast Indian Ocean, mixed together by the magnitude of the force of nature that is the Leeuwin Current as it races south. Our south-west, on both land and sea, is a globally recognised biodiversity hot spot, and it is this legacy of shelf protection that the people of Western Australia are creating now that delivers on the heart of the scientific imperative, and in doing so provides a firm platform to be built on in the future. I take the opportunity now to flag the importance of the case that the local community of the Western Australian South Coast has made, many of them long-term recreational fishers, in calling for an end to the long-term inaction by the WA state government and, in particular, the Minister for Fisheries and for Mines and Petroleum, Minister Norman Moore, over the terrible death toll of marine animals and other nontarget marine life in the demersal gill nets, a gear type which is not only intolerable but also unnecessary. Hook-and-line is a far better option. This also remains the imperative in the new marine park off Jurien, the most important breeding colony for threatened Australian sea lions on WA's west coast. The community of Geographe Bay has led the way in showing this can and must be done. The next frontier for high-level protection will be the state's north-westShark Bay, Ningaloo, the Rowley Shoals, the Pilbara, Coral Coast and the Kimberleyareas that are increasingly at a crossroads with the expansion of resource extraction. I pay particular tribute to the community of Margaret River, who have overcome great tragedy and challenge in recent times, maintaining control of their destinies by asserting their future as one based on a lifestyle which is the envy of the world. With the creation of a very large no-oil zone the federal government has heard their call that all extraction, like coal, has no part in the future of Margaret River. Margaret River is now flanked on the one side with the oldgrowth forest protected by Geoff Gallop in 2001, and on the other side with the sea, protected in 2012 by federal Labor. Fishing is a central part of WA's lifestyle, but the decline of some important fish stocks that is gravely concerning. I am excited by the possibilities that last week's announcement opens up for the important contribution it will make to the return of fish stocks to the abundant levels our forefathers knew so well. In 2005 we embraced the opportunity with the introduction of broad-scale sanctuaries in Ningaloo Marine Park, following hard on the heels of the rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park the year before. Great waves of science are now rolling in off the back of these measures, showing that marine sanctuaries are the most effective way to protect marine life. It is no accident that best fishing spots in the world are on the edges of marine sanctuaries. These marine parks will now boost the environmental credibility and marketability of an industry which is working its way towards industry-wide environmental certification, and I am pleased that this federal Labor government is contributing to their case. Like on land, national parks ocean are just common sense, so it is no surprise that new marine parks are being rolled out at this very moment by the state government of Western Australia in that state's waters. This week the Camden Sound Marine Park was created, including WA's largest marine sanctuary. Last week the Ngari Capes Marine Park was created in the capes region of the south-west and there are three more to come, including the greatly anticipated Greater Kimberley Marine Park. Such is the strength of support out west for these issues that the member for Curtin-the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-and Premier Colin Barnett are very welcome supporters. It is interesting and telling that there is no member of the opposition from Western Australia speaking on this MPI. This is because they know full well that marine protection is extremely popular in Western Australia. I am disappointed, though, by the confusing messages that elements of the federal coalition are sending on this matter. Is this the same coalition that under John Howard put in place high-level protection over a third of the Great Barrier Reef; that under Robert Hill put in place some of Australia's largest marine parks at the Great Australian Bight, Macquarie Island and Heard and MCDonald Islands; whose very own Liberal Senator Chris Back established one of WA's first marine sanctuaries at Kingston Reef off Rottnest Island, which has now been proven by the CSIRO to have the boosted rock lobster levels by 500 per cent? In this MPI debate today the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Mr Burke, talked about the great environmental decisions that have been made by previous governments. In his publication Thoughtlines former New South Wales Premier and now Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the Senator Bob Carr, points to how the big conservation decisions have played an important role in defining leadership in Australia: 'Fraser Island, the reef, New South Wales rainforests, the Franklin River, the wet tropics of North Queensland. Every one of these decisions was tough. Every one of them was politically contested. Every one of them involved the possibility of a backlash in the regions. The Australian government has got it right, and today these great natural areas saved for all time help us define ourselves as Australians.' But it has been a long time between drinks. There is a whole generation of Australians who would not have been born the last time Australia made a globally significant decision for our environment. Now young Australians can celebrate as well in the first-hand knowledge that history has been created. Let us take a moment to stand back and see what has been done. We started with less than one per cent of Commonwealth waters protected and we now have a national network of marine reserves to protect our ocean environment for future generations. Where did this process start? It started with the Keating government and was continued by the Howard government and now the Rudd and Gillard governments. This is positive change that should be above politics. It is positive change that will benefit not Australian diving and tourism industries but also recreational and commercial fishers. I come from a proud fishing community. I have not had one negative response since Minister Burke's announcement last week; not one. Indeed, during the extensive consultation process leading to the announcement I worked closely with Clayton Nelson from the South West Trawl Fishery which operates in a sustainable manner in waters off Fremantle. Notwithstanding some inaccurate news reports last week, the new marine network will have no impact on Clayton's fishery; indeed, he has told us that he is very happy with the result of the federal government's marine process. Australia-wide the impact of this decision on commercial fisheries averages one per cent and for recreational fishers it is negligible. As noted in an article by Paul Gamblin in today's West Australian-which is accompanied by a beautiful picture-interest in marine conservation in Western Australia is growing strongly, with those who have made submissions in favour of protection numbering in the tens of thousands. As Mr Gamblin notes, the real level of support this signals is much greater. And as celebrated Fremantle author Tim Winton noted in a speech in the House recently, when the bumper stickers that say 'I fish and I support marine sanctuaries' go from appearing on kombi vans to appearing on people movers, and now on tradies' utes, you know you have hit the mainstream. I am proud to be part of a federal Labor government that has made this historic decision to support our marine environment. I congratulate the minister for his vision and thank all those involved in the consultation process.",128
277,Mr ENTSCH,IMPORTANCE," In rising to speak on this MPI, I started to choke on some of the uninformed drivel that was coming from only the other side. I was particularly concerned by a couple of speakers who made light of the fact that they are going to have to walk some distance to reach Commonwealth waters. What they do not acknowledge is the fact that most of the inshore waters of these affected areas, particularly in the Coral Sea, have already been shut down. The fishermen who worked in those areas have already been forced out into the Coral Sea to continue their operations and we are now looking at shutting down those operations as well. It just shows you how uninformed those individuals on the other side are in relation to this issue. About 25 per cent of Australia's coastal waters is already marine park. With about 25 per cent of our fishing area-the Coral Sea and other planned extensions-our marine park areas will comprise about 50 per cent of the global total. Australia has the largest per capita fishing zone and the lowest harvest rates in the world, at about one-thirtieth of the global average. We have the most restrictive and costly marine resource management in the world. Over 70 per cent of our seafood is imported, at a cost of $1.2 billion a year, from markets such as Thailand and Vietnam, where species are far more exploited. We are ripping the guts out of Third World countries. Through our own insatiable demand we are destroying their fisheries. We have done the same thing with forestry. These are the countries that can least afford to destroy their fisheries-and we are making sure that they do, while we lock up ours in their entirety. It is estimated that Australia will need to import 850,000 tonnes by 2020 to satisfy the growing consumption rate and dietary recommendations. The Coral Sea is one of the world's prime tuna fishing grounds. The estimated value of its production has been reduced to about $8 million from 500 tonnes of tuna. That is what we are down to in this area that we are going to protect. Previously, Japanese fishermen who fished this area since the 1970s had sustainably produced around 30,000 tonnes annually for many, many years. Meanwhile Papua New Guinea licenses Asian fishing companies to fish the same migratory stocks-exactly the same fish-in its 2.4 million square kilometres of EEZ waters. In 2009 PNG took around 400,000 tonnes. In 2010 it grew to 700,000 tonnes-more than five times Australia's total catch of edible fish of all species combined. And PNG is expected to hit one million tonnes in 2011. Meanwhile, because of all our restrictions and lock-ups, our national fishery only produces about 15,000 tonnes a year. Annual catches in the main commercially fished tuna species of skipjack, yellowfin, bigeye and albacore in the central and western Pacific area have increased continuously in recent decades, peaking in 2009 with the highest ever catch of 2.46 million tonnes recorded which was valued at $4.5 billion. This compares to the 15,000 tonnes that we are allowed to take nationally because of our restrictions. Yet Australia imports more canned tuna than any other seafood product-about $165 million worth. We save our fish so that all of these foreign fishermen-licensed by the government in many cases-can catch them and sell them back to us. This is the intelligence of the mob that sits across from us! Let us talk about the organisation that captured the minister and this mob over here and decided they would influence the change. It is called Pew. It was founded in 1948 by the Pew family, who made a fortune in oil and gas and have more than $5 billion in assets. Their company is known as Sunoco. It is one of the largest gasoline distribution companies in the United States, but it withdrew from the oil business in 2011. It made a squillion and decided to go out and create some mischief. So what did they do? They tried to become a false prophet. They claim to be an independent, non-profit, non-governmental, non-partisan and non-ideological organisation. How much of a joke is that! They have got a conservation arm called the Pew Environment Group that literally owns this Labor government and certainly owns the minister. They say they are focusing on reducing what they see as the destruction of the world's oceans. They did not have the guts to take on the Americans. They will not go anywhere near the South East Asian or European fisheries that already are absolutely trashed. No. They look around for the lowest common denominator. They look around for one of the only governments that is totally dependent on the Greens to survive. So they worm their way in here like the expanding gangrene that they are. They come in here and do a deal with this mob. They frighten the living hell out of them. They say, 'If you don't do a deal with us, the Greens will take away their support.' So this has nothing to do with the environment. It is all about politics. It is an absolute joke. They said 487,000 signatures came through in this email campaign-all nice, glossy ones. But PNG 99.8 per cent of those submissions were bulk emails, and Senate estimates recently revealed that a very significant majority were from overseas. They did not even have a clue where this place was. It was just, 'Do you love your mother? Yes. Do you want to save the Coral Sea? Yes.' That is the way they do this, and it is an absolute farce. Whatever happened to Australians having a say in the management of their own waters? Pew has a controversial history. In Canada it was accused of smothering grassroots environmental movements. It comes in with its six-figure salaries and the foundation funding, and it uses its influence to exercise control over whatever issues are brought up-the same as has happened here; exercising control over this mob over on the other side, who cannot survive without the Greens. Last month the Pew Trust made headlines by contributing funding to the cash-strapped Barnes Foundation, which looks after the famed Barnes art collection. Despite the donor's will specifying that the collection must stay in Lower Merion, Pennsylvania, Pew helped fund lawyers who fought for the collection's relocation, in violation of the will. It has been reported over there as 'the art theft of the century'. This is the grubby mob that these guys have decided to take exclusive advice from to destroy the livelihoods of so many people in our area. Bob Lamason of Great Barrier Reef Marine Tuna, who is the only one left up there, used to pay $2,000 a vessel back in 2000 for his six boats, catching about 1,200 tonnes of tuna a year. He is now paying $160,000 a year, an average of over $50,000 per vessel, and he is now only able to catch 500 tonnes of tuna. Back then there were no bycatch restrictions, no wire traces and no VMS, and he had a much wider range. But he faced much higher fuel costs in going further and further out as they pushed him out, and they put five-hook limits et cetera on him. Basically they are driving him out of business. Lyle Squire Junior, a thirdgeneration businessman at Cairns Marine Aquarium, was decimated back when the green zones came out. They pushed him out into the Coral Sea. We look like losing him as well over this. Minister Burke himself admitted that the scale of the lockup in the temperate zonebecause it was so small-was pay-off for the lockup in the Coral Sea. In his speech here he mentioned some fisherman from the south-east saying that he was happy with it, as did the previous speaker. Of course they were, because they traded all of them off. They are not affected by it. The same goes for Chris Makepeace, the Northern Territory recreational fisherman that he mentioned. Of course, he is not affected either. The minister did mention Col MCKenzie, the CEO of AMPTO. What he did not mention is that Col MCKenzie is also the campaign manager for the state Labor members up in Cairns-a long-term Labor Party member. The minister did a deal with the dive industry to divide them from the others in the hope that he might get their support. There is a bit of a problem with that, because he is now saying that they are the ones that are going to be managing the fishery; they are going to be the policemen. But Chris Eade, the president of the Cod Hole and Ribbon Reef Mooring Holders Association, which represents nine dive businesses, has already shot down the idea of the minister. He said: … I don't think you can expect us to be your policemen out there … I cannot expect the crews on my boats, who are civilians, to put themselves at risk. They work for me, not the Government. This is an absolute disgrace. We have already seen businesses starting to fold on this, and there is a hell of a lot more tragedy to come out of it. (Time expired)",131
278,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,IMPORTANCE," The discussion has concluded. NA Homelessness Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (GortonMinister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business) (16:41): by leave-It is not acceptable in this country, a relatively wealthy one, that so many Australians are homeless. It is not acceptable that a widowed pensioner cannot find a bed or that a teenager is sleeping rough. It is not acceptable that a mother and her children are living in a car. Everyone deserves a safe and secure home. A home is the foundation on which a person builds their life. Without a stable home, people-no matter their agestruggle to live healthily, stay in training or community education, or find and keep jobs. That is not good for them, for their families, for their communities or for the country. That is why this Labor government has made homelessness a national priority. In 2008, we released the inaugural white paper on homelessness, The road home. The white paper outlines how we will reduce homelessness. It will require a sustained effort by governments, business and the community. To get there, we have set clear targets. By 2020, we will have the rate of homelessness, and we will provide supported accommodation for all rough sleepers who seek it. We do not resile from these ambitious targets, even though those opposite refused to sign up to them. In 2013 we will be in a position to measure our progress. We will draw on robust census data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and use information collected from specialist homelessness services by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. This data will be supplemented by the first national longitudinal study of homelessness in Australia, Journeys Home. We have also spent over $11 million on the National Homelessness Research Agenda to help drive the development and implementation of evidence-based policy. In addition to Journeys Home, we have supported research that, amongst other things, looks at housing and support options for older people, considers how to end rough sleeping in cities around the country, and examines how we best develop a professional workforce. Combined, these facts and figures will give us the most accurate picture of homelessness in Australia that we have ever had. We will better understand how homelessness comes about, and how we can help people get back on their feet. We are confident that, in partnership with states and territories, organisations and philanthropists, we are reducing homelessness in Australia. Every single commitment set out in the white paper has been concluded or is underway. Early intervention We have intervened early to prevent homelessness. As a result of the communitybased early intervention service, Reconnect, more than 50,000 young people are back with their families, and are in school or are in training. The Household Organisational Management Expenses Advice Program has helped over 3,600 families to stay off the streets by providing advice and assistance to people who were struggling to pay the rent or keep up with the mortgage during personal or financial crises. Further, we have prevented people with mental illness becoming homeless with the Personal Helpers and Mentors Program, which provides support for people with a mental illness to build social networks, gain employment, learn how to better manage their illness and live independently. Improving and expanding services: We have moved towards integrating mainstream and specialist homelessness services by improving the responses from 'first to know' agencies and providers. For example, headspace assists young people with mental health issues who are also experiencing homelessness; Job Services Australia provides tailored assistance to get homeless job seekers into employment; and Centrelink has started making weekly payments to those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. I also know how hard people in this sector work and the passion and commitment they have for their jobs. Attracting and maintaining the best workers possible is essential, and was reflected in the significant pay increases proposed for community services workers by Fair Work Australia. This is a historic decision, and one which this government has rightfully supported and will continue to support by funding our share of the salary increases. We are breaking the cycle of homelessness by providing integrated support in order to ensure that people leave homelessness permanently, not for just for temporary periods. One such example is Foyer accommodation, which provides homeless young people with stable housing and other supports on the basis they participate in education, training or employment. Under the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, the Australian government, together with the states and territories, has committed $1.1 billion to provide new and better integrated accommodation and support services. The agreement is delivering over 180 new or expanded services across Australia to tackle homelessness as well as 600 homes under the A Place to Call Home initiative. What does that mean for people? It means that since the commencement of the agreement, homelessness services have provided help more than 240,000 times. Addressing homelessness is not always just about a roof over someone's head, but a roof certainly helps. The government's investment in affordable housing recognises that it is essential, indeed critical, to preventing people becoming homeless in the first place, and it gives people somewhere to go when they come out of crisis accommodation. By increasing the stock of affordable housing we enable people to move from homelessness into stable accommodation and through social housing into the private rental market. This transition, in turn, creates space for other people to access accommodation when they are in dire need. The Australian government has committed almost $5 billion in new funding since 2008 to provide support services and programs to assist people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. It is worth remembering that whilst those opposite were in government they did not even have a housing minister, let alone a minister for homelessness. Even now they do not have a specific shadow minister for homelessness. In a time of relative economic munificence they ripped $3.1 billion out of the housing budget. Nonetheless, those opposite do have an opportunity to start to redeem themselves in this area of public policy. Today, the government tabled its response to the Housing the Homeless report of the former House Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth, which inquired into the proposed homelessness legislation. This committee report has provided the foundation of the Homelessness Bill 2012, which I intend to introduce in the spring sittings. In the absence of express constitutional power, the government has given careful consideration to its response to the recommendations of the legislation inquiry. The government has incorporated the recommendations into the draft bill to the extent possible within the constraints of the Australian Constitution. An exposure draft of this bill has been released for a two-month consultation period concluding on 3 August and the government will consider the feedback of the sector before presenting the legislation to parliament. It is true that this legislation will not provide a home for anyone; however, it will ensure that the spotlight remains firmly on addressing homelessness. The introduction of legislation provides us with a great opportunity to retain in law the important statements about homelessness; the partnerships, the effort and strategies are needed to tackle it; and the treatment and support that vulnerable Australians deserve. We believe the Gillard government's legislative response will serve as a lasting reminder of the need homeless Australians have for support, and of the need for partnered, strategic effort governments, community organisations and businesses. I urge the opposition to engage with the government on the bill, and to support it when it comes to the parliament. As our white paper notes, homelessness is everyone's responsibility. The Labor government has recognised this and remains committed to improving outcomes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. Ensuring that people who are experiencing homelessness receive high quality services and get every chance to move out of homelessness or avoid it all together is critical to the Gillard government's policy agenda. Not only does it make social sense to for people to have a home but it also makes economic sense. The cost of having people cycle through hospital emergency departments and mental health services because they do not have stable accommodation outweighs the costs of providing those very same people with a place they can call home. The welfare and safety of our fellow Australians matters. This is a great and prosperous country but I believe the real mark of a great country is how it treats and assists its most vulnerable. The Gillard government is determined to do all that it can to assist our vulnerable Australians. There can be no more worthy cause than doing all that we can to help reduce homelessness. I present a copy of my ministerial statement and the government response to that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth report on the inquiry into homelessness legislation entitled Housing the Homeless. I move: That the House take note of the document. I ask leave of the House to move a motion to between enable the honourable member for Menzies to speak for 10 minutes. Leave granted. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: I move: That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Mr K.J. Andrews speaking for a period not exceeding 10 minutes. Question agreed to.",133
279,Mr ANDREWS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS," The ministerial statement we have just heard was one of the more curious that I have heard in this House, not because the subject is unimportant-it quite clearly is-but because it betrays a sense of talk and discussion and wishing for the future rather than actual achievements. This has become a fairly typical Labor tactic: throw up a minister with a ministerial statement and try to push a story. So today they have thrown up the Minister for Housing and Homelessness and the Minister for Small Business. This is another stunt in terms of the way ministerial statements are being used in this place, and we on this side are bracing for more failures in the homelessness area from a minister who has presided over failed programs, failed policies and other cheap stunts. For example, when Labor was watering down mutual obligation and making it easy for people to get on the dole, he was the Minister for Employment Participation. With a white flag flying high as a sign of surrender to the people smugglers, and while people were being endangered, he was the Minister for Home Affairs. And with the Ombudsman, the National Audit Office and the DPP all noting fraud issues at the Department of Human Services, he was the Minister for Human Services. Labor stands condemned on the important issue of homelessness. The minister professes his pride not in achievements but in setting targets that we on this side of the House knew were unattainable. At the same time, Labor has allowed five years of the 12 years until 2020 to pass without being actually measure any progress in this area. And the government has not committed anything in the budget to the renewal of the National Partnership Agreement Homelessness, which is due to expire at the end of next financial year. Similarly, when I looked through the budget trying to find homelessness money elsewhere to make up for this funding stream that is finishing, guess what? I found nothing because there is no other commitment; there is no other money. That is because homelessness policy is all smoke and mirrors. There is no substance. There is no plan. There is no direction. They have got no idea. The question the minister should have addressed today is: will those 180 new or expanded services continue to exist? The minister probably does not know, and the government does not seem to care. Labor endlessly repeats the line that it has committed almost $5 billion to homelessness since 2008, yet it cannot explain where this money comes from or, indeed, where it goes. When we look at the funding we see that almost $3 billion of the stimulus funding went to remote Indigenous housing funding, social housing funding and mental health funding. These are all are very worthy programs, but none is directly relevant to the homelessness program. Labor's approach is that any housing measures can be counted as homelessness funding. The minister complains about the opposition not including the word 'homelessness' in the title of the shadow minister for housing, yet this is a government that has had three different ministers for homelessness in just seven months. And, of course, the current health minister served as minister for housing without any mention of homelessness in her title. So the minister's able to comment is nothing more than a cheap attempt to score some cheap points. There are estimated to be 105,000 Australians who are homeless each night. In on 2008-09, data indicated that 61.5 per cent of those who sought crisis accommodation, or 330 people-205 adults and 125 accompanying children-were turned away per day. Indeed, the data estimated that only one-fifth of Australia's homeless were in these services at any one time. A severe lack of affordable housing in Australia, and in Labor's Sydney more than anywhere else, is pushing families out of the rental market and onto endless public housing waiting lists. But homelessness goes beyond whether Australians can afford to rent a roof over their heads, with domestic and family violence and family or relationship breakdown leading to the plight of around a third of Australia's homeless. Such issues obviously are not easy to address. The question is how we, as a society, can ensure that those who do slip through the cracks are taken care of. We do not believe that there are easy answers to homelessness because almost every case is unique. Homelessness involves a set of individual circumstances for all those people who are, sadly, caught in this situation. And sadly, without wanting this to be the case, there will always be homeless people amongst us. Their presence and our response is a test of our compassion as a society. When it comes to solutions, most of the experts in this area say that a multidisciplinary approach is required. We need to do more than give the homeless a bed for the night and a meal. We need to give them a pathway out, one step at a time, solving one problem after the other. While we must always help those who are homeless, we should aim to address the root causes to help prevent struggling families and individuals from slipping into homelessness in the first place. A key focus is addressing Australia's structural housing shortage, which results in less homes being available for those who need them and higher prices at the lower end of the market for those who can least afford them. The coalition went to the last election with a homelessness policy based on taking practical measures to ensure the states and territories achieve tangible results, and on helping homelessness service providers focus on the work they do rather than on the administrative burden so often attached to government funding. We are in the process of refining our policies in this area, but an overarching approach will be to address and prevent homelessness by improving housing affordability. Our approach is to solve problems. Labor's approach, it seems, is to create problems and pretend they are fixing things up when they themselves have broken some of them. Only a change of government will deliver positive change for those Australians unfortunately living rough. Debate adjourned.

Question agreed to. Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,139
281,Mr KEENAN,BILLS," In the couple of minutes I have left to conclude my remarks, I really just want to remind the House what it is we are actually discussing here today. This bill was part of the announcements made by the Labor Party in the recent budget, brought down, astonishingly, only last month. We stand here six weeks later and today this is the second time we are going to be considering government amendments to their own budget. This is a government that holds such a tenuous grip on this parliament that they cannot actually deliver a budget for longer than six weeks. This is the most extraordinary thing. Can you imagine Peter Costello and John Howard walking in here for any of the 11 budgets that they brought down whilst we were in government, and then six weeks after the fact, saying, 'Hang on, we cannot actually deliver this. We are going to have to make amendments to our own legislation and knock out some of the revenue measures.'? This is what is happening on this particular bill and what has happened on some other measures that the parliament has been considering this morning on managed investments trusts. This is a great indicator of everything that is wrong with minority governments, about the failed experiment that is the hung parliament and why the expectations that Labor had given the Australian people that they could govern through this mess have turned out to be absolutely hollow, like so much else of what the Labor Party have told the Australian people. Minority government is an experiment that has truly failed. You know that it has failed when six weeks after the budget has been brought down by the Treasurer the government cannot even adhere to the plan that it laid out for the Australian people. We are very proud of the fact that we have got the government to back down on indexing this particular tax. We have saved the small businesses in the tourism industry, and the larger and medium-sized businesses for that matter as well. We have saved them from being subject to an automatic tax hike every year to pay for Labor's failures to control its spending. We are very proud of doing that. The tourism industry is a very important industry for Australia. It employs 900,000 Australians. It really need not have been subject to an attack from this increase in the passenger movement charge. A government that cannot bring down a budget and adhere to what it has announced six weeks later is a government that has clearly lost the confidence of the House. A government that cannot adhere to a budget for more than six weeks is a government that has lost the privilege of governing the Australian people. The sooner we can put an end to the farce that is this minority government the better off the Australian nation will be.",139
282,Mr HAYES,BILLS," I support the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012 in the same way that those opposite supported changes to the passenger movement charge, not once but on two separate occasions, when they occupied the Treasury benches. The bill amends the Passenger Movement Charge Collection Act 1978, raising the passenger movement charge from $47, as it currently stands, to $55. We are talking about an increase of $8 which will take effect from 1 July this year. The passenger movement charge is paid by individuals departing Australia for another countryclearing Customs and going abroad. This charge was introduced in 1995 and it replaced what was then installed as the departure tax. Under this arrangement, airlines and shipping companies undertook the responsibility of administering the charge as part of their ticket sales process. It is safe to anticipate that this modest price increase will not have a deleterious impact on Australian tourism as we have had similar increases to the passenger movement charge on other occasions, as I mentioned earlier. There was a $3 increase in the passenger movement charge in 1999. Not two years later, in early 2001, those opposite, then occupying the Treasury benches, moved it again-this time by another $8. Bear in mind, inflation did not go up 100-plus per cent over that particular period. The shadow minister has indicated that that was for extraneous reasons, but nevertheless when those opposite occupied the Treasury benches they also looked at adjusting that charge as a means of increasing revenue. It is interesting to look at what did occur in 2001 and compare that to what is being said by some of the personalities that are still around this place today. When the charge was introduced in 2001 and debated before this parliament, the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry-none other than the Leader of the National Party, the Hon. Warren Truss-expressed the view that a higher passenger movement charge would be a fair and sensible cost-recovery mechanism. At that stage the charge was being increased by $8. We need to be reminded that some colleagues on Mr Truss's side of the ledger on this-and certainly the shadow minister who preceded me in this debate-want to wax lyrical about tax history under the former government. When it comes to the passenger movement charge, he said the opposition's preferred position is to get rid of it altogether. They certainly did not do that when they had a chance to do it. They are saying they stand for a low-tax government. If you want to look at that situation in its entirety, look at tax as a percentage of GDP. That peaked at 24.2 per cent, in 2004-05, and again in the following year, 2005-06. Who was that under? That was under the Howard government. It was the highest-taxing government in this country's history. Tax as a percentage of GDP has steadily declined since Labor came in in 2007. It reached 20.2 per cent and then 20.1 per cent in 2009-10 and 2010-11 respectively. This is the lowest tax-to-GDP ratio since 1983-84. The last time that tax was lower than 21 per cent was back in 1979. You have to put things in perspective. Today will be no exception, as we will see a gaggle of people coming through here and all will want to extol the virtues of a low-tax economy, and yet they are going to be much the same people who had opportunities to reduce tax but presided over the highesttaxing administration this country has ever seen. It should be an embarrassment to those opposite that the tax-to-GDP ratio, over the twelve budgets they managed, averaged 22.2 per cent. That is certainly something that they cannot want to compare with the position we currently sit in of under 21 per cent. Considering that sort of record you have to take them with a grain of salt every time they come in here and cry crocodile tears over the issue of taxation. It is a bit rich, particularly when we went to the last election and they would not have their election promises costed. When they finally did, there was $11 billion missing-a black hole in their essential costings. The auditors that provided the costings were eventually accused, and rightfully so, of professional mismanagement in their calculation of their costings for the purposes of the election. But when we sit now-and they sit in the position of the alternative government-we see not a black hole but a $70 million crater in their economic credentials. As I said previously, those opposite had an opportunity, up until 2011, to do something about the passenger movement charge and they did-they increased it. Warren Truss very conveniently told us the reason for it when he said that 'a higher passenger charge would be fair, and a sensible cost recovery mechanism.' Clearly, the Nationals still abide by that. But it is a bit rich to come out and lectured to by those opposite. I understand that comments were made the other day by the Leader of the Opposition criticising the Prime Minister in the G20. For us, Asia remains very much our clear and present focus; however, any European crisis will certainly impact on the Asian trading market and, in turn, will have an impact on Australia. So we are right to have a voice in that forum. And we are right to indicate to people what we believe should be occurring. What the Leader of the Opposition did not add is that it was not just Prime Minister Gillard making comments, there was the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany and China. As matter of fact, the Chinese even signed off on a pledge to the International Monetary Fund of another $70 billion to help protect against a global banking and financial crisis. If you just looked at the comments by the Leader of the Opposition and at those that are carried by some of the more popular tabloids around the place, you would think this was just about the Prime Minister. Then again, the Prime Minister has something of a point to make. Our economy-I know those opposite do not like to be reminded of this-is growing at a rate of four per cent. We have a five per cent unemployment rate, we have record low interest and currently our sovereign debt ratio is 7½ per cent. Our economy is something we should be proud of. I know when the Leader of the Opposition goes travelling, he puts it in these terms: 'Australia has serious bragging rights.' For him to come out and make statements about the comments by the Prime Minister to the G20 makes me wonder what those opposite would have said if they had had half an opportunity. Certainly, the world is an ever smaller place these days. Trade is very important and so we do have a very clear interest in what be occurs in the Asian markets, and that is our immediate focus, but we also acknowledge the impact of a European crisis and what it would do to the Asian markets. The Prime Minister indicated to the Europeans what occurred in this country and how our country was protected from the worse economic shock in 60 years, and how we acted in the face of the global economic crisis. But I wonder what those opposite would have done if they had had the opportunity to be over in Mexico. They could have said what they did when we debated the various aspects of responses to the global financial crisis. The position of those opposite was very clearly laid out by the then shadow spokesperson: we should sit and wait and see what happens. Well lo and behold-maybe they have been giving advice to Spain, Greece, Italy and a few other places around the world, because there are many of the European economies that have done exactly what those opposite were urging this government to do-that is, 'Let us sit and wait and see what happens.' If those opposite want to start talking about economic credentials, they need to stack that up against the health of the Australian economy at the moment. They are the ones out there on a daily basis wanting to talk this down. The last thing they want to be reminded of is the statistics. As I have said, we are an economy which is growing, we have low unemployment, we have record low interest rates and a sovereign debt which is the envy of the world. That is the basis us having a significant focus on trade and on the trade markets as we go ahead. I have digressed a little from the bill, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I apologise for that.",139
283,Mr Tehan,BILLS,"Yes, you have, and you have done nothing on trade in the last five years!",142
284,Mr HAYES,BILLS,"I am sure my colleague opposite is going to want to mention something about the Asian market, so I needed to put in perspective what impact the European crisis would have on the Asian market. Those opposite thought we should not have a view on that at all. But I will get back to the bill. In the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill we are very much focused on two things. Firstly, the Asian market, which I will come back to, and, secondly, the development of regional tourism. We know there are issues about tourism in this country. Australia is a country you pass through to go and see something; Australia is a point of destination. And if you come from the Northern Hemisphere, it is a long, long way away. We are trying to attract as many tourists as we can from there, but we know that the emerging tourism markets for us are clearly in the Asian region, particularly out of China and, more recently, out of India. As a consequence, with the passage of this legislation $48.5 million will be provided to a new fund to support tourism industry development projects in regional Australia. That is something that we do want to showcase. We do want to attract people particularly into regional Australia. That is an area of tourism that has been dealt a heavy blow, particularly with the impact of the higher dollar. We do want to drive investment and job creation in those areas and we do want to be able to deliver certainty. We have a track record for doing for that and we will continue to do it, and that $48.5 million will be earmarked to do precisely that. It will give people the opportunity to plan, to develop and to market the elements of regional tourism in this country. Ten per cent of the increased passenger movement charge will go to the Asia Marketing Fund which will be responsible for promoting Australia's image as an attractive holiday destination and business destination for a number of the lucrative markets in Asia. This contribution is in addition to the $61 million the government has already committed towards the development of the Asia Marketing Fund in this year's budget. We are strongly committed to raising our profile in that region and becoming one of the primary destinations for tourists, particularly throughout the Asian region itself. Australia's tourism industry has already not greatly benefitted from the emergence of China, which is now one of the world's strongest economies. If you listen to the economic forecast for the next decade, it will take over from the United States as being the world's strongest economy. It has also got the world's fastest growing middle class. As a consequence of that we are attracting, as quickly as possible, marketing opportunities in China, currently worth $3.5 billion. It is the third largest market of inbound visitors to this country, with 542,000 arrivals from China alone in 2011. (Time expired)",142
285,Mr BALDWIN,BILLS," I rise this afternoon to speak on the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012. The coalition would like to have been in a position to oppose the increase in its entirety; however, faced with a government that is borrowing over $1 million every single day and is likely to bequeath a national debt expected to dwarf the $96 billion debt the ALP previously left the Howard government, the coalition will face circumstances equivalent to a financial hangover after a spending party. The totality of Labor's economic mismanagement will still, therefore, have to be paid for. The coalition is determined not to have the financial black holes in the national accounts that this government so regularly and cavalierly delivers. If returned to government, the coalition will look to do things differently, by looking at all measures to stimulate and grow the tourism sector, rather than simply looking to use the industry as a cash cow to be plundered. Australia is not the only country to have an international departure tax. A number of countries levy some sort of air travel tax on passenger departures or arrivals. What is striking, though, is the rate at which we are levied. The decision to raise the PMC by $8 from $47 takes Australia's departure tax to $55 per passenger. This contrasts with the Australian dollar equivalents for travel outside of the European Union of $10 in France and $34 in Germany. Outside of the EU, New Zealand has a $19 charge and the US has a $14 arrival tax. In Australia the $27 passenger movement charge was introduced in 1994-95 to replace the departure tax. It was a measure to cover the costs of Customs, immigration and quarantine, estimated at $19 per passenger plus funding to cover the $8 cost of processing short-term visas. Two years after coming to office, the coalition, in an effort to spurt tourism growth by providing resources to cover the costs of Tourism Australia's predecessor and its See Australia campaign, increased the charge by a further $3 in 199899 to $30. It was not raised again until 200102, when the airports required additional screening due to foot-and-mouth disease, and it was increased to $38. Under the Howard government the PMC saw only moderate increases, and only when there was a specific and valid reason to do so. Between 1996 and 2007, what to many Australians must now appear to be a golden age, the PMC rose by $11, from $27 to $38-a rise of 35 per cent over 11 years. By contrast, in just five years this government has increased the PMC by $17, from $38 to $55-a rise of almost 45 per cent, or 4.5 times the increase in the annual CPI during this period. This year alone it represents a 17 per cent annual increase, compared to an expected CPI of only 3.25 per cent. Raising the PMC is part of Labor's need to feed its insatiable tax addiction, an addiction that forces it to cast around for reasons to justify it. They had to at least attempt to make a justification, given that on 2 March 2012 in Cairns at the Qantas national tourism awards the minister, Martin Ferguson, was participating in the National Tourism Alliance full board meeting. At the same time. I was across town launching the www.staycation.org.au campaign at a press conference at the Cairns Marina, aiming to address Australia's ballooning tourism deficit. We have gone from a surplus of $3.5 billion in 2001 to a loss today of $8.7 through Australians holidaying overseas. The Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism was, as confirmed, in the National Tourism Alliance's communique, saying that there would be no increase in the passenger movement charge. In a later discussion on passenger facilitation, he said that he had heard no proposal to raise the PMC in the upcoming budget. Those statements are in this communique and I seek leave to table it. Leave not granted.",143
286,Mr BALDWIN,BILLS,"As usual, this Labor government want to hide from the facts. The communique will be available to anyone who calls my office and wants a copy of it. How can an industry have confidence when you are telling them one thing before a budget and doing something different afterwards? Minister, you went to the tourism industry and you told them that there would be no increases in the PMC and then, after the budget, they find they are getting whacked with a 17 per cent increase-plus the CPI. We have subsequently learned that, while we were all up in North Queensland, back in Sydney at the University of New South Wales they were modelling a potential 20 per cent increase in the PMC. This research was commissioned by none other than Tourism Research Australia, a part of Minister Ferguson's department. So while he was telling tourism leaders, 'I've not heard potential increases to the PMC in the budget,' he ordered his department to prepare the defence for what Labor would announce two months later. The government might wonder why there is such animosity out there in the electorate. It is because they have a habit of saying one thing and doing something else shortly after. Who can forget 'There will be no carbon tax billion under a government I lead' before the election? Contrast that with the python squeeze that is waiting for them in less than a fortnight from today. I want to pay tribute to my colleague Senator Humphries, who obtained these documents and revealed Labor's duplicity. The government knows it faces a trust issue within the electorate. That is why it tried, in relation to the rise in the PMC, what I call the 'disco ball approach'. You can see it now: all the ALP spin doctors sitting around in a room not far from here, saying, 'What can we do? How can we distract the industry? We need something bright and shiny-something that glitters.' One of them shouts, 'I know! What about an Asian marketing fund? What an idea. No-one else would have thought of that. We could really sell that one.' The rise in the passenger movement charge from $47 to $55 is estimated to raise an additional $500 million over the forward estimates, but just 10 per cent of that will be given back in the form of this bright, new, shiny Asian marketing fund. Not content with milking the tourism industry for $500 million, this government thought that it would try another resource strike at the industry by seeking to index the passenger movement charge to CPI, giving the government another $156 million over the forward estimates. In 2007, the passenger movement charge raised $420 million in revenue to cover administration costs of only $231 million; this year the passenger of any movement charge raised $656 million in revenue to cover administration costs of only $243 million. If we take this out to 2015-16, the government's passenger movement charge-or should we call it the government's tax on tourism?-will, according to Treasury figures, raise $1.037 billion, yet the administration costs are expected to be only $239 million. If you are looking for definite proof that the government sees the tourism industry as nothing more than a cash cow, then this is the definite proof. There are $800 million in surplus costs and expenses going directly into the bottom line. When this government came to power, the budget for Tourism Australia-the government body responsible for promoting Australia to international visitors and encouraging Australians to domestically-was $136,269,000. This year the proposed budget is $130,178,000, and in the forward estimates it will still only be $134,556,000 in 2015-16. This is the lowest level of funding ever for Tourism Australia-the lowest funding ever for an industry which, combined with hospitality, provides employment for almost 1,000,000 Australians. In fact, in real terms, the money lost between 2007 and 2012 is $18,949,000-16 per cent. Projected through the forward estimates, it is $22,943,000-19 per cent. This Gillard government has given the bright and shiny new Asian marketing fund with one hand and taken away from Tourism Australia's budget bottom line with the other. The tourism industry has had enough. The Australian Accommodation Association called the PMC 'a virtual tax on tourism' which has 'a direct negative impact on visitor numbers which in turn has a detrimental effect on room occupancy and revenue per available room in tourism accommodation businesses.' The TTF was joined by AFTA and several other travel and tourism industry organisations whose advertisement in the Daily Telegraph and the Australian Financial Review stated that the taxes and increases being placed on the travel and tourism industry were 'unwelcome and overwhelming'. No-one was more surprised that the tourism industry would stand up for itself than the ALP, who saw it is a soft touch. Surprisingly, in the face of these full-page as and a direct marketing campaign which showed that the industry was fed up and not going to take it anymore, Labor wheeled out an unprepared Prime Minister who was not across her brief and who had to pick up the mess left behind for her by her tourism minister. In trying to defend the increases to the PMC, the Prime Minister tried and failed travel to argue that the cash grab was actually designed as a positive step to help the tourism industry. That is great-help tourism by taxing it more! Prime Minister Gillard tried to imply that the PMC only affects outbound Australians holidaying overseas, but the truth is that this $55 tax slug is paid by Aussies at the start of their holiday and by our international visitors at the end of theirs. The Prime Minister said that she thought that raising the PMC was a good measure to discourage Australians from travelling overseas rather than holidaying at home. Either she made this up on the spot or, when the matter came up for cabinet discussion prior to the budget, neither she nor the Treasurer nor the immigration minister-let alone the tourism minister-understood how departure tax works. For now, it appears that the government has succumbed to the pressure and resiled from going ahead with indexing the PMC to the CPI. However, even last night, when his own colleagues had seen the writing on the wall, Minister Ferguson was still defending the indefensible by telling the tourism industry that he supported indexation despite the rest of the government acknowledging that they had gone one step too far. Indexation of the PMC would have lead to an ongoing and ever-increasing significant impost rise on the tourism industry every year. It would have been the only tax to do so, and this would have occurred by the stroke of a pen without any future parliamentary scrutiny and regardless of the prevailing global economic conditions. Speaking of prevailing global conditions, these are some tough times for this tourism industry, and, as I have said in many tourism forums, the industry has been doing it tough in recent years. This is due to anaemic growth in many of our largest markets for inbound visitors, exacerbated by our strong dollar; competition from new and highly competitive destinations in our region; the impact of natural disasters such as Cyclone Yasi; and short-sighted, ill-conceived and economically counterproductive policies. So what has Labor been doing to help the industry? The record is not exactly flash. First there is the little matter of the dare not speak its name-or, as I referred to it earlier, 'Labor's python squeeze'. The government did not even consider the tourism sector serious enough to undertake modelling of what the impacts would be. So, while it was shovelling out the money to the steel industry and the car industry, amongst others, all the tourism industry had to go on was private modelling undertaken by TTF which forecast that 6,400 jobs would go and that there would be a cut of 10 per cent in industry profits. With this PMC rise, the TTF is now stating that job losses could be as high as 10,000-and these would be predominantly in regional and rural Australia-yet the TTF received not one cent in targeted, tourism industry-specific assistance. Now the government has announced that some 90 Customs staff will lose their jobs in addition to the 70 posts already cut this year. This has led to longer queues at Customs and an average wait time of 24 minutes. The government has also increased the visa label charge by $10 and passed on the $118.1 million in costs for AFP security at airports. These costs in turn will be passed on to tourists and international visitors by the airlines. People travelling to Australia will now face all these additional imposts combined with a carbon tax when they shop. When one adds to this the cuts to Customs, Labor's marketing theme for our nation should be-to borrow a line-'Welcome to Australia, where you will pay more and where you will wait longer!' The thing about this government is that, if you watch it for long enough, you will find that patterns begin to develop. Just as it gave the tourism sector the glittering Asian Marketing Fund and then reduced funding in real terms for Tourism Australia, the government decided to repeat this sleight of tax that hand with the SmartGate passenger facilitation system which helps eligible travellers to use electronic information in ePassports and face recognition technology to self-process through Customs and Immigration. First, it gave $7 million to improve the SmartGate passenger facilitation. Then it made cuts of $10 million in the overall Customs budget in addition to staff cuts. Surely the government should have waited for the high failure rate to be reduced before making anticipated compensatory staff cuts? As the backbone of our tourism industry are thousands of small business operators. Tourism expenditure is mostly a discretionary-spending item and often is in a price-point sensitive market. This budget has resulted in making it more expensive to visit Australia through 'cash grab' measures such as the increases to the PMC. I condemn this government for taxing this industry beyond its capacity and it will stand condemned by the industry.",144
287,Ms MARINO,BILLS," The purpose of the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012 is to amend the Passenger Movement Charge Act 1978 and to increase the rate of the passenger movement charge, the PMC, from $47 to $55. As we know, the government promised about two months before the budget that it would not increase this PMC which clearly became nothing more than a blatant tax grab to try to help this government move into this mythical surplus. We certainly have not seen a surplus to date and I doubt whether we will see one in the future. But worse, the government is not just increasing those costs to the industry and to passengers and tourists coming into this country; at the same time it is cutting resources to deal with processing of tourists. This means that tourists will be paying more for the privilege of taking longer to get through the process at the airports. We do know that the government originally planned to introduce the annual indexation of the passenger movement charge from 1 July 2013 and this would have added a further cost of $156.6 million over four years to the passenger movement charge. Visiting Australia in the current economic climate is not the cheapest of exercises for tourists. As we see the Australian dollar edge once again above parity, the cost for international visitors increases and our tourism competitiveness declines. Why would you add to that cost for tourists coming to Australia? Why would you make it harder and more expensive and discourage tourists from coming here through increases in indexation, as we saw with this government, from $47 to $55? There is no doubt that there are impacts on our tourism industry. We are seeing this and I do not understand why the government would seek to add to the problems that this industry is facing, to add to the problems of all the small businesses. It is only the opposition putting the amendment on the table and pressure from the tourism sector making this government drop its plans to index the passenger movement charge. We know that not only is it an issue for tourists coming here, but the high value of the Australian dollar is actually encouraging Australians to holiday overseas. I see this in my electorate. Many of the small businesses in my electorate have been affected by this. Whether they are in tourism, hospitality or retail, they have all felt that exodus, even of local tourists. For some of the small businesses, the combination of the cost to come here and the exodus of the Australian travellers means they have had to make some very tough commercial decisions. I have also dealt with pensioners who are trying to live in Asia but still claim their Australian pension because their pension goes so much further overseas. There is no doubt that any increase to the passenger movement charge will impact on foreign visitors to our shores. We know that it is comparatively cheaper to leave Australia to holiday than to come here for a holiday. In part, it can be due to the high cost of living compared to other nations, but at each point the government seeks to make that differential even greater. According to Mercer Human Resourcing Consultant, Economist Intelligence Unit and ECA International cost-of-living surveys, four Australian cities are among the most expensive in the world to live. We know Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane are ranked 14, 21, 30 and 31. Accommodation and a night out are not necessarily cheap by international standards. We do not need any additional reasons for people and tourists not to come to Australia, but that is what the government seems intent on achieving. It is not necessarily cheaper to live in regional areas than in major cities and the cost of delivering goods and services in regional Australia can mean more expense. We know that the government's carbon tax will make both the base cost and the additional impost in regional areas even worse. Then you are going to add increases to the passenger movement charge. A survey by Sky Scan found Australia was the 16th most expensive country to visit. Not only is this the worse time to introduce the world's largest carbon tax, but the government continues to increase costs and reduce services to the tourism sector. It is really the worse time along with these additional costs and challenges. The government should understand that this is the worse time to increase costs for tourists coming to and leaving Australia. We do not want to discourage one more person from coming to our country. You see the small business operators who have been struggling for some time, are still struggling and will struggle further. We know that that will be the case. The tourism sector is also facing real problems because of the government's changes to the Fair Work Act. The lack of flexibility in the act is a millstone around neck of many small tourism operations. I hear this over and over in my electorate. It is one of the reasons that a cup of coffee costs so much on a weekend, especially in Perth. In its continual program of selling out small businesses perhaps in favour of the union movement, the Gillard government is selling out not only Australian coffee drinkers but the tourism industry around the nation. One of the great things that you can do as a tourist is eat and drink some of the best-quality food, offerings and beverages that we have in the world, as you would well know, Mr Deputy Speaker. My south-west relies quite heavily on tourism as part of our economy. I am sure that all members here have heard of Margaret River. Margaret River, in the south-west, relies on tourism. Tourism operators do not need an additional passenger movement charge, to prevent more people from coming to Margaret River and the south-west. If you are uncertain about the tourism potential of the region, please come along to my next South West Sensations Showcase. According to the South West Development Commission, tourism contributes almost $600 million annually to the gross regional product of the south-west. It involves over 1.4 million overnight stays. But, on current figures, only seven per cent of those are international tourists and 10 per cent are interstate tourists. Each of these figures needs to be increased. We are looking at the provision of a larger airport, based at Busselton, capable of receiving direct flights from Sydney and Melbourne. I see that as essential to realise the greater tourism potential of the south-west. Such tourists would not be hit by increases in the passenger movement charge proposed in this bill, but they would be hit the by additional costs from the carbon tax imposed on domestic transport and travel. Tourist destinations around the eastern seaboard do have direct flight capacity, which contributes enormously to their economies, and the south-west should have that same opportunity. As we have discussed, the bill before the House today increases the passenger movement charge. It means that international visitors will pay more. International visitors who come along to the south-west will pay almost $1 million in additional Labor tax. That is what it means to my south-west. And, as they leave Australia, the extra cost will be $995,200. The extra cost to visitors to the Augusta-Margaret River shire alone will be half a million dollars. People focus on small amounts, on a small change-no, it is not. It is not, when you look at major tourism areas such as my south-west and the Margaret River region. We do not need one more reason for tourists not to come to Australia, particularly to my part of the world. This is the worse time to be adding costs, like the carbon tax, to the industry. Tourists going to Busselton will pay a quarter of a million dollars and, at the same time, those going to the Augusta-Margaret River shire will pay half a million dollars extra. Every increase in cost collectively impacts on people's decisions as to where they decide to spend their travel dollars. Wherever they are sitting in the world, when they are looking on the internet or at a pamphlet, they ask: 'Where are we going to go for our holiday? Let's have a look. Where do we get value for money and where can we get the greatest experiences?' There are a whole lot of drivers. They are very careful to where they decide to spend their travel dollars. Every time the cost of travel to Australia rises, some potential visitors are priced out of the market and other destinations actually look financially more attractive. The rush of tourists, even Australian tourists, to places such as Bali actually proves this point. Those numbers actually indicate the pressure that already exists on local tourism operators who are competing for international tourists. That is why every single incremental increase, like this one to the passenger movement charge, actually adds collectively to the reasons why more tourists will choose not to come to Australia and certainly not to my south-west. We are in a competitive market. Any government action that reduces the cost competitiveness of tourism is an issue for the industry. In 2014 diesel will become part of the carbon tax cost. So there will be real travel issues for the industry, particularly for those travelling by bus. Of course, the further you travel, the more the compounding effect of that carbon tax will be. We need to strongly encourage, not discourage, any growth in tourists. In an era of what is really fundamental economic decline in many western nations, it will be Asia that picks up the economic ball and runs with it. Growth in economies such as Asia is based on hard work and productivity. Therefore, for tourism in Australia to flourish, despite facing the challenge that it does, it needs to engage, as we have previously done, in the Asian marketplace. Western Australia is certainly a key destination. Another aspect of the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012 is the expenditure of the moneys collected by the Commonwealth under the tax. As we as know, it was first introduced in 1994 as the departure tax. It was put in place to fund Customs, Immigration and quarantine activities. It cost visitors $27. It was increased in 1998 to fund a tourism campaign-a dedicated purpose-and, again, in 2001 to boost foot-and-mouth screening, something that, as a farmer, I well understand. The rate rose to $38. But the then newly elected Rudd government pushed that up by $9-or 24 per cent-with no explanation. 'It is not for foot-and-mouth screening, it is not for quarantine, it is not for any immigration purpose; it is just a revenue raiser, because we want to throw it away on one of our famous wasteful projects.' It could have been any project. Pick your project to throw it away on. We know the government's record on border management is absolutely appalling. It has cut funding to Customs, which is about protecting our borders, to help pay for multibillion dollar blow-outs in its people smuggler subsidy program, masquerading as a Labor border protection policy. We have seen the backdown, as I said earlier, on the proposed indexation. I do acknowledge the work of the shadow minister in the proposal to amend this legislation and the work of the tourism organisations. This is really a tax grab and it is there to fund the continuous waste, the mismanagement and the massive budget deficits and debt of this government.",146

290,Mr ENTSCH,PAIRS," In rising to speak on the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012 I have to say it has been quite an eventful couple of days that we have seen in this place. I am pleased to see that the government has finally come around to some semblance of sense in that, thanks to the pressure from this side of the House and from tourism industry leaders, they have backed down on the indexation of the passenger movement charge to the CPI. I have spoken to many representatives about this issue and I totally support their argument that it is both unreasonable and unfeasible to penalise visitors to the tune of $156.6 million on top of the $610 million over four years that the increase in the PMC will generate.",151
291,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS," Order! The member for Leichhardt will resume his seat for a moment. For those people conducting conversations out of their place, if they are leaving the chamber would they do so quietly and quickly and allow the member for Leichhardt to be heard in silence. The member for Leichardt has the call.",151
292,Mr ENTSCH,PAIRS,"I note that I will be losing a little bit of time there, too, Mr Deputy Speaker! As I was saying, I have spoken to many industry representatives about this issue and I totally support their argument that it is both unreasonable and unfeasible to penalise visitors to the tune of $156.6 million on top of the $610 million over four years PAIRS that the increase in the PMC will generate. Frankly, it was a wise move by the government to introduce this amendment to its own legislation in response to coalition concerns. Otherwise, it would have had another very embarrassing defeat on the floor of the House yesterday-and I look forward to seeing how they are going to explain that one. There are a number of issues with this aspect of the proposed legislation. Firstly, forward bookings are a major component of the tourism industry, so how can you set prices when you do not know where the CPI will be 12 or 24 months into the future, particularly in relation to the economic performance of this mob? And with the price sensitivity and inherent competitiveness in the tourism industry, how can you lock in an increase that does not consider any other economic factors or allow for the flexibility industry that is needed in the tourism industry in order that they can stay competitive? This is all at the same time as the amount being collected far outweighs the actual cost of the government services that enable these passenger movements. I would like at this time to commend the tourism bodies that have led a very concerted and well-researched campaign on this: the Tourism and Transport Forum, the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, the National Tourism Alliance and the Australian Tourism Export Council. In my electorate of Leichhardt, tourism, of course, is one of the mainstay industries that have had a very, very tough time in recent years. No-one would argue that the tourism industry is not an industry that is exposed to factors such as the high value of the dollar and, of course, economic confidence. I fully understand the need to pay off $140-odd billion worth of Labor debt; it is an incredible imposition on the Australian taxpayer and impacts on our financial standing on the world stage. But it is also obvious that I understand tourism and the unfair pressure that it has been subjected to. Time and time again, I have seen this government pay tourism lip service while at the same time, whenever they need to raise some revenue, they are quite happy to take it in the form of increased taxes from the tourism industry. They are happy to offer a support package to the manufacturing industry when they hit a bit of a rough spot, but when it comes to the tourism industry and we see problems there it is, 'Sorry, you're on your own.' Then, when they see an opportunity to recover a few dollars, straight away they whack another tax on this industry. It has been like a triple whammy effect that has hit our airports in the last budget, inasmuch as they will still be forced to suffer the increases in the PMC and to continue to contribute to the Australian Federal Police costs. This, of course, will have a particularly negative impact in regional airports like Cairns. Of course, small business again will suffer from the slashing of revenue streams as a result of the ban on duty-free sales of cigarette cartons on arrival in the airports. In addition, eight staff have been cut from the front-line customs services at Cairns Airport. I do not know about you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I can tell you that after getting off a long international flight last thing I feel like doing is standing in immigration queues that take forever to be processed. This information does tend to get back to users of that airport, and it acts again as a negative for people considering travel here. This increase in the PMC is certainly not in line with many of our tourism goals in Far North Queensland. It certainly will not be helping to double overnight visitor expenditure to $140 million by 2020. It is not going to help to widen the geographic dispersal of tourism spending within our country. PMC will hit the most pricesensitive travellers hardest and will serve as a deterrent to overseas visitors who compare Australia with other destinations. As a flat rate, it also does not take into account the different abilities of travellers to pay. Somebody arriving in Cairns on a Jetstar flight from Auckland, for example, will pay vehicle- the same as a first-class passenger arriving from London. However, with the Treasurer saying that some of the money collected through the increased PMC will fund the establishment of an Asia Marketing Fund, that is a little bit of common sense that is coming out of this. I am pleased to see that it ties in with the need to target the high-growth Asian market. It is imperative that the Treasurer be held to his words. If people are going to be forced to pay to visit us then, as a key tourism destination, we will certainly be watching very, very closely to make sure that a significant portion of marketing is targeted towards our region, which will help to make up for some of those additional costs. With Cairns having taken a hammering in recent years, the opportunities presented by the Asian market may just be our saving grace. For example, there has been an ongoing campaign to woo the Chinese market, and it has been reported today in the local media the that Cairns Airport may be close to an agreement with China Eastern Airlines on direct flights from Shanghai. In yesterday's Cairns Post there was an article saying that Australia is poised to benefit from the growth from the cashed-up Indian middle class, and yesterday afternoon we heard a report that direct flights from Singapore are likely to resume after a six-year hiatus. Again, it is interesting that it was the new LNP state government and the new state member for Cairns, Gavin King, who are kicking the goals and recognising the needs of regional Australia while this Labor government continues to penalise tourism, to try to put additional taxes on this very important industry and to tax it out of existence.",151
293,Mr CLARE,PAIRS,"Blaxland-Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (18:13): I would like to thank members for their contributions to the debate on the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment Bill 2012. The bill amends the Passenger Movement Charge Act 1978 to increase the rate of the passenger movement charge by $8 to $55 per passenger. This will take effect from 1 July. This week a House committee and a Senate committee tabled reports on the bill. Both recommended that the bill be passed. The House committee report raised a number of concerns that industry had raised, including indexation and regional tourism. The government has considered the report and decided to make two changes: (1) an amendment that I will be moving in committee to remove indexation and (2) the creation of a Tourism Industry Regional Development Fund. This will fund tourism development projects in regional Australia through grants of up to $100,000. This is, of course, on top of the funding allocated to a new Asia Marketing Fund. It is a very important initiative and we remain committed to it. There is good reason for that: in less than a decade it is there will be 100 million outbound travellers per annum from China alone. This fund will help promote Australia as a touring and business destination in this important and growing market. It has been endorsed by Tourism Australia Chairman and former Qantas CEO, Geoff Dixon, who said: With this new dedicated fund, we now have an unprecedented opportunity to further drive both existing campaign activity and new marketing efforts across our fastest growing and most valuable inbound visitor markets. There has been a bipartisan approach on this issue. We have both supported the passenger movement charge and we have both increased it in the past. John Howard introduced its predecessor, the departure tax, in 1978 and presided over the biggest ever increase to the passenger movement charge of 27 per cent in 2001. The difference between the major parties is that Labor is investing some of it in the Australian tourism industry; the Liberal Party never did. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",153
294,Mr CLARE,PAIRS,"Blaxland-Minister for Home Affairs, Minister for Justice and Minister for Defence Materiel) (18:15): I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill and I move the government amendment: (1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 4) to page 5 (line 22), omit the item, substitute: 1 Section 6 Omit ""$47"", substitute ""$55"". This amendment removes indexation of the passenger movement charge from the bill. The proposed increase of $8 will occur from 1 July 2012. The increase without indexation is expected to result in $485 million over the estimated that four years from 2012-13.",153
295,Mr HOCKEY,PAIRS," This is the third strike. Isn't it of great interest to everyone that when these ministers come into give these humiliating backdowns through an amendment to their own legislation, they have the shortest speeches? It could be a 45-second speech, which is the smallest limit on a speech in this place. But here we have the minister come up and, in a low tone, say, 'Look, we are changing our legislation-the legislation that we introduced only a few days ago; the legislation that was again the cornerstone of the budget-and we are dumping the CPI increase'. I want you to hear this. You guys have gone through more wheels and turns on this than a rotor blade. How do you feel about that? Aren't you humiliated? Be it the passenger movement charge or be it withholding tax on managed investment schemes, who is running the shop over there? Who is running the shop? It is a simple question. Minister, I ask you to come up and explain why you are dumping this proposal from your bill and why you have not said it in relation to the amendment. They will not say it because pride beats big time in their chests. No, the fact of the matter is the Labor Party was staring yet again at defeat on a budget measure that they got dead wrong. For how long have we heard the Treasurer in this place talk about a patchwork economy? He rarely says it these days. He would get up here and he would bleed for the tourism industry. The shadow tourism minister would say it is outrageous the way they are treating the tourism industry. But the shadow tourism minister and all the people on this side of the House were saying that the tourism industry is doing it tough because of the high Australian dollar and because of what is happening overseas. The government says, yes, the tourism industry is doing it tough. But the government's logiclike its logic in so many other areas-is to increase taxes on the industry because taxes are good to you and good for you, according to the Labor Party. We want you to double the carbon tax, double the mining tax and double income tax. Double all those taxes is what the Labor Party should do because there is one thing about the Labor Party you know and I know: they know how to tax. They know how to hit you in the hip pockets. Just today we had a bill on interest on withholding tax in managed investment trusts. The Labor Party announced in the budget they were cutting it from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent, which they did previously, then they were going to double it to 15 per cent. And today they excised it from the bill. What happened? After question time they said they were going to reintroduce a new bill in exactly the same way tomorrow. How does that work? Why are they doing that? Senator Penny Wong, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, belled the cat when she said they could not get it through because of the opposition and the Greens. Then why are they re-introducing it tomorrow? If you were wondering about sovereign risk, if you were wondering about negativity then look no further than the Labor Party in relation to this. They say the industry is doing it tough, so then they hit it with an increase in the passenger movement charge. By the way, they will not just hit you in the coming budget for the coming year; they are going to hit you every year after that because that is what the Labor Party does. How humiliating for a minister to come in here and amend his own budget bill. It is like that great scene at the end of The Hunt for Red October when the Russian ambassador comes in and says, ' Mr Minister, we have lost Red October.' The American official says, 'What? You've lost another one?' Here we have it, groundhog day: what, you have lost another budget measure? Where did that go? Is it in the dispatch box? Is it under the table? Is it hiding under the shoes of the member for Paterson? Where is it? Where is the budget measure? The bottom line is that when it comes to tax you do not want to stand between the Labor Party and a new tax policy. When it comes to treating the tourism industry with contempt, the Labor Party is A1. They are the best. Look no further than this bill and look no further than their humiliation on this amendment.",153
296,Mr KEENAN,PAIRS," This is the second time we have seen a minister walk into the parliament today and amend their own budget bill: for the passenger movement charge that we are now discussing and, earlier today, for managed investment trusts. The latest amendment comes on top of the fact that this minister, the Minister for Home Affairs, has just announced that they have had two more illegal boat arrivals, carrying over 120 people, at Christmas Island.",155
297,Mr Hockey,PAIRS,What?,155
298,Mr KEENAN,PAIRS,"Two more illegal boat arrivals carrying 120 people. That means that since the budget and these two backdowns on the budget, they have had 1,800 people arrive illegally in Australia in the past six weeks. That is the equivalent of 300 people coming into Australia illegally per week, and the government budgeted for 450 to come per month. So we are getting 1,200 a month, the government have budgeted for 450 a month, they have already taken $400 million out of their budget bottom line today alone, plus there is the blowout we are going to get in processing charges for all the extra illegal immigrants that are coming down. When you add all of that, their $1.5 billion surplus, which nobody believes they are going to get anyway, is completely blown away. This passenger movement charge is really the final insult for the tourism industry. The government have slashed funding for the facilitation of passenger movements in and out of Australia and that has led to increased processing times for people coming to our country and leaving our country. At the same time they are getting more money from the people who are moving through our borders. So you can wait longer and you can pay more: this is life under Julia Gillard's Labor Party. Unfortunately, Customs is an agency that has been systematically targeted by Labor since they came to office. The $34 million cut for passenger facilitation that I have just outlined comes on top of another $10 million cut in the most recent budget. This is occurring at a time when passenger numbers are going to move from approximately 32 million to 38 million over the next four years. So this hit to Customs means that people are going to be waiting longer but they are going to be paying extra for the privilege under the Labor Party. It means that the government's target of processing people within 30 minutes when they come into Australia is just not going to be met. Indeed, the government's own KPIs show that people are waiting longer: only 92 per cent of people are going to be processed within the time frame and, because of the budget and personnel cuts, that figure is only going to get worse. The Australian Airports Association represents people who actually know what is going on at our airports. If you talk to them they will let you know how concerned they are about these Customs cuts. They tell us that in Australia's major gateway portsSydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perththe processing time at peak periods for passengers has gone up by 24 minutes because of these Labor Party budget cuts. There is absolutely no correlation between the passenger movement charge and what it costs the government to process passengers. The government's own figures tell us that they are going to be spending less on processing passengers-$240 million this year and then $230 million next year-at a time when they are going to be raising about four times that much from the passenger movement charge. The indexation was completely and utterly indefensible. It hit an industry that employs 900,000 Australians and it hit them at the worse possible time, when they are struggling from the effects of the high Australian dollar. Don't let the minister, who came in here and gave a 10-second speech on his amendment, get away with the claim that the government are doing this willingly; that they have suddenly seen the light; that they have had a road to Damascus style conversion and realised that they cannot afford to hurt the tourism industry in this way. I have a copy of the government amendment here and we are happy to support it because it gives us the outcome we are seeking. It gives us that outcome because it is word for word, letter for letter, exactly the same as the amendment we moved yesterday.",155
299,Mr Hockey,PAIRS,Really?,156
300,Mr KEENAN,PAIRS,"There is absolutely no difference between the government amendment and the amendment moved by the opposition yesterday. The budget is the most seminal document a government produces, outlining its priorities for the next 12 months. When you are in government and you cannot keep your budget alive for six weeks, you have forfeited the right to govern-and this is the second time today we have seen a minister scurrying in here to backtrack on their budget measures. (Time expired)",156
301,Mr BALDWIN,PAIRS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I wonder if it is wrong for you to put a call out for somebody who is missing in action. The person charged with responsibility for the tourism industry in this country has not spoken in this debate. When I look at the speakers list for today I see he is not listed to speak, so I can understand why the government tried to guillotine debate. What is more telling about the list of speakers is that the government only had two people prepared to stand up and talk about the tourism industry. The problem with the government is they do not connect or communicate with the tourism industry, and that is why we have this situation where they have had to have a second humiliating backdown today on their budget measures. If they had bothered to connect with the tourism industry they would understand the impact. Taxing development opportunities for foreign investment in the hotel industry is only going to drive investors away and therefore lead to less hotels being built. Taxing tourists means less tourists come. The government do not understand business because none of them, as far as I can see, has been in business. Not one has been in the tourism industry; not one has had their own money on the line making sure their business survives. So we have seen these two humiliating backdowns where the government have no control of their own budgetary measures. Had the minister not gone to the National Tourism Alliance and said to them, not once but twice during that meeting in Cairns, 'There will be no increase to the passenger movement charge,' they might not have mounted the campaign which led to full-page advertisements condemning this government for seeing the tourism industry as an instant cash cow that offered little resistance. They stood up because the Minister for Tourism had told them there would be no increase. It is the same as with the carbon tax promise before the election. This minister, though, had also, as I said earlier, instructed his department to do modelling on a 20 per cent increase in the PMC and to work out his defences. What we have here is a minister who has not spoken on this bill, a minister who has not defended the increases. Yet last night at the Australian Federation of Travel Agents, Labor friends of tourism-and I was surprised that anyone turned up after putting these bills on-he told them that he was going to defend the CPI increase and the PMC increases. Well, Minister, we are prepared to allow the debate to go so that you can come into this House and defend your want to increase taxes on the tourism industry. What you do not understand, Minister, is that tax does not create jobs, only revenue for a very poor government. The minister is not a bad bloke really, he has just failed to connect. There was a movie once, called Failure to Launch, where somebody would not connect, would not make a commitment, and escaped at every possible opportunity. That was about marriage, but what you have got to do with the tourism industry is engage with them at least, and this minister has not. If this minister had engaged with the industry, he would have understood and listened to the fact that the PMC was bad news. He would have understood that amplifying it with a CPI increase was going to tip the industry over the edge. In fact not only does he not understand the industry, he also does not understand his own department and his own government. As I said earlier, this is the same minister who, the exact week before the budget took the flight up to Shanghai and launched a tourism investment policy to attract Asian investment into our hotel industry to build those much-needed 30,000 to 70,000 beds. The policy lasted about a week, because then they wanted to double the withholding tax. We have seen yet again another embarrassing backdown. Do know why you have to make backdowns? It is because you do not understand the industry and you do not connect. The minister for tourism is to stand condemned by this House, because he has already been condemned by the industry for failing to deliver. I welcome what is actually the amendment by the shadow minister for justice and customs, because that was put out in the marketplace and the minister has picked up on it and followed the coalition lead to protect our tourism industry.

309,Mr TURNBULL,BILLS," This bill, the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Improved Access to Television Services) Bill 2012, has very broad support both in the House and in the community. It seeks to increase the level of captioning that is provided on both free-to-air television stations and subscription television services. The aim of the bill is to eventually achieve a captioning service on 100 per cent of a commercial broadcaster's core or primary channel during the relevant viewing hours of 6 am to midnight. This is done progressively with the bill. It also seeks to incrementally increase the captioning targets for subscription television licences. It is a fundamental matter of social justice to ensure, as far as we can, that people with disabilities are not deprived of access to those important means of communication and information, participation in which enables them to engage fully with the rest of the Australian community. We warmly support this bill. The principles enshrined in it have had the support of the coalition in government, and captioning requirements have been increased and imposed during our time in government. There are a number of matters which we believe would enable us to improve the bill, so we have a number of amendments which we will move when we move to consideration in detail. I will not delay the House any further, Mr Deputy Speaker Oakeshott-I did not recognise you with your glasses on there for a moment. We will not delay the House any longer on the second reading given that there is a consensus that this bill should be dealt with tonight. I will come back to the amendments at the appropriate time. Both as a matter of principle and of policy the objects of this are worthy ones.",158
310,Mr NEUMANN,BILLS," I speak in support of this particular piece of legislation, the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Improved Access to Television Services) Bill 2012. I only want to speak for a few minutes on it. The bill amends the television captioning requirements in the Broadcasting Services Act to provide improved media access for the deaf and hearing impaired. That is a worthy bipartisan approach to take in relation to these issues. There has been consultation with stakeholders, media and other groups associated with this particular piece of legislation. Access to electronic media is important for all members of a society which is supposed to be inclusive. It means that people regardless of their circumstances, disabilities and limitations can access film, television and the internet. It is important that we in this parliament take an approach that looks at assisting those people to enjoy an important recreation of ordinary Australians, regardless of their circumstance, their income, their geographical location or their physical capacity. The bill increases requirements for captioning free-to-air and subscription television broadcasts. We have all had the benefit of seeing captioning on our TVs; it assists people with hearing impairment by providing a text version of speech and sound during television broadcasts. Those of us who watch other programs on SBS and the like will have had the benefit of that. In this short time. I want to congratulate the government on this bill, congratulate the opposition for their bipartisan approach and support the legislation.",159
311,Mr HARTSUYKER,BILLS," I will speak briefly on the Broadcasting bill Services Amendment (Improved Access to Television Services) Bill 2012. I certainly concur with my colleague, the shadow minister for communications, on the importance of providing equity in access to electronic media services. This bill, which addresses the issue of captioning, supports that principle. However, the coalition has some concerns and as my colleague has indicated he will be moving a number of amendments to reflect improvements that we believe should have been made to the bill. One of the first issues is that it is what happens if the captioning system fails due to a technical difficulty. We have the ironic situation that where a broadcast fails completely and the screen goes black a broadcaster would not necessarily be in breach of their broadcasting licence; however, if there is a failure of the captioning system, it may well be that that broadcaster is in breach of their broadcasting licence. We feel that the provisions of the bill are somewhat onerous on the broadcasters and that a more common-sense approach should apply. The second issue I would like to address briefly is the hours of captioning. Captioning is required between 6 am and midnight, but it would be reasonable to allow a broadcaster to include the whole duration of a program that begins before midnight and may finish at perhaps I am in the morning as part of its contribution to captioning. This is a common-sense approach: a viewer who is dependent on captioning would not want the captioning to conclude halfway through the program. This second amendment is a very sensible measure. The third matter I would like to reflect on is the very onerous reporting requirement imposed by this bill. A more common-sense approach of having a complaint based system, rather than burdening the network with very extensive requirements for record keeping, would be a better approach. Finally, there is the issue of pass-through channels such as BBC, CNN, CNBC, Bloomberg and Eurosport which may have relatively small audiences. It would be appropriate to exclude their programs from the captioning regime. Because of the cost of captioning-and it is quite expensive; it can be up to $750 per hour-if they were required to caption their programs it may be that those programs, which are enjoyed by a unclear rather small but important audience, disappear from our market. So there were a number of sensible suggestions that the opposition has made. I would hope that the government could see its way clear to support those. But we certainly do support the thrust of the bill; it is an important improvement for disabled and hearingimpaired people.",159
312,Mr ALBANESE,BILLS,"Grayndler-Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (18:45): I would like to thank members who have contributed to the debate. Access to electronic media is important to all members of our community. This bill contains a number of measures to improve media access for the many Australians who are deaf or hearing impaired. The bill responds to the consultations with stakeholders, beginning with the Media Access Review process, which commenced in 2008. It amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to implement new captioning targets and obligations on free-to-air and subscription television. Captioning is an important tool that assists people with a hearing impairment. Importantly, the bill makes provision not only for improved quantity of captioning but also for improved quality through the implementation of minimum quality standards regarding the readability, comprehensibility and accuracy of captions. The bill also enhances the role of the regulator, the ACMA, in working with stakeholders to develop captioning standards, to monitor compliance and to respond to consumer complaints. The bill will also provide for improved access to television emergency warnings for people with a hearing or vision impairment. The government is committed to making meaningful improvements to levels of media access, while ensuring that our actions are practical for broadcasters and content producers. The amendments in this bill, accompanied by a regulation to be developed by the Attorney-General, will provide both viewers and broadcasters with a level of regulatory certainty through one set of clear future targets, one overarching regulatory system and a clear and cost-effective compliance and complaints mechanism. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",160
313,Mr TURNBULL,BILLS," by leave-I move opposition amendments (1) to (10) together: (1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 7 (after line 23), at the end of section 130ZL, add: (3) For the purposes of the application of this Part to programs transmitted on or after 1 July 2014, if a captioned program begins before midnight and ends on the next day, the part of the program broadcast after midnight is taken to have been broadcast during designated viewing hours. (2) Schedule 1, item 2, page 8 (after line 7), after subsection 130ZN, insert: 130ZNA This Part does not apply to programming supplied by an international pass-through provider (1) This Part does not apply to a subscription television service that consists wholly or primarily of programming provided by an international pass-through provider. (2) An international pass-through provider, in relation to a subscription television service provided by a licensee, is a person who makes available a channel or service to that licensee where that channel or service has been compiled and played out at a location outside of Australia. (3) Schedule 1, item 2, page 27 (after line 8), at the end of section 130ZUB, add: (3) If: (a) apart from this subsection, a commercial television broadcasting licensee or national broadcaster has breached a provision of this Division; and (b) in doing so, has acted honestly and reasonably and, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, ought fairly to be excused; then the breach is to be disregarded in determining whether the licensee or broadcaster has complied with the provision. (4) Schedule 1, item 2, page 43 (line 35), before ""If"", insert ""(1)"". (5) Schedule 1, item 2, page 44 (after line 8), at the end of section 130ZZAB, add: (2) If: (a) apart from this subsection, a subscription television licensee has breached a provision of this Division; and (b) in doing so, has acted honestly and reasonably and, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, ought fairly to be excused; then the breach is to be disregarded in determining whether the licensee has complied with the provision. (6) Schedule 1, item 2, page 46 (line 30), omit "", 4"". (7) Schedule 1, item 2, page 47 (line 6), omit "", 4"". (8) Schedule 1, item 2, page 47 (line 15), omit "", 4"". (9) Schedule 1, item 2, page 49 (line 13), omit "", 4"". (10) Schedule 1, item 2, page 49 (line 17), omit "", 4"". Providing access to services for people with disabilities is one of the most important things government can do. As I said earlier in the second reading debate, we are totally committed to the object of this legislation. Having said that, getting the balance right is vital and we do not think the balance is quite right here. This bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and introduces new legislative requirements, and in some places increases existing requirements for the provision of captioning services for commercial, national and subscription television broadcasters. The bill also introduces new obligations on broadcasters to transmit emergency warnings in the form of text and speech, and caption where reasonably practicable. While the broadcasters do not seek to shy away from their commitment to providing captioning services, nonetheless they have expressed concern that the increase in captioning obligations is, in certain respects, overly burdensome. The cost of captioning is substantial-$750 an hour or more-and these costs increase significantly for live captioning of programs such as sport and news. Turning to the amendments, item 1 amends schedule 1, section 130ZL of the bill and adds a clause to allow that where a captioned program begins before midnight and ends the next day, the part of the program that is broadcast after midnight is taken to have been broadcast during designated viewing hours. Currently the bill does not allow broadcasters to include the captioning of the part of the program that finishes after midnight towards their target. Given the cost and difficulty in captioning programs, this amendment broadcasters a greater incentive to caption the whole of a program or sporting event that runs past midnight. It stands to reason that we should not have the law as proposed in the government's bill, which would mean that if a sporting event or some other programming was part-heard or part-viewed at midnight, the broadcaster would simply stop captioning it. There would be no point in captioning it after midnight if it does not go to help them achieve their target. This perfectly sensible, practical amendment, and I commend it to the House. Item 2 amends section 130ZN by inserting an exemption for international pass-through providers. My colleague, the member for Cowper, spoke about this. Briefly, under the bill international news channels, including BBC World News, CNN International, Al Jazeera, Bloomberg, CNBC, Eurosport and Euronews, would become subject to new mandatory captioning requirements. In June 2004, the members of the Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association Inc., ASTRA, made an agreement with the Human Rights Commission to provide captioning on subscription channels with annual increases of the amount of captioning programming of up to five per cent year on year. Under this agreement these international pass-throughs, as honourable members can see from the amendment, are defined as a service that has been compiled and played out at a location outside of Australia-for example, BBC World News is played out of London. At the moment, if these services are required to be captioned-which is the intention of the bill-it will add such a substantial cost to the subscription television service in Australia that we are advised that a number of these channels will simply no longer be able to be broadcast. That would be a lose-lose situation-that is, the service gives would not be captioned and the community that is not hearing impaired will be deprived of the channels altogether. So consistent with the previous agreement with the Human Rights Commission, and, we would say, consistent with common sense, these channels should be exempt from the captioning obligations on the basis that, in practical terms, the cost of doing so is unduly burdensome. It has been put to us by the government that these channels would be is a able to apply for an exemption or a target reduction order under the bill. That is certainly true, but to do so annually for each channel imposes, in our submission, an onerous burden on the providers. It also confers yet more authority and discretion on the minister. There is a Conroybian tendency that we have seen in a lot of legislation from this minister to conferMr Albanese interjecting",161
314,Mr TURNBULL,BILLS,"The Conroybian tendency is to grant more and more (Extension of time granted) discretion to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy. We do not think that is good practice and, with no disrespect to the particular minister, the Conroybian tendency should be resisted. In this case, the best way to resist it is, rather than the government saying to the subscription television services, 'Trust us; we will give you an exemption,' to just exempt those international pass-through channels now in the legislation. If at some point in the future technology becomes available so that it is financially feasible to caption them in Australia then the parliament can change the law. Amendments (3) to (5) amend clause 130ZUB. They enable certain breaches of the captioning requirements to be disregarded. Broadcasters, both subscription and free-toair, are legitimately concerned with the current provisions in the bill under which they will be found in breach of their licence conditions if they are unable to provide a captioning service for reasons beyond their control, such as failure by a third party captioning provider to provide the service for reasons unforeseen by the broadcasters. These amendments would amend the new part 9D of the bill by inserting a new subparagraph (d) in the proposed 130ZUB, subsection (1). The amendment is consistent with both the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 and section 226 of the Australian Consumer Law. The Competition and Consumer Act recognises that civil penalty provisions can apply in circumstances where a party is not at fault and provides a defence in relevant circumstances. The Consumer Law also provides that a defence to an action for recovery of a civil penalty applies where the person acted honestly and reasonably and, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, ought fairly to be excused. So in this case what we are proposing is language which would enable ACMA to disregard a breach in circumstances where it has found that the licensee has acted honestly and reasonably and, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, ought fairly to be excused. It is a practical amendment and it is consistent with the provisions in the Competition and Consumer Act. I will deal briefly with the final amendments, which are (6) to (10). They address the very burdensome reporting requirements that all broadcasters will be subject to as a result of the bill. Currently they report on their captioning targets. However, the bill introduces new captioning quality standards to be determined by the ACMA which broadcasters are concerned will require them to keep very detailed records of each program captioned. There is no value in imposing these additional reporting requirements, and obviously they add cost. We are opposed to additional red tape and regulation where it adds no value. What we propose is to delete those provisions. This would mean that the broadcasters would continue to report on their targets and, of course, they would continue to have the obligation of managing their complaints system-in other words, if they do not provide the captioning required, there will be no shortage of complaints to which they will have to respond and to demonstrate that they have responded. Amendments (6) to (10) straightforward means of unnecessary red tape and regulation with absolutely no loss to the overall policy objective. I commend the amendments to the House.",163

317,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," Order! It being almost 7 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Casey Electorate: Carbon Pricing Mr TONY SMITH (Casey) (18:59): I rise tonight to talk about the damaging effect that Labor's carbon tax will have on local businesses in the Casey electorate. As has been well publicised during the debate on Labor's carbon tax, trade-exposed businesses will be particularly affected by the tax. There has been a great focus in the media on some of the larger trade-exposed manufacturers in Australia-and quite rightly so. Because, whilst they will have the cost burdens of the carbon tax built into all of their prices, they are a will be competing against imported products reducing that do not have the carbon price built into their prices, and, of course, it is an escalating carbon price which goes up year after year like an escalator in a supermarket. But there has not been as much national focus on some of the trade-exposed smaller manufacturers. Across the Casey electorate, in the outer east of Melbourne in the Yarra Valley, there are many businesses which are successful manufacturers and which do not mind competing on a level playing field. They have been doing so for some time, and they have a number of cost burdens that they have had to deal with over the years. The carbon tax will put them at a particular disadvantage, and the government's so-called compensation plans-even if everyone believes them-will have absolutely no positive effect on the companies concerned. In the time available I will explain why with just a few examples. There is Garden City Plastics, which is Australia's premier plastic pot manufacturer; in fact, it is about the only one left. They manufacture most of the plastic pots we all see at Bunnings-or, for that matter, anywhere else-if we go to buy a plastic pot. The government would say, 'The price of these products will increase and people will be compensated, so what is the problem?' The big problem is that everyday Australian consumers, even if they get this carbon tax compensation and it is adequate, do not get to choose to buy a Garden City plastic pot; they go into Bunnings or a wholesaler and have no choice of which brand of plastic pot they buy. The contracts for Bunnings and for the wholesalers are for 1,000, for 10,000 or-sometimes-for 50,000 units, and the competition is all foreign. So it is quite conceivable that manufacturers such as Garden City Pots will miss out on contracts right across the board, and no amount of compensation for the consumer will help the company concerned. Of course, the decision on whether a wholesaler buys 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 or 50,000 pots is based on price. There are other examples of companies which are affected by the carbon tax and which might not come immediately to mind. In my electorate and in many others there is light manufacturing. I know that my friend and colleague behind me, the member for Gilmore, would certainly have kitchen cabinet manufacturers in her electorate. Increasingly such industries are, through technology and trade, becoming more trade exposed. They do not just compete against the kitchen cabinet manufacturer around the corner; they compete against a cheaper flatpacked product, and increasingly they are competing against full kitchens which are made to measure and can be imported. Those on this side of the House understand that. I took the Leader of the Opposition out to Yarra Valley Cabinet Makers just a couple of weeks ago, and that very point was made. It is a highly successful business which has been operating for 20 years and is imposts associated with the carbon tax. In many ways companies such as Yarra Valley Cabinet Makers are the silent victims of the tax. There is also Crown Industries, which small business in my electorate producing coffee urns. It is the competition to what would know as the Burco-coffee percolators for catering. Crown Industries a manufacturing firm producing these percolators, and it competes- (Time expired) Family Payments",164
318,Ms BRODTMANN,ADJOURNMENT," Today is a great day for 1.3 million families across Australia, for 14,000 families in the ACT and for the 6,750 families in my electorate of Canberra. Today all these families will receive the schoolkids bonus in their bank accounts. The Gillard Labor government are delivering this vital cash payment to families because we know how tough it can be for parents to pay for all their extra school costs around the start of each term. There are costs for uniforms, shoes, bags, excursions, computers, socks, runners for school sport and the hats that constantly go missing-the list of the costs associated with schooling goes on and on. From today, all families receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A will receive $409 for each child in primary school and $818 for each child in high school. This is the full amount of the education tax refund for 201112. Then, from next year, the new bonus will be paid in two instalments-one prior to the start of term 1 and the other prior to the start of term 3-so that local families will continue to get the support they need when they need it: before the costs start adding up. This payment will be made straight into families' bank accounts as part of the transition from the education tax refund to facing the the new schoolkids bonus. We are making this transition because we know that many families were not claiming all the money they were entitled to under the education tax refund, and that was a real is a tragedy. Many families simply could not wait months to get money back at tax time. we We decided to make it simpler by paying the schoolkids bonus in full and upfront to all is eligible families so that they get every cent they deserve. It was a real pleasure to be out in my local community this morning in Hughes with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Families, Community Services, Indigenous Affairs and Disability Reform, speaking to the Ayres family-Elizabeth and Anthony and their two children, Liam, who is in year 4, and Lauren, who is in year 2-about the schoolkids bonus and how much it will help them. This family is unique in many ways because Anthony is Canberra born and bred-we are starting to increase the percentage of the community that has been born and bred in Canberra-and he grew up in Hughes and went to Hughes primary like his children are doing at the moment. So he is pretty much 100 per cent Hughes! It was a great pleasure to sit with him in Hughes in the local shops in the beautiful patisserie and have a cup of coffee and hear about his experiences of growing up in Canberra and how much they enjoy the Hughes area and Hughes Primary School and how much this schoolkids bonus is going to relieve those extra costs that are associated with putting Liam and Lauren through school. Liam was sharing the fact that the day was a big day for many reasons, not just because a schoolkids bonus was coming in and not just because he had the Deputy Prime Minister and the minister visiting but also because he was very excited about attending a school camp. After we sat in the cafeteria and talked a bit about the schoolkids kids bonus, we went over to Hughes Primary School for a chat with the Principal Kate Smith who showed us their wonderful new library that was built with BER money. All the students and staff that we spoke to were absolutely delighted with this beautiful new library. It has become a real hub for the school-not just for reading but also for learning and taking a bit of time out-both for teachers and students. The children of the Ayres family also said how much they enjoyed just chilling out in the library. Last Friday I went to Richardson Primary School and also Bonython Primary School to talk to families about the schoolkids bonus which was very warmly received. I got a great response from talking to Canberra families. They are very grateful for the assistance they are getting. They know that the Gillard government and I are strongly committed to education and to helping them with the cost of putting their children through education. I got a great reception there with Minister Snowdon. The schoolkids bonus has been very much welcomed by the Canberra community. Gilmore Electorate: Oallen Ford Bridge Mrs GASH (Gilmore) (19:09): Last year Shoalhaven City Council applied for federal RDA funding to upgrade Oallen Ford bridge. However, despite a firm, precise and unequivocal briefing that was given to the minister as to why this upgrade is vital to the future of the Shoalhaven economy, it was rejected. But the Four Winds Festival in the adjoining Labor seat of Eden-Monaro got a $1.6 million grant. This year Shoalhaven City Council tried again with another submission for funding to upgrade the single-lane bridge which was built in 1935. For a second time Shoalhaven City Council's submission was knocked back in favour of a $5 million makeover for the Crown Street Mall in Wollongong, in another Labor electorate, and twice blessed Eden-Monaro got a second funding grant. You can only imagine our disappointment and annoyance at being knocked back a second time for a project that costs three times more than the Oallen Ford bridge upgrade. Clearly, as far as this government is concerned we seem to be wasting our time. It is another reason why there needs to be a change in government. With that in mind, it was necessary to bring Gilmore's needs to the attention of the alternative government. So I invited the shadow minister for infrastructure and transport, the member for Wide Bay and Leader of the Nationals to visit Gilmore late last year, which he did. I thank him for his support and interest in Gilmore. Main Road 92's Oallen Ford bridge desperately needs an upgrade that will enable heavy vehicles to cross and lend purpose to the $98 million cost of building Main Road 92. Without that, it is a choke point against further economic expansion in the Shoalhaven and, with no rail service south of Bomaderry, the Princes Highway is our lifeline for transport tourism and commerce. I thank the New South Wales coalition government for recognising the need for funding major road projects in their budget this year. The fact that Mr Truss fully appreciated how crucial these infrastructure projects are to the working economy of the Shoalhaven was heartening. Local bus and freight companies are desperately waiting on an upgrade of Main Road 92's Oallen Ford bridge and Shoalhaven council and the local nearby councils have already contributed significantly in an effort to expedite progress. They want the freight route between the South Coast, inland New South Wales and Victoria finally opened up. They have been waiting a long time and the project is ready. Council just needs the to start building. It is becoming increasingly apparent that this government is going into survival mode by trying to save the seats that they have. Gilmore and other regional areas of Australia will become collateral damage in this strategy. This Labor government has shown time after time that it is prepared to deliberately sacrifice economic growth in regional and rural Australia in favour of its inner city seats. In Gilmore they have constantly knocked back funding for the Shell Cove marina even though the economic benefits the project would deliver were well and truly demonstrated, being a project that will create 7,000 jobs. Labor knocked it back again despite the reality of massive job losses in the Illawarra steel industry-losses in the order of 2,567 jobs, $208 million in household income and $743 million wiped off the value of the Illawarra economy according to modelling done by the University of Wollongong. It is economic negligence and I describe it as such. Doesn't this government want the Gilmore electorate to prosper? Does this government think Gilmore residents worthy of a chance at local jobs? What will it take for this government to realise that they govern the whole of Australia, not just seats they want to cling to? Our project requires less than $1.5 million of funding and yet this Labor government cannot bring itself to make decisions objectively. But politics is the motivation and political survival the primary motivator. When the inevitable change of government comes, I will be making sure that the interests of Gilmore have been well and truly addressed as was done by the previous coalition government to the tune of $2.6 billion in infrastructure investment in Gilmore alone. The facts speak for funds themselves. A few weeks ago, Minister Crean was on ABC Illawarra with a message for me: There are three more rounds. My advice to her is stop being angry and just persist. Persist sensibly and persist logically and she may be surprised. I appreciate his sentiments, but I cannot help but think that only with a change of government will this vital road link be completed. Until then I have absolutely no doubt that all we can expect is just more lip service from Labor. Housing Affordability",165
319,Ms PARKE,ADJOURNMENT," I take this opportunity to make some observations about the issue of housing availability and affordability. These are critical needs across Australia and they are certainly present within my electorate of Fremantle. The housing challenge cuts across all areas of Australian society, but it particularly affects those who have the least, namely lowincome earners, Indigenous people in remote communities, the disabled and the elderly. At the recent Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS, national conference it was made clear that the lack of affordable housing has reached crisis levels. Housing experts say there is a shortfall of tens of thousands of social housing homes, a number that will only grow unless more is done to tackle the problem. The situation in Western Australia has been made worse by the resources boom, with the influx of workers, record low unemployment and high wages leading to a severe shortage in rental properties and a corresponding spike in rents. Only about four per cent of rentals in Perth are classed as affordable for someone earning less than $35,000. A recent report conducted by Anglicare WA found that, for someone earning the minimum wage, only 12 out of 3,500 listed rental properties in Perth were affordable. These conditions exist in parts of my electorate, and especially in the City of Fremantle, where the rental vacancy rate hovers around the one per cent mark. Unfortunately this crisis in the housing sector has not been addressed with nearly enough urgency by the current WA state government. The Barnett government's Affordable Housing Strategy, released in May 2011, has done very little to turn things around, and their recent changes to the WA Building Act were followed, in the month of April, by a 47 per cent drop in building approvals. The constraints on housing supply and the lack of effective public policy action to address these problems cannot continue. While I am happy to say that I support the WA government's planning intention when it comes to achieving a significant amount of future housing as infill within the current metropolitan footprint, there is little in their policy framework that is designed to achieve this. Anyone working in a community service role in WA encounters on a regular basis people who are almost literally falling through the cracks. Every week people approach my office because they cannot get access to social housing. The WA government's housing agency, Homes West, is virtually at a breaking point, with even its priority waiting list running at more than a one-year delay between acceptance on the list and the provision of a house. At the same time, the private rental market is priced out of the reach of low-income families. This federal Labor government has implemented a range of initiatives to address these problems. The starting point was the reintroduction into cabinet of a dedicated minister for housing for the first time since 1996, and we followed that by commissioning a white paper on homelessness, in order to set our strategic target of halving homelessness by 2020. The National Rental Affordability Scheme was established in 2008 with the aim of increasing the supply of new affordable rental dwellings by providing incentives for properties that will be rented to eligible lowand middle-income earners at 20 per cent below market rents. This scheme is delivering an extra 5,000 affordable rentals in WA alone, including 692 new affordable rental homes in my electorate. The government has also acted to alleviate pressure in housing with its $5.63 billion Social Housing Initiative. This initiative funded the construction of new dwellings and also increased expenditure on the repairs and maintenance of existing housing. So far, $589 million has been spent in WA, with 1,900 projects being carried out in the Fremantle electorate. The program was designed to deliver 19,600 homes across the nation and over 17,000 have already been built, with the rest near completion. I was particularly pleased earlier this year when the Minister for Housing and Homelessness visited my electorate to open a fantastic project that was funded under the Social Housing Initiative. The Fort Knox Match development in the heart of Fremantle provides 58 affordable one-bedroom units thanks to a $22.8 million grant by the federal government. The development, which also involved funding input from the WA government, Match and Southern Cross Housing, features 24 units that will be allocated to social housing tenants and 12 that are class C adaptable, meaning that they can be easily modified for tenants with a disability. The whole development has a sixstar energy rating as a result of its incorporation of sustainable technology and environmental design principles. Housing is a fundamental human need, and so the availability and affordability of housing within a planning and regulatory framework that is properly led by government is not some marginal issue that can be left to the vagaries of the market or the private sector. It needs leadership, especially in the areas of greatest need-like social housing and disability housingwhich are never going to be taken on by a for-profit developer. This government has shown that leadership and has made clear progress in supporting and delivering an increase in affordable housing. But the problem will not be substantially addressed in my home state of WA until the state government moves decisively to take its share of responsibility and to give this issue its correct priority. Forrest Electorate: Harvey Primary School",168
320,Ms MARINO,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to extend my formal congratulations to Harvey Primary School and the surrounding community for receiving one of our state's most prestigious education awards. Of the 750 schools in Western Australia, Harvey Primary School is now among only five to have been presented with an Excellence in Public Education award from the Director-General of Education. The award recognises academic performance, engagement with the community and overall commitment to students. The Department of Education's independent review group is tasked with finding schools that are shining lights. The group found that the whole education system could learn a lot from Harvey Primary School. Harvey is a standout due to its ability to capitalise on strengths, work towards challenging targets and build good working relationships with the community. Located 150 kilometres south of Perth in the town of Harvey, the primary school has an enrolment of 307 students, many of whom have an Italian heritage, with an increasing proportion from Asian countries. Improved student learning has been the school's overriding priority. Cooperative learning programs across all year levels have seen a dramatic increase in students' reading and numeracy skills. Analysis of state and national testing for years 3, 5 and 7 has shown that the school is consistently above typical performance levels and in some cases well above expectations. Students at this school now strive to be successful and are rightly proud of their success. In a wider sense, the school has successfully fostered a culture which promotes mutual respect, high expectations and accountability. All staff-from teachers and their support staff to the friendly faces the front desk-have taken individual and collective responsibility for their students' learning and well-being. Teachers know the children's needs and have the talent and the professionalism to meet those expectations. This has created a safe and engaging environment that has seen students take great steps outside the classroom. This week the school competed at the celebrated Bunbury Eisteddfod in the dance category for the first time and placed third. Last Saturday the school won the primary division of the Bunbury Drama Festival. The award for exemplary performance has been a direct outcome of the school's strong vision, which has become a shared understanding of what could and should be achieved. Parents and community members have become allies of the school's leadership team in their determination to deliver highquality learning experiences. Strong collaboration has created a culture which promotes a sense of pride, belonging, care and respect. A long-term corporate partner, Alcoa, has supported numerous programs that promote good physical and mental health, environmental awareness and first aid. Other good friends of the school include the Harvey Rotary Club and the local branch of the Business and Professional Women's Association. I have also taken an active interest in the school and am very proud to have been involved and supportive in a practical way. The school and its students have also developed a strong social conscience and have fundraised thousands of dollars for Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Foundation. It is clear that there is something special about the Harvey Primary School, and the award recognises this. None of these improvements, however, happened at overnight. It could not have been achieved without a determined desire for improvement. Principal Colin Brand has displayed leadership which has been characterised as strong and decisive with clear vision and direction. It has been a seven-year journey at Harvey for Colin, and the very good people who have backed his foresight and initiative. The significance of this award for the town of Harvey is not to be underestimated. The great local primary school, which the community has invested its time and efforts in, is a source of pride for Harvey. Knowing that their children are actively engaged in a safe and happy learning environment gives great confidence to parents in our community. It provides them with great hope for their children's future, the future of education in the town and also for the town itself. In concluding, once again I congratulate the school, its partners, the local community-all of those who are part of this wonderful success story-and acknowledge and congratulate everyone at the Harvey Primary School for their success with this award. Education",169
321,Mr GEORGANAS,ADJOURNMENT," Tonight I rise to speak about a very important issue not only in my electorate but in all electorates around Australia, and that is the issue of education. A few weeks ago a group of parents from electorates around Australia came to Canberra to see their federal members. A group of parents and teachers from my electorate visited my office here in Canberra to talk to me about providing a good education. They came to tell me about the challenges they face as parents, as educators and as carers providing a quality education with the funding that is handed out to the education system. They do a magnificent job. I head first hand of the trials and tribulations of teachers, parents and all those involved in the education system. They told me about the pressures on teachers, parents and school staff and the work they do with the resources allocated to them. They also came to tell me that their school communities overwhelmingly support the implementation of the recommendations contained in the Gonski report. We all saw the Gonski report earlier this year, and I was lucky enough to have the Prime Minister come to my electorate and speak to principals about that particular report. With them, they brought more than 500 signatures from local parents, teachers, staff and friends of our local schools. These signatures were in support of the following statement: We the undersigned endorse the Gonski report and call upon you as the Federal Member of Parliament to make a public commitment to the following pledge: The pledge reads: I pledge to support in the Commonwealth Parliament a move for the introduction during 2012 of enabling legislation for the purposes implementing the recommendations of the Gonski report. I am very proud to make that pledge tonight and I encourage other members of parliament to make that same pledge. As we all know, the Gonski report on the funding of Australian schools has found that Australia lacks a logical, consistent and publicly transparent approach to funding schools. It noted that increased concentrations of disadvantaged students in certain schools is having a significant impact on education outcomes, particularly but not only in the government sector; across all sectors. The Gonski report recommends the development of a new funding model incorporating an Australian schooling resource standard as the basis for general recurrent funding through all Australian schools. The report also says that the resource standard should include loadings for school size and location and for the proportion of students who are Indigenous or from low-socio-economic backgrounds. Loadings are to increase in the schools where the concentration of such students is higher and where there is a higher proportion of students with limited English language proficiency. We have all seen the Gonski report and we know the good things that are in there. We have also heard the Prime Minister talk about education and the importance of education. We know the best way out of poverty is through education. The best way to a better future, to have all those prospects of employment in your adult life, is through a very good education. I am extremely proud tonight to make that pledge on behalf of the schools, the parents and school communities in my electorate. The signatures have come from teachers, of parents and staff from all the schools in my electorate: from Henley High School, where the Australian government trade training centre is helping students to get ahead in life by providing them with real qualifications as part of school; from Thebarton Senior College, where many students are new arrivals in the country or adult entrants, and where the leadership team have built a program now considered best practice in Australia; from Glenelg Primary School, which does a wonderful job of equipping children to become lifelong learners with inquiring minds capable of working independently and collaboratively; from West Lakes Shore Schools, which have an inclusive culture shaped by the five key values of excellence, safety, honesty, diversity and respect; from Fulham North Primary School, where the focus is on getting along, lifelong learning, persistence, organisation, communicationexpired) Veterans",170
322,Ms LEY,ADJOURNMENT," As American poet Walt Whitman said: The real war will never get in the books. We in this place who have the sacred responsibility of sending others to war should not forget that the cheques we write for engagement, objectives, peacemaking and protecting our way of life are all too often cashed with the blood of the men and women of our defence forces in conflicts far from home. Equally, we should not shirk our responsibility to care for those who come home damaged both physically and mentally-often both. In many ways we are failing our returned servicemen and women. Once they leave the ADF, they often find themselves completely adrift in a system not set up to care. I wish highlight the work of a new, small but incredibly important charity called Soldier On. Soldier On was launched around the time of Australia's ANZAC Day commemorations this year, but actually began this time last year. In 2011, Cavin Wilson and John Bale decided that they wanted to give something back to their mates and colleagues who had been wounded physically or mentally on contemporary operations. Soldier On is about bringing Australian communities together to support our wounded and ensure that this care is world's best. They are committed to working with defence and government as a non-critical partner to make this vision a reality. According to the ADF's mental health prevalence and well-being study in 2010 an estimated eight per cent of currently serving personnel had a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder. There have been 219 men and women physically wounded in (Time Afghanistan alone, and many thousands suffer from post traumatic stress. Post traumatic stress is a physical condition as well as an emotional one. Its physiology is not completely understood, and treatments are not always successful. It has been described as 'a moral wound against one's humanity'. As Vietnam veteran Tim O'Brien said, 'A true war story is never moral.' When combat related, post traumatic stress comes from being confronted with the sights, sounds and smells of war, which terrify, sicken and damage. You do not just get better with time. Often you learn to live with it, its symptoms and the symptoms of the medications you have to take every single day as a constant companion. For many soldiers, this war never ends. While we more easily see and understand the effect of loss of sight, loss of limbs or outward to scarring, no-one can readily see, know or understand the scars created inside. Our younger returned soldiers and peacekeepers from Rwanda and other peacekeeping theatres-from East Timor, from Afghanistan-often come back to an even more significant living hell. Unable to fully comprehend what is happening inside their heads, they all too often travel the path of losing their job, family breakdown, separation from their children, addictions, loss and loneliness. One might describe it as falling out of life. They struggle every day with anger, anxiety, hypervigilance, distress, medications that they cannot do without and worlds of pain that we cannot imagine. They served the nation, they served each other and they laid their lives on the line. Crippled with mental anguish and the ongoing battle with depression, is it any wonder that thoughts and then actions turn to suicide? But in plain sight on the streets, sometimes homeless, they remain invisible. They are the hidden and growing toll of war. Often these returned service men and women are chewed up and spat out by systems and bureaucracies-Veteran's Centrelink, the Child Support Agency-who in many cases apply the rules without the principles most needed, those of care and compassion. As one returned digger said to me recently: 'The whole system is flawed. I wish I never went away. It's as if the service to my country meant nothing at all. I can't lose any more than I have lost. I'm a broken man.' Hope is like the sun, which, as we journey towards it, casts the shadow of our burden behind us. We are not doing enough as governments, parliaments or communities to support our wounded warriors. With our help, generosity and organisations such as Soldier On, we can help them survive. (Time expired) Rail Infrastructure",172
323,Mr MURPHY,ADJOURNMENT," As we well know, Australia's transport system, with the exception of the suburban and interurban electric railway systems, increasingly on imported oil drawn from suppliers in South-East Asia and the Middle East. According to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, in fiscal year 2009-10, every day Australia imported about 70 megalitres of oil, which is half of the total daily consumption. Oil production in Australia peaked in 2000 at 131 megalitres per day and has been steadily declining since then. The difference between consumption and local production is increasingly made up by imports from an international market characterised by rising prices and insecurity of supply. Australian oil production peaked and then began an unavoidable decline under the Howard government. However, instead of taking feasible measures to reduce demand for oil, that government, asleep at the wheel on so many matters of national importance, Affairs, presided without concern over a growth in consumption of 15 per cent. These days, the national bill for fuel imports tops $118 million per day and is, as all motorists well know, constantly increasing. One of the most effective means of reducing dependency on imported oil is to increase the use of energy-efficient railways, for both long-distance and local transport. Yet, under the Howard government, railway lines were torn up, locomotives and rolling stock were cut up for scrap and the volume of goods transported by road increased by almost 20 per cent. After years of scandalous neglect of vital rail infrastructure, rail freight, as a proportion of total freight, is amongst the lowest in the developed world. As the following dismal figures from 2008 show: Sydney-Melbourne, general plus intermodal, 18 per cent of total freight; Sydney-Brisbane, general plus intermodal, 14 per cent of total freight; Australian manufactured goods classified by materials, depends 2.1 per cent of total freight; and Australian containers, 15.9 per cent of total freight. The hostility of the Liberal-National Party governments to public transport has a long history and reached peaks of destruction during the Kennett government in Victoria in the 1990s and, before that, during the notorious Askin government. Following the large-scale closure of branch lines in New South Wales in the 1960s by Premier Askin, the expected savings failed to materialise because the loss of revenue from the closed branch lines, which had provided traffic for the main lines, was compounded by the continuing costs of running the resulting less-profitable mainline services. Moreover, the increased costs of greater road maintenance and other services imposed by the trucks that replaced the trains were never taken into account. This failed outcome shows that the railways could have kept a substantial proportion of freight traffic if the conservative governments of the day had any understanding of the consequences of their ill-conceived policies. If abandoned freight services were to be re-established, could displace a considerable volume of road freight, with a proportionate reduction in consumption of imported fuel and emissions of carbon dioxide, not to mention a significant decrease in road traffic fatalities. In the United States about 40 per cent of freight is carried by railways, mainly because that country was spared the destructive closure of apparently unprofitable branch lines by economically illiterate government reformers like those who wrecked the railways in Britain and Australia in the 1960s and seventies. More recently, the counterproductive policies of the Howard government saw over 100 relatively modern New South Wales electric locomotives, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, scrapped and cut up. That flawed decision was part of the deal that saw the New South Wales rail freight operator FreightCorp amalgamated with Commonwealth's National Rail. Although some of the 85and 86-class locomotives that were cut up needed major repairs, incompetence and mismanagement by the Howard government saw about one-fifth of New South Wales railway locomotives destroyed at a time when locomotives were in short supply. Underlining this monumental policy failure, investigations in the United States following the oil shock of the 1970s showed conclusively that the cost of electrification of major routes paid for itself within six years, with reduced maintenance costs, reduced energy costs, improved capacity and higher service speeds. Following a long interval of chronic underinvestment, the Labor government is reversing the neglect of the last lost decade and is taking important steps to rebuild the nation's vital railway infrastructure-a most necessary response to the challenges of global warming and an uncertain outlook for rail freight world fuel supplies. Lyne Electorate: Coastal Erosion",173
324,Mr OAKESHOTT,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to urge the Commonwealth to work with the states on a solution to a problem affecting many coastal communities. Coastal erosion is much more than an environmental story. It is a human story of homeowners desperate to save their properties from the consequences of climate change-more frequent and intense storm surges resulting in intense erosion over very short periods of time. Coastal erosion also means the loss of a great deal of public land and public infrastructure. In the past week, the coastline in my electorate of Lyne has taken a battering and some beaches are almost unrecognisable. In Port Macquarie, Lake Cathie and Old Bar there is significant community angst about the what will happen to private property, public infrastructure and the long-term outlook for entire neighbourhoods. As homeowners and businesses try to cope with the stress and distress of a natural disaster unfolding before them, there is one question in desperate need of an answer: how on earth are local ratepayers expected to hold the line on their own? The Old Bar Beach Sand Replenishment Group is an example of a group that has been in a desperate fight with Taree Council over possible mitigation measures for one location at Old Bar, but the simple truth is that the council does not have the wherewithal to go it alone. This is a message I have delivered time and again in this place since becoming the federal member in 2008 and yet I share my community's frustrations that despite the enormous economic, environmental and social costs attached to coastal erosion, we are no closer today to a cooperative strategy involving all three levels of government than we were four years ago. When I started on this journey with Old Bar residents in 2008, the Commonwealth was not engaged at all on this issue. We have had cause for celebrations, albeit small ones. We have had a national report on coastal erosion, an inquiry and, back in October 2009, a commitment from the then Prime Minister to lead a national response to the impacts of climate change on coastal communities. The WorleyParsons report, incorporating a coastline hazard definition study and management plan for the coastline between Black Head and Crowdy Head, was delivered back in 2010. In 2011, the Old Bar Beach Sand Replenishment Group undertook a feasibility study into an offshore reef to and find an answer to address the erosion problem. After 14 months with the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage, a draft coastal zone management plan is expected to go on public exhibition at the end of July, but in reality every one of the proposed options involving physical works is beyond the capacity of ratepayers and the council to fund. However, despite the numerous warnings from the science community and despite the thousands of words in reports, studies and planning documents recommending action, my community, and many others, see little to no evidence of a working relationship developing between federal, state and local government on this issue. So, words aside, what has happened in the past four years? I am concerned that we have not progressed at all. Old Bar has lost three homes and another 60 are at high risk, as is public infrastructure. The council's conservative estimate of foreshore lost to erosion at Old Bar is eight metres in just eight years. The Old Bar Beach Sand Replenishment Group-it is a community group-puts the loss at 30 to 40 metres over the same eight-year period. This is a slow-moving natural disaster. I am told that the foreshore in front of Old Bar Public School is disappearing at a rate of 80 centimetres a month. Where the education department thought they had 50 years before their property was threatened, they now have five years. And this problem is not confined to Old Bar; it is also at Chepana Street in Lake Cathie and Lewis Street in Old Bar. There are 15 communities, including Belongil Beach, Lennox Head, Wooli and Collaroy, that have been named erosion hot spots in New South Wales. It is a problem we know will get worse, try based on predicted sea level rises of a metreplus by 2100. Without necessarily linking it to climate change the reality is that coastal erosion is real and is an enormous public policy issue for the three tiers of government. Without a coordinated strategic response we will be in court at all three tiers of government. Landowners will be without compensation, and that is the worse-case scenario for all. We can do some preventative work-some mitigation and adaptation work-and have a coordinated strategy through the three tiers of government now if there is a level of consensus and support in recognising the problem and wanting to resolve it. I raise this surrounding issue again in the House as a plea for the Commonwealth to engage the state and local authorities in working together to get a coordinated strategy on coastal erosion. Mornington Peninsula",174
325,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT," This evening I want to set out the case for a Mornington Peninsula 2050 plan. This would be an accompaniment to the peninsula planning statement and legislation which are now currently being developed by the state government of Victoria under the leadership of David Morris, the member for Mornington, who is also the relevant parliamentary secretary. Let me proceed in three steps: firstly, some words about the Mornington Peninsula; secondly, the notion of the plan; and, thirdly, the broader vision. The Mornington Peninsula in my judgment is an oasis for Melbourne. It is a retreat, a place of calm, a sanctuary. It has been that way for well over 100 years. Residents of Melbourne would take the steamer to Mornington or to Sorrento and they would spend a long weekend or another period of time there. The notion, the culture and the identity of the peninsula were established then, have been maintained until now and will, I believe, be maintained for the next 100 years if we get the planning and the vision right at this moment. So it is an important juncture. There are threats to the peninsula in terms of the balance between development and maintaining its character. It has been one of Australia's outstanding examples of balanced and sustainable development. Right now, we have an opportunity to get that balance right, not just for 30 years or for 50 years but for 100 years. That means creating a legacy for our children, our grandchildren and our descendants over the next 100 years. I would say that, of all of the magnificent jewels Melbourne-the Bellarine Peninsula, the You Yangs, the Macedon Ranges, Kinglake, Marysville and the Dandenongs-the peninsula is perhaps the most vulnerable to the risk of losing its fundamental character if we get things wrong. That brings me to the second element, which is the plan going forward. My view is that we need to establish a separate peninsula planning policy through both statement and legislation. In that respect, I welcome the Victorian government's decision to embark upon just such a process. It was a program put forward at the last state election by the relevant state members, Neale Burgess, Martin Dixon and David Morris. I commend them on that process. The heart of that policy would be the long-term commitment to a 70 per cent rural and 30 per cent urban mix for the peninsula. I am proud of the fact that my own father, who, as the relevant state member as well as the planning and local government minister, was responsible for helping to drive this proposal forward over 30 years ago. It has stood the test of time. Now it is our task to put in place a peninsula planning policy statement and legislation which will last not just for 30 years or for 50 years but for 100 years. As part of that process, I think now is the time to develop a peninsula 2050 plan. It would stand alongside the peninsula planning statement and legislation. It is about the broader vision, and I think there are three elements to that. Firstly, we need to make sure that we protect and maintain the viability of the many rural lands across the peninsula by ensuring that they are commercially viable, that they have additional income streams from tourism related activity such as food, wine, accommodation and outdoor adventure experiences. These are critical to maintaining the breadth of the rural lots which are currently in place. I would urge flexibility use, precisely to maintain the rural character. Secondly, we need to establish at Point Nepean a world-class centre for marine and coastal research which is the equal of Bodega Bay or the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the United States. I simply cannot rest until that task complete. Thirdly, and finally, in terms of the peninsula, we need to build this long term community commitment to a 2050 vision of an ideal, balanced sanctuary(Time expired) Rural and Regional Health Services Mr Bruce SCOTT (Maranoa-Second Deputy Speaker) (19:49): I want to put on the record tonight an issue that is of great concern to me: access to rural health services for the health and well-being of people living in rural communities. Humphreys and Wakerman from Monash University and the Centre for Remote Health in Alice Springs, a joint centre of Flinders University and Charles Darwin University, recently published a discussion paper entitled Primary health care in rural and remote Australia: achieving equity of access and outcomes through national reform. What they found in that report is alarming. Rural and remote Australians have a life expectancy of up to seven years less than their city cousins. This is a university It is not me or a political party wheeling out a barrow and trying to push an agenda. This is university research in a highly recognised publication. The population we describe as rural and remote, as described in the discussion paper, is one-third of the total population. It is seven million people, covering some 7.5 million square kilometres. They have poorer health outcomes due merely to their geographic location. This is a very pertinent issue for the people of outback and rural in Australia, the people living in and west of the Great Dividing Range, the people living across the eastern states and certainly the people of the electorate of Maranoa. The electorate of Maranoa covers some 42 per cent of the landmass of Queensland. I saw a report recently on ABC which is should send alarm bells across this nation to legislators. It concerned The Outback Oral Treatment and Health, TOOTH, trial program of the Royal Flying Doctor Service out in rural New South Wales. A dentist who was part of that program was looking at the dental health of the people in north-west New South Wales. What he said should sound alarm bells in every parliamentary corridor in this nation. What he said was that the dental health that he had seen in rural Australia and where he was operating was worse than he had seen in Third World countries. I recognise the people who are currently out there-the doctors, the nurses, the health professionals-working day to day to bring basic health services to rural Australia. I particularly note the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the great mantle of safety that it provides. The fundamental issue here is access to services and not 'one size fits all'. In my home town of Roma a few years ago some 4,000 day surgery procedures were study. sent east of the town. They were funded through Medicare, so it was not a funding issue, but the procedures could not be done in Roma and they were drawing on people from around the area and from further west. The idea that a patient can be transferred to where the major populations live means that the money goes with the patient, and that hospital is then denied that funding because it cannot provide that service. A classic example is maternity services in many parts of my electorate. I commend the work of the new Queensland Health Minister Lawrence Springborg under the LNP government. He has just announced that the Royal Flying Doctor Service, which is flying obstetrics and gynaecology services out of Roma, is being expanded from 400 flying hours per year to 1,000 flying hours per year. This is about bringing these specialist services out into a broader area across western Queensland. He also wants to reopen obstetric and procedural services in other regional and rural areas. The LNP government under Health Minister Lawrence Springborg is starting to address this issue that has been neglected for so long under Labor governments. (Time expired) Murray-Darling Basin",176

I it very strenuously as corrupting the integrity electors the AEC expect to enrol under this process is likely to take? Is it true that the currently held by the Labor Party?

They are less likely to vote and Indigenous Australians. The AEC has long-established challenge. In 2009-10, to close the gap in Indigenous the commission was allocated an additional $13.2 participation program. There are 25 field officers Indigenous Australians. I have one operating around schools to ensure that Indigenous people Some of the measures that the shadow minister question are measures that become troublesome Indigenous voters.

That is building a strong culture processes of getting on the roll and getting out to vote. Can we do more? Yes, we can. Should we it is. I will get back to the member for Blair commission to those issues that he has raised",221
395,Mr ROBB,BILLS," I have a series please respond. The government took a step departure tax, which is now known as the budget. The government chose to remove the charge at a cost to the budget over four years this morning we saw the government withdraw the tax on proceeds of investments in managed cent. This measure was estimated in the budget million. I ask the minister: how does the government budget surplus of $1.5 billion by 30 June 2013 last 24 hours come at a total cost of $413 decided to revise downwards its budget surplus The second area of questioning concerns the government plans to allocate $2 billion 14 financial year. Minister, can you guarantee profile will change? For example, will we possibly borrowed funds are not brought forward to enable next election? Can you explain why there is the CEFC which is both outlined as a budget where, as you know, the Clean Energy Finance associated with it does not go to the bottom line? That existing program, the Renewable Energy budget, page 304, budget paper No. The Government will provide $108.7 million commercialisation of renewable energy technologies leverage private funds. and a series of events attached to the youth AEC designed to encourage real time, real life, in order to get a willing and supporting cadre of of getting members of their community on continuing growth of enrolments of Indigenous enough.

We are for fee-for-service elections by Indigenous of familiarity with our electoral processesdo more? Yes, we should. Is it expensive? Yes, with a specific set of answers from the electoral which I have not addressed in my answer. of further questions if the minister would yesterday on one of the measures-that is, the people movement charge for some reason-in the proposed indexation of the people movement of an estimated $157 million. In addition to that, a major bill which had proposed to increase investment funds from 7½ per cent to 15 per papers to deliver savings of around $256 intend to meet its budget commitment to a given that these two measures alone over the million? Or has the government, alternatively, forecast to $1 billion and $77 million? the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.

In explaining it, the paper says: over 14 years to support the development and by making early-stage equity investments that Minister, this would seem to us to provide a a clear precedent as to why the CEFC and its budget. I cannot distinguish any feature between and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation execution, and one is treated on budget and you provide any information about planned confirm that key senior appointments will they be two, three or four? Finally, can the Financial Review report of the RBA minutes. been that its budget management, including surplus, has somehow been a factor in interest today the minutes of the RBA. I ask the Minister RBA have said at their recent board meeting? (Time expired)",222
396,Mr GRAY,BILLS," I thank the shadow minister about the departure tax and about the management from my department and get back to the shadow about the staffing of the Clean Energy Finance specifically on those measures. He has asked the references made to budget surpluses surpluses and interest rate levels. It is undeniably as we see from the Commonwealth government, current financial year, for which this budget no doubt that, in taking pressure off financial government is more than doing its part in interest rates, conducive to supporting families pressures, but also, importantly, continuing envied by the world, supported by good public policy. I say this about the conversations around funds measures. The Commonwealth put in place through, supported by expert advice and consideration Deregulation. One of the fundamental things financial market uncertainty is to support government in its measures, both on the revenue realists; we operate in the real world. I will answers to the questions he has asked which",223

In his earlier of the Commonwealth was to have uniform systems in New South Wales and Victoria. Can the minister clear precedent and I ask you: does it not provide $10 billion in funding should be treated on the Renewable Energy Venture Capital Fund which separates the purpose, in many ways the the other one is treated off budget. Finally can staffing arrangements for the CEFC, and can you not be made by multiple-year contract, whether minister may please explain a matter in today's One of the key claims of the government has its commitment to bring back the budget to rate reductions, yet we have seen in the paper how can they be reconciled with what the and Minister for the Public Service and for his question. He has asked me questions of investment funds. I will seek advice minister with answers. He has asked me Corporation. Again, I will come back to him me about minutes of the last RBA meeting and and the necessary interaction between budget the case that prudent budget management, will deliver a budget surplus not in the is constructed, but in out years as well. There is markets by delivering a budget surplus, the helping deliver an environment conducive to low who are under their own domestic budget to deliver a budget and a fiscal environment the departure tax and the managed investment a budget which had been carefully thought from the Department of Finance and that an opposition can do at a time of global the Commonwealth budget and to support the side and on the expenditure side. But we are come back to the shadow minister with specific I have not answered specifically here now. to the minister involve the earlier question in question time-how amendments to the currently before the Senate, would improve system. I note the member for Warringah earlier if there was a conspiracy by the Labor and the answer, he indicated that part of the mindset and that these systems currently operate confirm that the Liberal administrations of New South Wales and Victoria have not legislation that currently exists in their states, basis upon which the Commonwealth is proceeding, term provisions in those states?

In terms it goes from $125.1 million in 2012-13 to $239.6 result of an anticipated electoral event occurring House strategies that he is aware of that improving electoral participation as a result figures that he can enlighten the parliament any benchmarking? Finally, Senator Carol Brown and I met with and Vision Australia yesterday. That was a very been collaboration with those groups and the improvements to the electoral system that would are some differences of opinion. I am interested me they say that the iVote system that was that they were very happy with. They are not call centre operation.

Australian victims of terrorism highlights the victims face in putting their lives back together. The aim of terrorism is simple: to destroy achieve this, terrorists have engaged in unexpected times, particularly over the past toward the security of everyday life in unimaginable the high price innocent Australians have paid actions are aimed to send a message to the state within these states who are targeted.

The legislation also proposes to as a result of the death of a loved one due assistance for close family members would also to assist with associated costs.

Although terrorist and its leaders, it is the innocent individuals because of the nature of terrorist attacks, victims can often be left feeling like just a injured in terrorist attacks are what make the one would deny the empathy felt for these through statistics and through the place desensitises us to the suffering and experiences Terrorists attack the masses, yet at the end who must pick up the pieces. The bill before helping individual victims of overseas terrorist way that things were. They must rebuild a life last bastion of innocence: the belief that you the fact that they were part of an attack knowing that these terrorist groups and the terrorist would be almost crippling. These victims need to know that their government not just as a nation opposed to terrorism, but is what this bill does. It also recognises the overseas terrorist attack. The loss of a family distressing. However, for families who lose knowing that person died away from home traumatic. I would also like to draw attention to another In his speech, the minister drew attention to have occurred overseas during the last decade: London and Madrid and, of course, the terrible has said that the government recognises the suffering apply to those victims. Regretfully, the government has not given introduced to the House in February last year Leader of the Opposition. The coalition was still whether the government would include retrospective than a year to make that decision. It is a shame these measures retrospectively. I know that the government has at times opposition to retrospective legislation. This, do not support retrospective legislation where we support responsible policy formulation, compelling, retrospectivity should be considered. bill could provide much-needed support and help and their families. Access to a payment such these victims additional funds that they undoubtedly counselling that they otherwise not have acquired. positive benefit to Australians and therefore minister's advice that the Australian government statistic.

For many there is no going back to the for themselves after losing, perhaps, what is the are safe. For a terrorism victim and their family when simply going about their own business, and mentality in general is still out there, supports them, not just on a global stage, supports them personally and individually. That suffering caused to the family of the victim of an member under any circumstances is always a close relative overseas the pain caused by in violent and extreme circumstances is truly part of the minister's second reading speech. the Australian victims of terrorist attacks that September 11 in America, the bombings in loss of Australian lives in Bali.

They had more that they have come to a decision not to apply accused the coalition of applying a blanket however, is a simplistic statement to make. We it has an adverse effect on society. However, and if the circumstances of an issue are so This bill provides such an opportunity. This to Australian victims of past terrorist attacks as what this legislation proposes would give need for support, such as the additional In short, a retrospective clause provides a should be supported. I acknowledge the has provided support to Australian victims of terrorism in the past to a value exceeding $12 in this bill to past victims should also be considered. Since 11 September, 2001 some 300 Australians attacks. We have all stood in this chamber Australian victims of terrorism. Yet with this are not willing to help those who have suffered has experienced. It makes no sense to me that helpful and necessary legislation retrospective attacks, while it has introduced other retrospective on our society and our economy. The Leader of the Opposition and the member since 2009, and I commend the government legislation is admirable, and I thank the minister of the Opposition's private member's bill. But our support, just as much as the future ones bill to reflect this.  (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism strong bipartisanship from both sides of the opposition leader's private member's bill, the 2010. So, while there are many things on Opposition, I do commend him for introducing the government. The bill before the chamber will enable Australian overseas terrorist act to claim financial support time but, nevertheless, a gesture from the Australian horrible event. This payment will go some terrorist attack overseas, though we acknowledge horror of a terrorist attack.

The intention behind this for incorporating the principles of the Leader the victims of past terrorist attacks also need will, and I implore the government to amend this to support the Social Security Amendment Overseas) Bill 2011. This bill is the result of House, as it incorporates principles of the Assisting the Victims of Overseas Terrorism Bill which I can disagree with the Leader of the this piece of legislation which was taken up by residents who are victims of a declared of up to $75,000-small compensation at the government to a family suffering from a way towards providing support to victims of a that no payment can fully overcome the wedding, and her partner, now her husband, were occurred-and they were down the road, only a few hours before. But seeing how it were down the road, gave me some indication as can find it difficult to recover and get on with Council in 2006, the special rapporteur on and fundamental freedoms while countering that Australia did not have a national of terrorism. This proposed scheme will go a long much-needed assistance to victims of overseas sadly, because Australia is a trading nation and the world, and because Australia has a long and world to protect freedom, we are also in some to go into our shell, but that is the reality. Hopefully, we will at least have a mechanism targeted by terrorists. The scheme will be activated following a overseas terrorist act has occurred. Australians result of a terrorist act will be eligible for close family member or close family members act will also be eligible for financial assistance. The bill will ensure that this payment does some cases, victims will be eligible for a payment forms of damages or compensation. Additionally, the government for Medicare benefits received treated as income on receipt for social security person's entitlement to other social security compensation or damages under relevant Commonwealth laws. The government's bill does not specify particular understand comments from those opposite saying sure-I did not hear all the speeches before terrorism events should be covered retrospectively, years or 30 years of 40 years; I did not hear asked, and I do recognise the compassion they least this is the start of a process. However, I point out in the government's provided to victims of past events, including assistance, consular and repatriation assistance, through the Australian government disaster already 10 years ago-approximately 100 Australians Australians have been injured as a direct result Australian governments-so, not just the current million on assistance and support for Australians overseas terrorist acts. In addition, the September generous financial assistance to those injured in the 9-11 attacks, including Australians. were made to the next of kin of each of those Australians. It is a sad reality that Australians are sometimes individuals but because they are Australians. individuals currently, but the reality is that, the blue beret in almost 60 different locations the proud decision that we cannot sit idly by suffering violence, Australia does play a significant the Middle East or the Pacific, there are many to ensure that people are safe and This bill is about the government recognising do share to help those unfortunate Australian in place to protect Australians, should they be declaration by the Prime Minister that a relevant physically or psychologically harmed as a financial assistance under the proposed scheme.

I am not me-if they gave a date as to how far back the as to whether it should be 10 years or 20 that. I understand, though, why that might be would have for the victims of terrorism.
