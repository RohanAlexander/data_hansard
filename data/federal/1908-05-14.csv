Mr THOMAS BROWN"" - I wish' to ask the Prime Minister if. his attention has been drawn to the following statement, published in the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 5th instant, as telegraphed from Perth, in a paragraph headed "" New Arrivals - Noisy Scenes in Fremantle ""There was ample evidence at Fremantle in the early IIOUTS of this morning that many immigrants by the Orotava, for Sydney and Brisbane, do not attain the standard sufficiently high to make them desirable colonists. The scenes which took place in the early hours of the morning are described, butno arrests were made, as there was no desire to detain such people in this State. Will the Prime Minister have an inquiry made as to the truth of the report, and, if it be found to be true, will he endeavour to arrive at an agreement with the authorities of the States whereby persons such as those referred to may be kept out, and a more desirable class of immigrants introduced ?",15
10,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I have not read the statement, but will inquire as to what foundation there is for it.",15
11,Mr THOMAS BROWN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"T n the issue of the same newspaper of the 9th instant occurs another paragraph, headed "" Bad Type of Immigrant - Crimina l Class not Required."" It says thatThe undesirable immigrant was very much in evidence at the Quarter Sessions yesterday morning and goes on to speak of the case of a young man, a recently arrived immigrant, who was sentenced to two months' imprisonment in the Goulburn gaol for robbery and false pretences. The Judge, in passing sentence, said that- . From the papers before him he, the accused, had been in trouble in Liverpool; in the Old Country, and had had his sentence suspended on condition that he left the country - ' He addedI t was a very improper thing, whoever sent you out here? If this country requires immigrants, it does not want them to be of the criminal class, and they had no right at all to send vou out here without any prospect of obtaining work. In view of these statements, will the Prime Minister consider the advisableness of enforcing the provisions of the Immigration. Restriction Act, to prevent the introduction of criminals, under the guise of desirable immigrants ?",15
12,Mr DEAKIN,POST AND TELEGRAPH,"I doubt whether, without the assistance of the Home authorities, measures can be devised to prevent individual criminals from coming to this country ; but I can look, into the case mentioned to see whether permission was given to this man to come here.

The policy of the paper being opposed to everything Australian except the fiscal question, is that the only reason it is to be subhave the addisidized by the Government?",16
23,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l The honourable member's questions invite an reaexpression of opinion on the policy and character of a leading newspaper which it is not at necessary for us to discuss in connection with a ill simple business arrangement for advertising Australia. The Government have arranged for three months for one page of advertising space in the first issue of a senarate supplement to the Standard, to be published weekly and devoted ento information from and questions of interest to the over-sea Dominions. It is announced that the. supplement will be devoted whollv to furthering the development of the ' Dominions and promoting a common understandat ing among their peoples and those of the Mother This marks an entirely new departure in English journalism, and appears likely who had to have f r u it f u l results. Canada is advertising largely in the supplement, and unless Australia is always to remain in the background in London, advantage must he taken from time lo time of opportunities such as Jthis.

The honourable gentleman was speaking of the pairs and the prospect of the vote.  think that the Treasurer did riot know the meaning of the phrase he used?",21
85,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I think the Treasurer used the phrase in relation to the vote, and not to the operation of other influences on honourable members-that he meant the votes were in favour of a particular side, and that that fact was known, but not that the votes had been improperly influenced.",21
86,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Why the Treasurer have brought in the name of a company ?,21
87,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,And what about former statements made in regard to honourable members ?,21
88,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I understand that those former statements have been, referred to the Committee on Privilege?",21
89,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,But in a leading article in the Melbourne Age of that morning there was a stronger statement.,21
90,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I do not remember that article; but since these charges present - an occasion, or supposed occasion, for action by the House, and for deciding what the action'shall be, I have considered how they ought to be treated. If no one appears to prefer the supposed charge diately before us and no one supports it there appears not to have been any intentional charge-and the supposed charge is abandoned by those who were believed to have made it , what is there to inquire",21
91,Mr WH IRVINE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"If the charge is made against us as a body, we cannot be our own judges.",21
92,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Surely there is such a thing as the honour of the House as a body.,21
93,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,I take it that a charge made against any member of this House affects every member of the House; and a charge made in a reckless way against some members would still more affect the House as a whole. The difficulty is how to grapple with charges that have not been made.,21
94,Mr WATSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Against individuals It ap- there is no charge.,21
95,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"In the absence of a specific charge, and in the absence of any person prepared to bring forward evidence, what have we to inquire into? Some statements that affect honourable members, so far as they appear to point to any improper conduct",21
96,Mr HUGHES,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The Treasurer would not have made the statement that he did if prior to that time similar statements had not been made to him. He merely repeated what other people had said.,21
97,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,What other people said did not affect me.,21
98,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"If so, those are the statements which have already been referred to the Select Committee on Privilege.",21
99,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,--Thos e statements have not should been formally referred to the Committee of which I have the honour to be a member. We have been' appointed to draw up a system of procedure.,21
100,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"It appears to be perilous to rely upon information! in this matter j but I have been informed that the statements in question were referred to the Select Committee on Privilege. I believe that we carried a resolution to that effect in this House, and, indeed, that it was done on my motion. The only thing that I am doubtful about is whether the same proposal was carried in another place; but in this House we certainly did refer the statements to which allusion has been made to the Select Committee.",21
101,Mr HUME COOK,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,They were referred immeto the Committee by-both Houses.,21
102,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"This is the reference : that this body, the Select Committeebe empowered to inquire into and report upon any recent allegations reflecting upon Parliament or any of the members thereof.",22
103,Sir JOHN QUICK,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,There is no specific charge referred to the Committee.,22
104,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The resolution refers to "" recent, allegations."" The allegations now referred to were quoted in speeches made upon this subject in this House. At tention was specially directed to them. Therefore they were referred to the Committee, for inquiry., asrecent allegations. No limitation was placed upon the Committee, because, as I have said, it was inferred during the debate that some other newspapers had published statements which might also be worthy of being inquired into.",22
105,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I , as one member of Committee, am not going to inquire into all those particulars before a form of procedure has been determined upon.",22
106,Sir JOHN FORREST,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Unles s we can take immediate action there is no use in going back and dealing with past statements.,22
107,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Anothe r point is that an endeavour was made by this House, when it appointed this special Committee, to arrive at a means by which, in future, we should be able to deal promptly with this class of attack, so that in future cases of the kind the immediate action to which the right'honourable member for Swan refers could be taken. These very charges were brought up, and were referred to the Committee, for it to take such steps as were necessary. Now we have had what appeared at first to be another charge, but which now appears not to have been a charge at all. After running through the debate, all that suggests itself as practical in the present instance is, to invite the same Committee to take into consideration what has been termed by some canvassing, and by - others lobbying, which occurs in relation to certain proceedings in this House. I must say, however, that the more one considers those practices, the more difficult it is found to draw a line - o r will be found to draw a line-between legitimate means of making information available for members of Parliament, and the illegitimate pressure sought to be brought to bear upon them by paid agents, who have a direct interest in that kind of work. I was not prepared, within the leibure at my command, to endeavour to draw that line of demarcation. I think that after the Select Committee have dealt with the. matters which they, have in hand, it would be well if they would also take into consideration-par ticularly in connection with Tariffs, when we have opposing parties making representations to members of Parliament which will sooner or later come before the House -7-whethe r information of that kind should not be conveyed to us in some more formal fashion, and whether individual members should not be protected against the intervention of persons who may have an interest in making those representations other than the interests of the persons whose business would be affected by the particular proposals under consideration. It would be veryhard indeed to close the doors of Parliament against those, who are to be affected, the either as importers or manufacturers, by any particular measure before the House. What the House wants, as a House, is knowledge: We have spent a large sum of money, and some of the members of this House have given months and years of their time, to the acquiring of knowledge with regard to certain items dealt with in the Tariff.",22
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"That is not our trouble. We have no quarrel .with the companies,. but with the people who are writing these statements against 'Parliament-with the Bulletin and the Age.",22
109,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Q u it e so; and the Select Committee is specially charged with the responsibility .of suggesting to us a means of dealing with such charges. The Committee is charged directly with the duty of suggesting a means by which such charges may be dealt with, promptly, and inexpensively, and ingloriously, in proper legal fashion.",22
110,Mr JOSEPH,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"COOK - And while that is being dealt with, we are to take no notice of these slanderous statements made .every day. Is that it?",22
111,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I have not said so. I previously pointed out that at present the' only weapon within our power is that of summoning these people to the Bar of the House. But we all know from our experience in the States Parliaments, that by that means, nothing results except advertisement to the offenders. It was because we recognised our present helplessness,, while Parliament, as a body, though possessed of the highest authority, being without the necessary mechanism or the neces-; But sary means of dealing with such questions,! is unable to take effective action, that, cure that helplessness, we appointed Select Committee to take the subject consideration as a whole. That mittee has met, and has been proceeding with its work. It will recommend the wisest course to be adopted to enable direct action to be taken to prevent slanderous statements. Beyond that, it appears to me, we cannot go at present. I saw nothing the debate to which reference has been made, to encourage me to propose any addition to the tasks intrusted to the Committee. But that is a matter for the House. If the House, or if the Committee itself, desire that any other matters shall be referred specifically to the Committee, it is within its competence to sav so.",22
112,Mr MCDOUGALL,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Will ' the Select Committee have power to deal derous statements made against individual members of Parliament, as well as against Parliament as a body ? - Mr DEAKIN - The Select Committee will recommend a means of dealing with statements made against individual memterjections, bers of Parliament as well as against' liament as a whole. But I am being led away from the simple statement that sired, to make"", ancl this is that when came to look through the debate to which reference has been made, I found no charge to which any honourable member hered. I found no clear and precise legation, nothing that had not been withsteps drawn or qualified, or in some way dealt with so that the substance of t'he statement had disappeared, and what was left was - a mere general impression.",23
113,Mr HUGHES,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"In the very nature of things, the Prime Minister could not pect to get anything clear and precise. statements must be made by innuendo, but an innuendo may do more injury to a man's 'reputation than a direct statement.",23
114,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"And it is for such innuendoes that the Committee will recomhad jnend a remedy of a simple, effective, expeditious character. The procedure must allow of our acting in such a way as will make the offender remember it. The premember. sent system leaves an offender in the possession, of a certain amount of notoriety, but with no punishment commensurate to the of it. injury he may have done to the House or to individual members. I shall be gratified at any time to accept and further any protioned yesterday ? posnl for the more effective suppression of those campaigns of slander to which Parliaabout it yesterday. ment is occasionally subjected, by putting to a proper responsibility upon the proper a shoulders, and teaching those concerned to into use the English language with due caution Comwhen referring to public affairs, as the law obliges,them to do when referring to private affairs. There must be a wider range allowed, of course, in connection with public affairs, but even that has its limits.",23
115,Mr MCDOUGALL,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"- The. . honourable in gentleman would not be in favour of putting Parliament above criticism altogether? ,.",23
116,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"No , certainly not; but Select I favour the establishment of some competent ancl impartial tribunal which, having regard to the work Parliament has to do, and the' great importance of its reputation while doing that work-for without that reputation, without that prestige, what authority would Parliament retain with the with slanpeople whom it represents?",23
117,The CHAIRMAN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Order ! I ask the honourable gentleman not to pursue that subject.,23
118,Mr DEAKIN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I was replying to in which were, perhaps, a little Parwide. My consideration of the debate the other evening shows, of course, the necesI desity for guarding our own language more I carefully arid avoiding any reflection, even by implication, upon any persons whose interests we happen to be considering. But aduntil there is a direct charge made, and alsupported by somebody, I fai l to see any 'the House can take at this moment, or, indeed, until the Committee shall have advised us. Then we must take action upon its report, so as to protect ourselves against unwarranted slanders- I cannot say from within, but certainly from withexout-thoug h I hope we shall add some reSuch straints upon slanders from within. Mr Reid, . (East Sydney) [3.21].^-My impression was that when an item wasSpostponed without a date being fixed it could not come on until after the whole .Tariff been dealt with, and I was nof aware and that this matter was coming on today.",23
119,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I am sorry, but I thought I mentioned it to the honourable",23
120,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The honourable gentleman did not mention it , and 1 was not aware",23
121,Mr HUME COOK,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Was it not men,23
122,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,I did not hear a word The Treasurer spoke about another matter. What I asked him was whether I should postpone the question of. which I gave notice until the Prime Minister came back from Adelaide.,23
123,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,It was then that I said that I was not going on with this item until the Prime Minister returned.,24
124,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The honourable gentleman did not fix any"" time.",24
125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I thought that did. - Mr Reid - The honourable member did not, and this has taken me by surprise; but since the item has come on, I quite admit that the stage which the Tariff has reached makes it impossible to hang it up until this matter of slanderous' statements is investigated. I do not for"" a moment depart from the original position that I took up, that we have got beyond"" criticisms in connection with the honour of Parliament of which no notice can be taken. We should be very slow to take notice of any ""criticisms affecting Parliament in any shape or form, unless they reach the point of definite imputations of actual bribery and corruption. that point is reached, however, it is not a question of whether this or that member is pointed af. It is a question of the honour of the whole House. Surely when a direct statement is made that two or three honourable members of one of these Houses have received a sum of £ 2 , 0 0 0 or .£3,000 from a notorious Trust which is interested in some item in the Tariff, a point is reached at which Parliament cannot keep silent? If the two or three particular men hinted at were indicated, that would be, perhaps, a less grave imputation than a general charge which may be fixed by people outside upon any or every member of the. House. Let the press be as free as air in its criticisms of us individually or collectively, but the moment it publishes a direct imputation of the offence of bribery and corruption in the exercise of our distinct duties in connection with a matter of public business, that becomes a question that affects the honour of the House.",24
126,Mr WATSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The press should not publish imputations. It .should publish straight-out charges, if anything.",24
127,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Jus t so, but still there are - some charges which, although vague as to the individual, are so definite in other respects that they do amount upon the honour of Parliament. I have thought over the question of keeping this *not, here was a sinister item open, but I feel that it is impossible Minister in charge of the to do so, and that the Tariff must go on. Personally, I do not believe there is a scintilla of truth in these imputations against any - member of this or the other House.",24
128,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,No r do I .,24
129,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"But , as this matter was really referred to the Select Committee on I Privilege by the House itself, the person who publishes any charge of that sort ought to be brought up before some such authority, not so much for the purpose of punishing the individual-that is a very secondary and insignificant part of it-bu t to afford him an opportunity to repeat or withdraw those statements before the Committee. It might be an equally honourable course for the persons who made the charge to say, "" We very much regret that we were led into making those statements. We believed them at the time we made them, relying upon authority which we believed to be true, but we find that our authority is unreliable."" Who wants to punish a man of that sort who When has been misled ? His error then becomes an error of judgment, in relying too much upon information received.",24
130,Mr WATSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,He should make amends by publishing a withdrawal.,24
131,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Yes ; but the dominant idea in our minds is, I am sure, not one of revenge"" or punishment, but one of preventing a style of journalism which will make of public life anything but a pleasant arena in which men can 'endeavour to discharge their duties to the public. We must try to put down any imputations of that sort. If there is any truth in this particular charge, it is time that we knew it. It is time that any person who accepted a bribe was banished from this House for ever. It appears that the Committee upon Privilege has had this matter referred to it, because I know that we do not stand on punctilio in matters of this sort, and the resolution read out by the Prime Minister seems to point sufficiently to the charges that I have in my mind. When the Treasurer made his unfortunate remark, the recollection of previous imputations spread like wild-fire. The Minister now says that he had no idea of making any charge of that sort.",24
132,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,I said so immedito a reflection atelv afterwards.,24
133,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Whether that was' so or remark made by a Tariff, that seemed to support and, in effect, repeat the slanders to which public attention had been drawn. A more lamentable mistake was never made by any Minister in any Parliament in the world. But I do not want to dwell on that. It is over. In view of the reference that has been made to the Committee, the Committee ought immediately to take some steps to ask the editor and publisher of the newspaper in question. to appear before it and give the information upon which they made the charge, or some explanation of how the charge came to be made, and the grounds .upon which it was made.",24
134,Mr HUGHES,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,All persons who have charges to make should be invited to come before the Committee and make them.,25
135,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,I am dealing only with the case which we have in hand. We can deal with other cases as they arise.,25
136,Mr HUGHES,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Charge s have been made in a number of quarters, and not only in one.",25
137,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Until the Committee goes to work and brings these people up to stand by their charges, or withdraw them and confess their misconduct in making them, this thing will go on from bad to worse.",25
138,Mr HUGHES,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,A member of Parliament seems to be fair game for all the wild charges that can be made by anybody.,25
139,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"As I say, I let them fire away so long as they do not go beyond the line of the most unbridled licence and impute something to members which affects their honesty in the discharge of their public duties. The .Committee might well, on the reference made to it, take immediate steps to bring the persons concerned before it , not with a view to punishment, but to ask those who make these infamous statements, affecting the honour of the House, for their authority. Other proceeding might, of course, follow.",25
140,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Hav e the Committee power to punish ?,25
141,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I am. not talking of punishment. To do so would be to put an aspect upon the proceedings which I altogether repudiate. We can very easily establish punishment for offences, but the first thing to do is to see that the person who makes these charges is brought before the Committee, either to substantiate or withdraw them.",25
142,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The first thing to do is to consider a proper system of procedure by which such people can be dealt with.,25
143,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,I admit that in ordinary circumstances that would be a sensible course to pursue.,25
144,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Of what use would it be to inquire into this matter if we have no power to deal with it after inquiry ?,25
145,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"M i g h t I suggest that if the members of the Committee invited the attention of the editor of the newspaper mentioned to the definite charges referred to, and invited him to come before them to give some information about these charges, and he failed to do so, that would be to a certain extent significant. I admit that it would then be necessary for the Committee to consider what powers they had to bring him. before them. But if .he will come voluntarily, the Committee need not be concerned about its powers to force him to come. If he is not ready voluntarily to come before the Committee, it will then be time to consider what powers should be conferred upon the Committee to enable it to bring him before it . If the editor of this newspaper will come before the Committee without the exercise of any sucft powers, why not let him do so?",25
146,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Suppos e he does come before the Committee, what can the Committee do?",25
147,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Surely the members of the Committee can ask him questions? Surely they can put in his hand the Bulletin paragraph to which reference has been made?,25
148,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,And the paragraphs' which have appeared in the Age.,25
149,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I know nothing about the other statements which are referred to. I speak only of that about which I do know, and the Bulletin paragraph is the most distinct charge of the kind that has come under my notice. Surely the members of the ' Committee could put that paragraph into the hands of the editor of that newspaper and ask him for some information on the subject? Let them, go on considering what powers should be given them, and, if he refuses to give the information for which he is asked, the necessity for giving the Committee amplo powers to deal with such matters will be made the more apparent. But do not let us stand on etiquette as to the way in which a man shall be brought before the Committee. If he is willing to come at once before the Committee, let him do so. To drag this affair on from month to month will not add to the dignity of Parliament at all. Proper means of procedure should no doubt be considered, but the matter before us should be dealt with promptly. <my mind, it would be worse than useless to have the members of the - Committee sitting for months to decide the procedure to be adopted in bringing a man before them in order that ha might be asked questions. I suggest, with great deference, that too much time should not be devoted to the question of procedure, but that some early step should be taken with a view to asking the particular authorities to whom I have referred to appear before the Committee in reference t'o these statements.",25
150,The CHAIRMAN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I should like to point out.that when the honourable member for Dalley moved that the item be postponed, and specially ' desired that some statement should be made by the Prime Minister, I allowed the'Prime Minister, and also the leader of the Opposition, to make statements bearing on the matter referred to. But it will be recognised that both statements went far beyond the item before the Committee.",26
151,Mr WATSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Can we discuss the item just now ? ' The CHAIRMAN - No , the discussion should be upon the motion of the honourable member for Dalley. I point out that even if the debate should continue on the lines so far adopted, the Committee can do nothing in the matter, which is purely one for the House to deal with. The debate is drifting into a discussion, not of the duties to be ""imposed on kerosene cil, but of the procedure to be adopted by a Committee appointed to inquire into certain charges.",26
152,Mr JOSEPH COOS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,It something very intimately connected with the oil duties.,26
153,The CHAIRMAN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Of . course, and on that account honourable members will be quite in order in making casual references to the Committee referred to: permit a discussion of the details of the procedure of the Committee, the way in which it should conduct its business, and the powers with which it should be intrusted, would be to open up a debate which might occupy the whole day, which would' be entirely out of order, and which could have no practical result. In the circumstances-, I ask honourable members to confine their remarks to the motion of the honourable member for Dalley that the item"" - be postponed. To Mr WH IRVINE (Flinders) [3.35]. - I desire, sir, to say only a very few words, and 1 do not wish to transgress your ruling. I understand that the honourable member for Dalley has asked that the consideration of this item should be postponed until some steps can be taken in connection with certain charges which have been made, and on that account some 'reference might, I submit, be permitted to the manner of dealing with the charges.",26
154,The CHAIRMAN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The honourable member will see that, whilst it would be quite in order for an honourable member to make an incidental reference to the matter, to enter upon a discussion of details connected with the Committee referred to and the method of its inquiry, would be totally beyond legitimate debate on the motion before the Committee.",26
155,Mr WH IRVINE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I desire to say with reference to the Prime Minister's statement, that the Committee should go into the question of lobbying, that, however important that question might be, and however much we may all deplore such a practice^",26
156,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"It is trivial compared with the other matter. . Mr WH IRVINE - I think it is entirely foreign to the particular and definite subject with which the Committee referred to have been asked to deal. The Committee have been asked simply to suggest to the House what steps, in their opinion, ought to be taken to protect the honour of the House against charges made against it. It would probably hamper and delay the Committee very much in the performance of that simple and definite task bears upon if , as the' Prime Minister has suggested, they were to attempt to deal with a matter which would probably require very much more lengthy consideration. We are not placing ourselves or our parliamentary methods on t r i a l ; but are endeavouring to But to discover some simple way by which we may protect ourselves and our independent action from such assaults as have recentlybeen made.  that the honourable member for Dalley will not persist with his motion. I cannot see that to do so would serve any good purpose. We have threshed out this matter, and to continue to deal with it is like flogging a dead horse. I feel with the honourable member that something should be done tb protect the honour of members of this House. I regard any reflection made upon the honour of a member of Parliament .as a reflection upon the Parliament to which he belongs. If at any time. I heard a member of this Parliament accused of bribery and corruption, I should deem it my duty, when the House next met, to publicly state that I had heard such charges levied against a certain member, in order that they should be either sheeted home or refuted. The Treasurer has made every amend for his stupid remark, and I do not think that anything can be gained bydeferring the consideration of the item before the Committee. In connection with other honourable members, I desire that we should get rid of the Tariff. I have had quite enough of it . I am sure that if we heard that it would be possible to close up our proceedings tomorrow, every member of the Committee would be pleased. again ask the honourable member for Dalley, in view of the remarks made by the Prime Minister, and in view of the way in which the Treasurer has humbled himself, to withdraw his motion, and let us get on with the business of the Committee. Mr KING O'MALLEY (Darwin) [3.38].'- I ithink that before we go on with the consideration of the item, honourable members should insist upon knowing whether they are to continue under the stigma which has been cast upon them that they have been bribed or are in somebody's pocket.  withclrawn that statement.",26

It is a matter in which I have taken up a certain position, and on which I feel very strongly. I might remind you, sir, that it was I who first brought before the House the Bulletin paragraph out of which this question has arisen today. And in regard to that paragraph, I notice that shaft was not shot until the House, had adjourned for the Christmas holidays, and we had not an opportunity of taking immediate action. Had we been able to do so, I believe that the result would have been more pregnant with good than it has been. The Prime Minister has very justly said that we are the custodians of our honour. Before I entered the House I endeavoured to build up for myself a reputation, and I mean to try to retain it.",28

I am not satisfied with his action so far. I think that a man of his character could have taken very much stronger action than he did, and I sincerely trust that he will now do his best to so arrange matters that if such slanderous statements are repeated their authors shall not be encouraged, but shall be brought to book.",28
184,Mr CROUCH,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Corio) [3.48] - I think that it is necessary to speak, simply because I intend to vote against the oil duties.

The Opposition vote, as a matter of course, against all duties, but I vote, from conviction,, against these particular items. I .believe that every honourable member is so conscious of his own integrity that he does not take the slightest notice of slanderous assertions.

196,Mr CROUCH,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Parliamentar y proceedings have usually made the slanderer notorious and the Parliament ridiculous.,29
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I know if ; but It was that need not be; it is the fault of Parliament when such a thing occurs. There has not been a series of direct charges, and, as the honourable member for West Sydney has pointed out, direct charges are not made in these cases; but there have been innuendoes and what are referred to by the Age as "" disquieting rumours,"" which do much to k ill the reputation of Parliament. When a number of such innuendoes are published, amounting in the aggregate to what is practically a direct charge, Parliament should take steps to clear itself of the imputations on its honour. What are the facts ? In the first instance, the Bulletin published the allegation that £ 2 , 0 0 0 had been spent to bribe members, and next day the Age declared that the reference was to the Free trade Opposition. Following that brutal twist, came, other innuendoes from this newspaper, which supports the Prime Minister so cordially. Parliament should be protected from such, statements. If other newspapers have erred, let them be brought to book, too. There has been a series of implied charges, culminating in the foolish statement made by the Treasurer the other night. As the Prime Minister has, to use a , vulgarism, practically-thrown up the sponge, at least, the Joint Committee should""investigate the charges, and report to Parliament concerning them. The Committee's powers may be limited, but it can ask those who have slandered us to come before it , and, if they do not do so, the public will draw its own inferences. The helpless attitude of the Prime Minister amounts to an invitation to newspaper proprietors to continue their slanders, and I object to that. The sooner these statements are sifted, the better it will be for the honour and dignity of Parliament. Almost every Age leader dealing with the Standard Oil Trust contains some insinuation, and the public will not be long in coming to the conclusion that the practices of the Trust in regard to this Parliament have been similar to those alleged in connection with other Parliaments. We should nip this slander in the bud, acting, not hysterically, but sanely, wisely, and firmly, so that our traducers will see that we are not to be treated in this way.",29

We all recognise the need for more effective procedure, and I am not disposed to make the Committee the laughing-stock of Australia by allowing it to act before such procedure has been devised. Sir. WILKS (Dalley) [4.4]--The honourable member for Maranoa has said that it is useless to flog a dead horse. not intend to do that, nor shall I chew the cud of malice in this connection. The Parliamentary Committee on privilege and procedure should before this have devised a. system of procedure for dealing with the charges published in the Bulletin and other newspapers. I moved the postponement, of the further consideration of this request because I thought that it should not be dealt with until the charges had been disposed of, especially in view of what occurred last week. The Prime Minister had not then made his statement; but even now that he.has made it, I should proceed with my motion if I thought that it would be carried, because I do not think that we should vote in regard to the item until the charges have been dealt with. The honourable member for Corio has stated that if he votes as he intends to vote he will make himself liable to the slur that he is one of those who are "" in the bag,"" or who .have been improperly influenced by a trust.",30
218,Mr JOHNSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The object of the slur was to induce protectionists to vote with the Government.,31
219,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"No doubt, but that is a matter which each honourable member must consider for himself. I give the remark no'personal application. I agree with the leader of the Opposition that we must not be too squeamish in the matter of criticism. Hostile criticism certainly tends to strengthen the average public mar,. My complaint, however, relates, not to hostile criticism, but to a definite charge of corruption associated with the name of a company which in the United States of America has the reputation of resorting corrupt practices. The reputation company causes the public to attach some importance . to such a charge. I am observant man, having acquaintances in all letin as fools walks of life, and I have no hesitation in saying that the average man attaches weight to any statement appearing in the Sydney Bulletin, the Age, or any newspaper of like importance. When mud is thrown, some of if always sticks. As to the honour of this Parliament, without desiring to be patronising, I say unhesitatingly that if I were to retire from political life tomorrow, one of the happiest memories that I should carry with me would be the recollection that the Commonwealth Parliament had ' passed unsullied through two Tariff struggles. I do I have no reason to believe that either in connection with the first Federal Tariff or that now under consideration, there has been any element of corruption associated with this Parliament. But, knowing as I do that the public are disposed to attach much importance to such a charge as that made by the Treasurer, I think that the Prime Minister would' have done well had he invited the Committee to agree to the postponement of this request until the remaining requests had been dealt with, so that an investigation might be made by the Privilege Procedure Committee. Either too little or too much has been said in connection with this matter. Had the Bulletin definitely stated to whom a certain sum of money had lieen paid, as alleged by it , to secure a certain vote, we should have been able t'o take action. On the other hand, if it has published too much, relying merely upon rumour, the sooner it withdraws its statement the better. Public men show their courage by withdrawing statements which they have ascertained to be incorrect, and leading newspapers should be prepared to withdraw a statement as soon as they find that it was ill-advised. I am satisfied that neither the Bulletin nor the Age would publish mere rumours. A keen-witted man like the editor of the Bulletin would not publish such a statement as that of which complaint is made, unless he believed that he had something behind him to support' it. And so with the editor of the Age. It is because I hold that view that I think that this charge should be investigated. Mr DUGALD THOMPSON.:-The honourable member dees not mean to suggest that to those newspapers had some legitimate auof the thority for their statements ?",31
220,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,I am not going to write an down the editors of the Age and the Bul,31

230,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Macquarie) [4.13] - There has been a good deal of misunderstanding in regard to this proposal. I appeal to the Committee, as a protectionist body, to agree to the request made by another place, and to reject the modification' proposed by the Treasurer, although I may say that if we cannot secure the protection advocated by the Senate we shall regard as preferable to no protection at all the provision that oils of a lower flash point than 97 degrees Fahrenheit close test must be denaturated to secure free admission.",32
231,Mr KELLY,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Then it is a question not of safety, but of protection?",32
232,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Fro m a commercial point of view it is absolutely one of protection; but from a humanitarian stand-point it is very necessary that oils below a safe flash point test shall be denaturated, so that they may not with risk to human life be put to a use for which they are not intended. If the shale deposits of New South Wales are to be successfully mined, we must take care that the industry is protected so far as it is capable of supplying the demand for oils for motive-pov/er purposes. It is laid down that oils of a flash point test of 97 degrees Fah. and less are useful for motive-power purposes, and, as a matter of fact, they are in general use. Such oils are produced in New South Wales, and oils of a flash point test of more than 97 degrees are also imported and used for oil engines. That being so, in urging that the Senate's request should be agreed to, we are not even seeking for -.a. monopoly for the local industry in respect of these oils.",32
233,Sir JOHN FORREST,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Oil s of a flash point test of less than 97 degrees are also used in oil engines,32
234,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Oil s of a considerably lower flash point test are so used. There is a difference of opinion, even amongst vendors of oils, as to what is the necessary test for an effective engine oil. Many experts, however, declare that the higher the test the more economical is the oil for engine use, the explosive force being correspondingly greater.",32
235,Mr LIDDELL,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Then why denaturate the oil when the better class of oils can be used for this purpose?,32
236,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The better class of engine oil has a flash point test of 97 degrees, but is not designed for use as an illuminant. I wish to make it clear that the Senate's request will not place an embargo upon the importation of any - oil save that of the Standard Oil Company.",32
237,Mr JOHNSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"This will play into their hands, because, if we make the test too high, we shall give the Standard Oil Company a monopoly.",32
238,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The point is that oil of . the higher tests cannot be sold at the price at which the lower-class oils are vended. That being so, the Standard Oil Company is not likely to supply its high-test oil - for engine purposes. The British Imperial Oil Company, in addition to the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, is already supplying oil of 100 degrees Fah. close test for engine purposes. Messrs. Alexander Cowan and Sons, agents for the Otto and Crossley engines, which are known all over Australia-and which I have repeatedly used-unhesi tatingly recommend the oil supplied by the British Imperial Oil Company for use in those engines. The flash point of that oil is over 97 degrees, so that we are not asking for an exclusive market for the Commonwealth Oil Corporation. Messrs. Alexander Cowan and Sons writeDear. Sirs,-We have to express our complete satisfaction in running our oil engines with your ""Silverlight"" kerosene. We find it cleanly, easy of vaporisation, and it leaves in the engine a minimum amount of residual matter. We have no hesitation in recommending the oil to engine users, ancl we are sure that it will give them every satisfaction. Then, again, Messrs.

240,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"But honourable 'members have not read them. I wish to emphasize the point that the proposal to prescribe - a flash point test of 97 degrees does not mean the complete exclusion .of imported engine oils. It will simply exclude the cheap oil which is dumped here, and which is of no great value even for engine purposes.",33
241,Mr SAMPSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Would not the fixing of the 97 degrees close test give the British Imperial Company a.monopoly in respect of engine oil?,33
242,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"It would not, because the Commonwealth Oil Corporation is prepared, to supply all that we require.",33
243,Mr SAMPSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The honourable member would shut out all imports of engine oil except those of the British Imperial Oil Company ?,33
244,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I merely wish to exclude oil that is now being dumped here - By raising the standard we shall secure to the local industry a measure of protection which all protectionists should be prepared to give. I am pointing out, for the information of free-traders, who, on principle, are opposed to protection, that the test proposed by the Senate will not prohibit the importation of all oils. If it be agreed to, there will still be 2 market in Australia' for the British Imperial Company's oil over the, 97 degrees test. The testim&nial given to that Company by Messrs. Hornsby and Sons is on similar lines to that given by Messrs. Alexander Cowan and Sons. I quote them because they haye been given by"" firms representing practically the only class of small oil engines in use in Australia. Free-traders should have no hesitation in granting this measure of protection, more especially as in doing so they will incidentally guarantee a measure of safety to the users of oil. As bearing on the risk attaching to the use of lower grade oils, I wish to read the following letter from Mr W. M.' Hamlet, F . I . C . , F.C.S., Government Analyst for New South WalesIn reply to your's of the ist inst., and irt confirmation of my opinion sent to you by telegraph through' the secretary, I beg to say that I approve of 97 degrees Fahrenheit as a flash point for kerosene. Some time ago, when this matter was under consideration at a Confer-ence, of which I was Chairman, a flash point of 100 degrees Fahrenheit was suggested. This was opposed by the American importers, who wished to put it at 73 degrees H . Fahrenheit. After considerable discussion we came to a compromise, and 85 degrees was recommended. Since then, legislation has been in favour of the higher test, and I do not think any hardship would be entailed by adopting 97 degrees Fahrenheit as the standard flash point throughout Australia. It certainly ought to be uniform or else oil that was refused admission in one State could be introduced in a State where the limit was lower. Kerosene or mineral oils can be manufactured that will test up to 100 degrees and over, and a high test will have the beneficial effect of shutting out inferior low-test oils that may be potentially dangerous. The Standard Oil C ° P y of m a n America, I believe, are the people who are fighting hard for the low 73 degrees test, and from what I know of the trade, they could readily turn out a higher test oil if demanded. Kerosene is tested by the Abel close test which is, strictly speaking, not recognised by this Act, which places the test at 110 degrees by the open test, equal to about 88 degrees Fahrenheit close test. That communication, I contend, discloses very fair reason why this Committee should support fixing the flash point at 97 degrees Fahrenheit. I desire to see the request of the Senate adopted without any modification. If the provision relating to denaturation which has been proposed by the Treasurer be inserted in that request, the industry chiefly concerned will receive no protection whatever, because it will be possible for large producers, such as the Standard Oil Trust, to denaturate their oils in bulk, and, indeed, they have already signified their willingness to do so.",33
245,Mr LIDDELL,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,To whom ?,33
246,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I gained my information in the parliamentary lobbies. I appeal to the protectionist members of this Committee to grant what I am asking. The Com-. monwealth Oil Corporation is able to supply all the oil required for motivepower purposes ' in Australia, and if it tempted to abuse its privilege in any way, this Parliament possesses the power to step in and prevent it doing so. Is the Treasurer prepared to accept the request of the - Senate Avithout modification?",33
247,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,I submitted proposal with a view to protecting the public.,34
248,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I do not decry any attempt to protect the public; but I claim that that object can be achieved without interfering with the commercial protection which is sought by those engaged in this industry. It would be an easy matter to impose an Excise upon oils possessing a lower flash point than 97 degrees Fahrenheit if they were not denaturated. .The Treasurer's proposal, if adopted, will have the effect of protecting the public, but without in any way protecting the oil industry.",34
249,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The member is at liberty to move an amendment to omit from my proposal the provision relating to the denaturation of inferior oils.,34
250,The CHAIRMAN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"If the Treasurer's proposal be defeated, the item will then stand in the form requested by the Senate.",34
251,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Then I ask the Committee to vote against the modification of the Senate's request proposed by the Treasurer. I wish to test the feeling of the Committee upon this question!. Oil possessing a lower flash point than 97 degrees Fahrenheit' is not kerosene within the strict meaning of the term. No such oil can well be used for illuminating purposes, but a very considerable quantity of it is used for motivepower purposes. I hold in my hand a memorandum from the Commonwealth Oil Corporation in reference to this matter, from"" which I extract the followingStatements have also been made that we cannot supply engine o i l . I desire to contradict such,' and haye pleasure in stating that, as we understand there are only about 400,000 gallons of oil imported from America for this purpose, and sold under the brands of "" Royal Daylight"" and "" Petrolite,"" we are in a posi-' tion to supply all Australia's needs of engine o i l , and at current market prices. We cannot, however, be expected to supply oils which may be sold at "" dumped "" - prices. That is the position of this company. I maintain that the principle of protection is at stake upon this question. I am sorry that the Government of New South Wales have not seen fit to open up the shale deposits in that State, but, seeing that a company has been formed for the purpose of developing them, I claim that we ought to extend to it some encouragement to supply all our needs in the matter of mineral oils, as well as of crude and residual oils. I therefore ask the Committee to vote my against the Treasurer's proposal, with a view to accepting' the request of the Senate, and thus assisting Australia to becomea little more self-contained ini' this respect than she is at present.",34

253,Mr CARR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"How can the honourable member make that statement, seeing that the industry requires to be protected against dumping ? honourable Mr HARPER - I am merely stating my own opinion. I may also add that I have not been approached by any representative of the Standard Oil Company. The only company which has approached me has been the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, and I am bound to say that it did so in a perfectly proper manner. .Its representatives stated their case, I listened to what they had to say, and I have given their representations every consideration. The honourable member for Macquarie has said that that Corporation is prepared to produce oils of a certain quality, and in sufficient quantity to supply the entire needs.of the Commonwealth. I am not in a position to say whether or not his statement is accurate. But, upon a former occasion, this Committee deliberately decided that kerosene should be admitted free, and I see no reason why we 'should depart from that decision. I do not see my way to support the request of the Senate.

To my mind, the merits of the proposal should be considered. Mr W. H. IRVINE - The member for Mernda merely said that this request of the Senate is not a Government proposal.",34
255,Mr WEBSTER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"But the honourable member will, admit that representatives in another place are at least endowed with a little intelligence. In my opinion, they have endeavoured to improve upon the work of this Committee by protecting the public from imposition by dishonest traders. We know that in country districts it has not been an uncommon thing to find storekeepers selling oil possessing a lower flash point than 70 degrees Fah. for illuminating purposes. The result of using this oil for lighting purposes has been very unsatisfactory. It is our duty to protect the public from imposition of that kind. In agreeing to the request of the Senate, the Treasurer is acting in the public interest. I voted for the free admission of kerosene, but I now intend to go one better by insisting that the article which is sold as kerosene shall be of a quality that will guarantee satisfaction to the users of it. We all know that the use of inferior oils has been responsible for serious damage in some of the homes of this country. The want of Government control in the past in connection with kerosene has resulted in many serious accidents.  1 the honourable member speak of within his own knowledge?",35

Surely it is not suggested that the Government should refuse to accept an amendment, because they did not happen, at a prior stage, to have realized the advantage of such an amendment. It is a patent fact that there is much danger and considerable damage arising from the use of inferior o i l , though the fault is not always laid on the oil, but is attributed to the use of a cheap lamp.

I venture to say that 99 per cent, of his constituents use kerosene as an illuminant; and there can be no doubt that the Government are supporting this proposal as a cloak to the imposition of a duty of 6d. per gallon. The Treasurer desires that this requested amendment shall be .made in order to give greater security to life and property; but it will be observed that his able supporter, the Government Whip, was able to point to only one fatal accident within his knowledge throughout the Commonwealth. Every day in the newspapers we see accidents caused by the use of pea rifles; but would the Government propose to forbid the use of such rifles on that account? I have known people die in their beds, but I do not suppose that the Government would propose to put a tax on these domestic articles. As a matter of fact, it is not the inferior kerosene that bursts the lamps, but the defective character of the lamps themselves.

For the motion which I have dicated, I claim the vote of the honourable member for Gwydir, on the speech just made.

It cannot be in the interests of the people that low-test kerosene should be imported.",37
271,Mr WILSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,It is in the interests of those who use oil engines.,37
272,Mr COON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"It is not so, because nearly all the oil engines in Australia are working with high-test kerosene. ",37
273,Mr COON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The largest oil engine working in Australia today is at Broken Hill . It is a 66 horse-power engine, and is worked with high-test kerosene. As a' matter of fact the Standard Oil Company does not desire to import: low-test kerosene for oil engines at all. All around Sydney and Melbourne this stuff can be seen marked up "" Best American keroseneRoyal Daylight "" ; and it' is going into the homes of the poorer people. Why should we allow the Standard Oil Company to import kerosene of low-grade quality whilst everv other country in the world insists upon a high test? In Sweden and Denmark the flash point is 104-; in Ohio, whence a large quantity of this oil comes, the flash test is 98 ; in Canada it is 96.95 ; in Columbia 120; in New Mexico 105. Before Federation the flash point was 83 degrees .in Queensland. As a matter of fact there was no need for the Treasurer to bring this' matter before the Committee at all. He could have dealt with it by regulation. It has been said that no accidents have occurred through the use of low-test kerosene; but there have been two cases this year. In one of them a lamp exploded, and a woman was burnt to death. Each of the cases occurred in Ballarat; and, strange to say, it is only within the last four months that low-test kerosene has been introduced to Ballarat. effect of rejecting the Treasurer's proposal will be that the poorer people who cannot afford to buy their oil by the tin, but purchase it by bottle, sixpennyworth at the time, will have to put up with inferior oil. I remind honourable members that there is an Australian company carrying on business in New South Wales that is capable of supplying all the requirements of the. Commonwealth in regard to oil for oil engines. Yet we find protectionists who are not prepared to protect' that industry. I venture to say that' if it were a Victorian industry there would be no doubt about its protection. The Victorian members would see to that. But the representatives of New South Wales seem to be afraid to demand protection for an industry in their State which will afford employment to thousands of men. I hope that the Committee will not be led away, with the cry that a low test is in the interest's of people who use oil engines, because as a matter of fact it does not pay them to use low-test kerosene.

275,Sir JOHN QUICK,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Bendigo) [5.4]-As a member of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission I was a party to a recommendation that kerosene in tins of 10 gallons should be liable to a duty at 3d. per gallon. That was a straight-out protectionist duty, and I am prepared to' vote for it at the present time. But the Committee in its wisdom, refused to entertain that proposition, which was made for the purpose of encouraging the tinning and packing in Australia. The House decided - practically that kerosene should be absolutely free, without any'condition attached to it , and the item left this Chamber in that shape. The Senate, on some process of reasoning, decided to ask the House to introduce"" a flash test. I do not know whether that is intended to operate as a protective duty or condition, or whether it is intended for the protection of the public. As the proposition has been sent down to us, it appears that kerosene above 97 degrees flash test is to be free. That leaves kerosene below that test liable to a duty of 6d. a gallon.",37
276,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,It does not.,37

The effect of the Senate's proposition renders liable to a duty of 6d. per gallon all the low-grade kerosene used for industrial purposes in oil engines, and so on. I have received the strongest protests from various the country against that proposition. 1 fail to see how it"" would have protective incidence or benefit of any kind whatever. I am, therefore, not cient prepared to accept it. I am preing is pared to revert to the original prowho position of the Tariff Commission, and place a duty of 3d. per gallon on tinned kerosene, with a view of promoting the local tinning and packing, because I beEverything lieve that would result in giving a consiThe derable amount of local employment. Howexpensive. ever, that proposition is now past and gone, will be expensive. and we are faced with a proposal from Senate for which I do not think the vernment are responsible, and which have to be subjected. emanated from a private member. Every honourable member, therefore, has a free hand, and ought to exercise his deliberate judgment in the matter. I should be pieand pared to support any duty that would a protective effect or result, but the Senate's proposal will mean a burden of 6d. per gallon on industrial oil, and will do no good whatever to the development of tralian industry. That being so, the Treaheld surer now proposes to amend the Senate's proposal by providing that low-grade sene, below 9.7 degrees test, shall be free long as it is.denaturated. That means that the whole ' of the low-grade kerosene, whether introduced in bulk or in tins, before it is admitted into the Commonkerosene, wealth or placed upon the market and made accessible to the-public, have to be untinned or unbulked, and placed in separate recepParliaments tacles for the purpose of being denaturated. That, I believe, would mean a considerable amount of trouble and expense, involving, in all probability, a burden equivalent duty upon industrial oils. I fail to see, therefore, in the circumstances, what is, be gained by it. The Treasurer's proposal imposes the obligation of denaturating low-grade oil before it can be admitted, and, therefore, it will, have no protective incidence or benefit whatever upon the tralian shale oil industry.",37
280,Mr WEBSTER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Will if afford any prodeal tection to the consumer? Sir JOHN QUlCK - I understand now that it is proposed merely as a method protecting the public.

Everything seems to be left to chance. is to be settled by regulation. denaturating'process may be cheap or I am inclined to think that it By that I mean not the so much the ingredient as the treatment Goana* manipulation to which the oil will Therefore, ,as the proposition now put forward by the Treasurer will have no protective effect, but will certainly be burdensome to industry, is one of those matters which should have be dealt with by a separate Bill. I cannot support it. It is doubtful whe. ther_ we can introduce into a Customs Tariff Bill anything but the imposition of AusCustoms duties. It might afterwards be that this provision is not a Tariff provision, and that it comes rather within keroour general power of dealing with trade so and commerce.' If this Parliament desires to restrict or regulate the importationof kerosene, to impose a flash test, or to inwill, sist upon the denaturating of low-grade the matter ought to be specially dealt with by a separate Bill. Otherwise, the question should be left to the States to deal with as one of domestic legislation. The Stales Parliaments can deal with it more effectively than we can, because, although the Federal Parliament; to a may pass a law providing for the act of denaturating at the ports of entry, the Fedto eral control ceases immediately the article goes into consumption, and it is doubtful the whether this Parliament could pass a law pursuing the oil after it leaves the Customs House. It is quite possible that some Ausprocess of destroying the denaturating ingredient might be resorted to afterwards. I am doubtful whether this Parliament can effectively with this important subject in the manner suggested by the Treasurer. In those circumstances I feel disposed to of vote straight against both the Senate's rea quest and the modification proposed by the The - Mr WYNNE (Balaclava) [ . i ] . _ I5 S have inquired into this matter, and"" it seems to me that the reduction of the flash test from 102 degrees to 97 degree's will not effect any good purpose. In India, which has a hotter climate than any part of Australia, the flash test has been fixed at 76 degrees, and I am advised, after inquiry from some of the'highest, authorities here, that a flash test, of 76 degrees is perfectly safe for lighting purposes, provided that the right kind of lamps are used, and that kerosene tested up to 102 degrees or 97 degrees test is no better for lighting purposes than that tested up to 76 degrees. In England, I think, the flash test is 73 degrees,, ancl no country has thought fit to fix as high a standard as is proposed by the Treasurer.",38
283,Mr COON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Oh , yes.",39
284,Mr WYNNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Where ? None of the Russian oil comes up to 100 degrees flaish test, and therefore the effect of the Treasurer's original proposal would really have been to grant a monopoly to the Standard Oil Company. Theirs was the only oil that would have come in free. Every other oil would have been charged the duty, and it would therefore have meant larger profits to that company at the expense of the community, and the shutting out of other oils. The Treasurer then proposed that oil below the flash test suggested should be denaturated. I am advised that kerosene oil cannot be denaturated, except in such a way as to destroy all its lighting power and render it absolutely useless for oil engines or any other purpose. There is, therefore, nothing to be gained by attempting to make any such provision. The proper course for the Committeeto take is to disagree with the Senate's request, and leave the oil free for the benefit of the consumer. If the Treasurer wants to impose a tax simply for revenue purposes, let him say so straight out. It has been suggested that it will be in the interests of the Commonwealth Oil Corporation. That company was started when oil was free. They relied upon their shale oil,and knew that there was no duty on imported kerosene. There is a large number of companies in Scotland that make oil from shale. At the present time, although they are closer to the American market than Ave are, and both American and Russian oils can be sold cheaper there than in Australia, some of those companies are making something like 40 per cent, profit. Tf they can do that Will a lower percentage of oil from their shale than we have in Australia. I think the Commonwealth Oil Corporation should be able to pay their Avay Avell ""on their shale oil, Avithout any duty being imposed upon imported oil. Is the Committee going to penalize the people in the country ? The proposal affects the poor people, because this oil is used for lighting purposes by the poorer classes in the community. The people that live in tOAvns have electric light and gas. They are not dependent upon kerosene in the same way as are the miners and farmers and others Avho live away from the large centres. In the back country of every State the people have no other light than kerosene, and to impose a tax of 66. per gallon will be to tax those people at a A'ery high rate for an article that they cannot do Avithout.

There is no change at all. Mr Langdon explained that the difference arose through the interpretation given to ""superficial foot."" ' Sir William Lyne - How do you know what the interpretation is? The by - laws are not out yet. I was telegraphing to Melbourne about them today. Mr Langdon - The reason I know is that we have had to pay the extra duty. Sir William Lyne (further consulting the list) said his intention was that the duty should Tellers: be the same as it was before. If they had not paid the increased duty before the Tariff was brought down they would not have to pay PAIRS. it now. There was no doubt as to what his intention was. Mr Langdon, with a relieved air, said that if this was the case there was no necessity to argue the matter further. He again drew attention to the anomaly by which they were compelled to pay as high a rate of duty for three-eighths of an inch as for the . full inch. Sir William Lyne asked whether there had been trouble through the importation of timber just a shade under the inch, in order that advantage might be taken of the reductionof duty. Mr MCSweeney - Absolutel y no, Sir William. Sir William Lyne rejoined that it looked to him as if there had been' some trouble on this account, but he. would make inquiries on the subject next day. He led the deputation to understand clearly that it was not intended to charge, under departmental misinterpretation higher duties on the smaller sizes of timber. When had reminded of the occurrence on a former occasion, he objected that the report was not correct.",40

I regret, however, that the Treasurer did not stand by the proposal of the House of Representatives. We should have' some explanation from him as to why the Government supported an alteration of the item in Had it not been Tor an as to arrangement made between the Treasurer and some of the members of the Committee, much of the timber coming under this item would have been made free. One or two of exthose who supported that compromise say, as the Minister has broken it, they do not feel bound to support it any longer, and under the ruling of the Chairman, if is possible to have a vote on the question whether certain timber shall be made free. I think that it would be fairer if we adliered into the compromise which was arrived at here when the item was last under coneven sideration, and that was to levy an all round duty of 6d. per 100 superficial feet. I regret very much that the Minister should now want to place a duty of 6d. on oregon, and a duty of is. on all other timbers. His proposal will suit my coninch stituency because it is mainly interested in the use of Oregon. But I "" do not. think that it is fair for the Minister to differI shall, certainly the support his proposal so far as it relates to oregon, but immediately after it is carried, as I believe it will be, I shall support the imposition of a duty of 6d. per superficial feet on all other timbers. I believe that it would save time if the Minister, instead of proposing this modification with regard to the duty on Oregon, would frankly propose a duty of 6d. on all Not the only would it tend to save time, but I think that it would be the more honourable course for the Minister to pursue, in view to of the compromise which was arranged here, and in which I was not concerned. to I voted then to make oregon free, and, call therefore, I am not affected in any way. But at least the Treasurer should explain why, behind the backs of those with whom he entered into the compromise, his colleagues in another place departed from it. course, I should like' oregon to be made because there is no doubt that the Mr. secretary of the Mine Managers' Association of Broken Hill , has, in reply to an inquiry from me, forwarded this telegramUnder existing Tariff as passed by Representatives additional burden on the Barrier mines equals ^'22,000 annually. What he means is that the additional duties on mining requisites generally have increased the cost of producing ore at . Broken Hill by £ 2 2 , 0 0 0 a year.",41
297,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,How much of that increase is attributable to the duty on ber?,42
298,Mr THOMAS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"A duty of 6d. per 100 superficial feet represents an annual tax of to be reconsidered. £ 5 , 0 0 0 . That was the rate under the Tariff, and it was continued in this Tariff, so that as far as timber is concerned this House has imposed no fresh burden upon the consumer. The Senate's if made means practically an additional burden of £ 5 , 0 0 0 to the mines at Hill . I have the idea that the miner as - much right to be considered as have colonial timber they do so. other people. I do not ask that he shall receive any special consideration.",42

I do not follow the dividend list, as I am not interested in a single mine, but I understand that lately there has not been a dividend declared in respect of any mine.

At Broken Hill there is a system of contract work underground. .1 presume that the honofable member knows something about mining, and therefore he will understand that if the men have their work set to them on contract there is a big possibility of their wages ^ being reduced. As regards the .surface men, an understanding was fixed up at a timtime - when things were booming at the Hill , but its term will soon expire, and the whole question unfortunately will have I do not want to old give a vote, nor should I like this House to give a vote which would make the work of fixing up the wages any. more difficult than it is likely to be.

He has furnished the details con* cerning the ordering and delivering of four time in lots of timber. On the 17th August, 1906, the company ordered 152,200 superficial feet; in January, 1907-that is five months after the order was given-148,77 9 feet delivered, and the quantity short delivered was 3,421 superficial feet.

On the 6th August, 1907, an order was given for 210,700 superficial feet, but it is not yet fulfilled. I trust that the Committee will adhere to its previous decision, and if it does that will of the lot. satisfy me for the time.",42
310,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Dalley) [6.0] - The honourable member for Barrier has set a very good example. He has pointed out that a previous occasion we had a long debate Oil this item, and there is not much dence that further discussion is likely influence a vote. He has expressed his surprise that the Minister is not resisting emphasize the request, and adhering to the deciregards thewhat sion of the Committee. On a previous occasion I fought to get timber admitted free, but I do not wish to tell you, sir, reason why the proposal for. a duty of pe.r 100 superficial feet was carried. That occurred through a.misunderstanding. Even now, if I thought that there was a possibility of getting timber placed the free list, I should submit to you a modification of the Treasurer's proposal. So far there has been no evidence given, either to-night or last week, that there an inclination to go in that direction. parently the Treasurer desires to pick oregon for a duty of 6d., and to levy duty of is. on baltic and kauri pine. That is manifestly unfair to various trades which use those two classes of timber. It will i>e a very severe impost indeed to them. Oregon is largely used by ship-builders fining and ceiling boats, and kauri is fiest class of wood that can be used deck planking. The mere imposition duty on kauri will not force other timbers into use for that purpose. It will simply lje an increased burden to the user. I Treasurer wants to encourage an industry such as ship-building, he is proceeding the wrong way to achieve that object, cause kauri will continue to be used for deck planking. It is just the same with baltic pine, which, as honourable members know, is used for making ships' spars and in other ways. I admit that balt'c pine in the rough is admitted free. A duty on baltic pine is a serious matter to engineeron ing establishments, in which it is used pattern-making"". Under this Tariff of engineering trades have been treated very badly, arid surely it is not necessary to subject them to a further impost! If honOn orable members compel heavy charges to be paid for kauri and baltic pine they will strike, indirectly, a severe blow at the engineering fraternity, who, I repeat, have beenbadly treated under the Tariff.",43
311,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,What nonsense !,43
312,Mr KELLY,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,They are the worse treated,43
313,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Exactly . For patternmaking they need a timber which is free on from knots, so that if a duty is imposed on baltic pine it will be an additional tax eviupon them. As regards the large timber to \ards, the honourable member for Lang has put the position fairly, and as they all happen to be in my electorate I wish to he has so well said. As measurement of timber I cannot understand the action of the Treasurer in reverting to his original proposal. It the was rejected here by honourable members, 6d. and now the Senate has requested its restoration. Its absolute want of equity has been pointed out by the honourable member for North Sydney and others. The Treaon surer has not yet intimated how he intends to treat the request, but I hope that he will adhere to the decision of this Committee, and will not advocate the fanciful method is which the Senate has recommended. The Apmethod which we adopted is far more out favourable to those who have to build a small houses. If , however, the Senate's suggestion is adopted the timber merchants will pass on the duty all right, and the effect will be to hamper building operations in the various States. In New South in Wales it will probably mean to ani artisan the a question of building or - not buildfor ing a house with his small savings. of a I do not know whether it is the case in Victoria, but certainly in New South Wales the main desire of an artisan f the is to be thrifty so that he may acquire a home. In the majority of cases a in workman's home is mainly composed of betimber. I cannot conceive that any argu, ment can be adduced in support of the Senate's method, except that it is in favour of the saw-millers. But the woods which artisans use do not pass through the ""hands of the saw-millers. I have heard the representatives of Queensland put in a claim behalf of its timber. That is a line of for action which I have taken up, and.therethe fore I do not blame them for doing the same thing. They say, "" We want to force an Australian industry."" For instance, take the honourable member for Maranoa. On the last item he was a free-trader, but on this request he will vote as a sturdy protectionist. I have my changes, but I do not ring them in too rapidly. Queensland timber cannot replace imported timbers used in the ship-building yards in my electorate, nor can it replace those used for house building there. The forests of New South Wales are rapidly becoming denuded of good timber, and I am one of those who believe that it would be wise to refrain, as long as possible, from encroaching upon our forest reserves.",43
314,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,I should stop the exportation of sleepers.,44
315,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"So should I . Our hardwood, for certain purposes, has no equal, and I think that we shall suffer by encourcompromise aging its export.",44
316,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The supply hardwood in Australia will not-be exhausted during our lifetime.,44
317,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"But in exploiting our forests for the benefit of the rest of the world, we are parting with a valuable asset. In the scrub country of New South Wales, close to the Queensland border, there is an abundance of valuable timber, but it is difficult to get it to the seaboard.",44
318,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,A lot of it is being used in New South Wales.,44
319,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"That is so. I have travelled through what is known as the Scrub country, and-have no hesitation in saying that there is no better timber that which is growing there. A lot of however, is almost inaccessible, and enormous expenditure will be necessary to adopted, open it out. The timber reserves in some object which it had in view. parts of New South Wales have been spoliated. The scarcity of timber all over the world is becoming serious, and if Ausdesire, tralia preserves her supplies she will secure for future generations a marvellous asset. Our importations of baltic, kauri, and oregon are not competing with Australian timbers; they are used for special purposes. I should like all timbers to be free, and would vote for a modification to that effect. Failing that, I do not think that the timber duties, as passed by this House, should increased. I fai l to see why the Treasurer should select oregon for special treatment at the expense of kauri and baltic timber. Either make all those timbers free, or make them dutiable at the same rate. The Treathey surer's attitude suggests that he has been calculating the varying interests' in this Chamber, and rinds that the number of honourable members in favour of making oregon free is greater than is the number desiring a low duty in respect of timber generally. If oregon is to be dutiable, I shall vote for the retention of the duty of 6d. per 100 super, feet, as originally passed by this House, and shall endeavour to have a similar duty imposed in respect of other items now dutiable at higher rates. But if any honourable member moves a modification providing that these items shall.be free, I shall vote for it . Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - Why should like to not the Minister stand by the old compromise ?",44
320,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Quite so. But for that he would not have carried the duty of 6d. per 100 super, feet on Oregon. of Mr DUGALD THOMSON - He arranged that compromise with the honourable member for Kooyong.",44
321,Mr WILKS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Who was fighting all the evening for the free admission of oregon. To use an expressive phrase, the honourable member for Kooyong, on that occasion, dropped all of us "" in the soup "" by making the compromise in question. I hope that the Treasurer wil l at least determine to stand by the original compromise agreed to by him, and revert to the measurement proposals passed by this House before the Big Tariff was sent to another place.",44
322,Mr MATHEWS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Melbourne Ports) than [6.12] - I feel that whilst the inteni t , tion of another place in making this an request was good, its proposal, if would not carry out the The Senate undoubtedly desired to encourage the use of Australian timbers. I have a similar and, as a protectionist, should have supported a request to make a corresponding increase in all the other timber duties. I recognise that when this item was before the Committee ©n a previous occasion, a compromise was arranged, and in dealing with this question I must take into ""consideration the effect which the duty on oregon may have upon workers engaged in be our saw-mills. Some consideration must also be extended to the timber merchants who have invested large sums of money in the timber trade, and who must ceriainlv obtain some return on their investment if are to pay their workmen the wages that I desire them to receive. The point that I wish to make is that if we agree to the request to increase from 6d. to is. per ioo superficial feet the duty on undressed timber, in sizes of 12 inches x 6 inches, and do not make a corresponding increase in the duties on smaller sizes, we shall encourage the introduction of small cuts, and consequently lessen employment in the saw-mills. We shall not stop the importation of the smaller sizes dealt with more particularly in paragraph D by increasing the duty in respect of paragraph A. I have therefore come to the conclusion that, much as I should like to encourage the use of Australian timbers, it is better that the duty in respect of paragraph A should remain as originally passed by this House.",44
323,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Wide Bay) [6.16] - I think that by this time the Treasurer must have recognised that, in agreeing to a compromise in respect of the duty on oregon, he secured no equivalent gain in respecFof other classes of timber. It is an admirable bargain only from the point .of view that it are offering. makes it easy to reduce the duty in respect qf paragraph A , and much easier to reduce the duties relating to other paragraphs! The honourable member for Lang in speaking this afternoon seemed to take up the position that this item affected only Queensland pine. I would remind the Committee, and especially the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that it covers every kind of timber entering Australia.",45
324,Mr THOMAS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,But no timber can compete with our hardwood. Is any hardwood being imported?,45
325,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Ye s ; into nearly every port. We have on one side honourable members who declare for a revenue duty, and on the other a majority declaring for protection for Australian industries; yet the timber industry, which is a native one, will secure neither a revenue nor a protective duty. It is because the timber industry happens to be native to Australia that it is not supported. The ordinary citizen will want to know why; and I venture to say that most honourable members will find it difficult to give a reasonable explanation. The only explanation I can offer is that it has been in the interests of importers rather than to the advantage of local producers that timber has been free. Fortunately or unfortunately, our large centres of population are on the sea-board, and. in many instances, the cost of conveying to them timber from otlier parts of the world is much less than is that of conveying timber from our forests to them.",45
326,Mr MAHON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The principal parts of the forests of Western Australia are close to the sea-board, and timber from them can be brought here cheaply.",45
327,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"If that were so, Western Australian timber would have a monopoly of the market.  timber from Queensland to Melbourne than from the Baltic to this port.",45
328,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Exactly . If the honourable member for Coolgardie's statement were correct, Western Australian jarrah"" would supplant all importations of hardwood. It is not doing so.",45
329,Mr MAHON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,-The jarrah trade is doing very well.,45
330,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"And I wish - it luck. Queensland uses some Western Australian jarrah, and I presume that it does so because it can obtain it at lower rates than those at which some of the local timbers",45
331,Mr HEDGES,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,It is used because it is a better timber.,45
332,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"There is no timber to equal blue gum, spotted gum, and ironbark. Our forests are being stripped of good timber, and yet the trade is unprofitable because the local industry receives no encouragement from this Parliament. It seems to be - the determined policy of honourable members not to extend to the timber getter the protection that has been extended to every other native industry in Australia. For instance, raisins and dried fruits have been subjected to. heavy duties,, and yet those industries do not employ one-fifth of the hands that are employed in the timber industry. Similarly, butter and cheese have been highly protected.",45
333,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Of what value is the duty upon butter?,45
334,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"When I was arguing this question upon a previous occasion, some honourable members said that they did not object to a duty upon log timber. "" Put it on,"" they exclaimed. But when, at a later stage, it was suggested that the item should be made dutiable, those honourable members-includin g the honourable member for Wimmera-said , "" Oh, no. That is. quite a different matter.""",45
335,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Hear , hear.",45

337,Mr SAMPSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The honourable member has not yet shown that the timber industry will be able to supply the requirements of the Commonwealth within a reasonable time.,46
338,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I will undertake to say- one. that that industry will produce sufficient timber to meet the requirements of the Commonwealth in a shorter period than any other industry can supply our needs in the matter of its own productions. It will produce sufficient timber to supply the quirements of the whole Commonwealth be- now. fore Our woollen mills are in a position to produce sufficient woollen goods to supply our needs. What is the use of the honourable member talking nonsense of that sort? I have always understood that a protective policy is based upon the assumption that it is necessary to nurse our industries during the initial stages of their existence, and that afterwards they will be able to stand alone.",46
339,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,But there is a profitable market for the timber industry now.,46
340,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,An enormous number of bush workers are exclusively engaged in the cutting of hardwood.,46
341,Mr HEDGES,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,That fact does not interfere with the industry.,46

344,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The fact.that it can be produced cheaply is no reason why the industry should not be protected.,46
345,Mr SAMPSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,But hardwood is more suitable for certain purposes than are timbers.,46
346,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,I quite agree with the honourable member that certain timbers are best adapted to certain purposes.,46

348,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I have never contested the honourable member's claim in that connection.

After all, valuable as our soft woods are, I believe that the hardwoods of Australia will ultimately prove even more valuable; soft and the sooner the hardwood forests are developed the better it will be for the Commonwealth 'as a whole. I recognise that, unfortunately, any discussion is unlikely to alter the result. The large centres of population are on the seaboard, and the people there can, apparently, get their timber supplies from oversea cheaper than they can from _ inland' owing to the cost of carriage, so that it does not seem to matter whether or not timber is partially destroyed or railways are built in The fact that this is a typical Australian industry, which gives employment to large numbers of people, and assists in the development of the country, does not seem to influence the majority of honourable members.",46
361,Mr THOMAS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Is that fair? I might say that the honourable member does not consider the miners of Broken Hill .,47
362,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I am only pointing out the fact that, while every exotic invotes. dustry is protected, the timber-producing industry, which I venture to say some 80,000 people, is left to face the competition of the world. I can only acgiven count for this by the fact that it suits large centres of population, especially the seaboard, to import their timber plies rather than agree to impose even a revenue duty in the interests of the ber-getters. The people who make large for the tunes are those who handle the timber from oversea; those who have endeavoured to develop the native timber industry in some cases have done well. Log timber is in every instance free, and, with that concession, I think that a duty of is. might well be imposed in the 'the case of the item before us. Of course, if the majority of the Commitought, tee are otherwise minded, I am content to leave the matter as before. I admit there seemed to be some kind of compromise arrived at on the previous occasion; and is for the Minister to decide what he shall do in the position in which he finds self. It is proposed that the duties the case of oregon shall be reduced; and it would be an anomaly if other timbers were treated differently.",47

When these items were before on the previous - occasion I moved that the timber imported for butter-box making, from New Zealand especially, made free in the interests of the great dairying industry of Australia. It appears, however, that there is no possibility having pine, oregon, and other timbers placed on the free list; and, therefore, suppose Ave must endeavour to have duty made as IOAV as possible, which will in all likelihood mean the rate already passed by this Chamber.

382,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The letter is dated n t h inst., and is as followsReferring to the supplies of Queensland timber now being discussed in the House, we beg am afraid the to inform you that Queensland is quite unable to deliver sufficient quantities for our requirements. During the season, we use over 1,000,000 feet of butter-box timber; we asked Queensland mills to quote for 500,000 feet, but were informed that all we could get would be 5,000 feet per week, which would only keep us going for about three hours per week in the busy season .' So that this gentleman, says that, so fa r as he is concerned, the supplies that he was able to obtain from Queensland would keep him going only three hours per week in a busy season. When supplies are forthcoming in that insufficient way, it would be. absolutely impossible to keep a large timber mill in full work.",48
383,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,When did that happen ?,48
384,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,This communication refers to the present time. The honourable - Colonel FOXTON - When did the writer of the letter give that order?,48
385,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Does the honourable member dispute the statements?,48
386,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Yes , I do.",48
387,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Does the honourable member assert that Queensland is in a position to supply the requirement's of the people of the Commonwealth in regard to timber for the purpose of making butter boxes for the dairying industry ?,48
388,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Yes , I do.",48
389,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Ninet y per cent, of the orders are for 12 and 24 inch widths.",48
390,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The honourable member for Maranoa was very strong in his statement that timber merchants in the big cities of Australia, while prepared to take what are known as the "" butters "". from Queensland, are nof prepared to take the off-cuts; and he said that that was the great diffiMr Joseph culty that the Queensland timber people had. Here is what this gentleman says on that' subjectWith regard to the statement thai Victoria Victorian will take their ""butters,"" but will not take their "" off-cuts,"" we are quite prepared lo enter into an arrangement to take all the Queensland mills can supply us with for 12 months; sonable deliveries, provided the price is the same, or even is. higher than New Zealand. So that this gentleman was prepared not only to take butter-box timber, supplies of which he could not obtain, but also what is known as the off-cuts or waste, and that at a price even is. higher than the price of. New - Zealand timber.",48
391,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Does not the honourable member think that it is signincant that these statements were made after the representatives of the Queensland timber industry had gone away.,49
392,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"For years past that has been the position. I happen to know some of the Sydney timber merchants very well. I have known them for a number of years, and I am aware that this has been a common complaint. It is not a new thing, but it is the common experience in dealing with the . Queensland timber merchants, that they are unable to maintain! a regular delivery of orders.",49
393,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,There is a dead set by the merchants against Queensland timber.,49
394,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"There is no dead set against it on the part of the merchants whose representations I have been giving to the Committee. Personally, I wish well to the Queensland timber-getters, and hope that their industry will prosper. I know that they have a magnificent' industry, but I also know that they cannot supply orders. The Sydney timber merchants would be perfectly ready to use Queensland timber if they could get regular and sufficient supplies of it. But the dairying industry would be absolutely blocked, not only in connection with the local trade, but also in regard to the export trade, if a ready supply of pine for butter boxes were not always forthcoming. What a nice position the Victorian dairy farmers would be in, with their exports of £16,000,000 per annum of butter to the markets of the world, if they were not in a position to get timber for the making of their butter boxes, or if they were only able to obtain it at such a high price as must seriously handicap them in their trade? I feel sure that' even the Queensland representatives,interested as they are in the prosperity of the dairying industry and of mining, would not, in a cold-blooded way, injure the large number of persons engaged in those industries. I wish to refer to some further evidence which I have in my possession in connection with this with reafeature of the matter. .Messrs. Binns, Wadge, and Brown, who are large merchants in Sydney, and who use every kind of timber, write to me under date n t h May, 1908.",49
395,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,They are importers.,49
396,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Yes , but they are also large users of all kinds of Australian timber. They will take as much Queensland timber as they can get.",49
397,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,They are importing timber; that is their business.,49
398,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"They have to import to fulfil their orders. We want oregon, baltic, and other imported timbers to supply our people, whose requirements cannot always be met from the resources of the forests of Australia.  to the best kauri.",49
399,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I think it is myself, and I believe that that is also the opinion of. experts.",49
400,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Why not give it a chance ?,49
401,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I am prepared to give it every chance. What is the use of the 'Treasurer continually barking in that manner, when he knows perfectly well that the Queensland merchants are unable to supply the New South Wales market, and cannot even fulfil contracts. The letter from Messrs. Binns, Wadge, and Brown is as followsRe yours of the gth, we begto state that we have no contracts with any of the Queensland firms, as we found the business so unsatisfactory through the delays and unbusinesslike methods of the Queensland firms, that we had to drop it and buy locally. They kept us waiting for months for timber, so we decided to place no more orders with them.",49
402,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,That letter does not sav what sorts of timber are referred to.,49
403,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The honourable member for Brisbane wants fo pin these men down to pieces of a measurement which meets the requirements of the butter-box trade. But I can assure him and the Committee that the inability of the Queensland timber people to supply orders applies to all kinds of timber. I have also a letter from. Messrs. S. A. Burns and Company, general timber merchants, Goulburn-street, Sydney.' In documents handed to me they give particulars'in connection with classes of timber which they ordered, and for the information of the honourable member for Brisbane I will read some of the sizes.",49
404,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,When were they ordered ?,50
405,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"On the 8th April, 1907. That is recent enough, I hope. The sizes were 4 x i | inches, 4.x J,.i2 x } 18 x 12 x I-and so on. 'Colonel FOXTON - Do they give the quantities of different measurements?",50
406,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Yes. ' For instance, 2,418 feet, 4 x \ \ ; 1,800 feet, 4 x \ ; and so on.",50
407,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,What about the larger sizes?,50
408,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The order for timber 14 x \ inches was 156 feet; 18 x \ , 24 feet; 12 x f, 202 feet.  seriously say that Queensland cannot supply such small orders? - Mr FULLER - They cannot supply these small orders.",50
409,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The honourable member's statement makes a farce of the discussion.,50
410,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I shall come to some of the bigger orders presently. pected that something would be said in connection with the small orders, but when we find that neither the small nor the large orders can be supplied we are entitled to conclude that the timber is not forthcoming to fulfil orders. I come now to communications from John W. Eaton and Company, one of the largest timber firms in Sydney. They refer to their dealings with the Queensland people through Mr Ross principally. like to read to the Committee the written statement of Mr G. Augensen, secretary of the Timber Merchants' Association of Sydney. I wrote to him asking him what was the experience of his association in connection with this matter, and he writes to me to sayDear Sir,-The general opinion among merchants here is that it is useless to contracts for Queensland pine, as they can never be certain as to when the timber will arrive here. Yours truly, Sec. Sydney and Suburban Timber The particulars which he gives show lhat, in the instances quoted, although orders were sent, they were not fulfilled. not wish to protract the discussion, but I must refer to the experience of Messrs. John W. Eaton and Company in connection with the Queensland mills. The following is a letter sent after an interview by Mr Chidgey, whom probably the Queensland representatives know2gth ]uly, 1907. Messrs. Davies and Fehon L t d . , 60 Margaret-street, Sydney. A Dear Sirs,-Confirmin g the writer's conversation . with your Mr Chidgey this afternoon, please book us - the following lines of hoop pine:-50,00 0 f t . 4 x"" f T. & G. hoop pine; 10,00a f t . 6 x § ditto; 20,000 f t . 4 x £ T. & G. & V.

One of the big classes of timber to which the honourable member for Brisbane and others have referred was included in this order. The total amount of the order was for 50,000 feet. I call that a pretty ""big order.",50
411,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Was . not that supplied ?,50
412,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"No , it was not.",50
413,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Is the honourable member sure of that?,50
414,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I am sure of it. ' On I ex- that order being given^ a letter was received from Mr C. H . Ross, director for Messrs.

Hyne and Son write us with reference to the order we placed before them for hoop pine on your account, that at I should the present juncture they could not accept your order at rates specified,"" and state"" We are faced with yet another increase ir» price of logs, and a probable strike with our men for less work and more pay per day, sent present we would not entertain the order.

We regret exceedingly that we have to pass enter into your order on this occasion. Yours faithfully, DAVIES & FEHON, C. H . Ross, Director. C>. AUGENSON, So that it was probably on account of the price and other difficulties, that the QueensMerchants' Assn. land people were unable to fill that order. But we cannot afford to allow industrieswhich are dependent upon regular supplies I do of suitable timber to be placed in such a position as is indicated by this letter.",50
415,Mr STORRER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The price was evidently too low.,50
416,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Evidentl y it was a question of price.,50
417,Mr MAHON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The Queensland firms did nbt want to pay the wages which the men asked for.,51
418,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Member s representing Queensland may be able to state if there was any trouble in the timber trade at that time.,51
419,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,I have no recollection of any labour difficulty at that time. mit that the wages are not too high.,51
420,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"On the 1.2th of August the same people were asked for a quotation for 64,000 feet. I shall not weary honourable members by reading the whole of this correspondence, but one letter, dated 2nd September, 1907, sums up the whole position. It is also from Mr C. H . Ross, the agent of the Queensland Timber Getters' Association, and is as followsMessrs. John W . Eaton, L t d . , North Sydney. Dear Sirs,-We have today received advice from Messrs. Hyne and Son that they prefer not to quote for ordersSo it is not a question of supplying at a price fixed by the people who want the timber, for it is stated there that the firm preferred not to quote for ordersfor some little time, or until their log look brighterThey were not in a position to get the log supplies to fulfil the contractthan they do at present. We are, therefore, referring the order to Brisbane, and will advise you their reply. I have similar evidence with me to which I could refer, but I think I have quoted sufficient to prove that the people in Melbourne and Sydney, at any rate, who want supplies of Queensland pine, and have given orders, not only for the big sorts, but for the smaller sorts as well, and are prepared to take not only what is known as the butter timber, but the off-cuts or "" rubbish,"" as the honourable member for Maranoa characterized it the other night, cannot get supplies from Queensland. One timber merchant was prepared to take all that could be supplied for twelve months. I think I can fairly claim that Queensland is not in a position today to supply anything like the requirements of the Commonwealth. I hope that State will - some day be in a position to supply the whole of our requirements, but, in the meantime, while the Queensland Government have hysterically . rushed railways through the State Parliament, in the teeth of the opposition of Labour Partv, in order to open up these forests ",51
421,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I am informed that it is so.  orable member informed him wrongly. Those are not the railways that were opposed by the Labour Party. They opposed syndicate railways. I ad- Mr FULLER - If I am wrong, I am perfectly prepared to be corrected by Queensland members, who know more than I do about it.",51
422,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I think the honourable member ought to give the name of the person who made that scandalous, cunning insinuation.'",51
423,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I have made the statement, and am prepared to accept the correction of the' honourable member for Maranoa, or of any other Queensland iabour HOOP PINE. member. What could be fairer than that? If they, assure me that I have made a nasty insinuation, I withdraw it, but that does not affect the position at all. The fact remains that Queensland today is not in a position to supply anything like the requirements of the"" Commonwealth. I go further, and say that Queensland is not in supplies a position to supply anything like one-fourth of the requirements of the particular industries I have mentioned. In those circumstances, the Committee would be acting prejudicially to some of the great industries of Australia, and prejudicially to the interests of the working classes particularly, who are compelled to use a number of. imported timbers in connection with the little homes that they build for themselves, if it agreed to impose the heavy duties suggested by the Senate. I sincerely wish that these timbers could come in free, but, in the circumstances, I am compelled to vote for the duties as passed by this House on a previous occasion. In doing so I feel that we are still placing a handicap on some of our big industries. If we acted with wisdom, and with a view to the development of the mining, dairying, and other big industries which are makjng the wealth of Australia, and practicallv keeping our big cities going, every inch of this timber would come in absolutely free. As we cannot hope to make it free, I trust that we shall place it under as IOAV a duty as possible.  the stated in one letter read by the honourable member for IllaAvarra, Will regard to the supplying of orders from Queensland, that the logs were not coming forward. That letter was dated, I think, April, 1907. I have information of much more recent date. I am informed that since that time the logs have been coming in so fast that they could not be unloaded.",51
424,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Who informed the honourable member?  James Campbell and Sons, timber merchants of Brisbane. I can assure the honourable member that all my information is Queensland information. I am not barracking for the Timber Combine in ""Victoria or the Timber Combine in New South Wales.",52
425,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"O r the associated timber people ?  associated saw-mill owners and timbergetters in Queensland-for the men who are pioneering the country. In the electorate of the leader of our party, there are men at work opening up the country for civilization and selection, and surely if some of the workers in Melbourne and Sydney are to get a measure of protection, the protectionist members of this House will not deny the same protection to those men. I do not know much about the protectionist theory. I am only a novice at it, but since I came here I have learnt a lot. The only protection that my electorate asks for is to be left alone. I have heard honourable members on this side of the chamber, and in our own corner, denouncing combines and trusts, and condemning them in no measured terms. Here, in Melbourne, there is a Timber Combine second to none. Talk about the Confectionery Combine and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company ! This one is on the Yarra bank, in the electorate of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports. There are half-a-dozen men in it, and the great bulk of the timber imported into Victoria is imported in one man's name. There are two lists in the Combine. One is called the white list. Those on it are the insiders. They are the fellows that get all the pickings. On the other side, there is what is called the pink list, and the pink listers have to pay 15 per cent, more for their timber than those on the white list pay. To prove what I am saying, I will read a letter that appeared in the Age this morning from Mr J. J. Moore, of 17 Queen-street. That is not Mr Moore, the big timber merchant, but the agent, I think, for one of the Queensland firms. The statement in the Age is as followsTHE TIMBE RDUTIES . Mr J. J. Moore, 17 Queen-street, writes in reply to the letter signed "" Timber Merchant"" in the Age of Tuesday :- "" Hitherto I have kept out of this controversy, but I cannot allow your correspondent's statements to go unchallenged - I have had six years' experience in Queensland timber in Melbourne, and) in reply to allegations about combines, my_ experience is that one of the biggest combines in the southern hemisphere is to be found in the Melbourne timber business. The Melbourne timber merchant does not want local timber, for anything local, as a rule, kills combines. When they order Queensland timber they always demand our best, and best only. When they buy kauri or New Zealand white pine they must take everything out of a log, or pay for the privilege. From Queensland everything is wanted, and no privilege. ' Timber Merchant' challenges Mr Campbell's statements regarding the cutting of pine. I will not dispute the point; but will ask ' Timber Merchant' to explain why a Melbourne buyer,- who is neither white 1 nor pink,' has to pay in Melbourne 33 1-3 per cent, to get his logs cut up. Now that I have come into the open, I should like 'Timber Merchant' to come to the front, and expose his name, so that we may fight on fair ground."" There is the whole thing in a nutshell. Because it is not a Victorian industry-lie cause the timber is not growing on the banks of the Yarra, or in the backyards of South Melbourne, or up and down the avenues of Collingwood-the timber industry is to have no protection. Like everything else Victorian, the idea is one-eyed. If one attends a football match or a cricket match in Victoria, he wil l find that the "" barrackers"" while seeing nothing but faults on one side, see none on the other. Honourable members know the weeping and wailing there was the other day because the New South Wales crew beat the Victorian crew in the boat race. One Victorian, I believe, went so far as to say that he thought some of the Victorian crew had been "" dosed "" by New South Wales supporters. I ask representatives of Victoria, who advocate protection from the public platform, how they can reconcile voting for protectionist duties to assist a Victorian industry with their refusal to give the same measure of protection to a Queensland industry? We have known some of them to shed crocodile tears because they did not consider a 50 per cent, duty sufficiently protective for a Victorian industry. The honourable member for Batman last night was wailing about a 50 per cent. duty.",52
426,Mr TUDOR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The honourable member for Batman has not gone wrong on the timber duties.  I was referring to the way in which he was prepared to deal with a Victorian industry. I will say this for the honourable member for Batman, and it is to his credit, that has never ""gone crook "" on protection yet.",53
427,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"He is almost the only member of the Committee who has not done so.  honourable member for Yarra. It does not matter how much advantage might be gained by giving a vote for a' lower duty, those honourable members are unable to see it. There is no doubt that they are one-eyed protectionists. But there are other members of the Committee who, to hear them speaking, would sacrifice everything rather give a vote against protection, but who are not prepared to vote for the protection of industries that are not established in Victoria.",53
428,Mr TUDOR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Where do they sit?  corner, and some in the ""constitutional"" corner. There are some red-hot protectionists to be found in both those corners. According to Mr Moore's statement, there can be no doubt that a timber combine exists in Melbourne. I have found, on inquiry, that that statement is absolutely correct",53
429,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"There is one in Queensland, also.  Queensland, all concerned are in the swim. There are no pink ones and white ones there. If the workers of Collingwood, Melbourne Ports, and Melbourne generally are to be given a share of the advantages of protection, I cannot, for the life see why they should object to assist their fellow workers in Queensland.",53
430,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"What about the New South Wales oil industry ?  is concerned, my view was that there little choice between the devil inside and the devil outside. Possibly I shall have to suffer for the vote I gave in connection the oil industry.",53
431,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I voted with the honourable member.  member has no vote for my constituency, and probably I should not get it if he I do not appeal in this matter to free traders, because I do not expect to influence a single vote on the other side, but I do appeal to protectionists to support these duties, which, if carried, will give timberworkers in Australia the assistance to which they are entitled. I am informed thatUnder existing conditions, timbers imported he from Sweden and Norway, known as Baltic limbers, have workmen for the labour on these, dressing, tonguing, grooving, & c , paid at the rate of 2s. per day. Freight from the Baltic costs less than the coastal steamer charges from Brisbane to the southern ports.. That is another handicap against the timber industry in Queensland and on the northern rivers in New South Wales. I am sure that the honourable member for Hunter will be able to bear Out that statement, as he must know something of the excessive rates of freight on timber from the northern than rivers of New South Wales tb SydneyQueensland has pine timber, in abundance which can take the place of these inferior Baltic timbers, and for the trade in Queensland there have never been any imports of Baltic timbers. I wish to be quite fair with the Committee in dealing with these timber duties, and, therefore, I mention the fact that some twelve or eighteen months ago I saw a statement in a newspaper to the effect that a quantity of white pine had been imported to Queensland for the manufacture of butter-boxes. I made inquiries in Brisbane as to the reason for this importation, and I was told that sufficient Queensland pine had not come to hand, and the Queensland millers could not execute the orders they received, - because the butter industry of the State, was growing at such a rapid pace, that they could not keep up with its requirements. That appeared to me to be a valid reason for the importation of white pine at the time.  of me, argument from our point of view ?  honourable member looks at the question. If he looks at it from the point of view of the Victorian protectionist, he is quite right. But looked at from the Queensland is very point of view, he is quite wrong.",53
432,Mr MCDOUGALL,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Is not Queensland pine the best timber that can be obtained with for the manufacture of butter-boxes ?  like to say that when the first Tariff was being considered, the statement was made that Queensland timber used for the manufacture of butter-boxes tainted the butter. had. That has not been said during the consideration of this Tariff. Sir WILLIAM LYNE . : - I believe that they put some logs in a dirty place, and then had them sawn up for butter-boxes.",53
433,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"It is only since the consideration of the first Tariff that a fair opportunity was afforded for the testing of Queensland timber..  orable member what the test was. Queensland butter packed in boxes made of Queensland pine took the first prize at the Royal Agricultural Exhibition at Islington, London, in competition against the world. If that is not a good enough test of the suitableness of the Queensland pine for this purpose, I do not know what other tests honourable members require. I am further informed thatTo supply the other States, handicapped as they are with heavy freight and the higher wages in Queensland, as compared with wages paid in Norway, Sweden, & c , without the' help of the duty asked for, is not possible. That statement can, I think, be borne out. I know some men getting and hauling timber in Queensland who make about 30s. a day. Of course, they have, out of that, to keep a team and to keep harness in repair ; but, paying such wages, it is a matter of impossibility to carry on the industry in competition with those who pay wages of only 2s. per day.",54
434,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The 30s. paid for a man and his team.  said that a man with a team getting and hauling timber makes 30s. a day in Queensland, and he earns every penny of it .",54
435,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"But why with the men who get 2s. per day in Norway ?  way the same value would be put upon the services of the honourable member for Moreton that is put upon them by the Queensland electors. If the honourable member were King of Norway, let alone an ordinary member of Parliament of the common or garden variety, he would not get £ 6 0 0 a year.",54
436,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The honourable member's services in connection with one particular industry are valued very highly in Queensland.  highly by his constituents than mine are by the people .1 represent; but, of course, comparisons are odious. The statement is made that the superiority of Queensland flooring, lining, weatherboard, and other timbers for the trade is acknowledged, and dare not be contradicted. I must say that I have heard no member of the Committee contradict it. . The Queensland timbers are of the finest quality. I admit that the honourable member for Illawarra was very fair in his criticisms, but what we object to is that timber merchants in Melbourne- I cannot speak as to Sydney-requir e the heart of the log. They must have timber from 12 to 24 inches wide, and as much wider as they can - get it. If a purchaser every time he enters a shop buys only the best of the stock, and leaves the inferior goods on the shopkeeper's hands, how is he to replenish his stock?",54
437,Mr ATKINSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,He must become bankrupt.  members opposite wish to bring upon the the timber industry in Queensland.,54
438,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Thos e engaged in it can make plenty of money.  They are not in business for philanthropic, reasons, any more than is any one else.",54
439,Mr FULLER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I have a letter from a man who will take all the off-cuts of Queensland timber for the next twelve months at the price paid for New Zealand timber, or even at is. per 100 superficial feet higher. per day is Colonel FOXTON --Why did he not make that offer to the President of the Association two days ago, when he was here.",54
440,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I made the President of the Association an offer which compare him he did not accept.  Orders sent are for only 10 per cent, out of the logs, being all wide boards, from 12 inches to 24 inches, leaving Queensland millers 90 per cent, in smaller sizes, and the best of the log must be taken to supply these' orders. The wealthy importers of Sydney and Melbourne have circulated these statements-Queenslan d cannot supply, &c - and areworking their own ends for imports against the development of the forests of the Commonwealth. I believe that statement to be welt founded, and if honourable members are prepared to assist the importers in this respect, they are bigger fools than I take them for. I recognise no distinction between a f at manufacturer and a f at importer. My informants say, furtherTasmania before Federation had no need for these imported Baltic floorings, linings, and weatherboards.",54
441,Mr ATKINSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"What is the honourable member quoting from?  written paper, which the honourable ber may see presently. I suppose that reference to Tasmania woke him upTasmania before Federation had no need for these cheap Baltic floorings, linings, and weatherboards. She could, and can now, her lighter class of hardwoods, supply a magniticent article, equal tp the oaks and maples of America, and in price (taking durability superiority in every way) far Baltic stuff.",54
442,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Sh e has Macquarie Harbor and Huon pine, too.",55
443,Mr ATKINSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Huo n pine would not be used for flooring.,55
444,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The honourable member does not know anything about the matter.,55
445,Mr ATKINSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,I know that it is not used for that purpose.  timber alone to get the benefit of this protection. Any other States which can produce the timber have as much right to the protection as has Queensland. Surely the honourable member for Wilmot would not object to a little protection fpr the timber in Tasmania !,55
446,Mr ATKINSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"This is not a Tasmanian, but an Australian question.  ber always look at Australian questions in that light? He had a lot to say about protection for the potatoes and hops of his State j he spread-eagled himself when we were dealing with those items. The paper continuesWith Queensland pine and the light hardwoods of Victoria and Tasmania, the Commonwealth can fill her own wants in these uses.

Of course, it is of no use for me to plead with the free-traders, because I know very well that, with the exception of the honourable member for Illawarra-wh o does not mind a duty of 10 or 15 per cent - the y are against the imposition of duties of any sort.

Throughout the world, the price of timber is rising, and apparently the forests are becoming somewhat denuded. If the States of Australia are wise, they will begin to conserve their forests. I dare say that a good many of the imported woods could be grown here if the States' Departments would only make an effort in that direction. In my opinion, the duty on oregon, New Zealand white pine, kauri, baltic, and other soft wood's which are imported, should be a light one. Those woods are not grown here, But they are wanted very much indeed. If honourable members force the people of Australia to use other woods for the purposes for which the imported woods are now used, the heavy burden which they will impose will not be counterbalanced by any employment which may be given locally?",55

Surely if there is one industry in Australia that deprice of timber, I repeat, is rising. serves to be encouraged, it is the butter industry. It is one of the greatest wealththat producing sources that we have. developed naturally, and its potentialities are very great - It is a short-sighted policy which will attempt to hamper a valuable industry merely for the sake of benein fiting the community generally in a small way. I do not doubt for a moment the statement that Queensland pine can be used for making butter boxes, but the butter trade is a big one. There are many purposes to which this wood can be put. Surely the market is good enough to enat courage the Queensland people to send down their wood without getting further encourUndoubtedly a big demand exists, and if they are in earnest they ought to try to supply it. If a duty is imposed may help Queensland, but it will not help the community very much, because probably greater proportion of the pine-it is a in wood of superior quality, ancl well fitted for making doors and other things-wil l be used for other purposes than the making of any butter boxes, so that the butter industry use may be hit, and no one appreciably benefited. It will be remembered that we gave good measure of protection, I think unanimously, to the Marbut carving industry. in AdeThe Marbut Carving Company! found it very difficult to get a supply of Queensland wood. Firms in that State would not take orders to supply tEe wood at a definite and many orders still remained unfulThe result was that the company were forced to get the timbers they required am from America, New Zealand, and other If Queensland cannot keep up a regular supply of the small quantity of timis ber required by that industry, how can it supply the big demand of Australia?

The The honourable member for Illawarra has stated if we impose a duty it will not stop the It has importation of Baltic and other cheap woods which are now introduced so freely and used so largely by all sections of the community. Nowadays pretty well every house the country contains a lot of baltic pine. If it is seriously taxed, it. will still be imported, and poor users penalized to extent, without the timber industry being - benefited. It is said that, although is a good market, Queensland cannot supply the orders which it receives from timber merchants. Why is not the timber sent down ? Possibly it is owing to the forests being so difficult of access and the freight so heavy. If that is the reason why Queensland timber is not placed on the ket, why should we impose a heavy duty on other woods that Australian people have?

A greatTariff many of the mines in Broken Hill might shorten hands, and we should have done more harm by causing men to be thrown out of employment than good by giving work, by compelling the mine-owners to use Australian hardwood. There is a good market here and abroad for both Australian and imported timbers. As a matter of fact, most of the Tasmanian hardwood ported timber is not accurate. is exported to London and elsewhere, where it finds a ready sale, and I do think that the duty would be of much asenough. sistance to the local timber companies. At any rate, there is nothing to justify the imposition of high duties on the timbers mania. which I have mentioned. As to the measurement question, I cannot see ber half-an - inch thick should be charged as if it were an inch thick. Duty should Commonwealth. be proportionate to the number the timber; it should not be charged by superficial measurement.

It was stated in this morning's that Argus that in a certain division I voted free-trade; but that is one of the mistakes there which that journal makes. Throughout the consideration of the Tariff, I haveremained on the protectionist side whenever a proposal involving a fair and reasonable protection has been at stake. A.great deal has been made of the statement that the Queensland timber-getters were not able marto supply all the orders sent to them just about the time the Tariff was introduced, must when merchants in Sydney and Melbourne it forwarded large orders, thinking that In one of the letters quoted by the honourable member for it is stated that certain timber firms refused to execute orders at the prices at quoted; but it often happens in business emthat a firm to which an order is offered at a certain price will not accept it. Besides, in every new industry, if business is will growing rapidly, there are times when The present will last, I hope, for at least ten years, and are we, in framing it, to penalize the timber industry of Australia because one or two firms could not execute orders when there was a rush last year?",57

A great deal has been said about the need for cheap butter boxes; but surely I the poor farmer who, instead of burning his timber, sends the good logs to should be protected,. Queensland pine is suitable for butter boxes, and there is a good supply of it. If a duty of 6d. were imposed on butter-box timber, the extra cost per box would be only about £d., and as each box contains. 56 lbs. of butter, that would be very little per lb. bf butter.

472,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Parramatta) is [9.9]:-This question has been so thoran oughly threshed out on this and previous occasions, that I have very little more say on it now. We are constructing a most complicated Tariff. The object of appointought ing a Tariff Commission was to provide the remedying of anomalies; but this Tariff will be even less scientific than the It is divided into such a multiplicity items and sub-items, and gives so much scope for departmental interpretation, that the Customs experts, who are keen and alert for the protection of the revenue, and; incidentally, for the protection local industries, will have a great deal do in deciding what rates shall be posed, and there will be a conflict of opinion which will lead to endless conthat fusion. While the Tariff is yet in the cess of making, it is already having this effect. Only last night warm words were exchanged over the table because of an occurrence of the kind. In respect of timwe ber, we are framing a Tariff which, I ture to say, is of the most complicated nature, and will lead to equally reprehenshows sible results in the matter of interpretation.. I should think that the most scientific of constructing a Tariff, from a protec155,000,000 tionist point of view, is to make it as simple, and not as complicated, as possible. It is useless to belabour this aspect of the question if the Minister has made up his mind, but I complain again that there is a great want of straightforwardness, in the conduct of this Tariff, on the part of those and who have charge of it. We are actually going to enact that timber shall be rated as being an inch thick when, in reality, it is not. We are enacting that things are prewhat they are not, and all this will lead to endless trouble. Why, it being done? The answer is simple: it is being done in order to impose protective duties under cover of complicated arrangements. In some instances, we are taxgoods two or three times over. I mentioned night a case in which a duty of cent, or 30 per cent, has been imposed on an article of manufacture, and out that on the top. of that duty, but in a different part of the schedule, we indirectly impose further duties by taxing the or labels and packages. Thus, although the product appears in the schedule as being dutiable at 20 per cent, or 30 per cent., it may be found, in actual practice, to carry a duty of 40 per cent, or 50 per cent. It cannot be said that a Tariff so arranged scientifically constructed. It is simply ingenious method of piling up duties which would not be assented to if they were to put before the Committee in a clear and straightforward way, as I think that they to be. I refer to this instance' as for beingtypical of many other items with which we have dealt during the. course ot last. the Tariff through this Committee. The of position in regard to the timber duties is resolvable into a very plain statement of fact. The protectionists say that until we can satisfy our own requirements protective duties must be taxes. They assert-and we of may admit, for the purposes of this arguto ment, that the statement is correct-that the immoment we are able to supply our own requirements such' a duty is no longer a tax it is simply a protective impost as disprotinguished from a tax. Accepting Ithis rea- soning of theirs, how does it apply to timber? - Those who advocate most earnestly and urgently this duty on timber admit that are not able, by any means, to supply our venown requirements. The Official Year-Book for 1901-7, just published by Mr Knibbs, that our total imports of timber during 1906 were 250,000,000 super, feet, and way that our exports for the same period were super, feet. Here is a curious example of the inability of any tax to control the trade in niatters of this kind. It is curious to observe that in this, as many other cases, we are exporting as much as we import.  wood.",58
473,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Quite so; but I think that the honourable member will admit that we are unable to satisfy our own requirements in respect of soft wood. ,59

The same thing happened in connection with butter boxes. is true that their price was subsequently of reduced somewhat, but today, as the result of the operation of the timber duties, these boxes are costing more than they did Am I to vote in favour of , imposing taxation upon the primary industries of Australia, when there is no. immediate prospect of their being able to get their timber requirements supplied locally inand equally reasonably?

490,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,What .is layman like myself to do when such conper cent. flicting statements are made upon the tion? The butter makers say that the Queensland pine is not so suitable butter boxes as is New Zealand pine. Mr 'WILSON - It is not nearly so cheap.,60
491,Mr JOSEPH COOK,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Why is it not flict' as cheap? I suppose it will not be denied - that the' expense of getting timber in New of Zealand-so far as the cost of labour concerned-is quite as much as it is Queensland. We have been told tetter wages obtain in New Zealand than Australia-that it is the ideal State to our Australian democracy must look to all the conditions that should obtain in spect of industrial and social welfare. .Why we are unable to successfully commade pete with New Zealand I am at a loss understand. But my chief point is at present we are not able to supply our own demands in the matter of timber. Until those demands can be supplied locally, the existing duty must, on the soning of protectionists - themselves, as a tax, and therefore must fall as heavy imposition on the primary industries of the Commonwealth, which can ill afford to bear it, seeing that they have to compete oversea in the markets of the world. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [9.28] At the risk of repeating what I said some days ago in the short address which delivered, I desire to make a few observais tions in reply to what has fallen, not from the honourable member for Parrasaw-millers matta, but also from the honourable ber for Illawarra - But before with any other phase of this question, I [396] wish to point out that a very grave misapprehension exists on the part of a number' of honourable members-protectionist s and of free-traders alike-as to. the extent to' n which the duty upon this item would act as a protective impost. A duty of is. per 100 superficial feet represents a protection' of i \ per cent.', and' a duty of 6d. per 100 superficial feet consequently represents aprotection of only 3$ per cent. One would - imagine from the debate which has taken can place that the whole of the trades which are dependent upon obtaining a sufficient supply of 'timber would be penalized if a duty of is. per 100 superficial feet wereimposed upon it. Could anything be more absurd? What would some persons engaged in our secondary industries-whic h are practically hot-house plants-thin k a if a paltry protection of only 3! were offered to them ?quesThe honourable member for Illawarra certainly gave some rather remarkable statefor ments and figures; and I can only say, as I said before, that these, as well as those previously quoted, are in strong conwith the facts and figures supplied tn me by the timber-getters and saw-millers Queensland. Mention has been mi'de of Mr Ross, the accredited agent in Sydney is of the Queensland Associated Saw millers. in That gentleman was, I understand, apthat pointed on his representing that he in could secure orders for 6,000,000 feet which per annum; but the Associated Saw-millsee ers are complaining bitterly of his being reunable to carry out his undertaking. This, of course, conflicts with the statements here to-night. I asked specially for to the dates of the orders which have been that given, and are alleged not to have been fulfilled, and I find that they were earlv in last year. I am told that the saw-millers association was formed about a year reaand eight months ago; and I understand act that since then no orders have been rea ceived from'Sydney or Melbourne for anything under 12 inches or 24 inches in width. It would appear that the orders referred to by honourable members to-night were given before the formation qf the association, for since then all orders are recorded, and none of the kind have been reI then ceived. One order was so small that it almost' absurd to quote it, even if it were only not fulfilled, as proving that Queensland are unable to supply the marmemket. One item was actually 24 feet of a dealing certain class of timber '.",60

494,Mr MAHON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Why were the large orders not' supplied ?,61
495,Colonel FOXTON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I have alreadv said that the saw-millers are complaining about their agent being unable to obtain the orders he undertook to get; and the very last words which Mr Campbell, of Messrs.

But the industry on which will fall the impost caused by this paltry protection, if it be afforded, is the building industry, which I do not regard as primary, but one which should pay its fair share of protection on the timber consumed; in the same way as it pays for protection in regard to tiles, slates, iron, and other material. We have* in Queensland what is admitted to 7 be very superior pine; .and yet not a solitary foot of if can be seen in any building in course of erection in Melbourne or Syd-. ney.",61

505,Colonel FOXTOX,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"r-A Queenslander, accustomed to the beautiful pine to be seen in the buildings in that State, observes with surprise the exclusive use of (marled and knotted imported pine in Melbourne buildings. I know that it is useless to attempt by any arguments to change the vote, because I believe that every honourable member has made up his mind. But I ask the Committee, haying regard to the importance of the timber industry to the Mr State from which I come, to bear with' these few words in favour of imposing a duty which, after all. from the protectionist point of view, is less than paltry. What sort of protection is that to offer a primary industry such as this? Mr.'MALONEY (Melbourne) [9.40] I desire, as a Victorian representative, to offer my support to the views enunciated 1 by the honourable member for Wide Bay. I do so-, not only because the duty under consideration is one for the benefit of a primary industry, but also because I consider that we Australians have not hitherto shown that we understand the value of timber and the potentialities of our magnificent forests. I am glad to say that Queensland is in some respects leading the van in the direction of an appreciation of the importance of forestry. No less than one-tenth of the surface of the earth is covered with forests. Europe is richer in forests than any other part of the world in proportion to its size. Russia has an area under forest of 426,060,000 acres; United States, 456,000,000 acres, and Germany and France, which lead the world in this respect, have respectively 32,000,000 and 22,000,000 acres under forest. It is calculated that an under cultivated forest in Germany will give a greater yield than ten acres in wild state. The destruction of timber Australia has been largely due to the fact that in the past we have had bad land ever laws, which compelled settlers to go into the heavily-timbered country. Victoria,. thirty or forty years ago, men who wanted to obtain land upon which settle had to go into the dense forests of Gippsland and carve homes for themselves. Some of the most magnificent trees in world have been destroyed in this manner. One famous tree, which' was said , to be miles of forest. the biggest in the world, was called the Baron tree, in honour of the late Baron Von Mueller. That, in common with other enormous trees, has been destroyed. In Europe, I need hardly remind honorAustralia. able members, great care is taken of notpoint able and historical trees. I might ins'tance the famous oak which was the means of saving the lif e of King Charles the Second, every other State. owing to the fact that he took refuge in branches after the battle of Worcester. timber of the forest is the finest crop will ever be garnered from the land. N other crop which can be planted can equal in value a crop of good timber. scarcely remind honourable members that takes sometimes from 200 to 300 years for in that respect. some kinds of timber to reach perfection. The honourable member forParramatta quoted from a. book, which"" I held in hand while he was speaking, .to show how forestry. the output of Queensland timber has creased. That is to be explained by the absence of railway accommodation into parts of the country where the forests most dense. I may quote with advantage from Mulhall, a statistical ' authority, highly regarded by all economists. mentions the plantations made - by three British noblemen-the Duke of Athol, at Dunkelt planted 28,000,000 trees' 16,000 acres; the Earl of Seafield, who, at Inverness, planted 60,000,000 trees 40,000 acres; and Lord Powerscourt, who, at Wicklow, planted 3,000,000 trees .1,000 acres. It ""is estimated that'/the ' last-mentioned nobleman, who planted in - item'I have mentioned. -1869 at an outlay of 66s. per acre, will , by the year' 1915,' possess a plantation worth . £ 50 per ""acre. "" We have'to remema ber that Australia is poor in respect of 'her forests in comparison with some other countries in the world, as honourable members will find on turning to the official acre year-book of the Commonwealth by Mr. Knibbs. I must, in passing, compliment that the gentleman on the splendid way in which in he has produced this volume, which is a book of statistics that will be valued wherstatistical information is studied in any out part of the world. Mr Knibbs says, comI n paring the relative value of forest land in Australia with other countries in the world, to that the Australian Commonwealth can - claim a total forest area of 167,245 square miles. The United States, however, has the a forest area of 1.000,000 square miles, and Canada possesses 1,248,000 square So that it behoves us in Australia lo be very careful of our forests. Although a Victorian protectionist, I have never claimed for my State what I was not prepared to concede to every other State - in No honourable member can at me and say that I have been willing to vote for protection for Victoria without being willing to concede the same to On page 377 of Mr. its Knibbs' volume, the revenue derived b,y The the Forestry Departments of the States is that shown. New South Wales leads in this o ' respect. In 1900 its revenue from forests was £ 1 4 , 4 2 1 , and in 1906 this revenue I need had increased to ^50,937. The greatest it credit must be given to New South Wales The revenue in Queensland has increased .from .£7,608'. to ^14,560 in the same period.' No one can my - gainsay the potentialities of QueenslandMany honourable members have deseen for themselves the splendid timbers growing in that State - We have fine for the ests-in other States'also, notably in Tasare mania, with her fine fiddle-back blaekwood. But, as I said before, our forest possessions have been sadly sacrificed in the past. He ' I point out that if we. are-to have .a scientific Tariff, we ought to recommit item who 363, paragraphs c and D, the duties on ori which ought to be raised from 2s. to 2s. 6d. to 3s. and 3s. 6d., so as to prevent on th . smaller stuff from coming in. VVe a should as far as possible prevent cut timon ber from being'imported, and therefore it is my desire to increase the duties on the To show the importance of some kinds of timber, I may mention that Le Ptf.it. Journal, which has circulation of 1,500,000 copies per day - the largest circulation of any newspaper in the world - is said to eat up a pine forest every year; the paper upon which the journal is printed being manufactured from wood pulp. I may make another allusion from Mr Knibbs' volume, page 382. The imports of dressed timber from Norway, in 1906, amounted to 43,712,732 superficial feet, of a value of £273,546. Of undressed timber, which would give our workmen a chance of obtaining employment, we imported from Norway, in the same year, only 1,284,969 superficial feet, of a value of £6,987. We therefore imported £273,000 worth in a prepared state, as against £6,900 worth in an unprepared state. No honourable member will say that the Australian workman is not able to do the work of preparing that timber. If we had had a scientific Tariff, we should have made it almost impossible for dressed timber to come into the Commonwealth, while making undressed timber absolutely free. That has been allowed only in regard to logs. From the United States, the other great timber exporting country, we received, in 1906, ^1:9,982 worth of dressed timber, and of undressed timber £549>534 worth. .That shows the advantage that it must have been to have had all that quantity of undressed timber coming from the United States prepared in our midst. My vote will be given with the honourable member 'for Wide Bay. I trust that will be an answer to some of those who have been pointing the finger at Victorian members and saying that they were not consistent in their votes for protection. I do not know a single protectionist in the Labour comer who has not been consistent in his votes on every item in the Tariff. If any honourable member cares ,to challenge that statement, I will ask him to quote any division where a Victorian Labour protectionist gave a* vote for free-trade in any direction whatever. The votes of those honourable members have been straight for protection throughout the length and breadth of the States, taking no cognisance of parochial ideas, and recognising the - needs, not of the particular State"" of . they are representatives, but of the Commonwealth as a whole.

It was first used for making picture and room mouldings, but later it has been imcommon-sense, ported for the manufacture of furniture, including bent-wood chairs.

508,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,I was just I going to mention the Tasmanian timbers.,64
509,Mr REID,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,- I see no reason why the duty should be increased.,64
510,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The ' honourable gentleman would make everything free and injure the country as he did New South Wales for so many years. That State is fifty years behind what she would have been but for his action. It appears that this red beech is coming - into keen comThat petition with some of the most beautiful woods that we have in the Commonwealth. is amazing to me. If honourable members are protectionists at all fhey should protect timbers which are largely used for the manufacture of ture, picture frames, and for like purposes. Not long since I visited in Adeknow laide probably the finest and most up-to do. date furniture manufacturing establishment in the southern hemisphere. I was by the owner, Mr Matthias, an immense quantity of Tasmanian wood which he had imported, and was keeping, in order that might be seasoned, for the manufacture the class of furniture to which I have ferred. He told me that it was some of the finest timber for the purpose that could be obtained in any part of the world, and that after it was seasoned no other timber could be compared to it for the purposes which he required it. I think that such timber should be protected in some way. The existing duty is 6d. per 100 supermoveficial feet, and the Senate recommend, that it should be increased to is. If I am be made. to take the result of the last division an indication of the feeling of the Comquested mittee it would seem almost' useless to to secure protection of any kind tralian timbers.",64

513,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I do not say anything of the kind, but I do think that honourable members should display some and agree to protect timbers suitable for the special purposes to which I have referred. The difficulty of securing suitable timber for the manufacture of butter-boxes does not arise in connection I am dealing now with timber required formanufacture of - furniture and pictureframes, and the Tasmanian timber to which have referred takes as fine a gloss and polish as any timber I hav-i ever seen.",64
514,Mr HEDGES,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Tasmani a does not need any protection. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Does she not?,64
515,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,I am sure I do not know. I have been very much surprised that some representatives of Tasmania should have voted for duties on timber as low as 6d. per 100 superficial feet. honourable members should lose their heads in these matters to the extent they do,64
516,Mr KELLY,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,They probably know more about the requirements of their own State furnithan does the honourable gentleman.,64

518,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I shall say nothing about that, because it .might be it suggested that I meant something serious. of If for no other reason, I think I shall rebe justified in moving that the requested amendments should be made, in order that we may discover what Tasmanian representatives and other 'members of the Committee are prepared to do to protect the beautifor ful timber to which I have referred, and which is being exported from that State to other parts of the Commonwealth.

519,Mr HEDGES,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Fremantle) [10.6] - I should like to inform the Committee that the Senate has requested the insertion of words "" and red beech "" in this item for a reason which is quite opposed to that the Minister has stated. This red Vicbeech comes from New Zealand, and is undoubtedly a'very fine timber. It is the only timber imported that can be used for the manufacture of bent-wood chairs. The reason the Senate desires that it should be specially included in this item is that if it is not so included it will come under another item; where it will carry a heavier duty than is. per ioo superficial feet. I have that statement from at least half-adozen members of the Senate. This red beech comes from New Zealand. lower the duty we impose upon it , the better another place will be pleased.",64

522,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Moreton) [10.9] - B y proposing that the Committee should make the amendment requested by the Senate in the wording of this item, the Minister is seeking to do what would only defeat his his own object.

524,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Whil e I am on my feet I desire to say a few words in regard to butter-boxes. I have listened with intense interest to the arguments for and against the timber duties, and I am convinced that sometimes honourable, members speak from theory more than from practice. I know, as a matter of fact, that the mill-owners of Queensland do not want the butter-box trade.",65
525,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The other representatives of the State do not say that. . Mr SINCLAIR .

I have been told that, the mill-owners are not prepared now to supply the, requirements of the butter trade in Queensland.",65
526,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,That ' is a very grave accusation to make against those who have been advocating the other side of the question.,65
527,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I am speaking from practical experience. During the last few weeks I have seen stacked up in the facThe tories of Queensland tbns of butter for which boxes could not be obtained. In this matter 'we ought to be fair to both Tasmanians sides - My object is to try to protect, as much as I can, the timber industry of not only Queensland, but .Australia generally. I believe that it needs some protection, but when the mill-owners say that they do not want the butter-box trade, and the dairying industry is going to suffer to such an extent, I submit that we should take into consideration the two industries.",65
528,Mr WEBSTER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Has the honourable member any documentary evidence of that?,65
529,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The mill-owners' representatives, who were in the lobbies during the last few days, told me that they So not want the butter-box trade-the y have told me that for the last eight years in a practical way-as they would not supply our requirements.

530,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The object of the millowners in waiting upon the honourable gentleman was to secure some protection for the vast quantity of timber which is now being destroyed ""in Queensland because it cannot be successfully placed' on the market.

551,Mr HEDGES,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"But honourable members have gone back on a number of things in regard to which there were agreements. To my mind, it' is reasonable to reduce the duty on door stocks from 2s. 6d. to 2s., to allow those in the joinery business to get their raw material more cheaply. Of course, if honourable members have made up their minds, it is useless for me to make a speech on the subject; but I hope that the Committee will make the requested amendment.",67
552,Mr KING OMALLEY,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"(Darwin) [10.30] - I trust that the Committee will not agree to this request. Tasmania's position in this House is neither apologetic nor defensive. Her representatives have on every occasion assisted - the manufacturers of Victoria and New South Wales to secure a high Tariff against the outside world, even at the expense of their own State, and yet, when they ask the Committee to stand by a duty that will enable the mill-owners of Tasmania to secure the investment of more capital in their industries, so that they may carry large stocks and thus have an opportunity to season their timber, they find that most of the protectionist representatives of Victoria and New South Wales are prepared to accept only that' which suits themselves. We find them combining against the interests of the small State of Tasmania. We have in that State blaekwood, redgum, peppermint, ironbark, fiddleback, and tallow-woodwe have timbers that have been described by experts in all parts of the world as superior to any grown in the rest of the Southern Hemisphere. The honourable member for Kooyong will admit that Tasmania furnishes timber for the Mount Lyell mine superior to any that Queensland can produce.",67
553,Mr HEDGES,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"But . this request relates to soft wood. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Some honorabel members are prepared 'to cling to anything that suits their own interests. Talk about statesmen who are going to build up a new nation! Heaven help the nation that has todepend on such men as the honourable member for Fremantle, - who talks only for his own interests. It is time we brought a missionary here to preach salvation to such honourable members. I do not wish to say unkind things, for I recognise that the polish has not yet left the Pagan. Each generation simply tells the tale of its civilization, and many honourable members who came here as protectionists are, so to speak, not yet civilized. There is a day of judgment coming for them. This is an item of serious interest to Tasmania, the gem of the Southern Hemisphere, which entered the Union without asking for any favours at the expense of the other States. She said to the people of the rest of the Commonwealth, "" Take freely of all that our land and our waters can give,"" and yet we find honourable members not prepared to support a duty that will enable those engaged in the great timber industry of that State to secure capital to extend their interests. Financiers in Australia will not help this class of men, and are not likely to do so until my national bank scheme is in operation. They will help only those who have the Universe behind them. Many years ago, I should have been crushed in this country but for the honourable member for Balaclava. I was a stranger in a - strange land, and he was a Christian. Having had that experience, I can f u l ly sympathize with small men engaged in saw-milling, who have to fight great combines outside Australia, consisting in manv cases of men who are directors of banks, and are able to utilize the people's money in their enterprises. Sucli combines ship to Australia thousands and thousands of feet of timber to glut the local market and crush out the small man in the industry here. I appeal to honourable members not to agree to this request. . Mr DUGALD ' THOMSON (North Sydney) [10.37] - I do not propose to reply to the heated speech just made by the honourable member for Darwin, who has waxed eloquent over a difference of 6d. per 100 sirperficial feet in respect of the duty on doorstocks. The Treasurer proposes that this request be not made, and I wish to ask him whether he is prepared to stand by the whole of the timber duties, as - passed by this House. If he is, we can save a great deal of debate, and arrive at practically the same result.",67

558,Mr MAHON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Coolgardie) [10.43] - It may be necessary to remind the Committee that the request of the Senate for a reduced duty upon door stocks is supported by the carpenters and joiners of Fremantle and Perth, who find that the duty levied by this Committee would interfere very considerably with their industry. I think that they are entitled to quite as much consideration as are the persons upon whose behalf the honourable member for Darwin made such an eloquent appeal.",68
559,Mr FRAZER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Kalgoorlie) [10.45] - I am inclined to think that the Treasurer has made up his mind in respect to this item in the absence of special information as to the reasons prompting the request of the Senate in respect of door stocks. The position of those engaged in the door trade is that, while the duty upon doors has not been increased, the duty upon the raw material of which they are manufactured has been increased. Consequently, instead of the protection which has been afforded proving a benefit to the Australian workmen, it is operating in the other direction. If the Treasurer really desires to protect this class, I think that he should give the Committee his view upon the matter in the light of the statement which I have just made.",68
560,Mr STORRER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"(Bass) [10.48] - I hope that the Treasurer will also recollect that the duty which he proposes upon timber re[397] presents a tax of from 6d. to 8d. per door, and that the door manufacturers already enjoy a protection of 7s. 6d. per door. If it be right to protect the joiner in the .workshop, it is equally right to protect the timber-getter, who was referred to by the honourable member for Darwin. I believe in protecting the bush worker equally with the city artisan. I should like to ask the Treasurer, who is to follow this timber with a view to seeing that it is used only for door stocks ?",68
561,Mr FRAZER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The size of it is stipulated.,68

It may be that there is some patent hub metal band which some importers desire should come in without being subject to duty; but, in the absence of any information on flie point, this seems to be a most left-handed kind of protection, and if a division is taken on this question, I shall vote against the proposal of the Minister.",68

567,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Wide Bay) [10.58] The Committee apparently is not in a temper to debate the matter, but I am of opinion that the Senate has interpreted the Tariff in a better sense than did the Committee on a previous occasion. as a matter of fact, that in Queensland it has always been a trade custom, when timber was dressed, to charge any portion of one inch as an inch.",69
568,Mr TILLEYBROWN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"If an inch plank were divided into sixteen planks, it would mean the payment of the duty sixteen times over.",69
569,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,That is a misleading statement. TheTreasurer under the duress of numbers has agreed to the largest sizes coming in at the smallest possible duty. Now it has been proposed that the work upon this timber should be performed in the cheap labour countries. That is a mistake from my point of view.,69
570,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,We have already provided for an increased duty on cut timber.,69
571,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"It is a very small increase, and not nearly enough. Although the debate has ranged round softwoods, in my opinion, sooner or later the most important timber trade of Australia will be in of hardwoods and the value of that timber will ultimately be enormous. The cutting of it will be a very important industry. It cannot be denied that a certain a amount of labour will be performed in the countries from which this timber comes. paraThe people who do that labour do not do it for their health's sake. It is done abroad because that labour is cheaper.",69
572,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Labou r is dearer in New Zealand and in America.,69
573,Mr FISHER,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"That ' may or may not be the case. I hope that it will not be . . . . long before the Australian workman will be paid as much as the New Zealand workman in the timber trade. A country which produces more wealth per head than New Zealand does can surely afford to pay as high wages as - are paid in New Zealand. The honourable member for North Sydney has given the best reason for insisting on the measuremient being included in the Tariff. I venture to say that we shall not have heard the last of the timber duties to-night. The settlement of this question will not be determined by the vote about to be given. This will be one of the first' items of the Tariff to be attacked. What we are about' to do will lead to a re-opening of the Tariff at the earliest possible date. I believe that Parliament has made a. mistake. . Honourable members seem determined to maintain that mistake, and, of course, numbers being all powerful, it is futile fo resist the inevitable.

Timber, viz. :Request - After sub-item (DD) insert :Note - The term "" super, face"" means the superficial measurement of those surfaces (except edges) of the timber actually dressed or partly dressed.",69
574,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Moreton) [11.12] This note refers to paragraph s of item 303. I should like to see some note inserted - to define the term "" super, face,"" but perhaps the Committee are not aware that the Customs Department are charging duty on all the dressed surfaces of the timber, and in this way the duty is increased in some instances to two or three times more than it was the intention of the Committee to charge. On a board like the one I hold in my hand, for instance, the Department measure the planed edges as well as the two planed sides. It was the intention of this Committee that a board like this, which is one foot square, should pay duty on one square foot. The amount now being charged by the Department on that board is i^-d - It was the intention of the Committee that the duty on it should be about hd. The rate in paragraph s is 2s. 6d. per 100 super, face, but under the departmental reading of the [397]- 3 NOES. term ""super, face,"" the duty runs to about 6s. per 100 super, feet. The Department say that the duty is not on the timber, but on the dressing.",70
575,Mr HUME COOK,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The honourable member is incorrect in stating that the Depart-, ment charge on .the six faces.",70
576,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"They do charge on the six faces. This board happens to be intended to be part of a butter-box, and the duty on that box was 7-Jd. Fuller, G. W.",70
577,Mr HUME COOK,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The Department charge only on two faces. PAIRS. Mr FISHEK - It can be dressed in. the Commonwealth, and the duty saved.",70
578,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"If it is the intention of the Committee to put a duty of 5s. per 100 super, feet on dressed timber, I have no objection; but if the Committee intended.the duty to be only 2s. 6d., and the Department interpret it to be 5s. 6d or 6s.",70
579,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"That is not correct. It was charged at first, but it has been altered.",70
580,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,That is the duty being collected at the present time.,70
581,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The duty is charged only on the two sides. Mr JosEr-H COOK - How long since?,70
582,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Since the 6th December last.,70
583,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Has the practice been altered since last week?,70
584,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,We have not charged on the edges since 6th December last.,70
585,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Will the Minister of Trade and Customs say that they have not charged on both sides?,70
586,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"I will not, because we do charge on both sides.",70
587,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"The Committee intended that the duty should apply only to one side of the timber. Super, face means the same as superficial measurement, and this board should measure up only 1 square foot. The Department say that it measures 2 square feet.",70
588,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,Is there no one in Queensland who can dress it?,70
589,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Undoubtedly , but did the Committee intend to make two pieces of timber out of one?",70
590,Mr MATHEWS,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,The Department charge for the two dressed sides.,70
591,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"They charge for the dressing on both sides. If the Committee think that 5s. per 100 super, face 'v a reasonable duty on dressed timber, I am quite prepared to vote with them, but I am not willing to vote for putting upon the work of the Committee an interpretation that the Committee never intended it to bear. I move That the requested amendment be modified to readNote - The term ""super, face"" means the superficial measurement of one surface - (except edges) of the timber actually dressed or partly dressed if being uncier i inch in thickness.",70

593,Mr SOLMON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"Laanecoorie) [11.19] The honourable member for Moreton seems the to have a grievance because duty is charged upon both sides of the dressed timber. I ask him to remember, as a good protectionist, that it is the desire of the majority of the ComThe mittee to protect the workmen - Australia against competition from outside. If a duty is to be imposed in respect of the dressing of timber on one side, honourable member for Moreton must see that we shall be only half protecting tralian workmen. Is it not a fact that one who wishes to use timber dressed on both sides, must pay for the work of same way as one board 1 inch thick. dressing it on both sides ? If the able member were a worker in timber, would 'he agree that those to whom he supplaned, plied timber dressed on both sides should pay for the dressing of it only on one side?",71

599,Mr SALMON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"When it dealt with the item previously, and passed the ' word "" super, face."" The honourable member for Moreton, who has dealt in timber, must be aware that the Department has adopted a trade practice in charging duty on every dressed surface.",71
600,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,He is thinking of butter-boxes.,71
601,Mr SINCLAIR,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,This does not affect butter-boxes.,71
602,Mr SALMON,ARRANGEMENT WITH LONDON,"It may bring some comto the honourable member's mind, to learn that the time is not far distant when timber will not be used for the manufacture of butter-boxes, because an Australian invention will make the use of timber for purpose unnecessary, by substituting for it a material, which can be produced in large quantities in Australia, and is one of the products of a primary industry.",71
