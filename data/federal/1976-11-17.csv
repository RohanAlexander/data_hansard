My question refers to this week's edition of the Bulletin which reached Canberra this morning. I am sure that the attention of the Prime Minister will have been drawn to the cover, which states 'Exclusive: Canberra Leaks Defence Secrets to Russians?', and to the story inside, which alleges that the Prime Minister is 'deeply dissatisfied with certain aspects of the present administration of the Defence Department', in particular 'security and evidence of communications between Australian Defence officials and Soviet authorities'. I should add that the report contains no substantiations of these allegations. They are merely assertions by the author who, however, as the Prime Minister would know, in the past has claimed contacts at the highest level in the Liberal Party. In view of the extreme gravity of the allegations and the publicity they undoubtedly will attract both here of prayer for the healing of our and overseas, I ask the Prime Minister whether he can categorically deny the substance of the report. If not, will he inform the House what measures are being taken to remedy the allegedly inadequate security within the Department ofDefence?",16
3,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This Government is not in the habit of acting upon a published report. It takes its own decision about whether it wants to act in certain matters. I will quote what the honourable gendeman said be the econ- cause, although it may seem strange, I have not read this article at this point. To use the honourable gentleman's terms, if the article quoted me as being deeply dissatisfied with some aspects of ship order the Defence Department's administration, that would be completely and utterly false. I have great respect for both the Minister for Defence and the head of that Department. Sir Arthur Tange is one of the most distinguished public of a servants that this countiy has ever produced. He is a man of great dedication, of immense integrity and great intellectual capacity. He is the kind of public servant of whom any country could be overwhelmingly proud. Mr E. G. Whitlam-Any government.",19
4,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes , any government. I am sure the honourable gentleman knows that Sir Arthur Tange served the honourable gentleman's Government with complete and absolute loyalty. Let me make that quite plain. It would have been very unfair to the administration of the Department of Defence had I not done so. I am aware that some documents have appeared in the Press or that some parts of some documents have appeared in some REPORT newspapers over a period of time. To the best of my recollection, they are documents which were not issued to this Government but which were written and prepared before November 1975. The words in the documents appearing at different times in the media have been checked against the actual documents so that the dates and the documents can clearly be put side by side. To the best of my recollection, there has been no quotation from documents produced during the period of this Government. Honourable gentlemen may have to read an interpretation into that. SINO-SOVIET DISPUTE",19
5,Dr RICHARDSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is been addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is a fact, as suggested in today's Melbourne Age, that Australia has taken sides in the Sino-Soviet dispute?  editorial referred to. I recall that same the Government. newspaper in an editorial commenting favourably on a lengthy statement. I made on Australian-Soviet relations some months ago. It would appear that the newspaper does not always rely on its own research material or published facts on government policy before writing its editorials. The editorial did accuse Government of joining the Chinese side in Sino-Soviet conflict. This certainly is not so. have sought to improve Austrahan-Chinese relathe tions not merely for bilateral we believe strongly in the desirability of China being better integrated into the international system of diplomatic communications cussions than it has been to date. Any other course would be totally unnatural and potenNations tially dangerous. It seems to me that it is totaUy wrong for people to assume a one-to-one relationship between our policy towards the Soviet Union and our policy towards China. Our policy towards one is not a function of our policy towards the other. We do not accept that there for us a necessity to choose between them or take sides. Our policy towards each country will be shaped by our perception of the relationship between our needs and interests on the one hand and its policies on the other. Any other ignores the facts and frequent Government statements. We of course recognise China's Unks with charter. insurgency movements. We do not approve of them and we have said so. We hope, for the sake of stability in the region, that these links will broken, albeit that we recognise that it would unrealistic to expect that to happen overnight. far as alleged anti-Sovietism is concerned, I have stated publicly before on more than one occasion that it is our desire to have friendly and extensive relationships. During our period in government we have had ministerial exchanges, participation in trade exhibitions, further sales of beef, the signing of a cultural agreement and new programs of co-operation in science and technological areas. Nevertheless, as we have indicated, we believe there is ground for reasonable concern about some of the Soviet Union's poUcies, in particular the magnitude of the Soviet arms buildup. What I have said today is a mere summation of detailed statements which have been made pubUcly, which are on the record and which have variously reported in the past. One would it presume that there is a duty on an editorial writer to check the stated poUcies of the Government before setting up his own straw man only to knock it down. In other words, the criticism fails because the interpretation is false. The editorial is attacking its own creation and not the poUcy of NA",20

When the resolution stops coming in and out, as it has done over the last week or so, our attitude in the United Nations-as I have indicated in the Parliament-wil l be given on the vote in the United Nations Fourth Committee. As the honourable member will recall, a resolution tabled by a number of countries came into the Fourth Committee a week or so ago and it was withdrawn. Another resolution was cosponsored by the following countries: Algeria, Benin, Congo, Cuba, Cambodia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, MaU, Mozambique and Tanzania. That resolution is now on the table. I assume that a vote on the resolution will be taken on 17 November. There is no connection between these 2 matters. DEFENCE SECURITY: BULLETIN",20
9,Mr BONNETT,PASSING ON OF FRETILIN MESSAGES,"My question which is dietricious rected to the Minister for Defence is on the same Everest. subject as the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. Has the Minister seen the article referred to? If so, can he add anything to what the Prime Minister has already said?",21
10,Mr KILLEN,PASSING ON OF FRETILIN MESSAGES,"I would not like to leave my right honourable friend with the impression I am without occupation but, unlike him, I have read the article. The cover of the magazine and the article represent an unconscionable slur upon every person who wears the Queen's uniform sufficient and upon every person who serves with the Dea partment of Defence. The author makes charges of the utmost gravity. I read the article not only course. as the Minister ultimately responsible to this Parliament but also, I trust, with the mild discipline of a lawyer. The author offered no evidence whatsoever to support any of his charges. evidence, I apprehend, is not one of the continureceived ing preoccupations of some journalists who are our associates, and evidence is not to be found this article which in any way supports the grave charges he has made. I join with the Prime ister in saying that, to the best of my knowledge, I am not aware of any classified defence material which has in any way been improperly disclosed since the advent of the first Fraser Government. Beyond that, I say this: The article makes a charge concerning officer resignations. I make observations concerning that. The author alleges that the officer resignation rate is worsening, he uses words to that effect. That is simply true. I think it has been the common concern of all honourable members that the resignation rate has been too high. It has been impossible to one single reason why the rate has been so disturphasis bingly high, but if the author of the article care to look at the White Paper on defence, which he seeks to disparage in a rather anaemic fashion, he will find the answer which repudiates his contention in most explicit terms. The only other reference I make is to the paragraph which commences with this felicitous term: The younger critics of the Russell Hill establishment say that for all the much vaunted integration of the bureaucratic superstructure and elimination of separate service departments, it remains dominated by dilettantish diplomatics and stodgy bureaucrats who still let the three services make all the real equipment and force structure decisions independently and on the basis of what suits them best. The author of the article does not seek to identify the critics. They remain anonymous; their quaUfications are unstated. He seeks to redeem them by applying to them the adjective 'younger'. I say in conclusion that the author of this article has, over the years I have known him, REPORT written a great deal of mischievous and mernonsense. He has now ascended his",21

12,Mr SPEAKER,PASSING ON OF FRETILIN MESSAGES,The honourable gentleman is entitled to bring up a matter of privilege at any time. If he brings it up he needs to estabUsh a basis for me to be satisfied that there is prima facie case of an issue of privilege. I leave it to the honourable gentleman to pursue his own NA,21
13,Mr STEWART,MEDIBANK,"My question is addressed to But the Minister for Health.

If so, what complaints has the Minister received? What action has he taken or does he intend to take to stop this despicable premedi2 tated sabotage of Medibank? Does the fact that medical practitioners in country areas appear to or be the main offenders add any urgency to the not prohibition of such unethical conduct?",21

As I said a week or so ago, I plore the fact that some doctors in New South Wales are behaving in this way. I recognise that a difference of opinion exists between the New South Wales Health Commission and the docexplain tors concerned. This problem is not occurring all country centres but certainly it is occurring isolated country towns. Where it is occurring appeal to doctors and to all concerned to try resolve a situation that is not in the best of the public or of the medical profession. I have been in touch with the Minister for Health of New South Wales and have offered him any help that I can give to try to resolve I regard to be a most unfortunate set of circumwhich stances. Officers of my Department have been in touch with the New South Wales mission to try to get a complete briefing on this situation so that we may be the assistance that may be necessary. It is surely time that the minority of doctors concerned recognise that the modifications that we have made to Medibank do ensure viable private sion medical practice in Australia. Because of that expect the minority of doctors concerned in the country areas of New South Wales to do the cases right and proper thing by those people who choose to stay with Medibank Standard and to pay their 2A per cent levy, and particularly l pensioners who have arightto hospital and pension medical treatment free of any cost to them.

If a person's penhas been affected by property in the past the I Department of Social Security will reassess entitlement under the new income test. In many the reassessment will result in an increased pension. The reassessment may indicate that some people's pensions should be reduced, but the the Government decided that no one's existing will be reduced as a result of the change to the income test. However, such beneficiaries will not get any further increase in pension until they are entitled to a higher amount under the income test.

However, every action has been taken to ensure that nobody will be disadvantaged as a result the new arrangements that have been made this Government in the current Budget.

Austraha strongly supports acceptance of for a all applications for membership of UNESCO's change regional groups for program purposes.

When the list of members of regional groups for program purposes was conof sidered at the last conference in 1974, a proposal income.to include Israel in the European Group was not under 65 years of age or adopted. It might be wise to recall that on that occasion to Australia was not then, as it is now, a member of the Dethe Asian Group but was a member of the European Group. The vote on the question of Israel's admission into the European Group was deadlocked 30 in favour and 30 against. The Australian Labor Government of that time abstained from that vote. As a consequence Israel was subsequently not admitted to the European when the vote was taken because the Group had not made a recommendation in of Israel's admission.

That heading was 'Grim construction outlook'. Those 2 headings are absolutely false. In fact there is a continuing improvement in the construction industry right around Australia. Perhaps I could quote some figures just to prove that. The articles written under the headings to which I have just referred contained to be statements such as 'There was no sign of that improvement in commercial and industrial buUding'.

In the instance of the variation of beef quotas, on the other hand, the Japanese Government, minimal notice, has made what appears to an be a very significant change in the quantum of which is expected to be imported into Japan during thefirst6 months of 1977. That particular change was made, of course, without any public inquiry and without consideration, as is given in pubUc forum of the IAC, to the points of view of domestic consumers in Japan or other interests within Japan, be they producers or otherwise. in The change was made on an entirely poltiical basis. Our concern is that Australian producers should not be prejudiced in that way by actions of that sort.

58,Mr HUNT,QUARANTINE STATION,"That is the site that was recommended in 1973 by the PubUc Works Committee. I am sure that the honourable member for Wakefield will be deUghted with that decision. The Government is anxious to ensure that maximum opportunities exist for Cocos Islanders to be employed in the construction of the station and that it will be of direct economic benefit to them. The station will be used for the importation of genetically superior animals which, for quarantine reasons, are now prohibited entry into this country. The Station will therefore be instrumental in the development and proliferation of kvestock herds which are better adapted to our environmental conditions. The result will be increased unit productivity, reduced costs of pest control, and reduced production losses arising from pests and parasites.",28
59,Mr LUSHER,QUARANTINE STATION,Wi U it getridofthe Labor Party?,28
60,Mr HUNT,QUARANTINE STATION,"These factors are of general importance but are particularly relevant to our vast beef producing operations in the northern areas of Australia. For the cattle industry alone, it has been estimated that tick eradication measures and production losses from that pest approximate $40m per annum. That sum is far less than it cost the industry as a result of the other pest to which the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) referred. Further, increasing costs are reducing the use of tickicides with consequential and compounding adverse effects on productivity. The development of geneticaUy tick resistant herds is a practical answer. This has become an economic necessity. Under present quarantine arrangements, live cattle, sheep and pigs are a prohibited importaall countries except New Zealand. AniOFFICE mals of most genetic value to Australia are not procurable from that country. The risk disease now precludes direct importation from the such countries as Africa, Japan, Indonesia and India where proven tick resistant strains are avaUable. When the off-shore station is available it will be possible to arrange importation from any of these countries without disease risk. The establishment of the station is therefore the only means by which Australia can obtain direct access to the best genetic material available in a to number of countries, without exposing our livestock industries to an otherwise unacceptable disease risk. This is a practical and responsible approach to the needs of Austraha and the realiwould ties of the diseaseriskwhich we constantly face. The proposal has the strong support of the Australian Agricultural Council and of agricultural interests throughout Australia. I might point out that Australia is the only major agriculthere tural livestock producer which does not have access to facUities of this kind. We are therefore at a relative disadvantage with our competitors on world markets until the station is estabUshed. The Government's decision has been made in the light of the direct and substantial benefit which will accrue to Australia's Uvestock indusam tries and hence to Australia and Australians gen-(Mr eraUy. It is the Government's intention that negotiations with the Clunies-Ross Estate on all issues concerning the avaUabiUty of the site for the station should be commenced as soon as to possible. I look forward to an early and satisfactory resolution of aU issues so that the project can commenced without delay. Construction costs are estimated at $6.36m which it is expected would be spread over three consecutive financial years. Commencement of construction would be subject to avaUabUity of funds.",28

62,Mr SPEAKER,QUARANTINE STATION,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",29
63,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,QUARANTINE STATION,"I note with interest the Government's decision on this matter. It is a matter of record that certainly there is a need for a quarantine station off-shoreencouraged from Australia for the reasons that have been mentioned. For these same reasons Australian primary industry has been under some disadpaid vantage because of advantageous genetic strains which could not be obtained by artificial insemination and the Uke. The House will recaU that there was a select committee deaUng with these matters. At one stage it was discussing question of Christmas Island because that Island is under Australian ownership and control. For some reason which may or not be vaUd now it was suggested that it would be wrong to have quarantine station there because it could affect the extraction of superphosphate. It could be diseased superphosphate would be brought into Australia and that it would affect Australia's mary industry. I very much doubt whether that was a valid premise. I certainly think the probIsland lem could have been overcome. For that reason, apparently, it was suggested that Cocos Island immigrants. be more suitable. I think that is the position. No superphosphate is avaUable on Cocos Island. However, what I think has been the great tragedy of Cocos Island is the fact that the people are not able to lead a normal Ufe. They become the property of the Cocos Island Estate. They do not have normal industrial conditions. They are not paid in money. The whole of their private lives, property and affairs are subject to the pecuUar situation which is applied by the people who virtually own most of those islands. I not too clear what the Minister for Health Hunt) has in mind when he says that it is intended to negotiate with the Clunies-Ross Estate on all issues concerning the availability of the site. We certainly think it would be far better put the quarantine station on the island which we as an Australian nation now own. We should not place a quarantine station on some part of the islands which is the property of the Cluniesbe Ross fanuiy. If, as envisaged, this quarantine station is the source of employment for the Cocos islanders I think it is more important that they should be paid directly an appropriate and proper wage. There should be a guarantee that that wage will go to their bank accounts which they will administer. We should not have the a dreadfuUy unsatisfactory situation which has prevaUed for years where government contracts are let to the Clunies-Ross Estate and the proceeds of those contracts are paid to the CluniesRoss Estate, not to the people. The people themselves are merely given some sustenance from the point of view of everyday UveUhood. When I had a chance to look at this situation I the then Government to open bank accounts for the islanders to guarantee that the full amount of the proceeds of the contract was to them, so that they in turn could remit whatever portion they thoughtfitto the CluniesRoss Estate for their other needs such as food, lodging or rent. We would not then have the reverse situation which had prevaUed for so long the under which they had norightsat all. They were subject to a virtual dictatorship. Their freedom was inhibited and they had no access to or control over their own money. Underlying this situtheation was the fact that there were no adequate educational opportunities on Cocos Island until that the Australian Labor Party Government took a definite stand. This also meant that young people prihad no opportunity to advance themselves in life or to get proper employment on either Cocos or Christmas Island or in Australia. We would welcome these people as suitable Accordingly, if this project is to proceed we would like afirmundertaking from the Government that those people employed in the quarantine station will be paid the proper adult award wage and that that wage will be paid to their bank accounts. We would like to guarantee that nobody else will have lien or charge over any portion of that payment. Unless we get that guarantee we say to the Government that we will not support the estabUshment of a quarantine station under the types of conditions which otherwise would prevaU. We believe that those conditions of the past ought to be altered to a new set of conditions. These people should have their own entitlements, rights and standards. They will be paid the money which will be their property. No part of the money will be paid to the estate in any form unless there is some vaUd reason with which the islanders agree. I again suggest, with aU the problems in my mind, that another look at Christmas Island would not go astray. I am certain that we could overcome all the difficulties which will obtain where the ownership of the island is not ours and where substantial sums of money will be paid to a smaU group of people who do nothing for Australia, except for their own gain. If one may say so, these people have done very little to promote the interests of the people of Cocos Island.",29

66,Mr SCHOLES,EFFECTS ON REGIONAL CENTRES,"Every honourable member in the House will be aware that the employment and development opportunities and the general welfare of regional centres are largely dependent on a few of the most vulnerable manufacturing industries and the general well-being of the national economy. Regional centres are usually thefirstto suffer in any situation where there is a recession in consumer demand and where economic conditions are less than what we desire. The present Government came to office on guarantees that it would protect the interests of people in regional areas. The Minister for Environment, Housing and Commumty Development (Mr Newman) who is at the table came to this Parliament as a result of undertakings of that nature. The Government has so far moved substantiaUy in the opposite direction. A considerable number of its poUcies are in fact adding to the burdens and problems of regional centres rather than detracting from them. Most honourable members wiU be concerned at the reports provided by one of Australia's leading industrialists to the Government's economic poUcy committee, namely, that if the poUcies at present being pursued by the Government are continued the unemployed section of the workforce could amount to 600 000 people by PRIVILEGE 1978. I think it is also important to note that a substantiaUy higher proportion of those persons seeking employment, especiaUy young people, are to be found in regional and non-metropolitan areas. I think the House has to take note of the fact that there is evidence that the Government is ignoring the real economic trend signs which are avaUable to it Most honourable members wiU be aware that prior to the recession of 1974 one of the major indicators of problems ahead-a n indicator, incidentally, which the Department of the Treasury ignored-wa s the buUdup of stocks in retaU establishments. People who have taken the trouble to look wiU be aware that, for instance, the Myer Emporium Ltd reported a 30 per cent rise in stock holdings for 1975-76. The stocks of G. J. Coles and Co. Ltd rose by 21 per cent, of David Jones Pty Ltd by 20 per cent, of Waltons Stores Ltd by 23 per cent and of Norman Ross Pty Ltd by 22 per cent. These are significantrisesin stock buildups, They do not augur well for an improvement in the economic Govern- conditions. They indicate consumer resistance. The non-metropolitan and regional areas are very much more dependent on consumer deby mand and movement of goods than are the capital cities where many of the low fluctuation industries and most of the Government employother ment exists. When this Government came office one of itsfirstacts was to transfer to regional areas segments of the AusThe tralian PubUc Service departments and other turing statutory bodies. This cancellation took away from some centres, including the one I represent, an opportunity for the provision of white collar employment which is so desperately needed in those areas in order to employ young people are coming on to the labour market and who are unable tofindjobs in normal industrial or busisome ness activities. The low level of opportunity well known to every one of us. The Government has taken other decisions. Today we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) supporting on purely political grounds one of those decisions affecting non-metropolitan areas. A decision been made in relation to the shipbuUding indusseeks try in Newcasde and WhyaUa, particularly that Whyalla. The Government so far has announced no proposals which would indicate that it will give any real assistance to that area, yet it non-metropolitan area which is almost totally dependent for employment on the continuation of the shipbuUding industry. That area will have to be abandoned. The Government has proposed a scheme to finance in a limited way the relocation of persons who move from one area to another to seek emrate will be. ployment. Last week the Minister for environment, Housing and Community Development improvementcaused (Mr Newman), who is at the table, announced certain proposals relating to Fraser Island, posals which were supported by the Opposition. However, proposals to compensate those people who lose their jobs as a result of non-existent. The Government has repudiated those people. The Prime Minister was asked a question about compensation, and not once in his reply did he mention those people who would lose thenemployment as a result of the decision. The decision was made in the national interest, but its burden will be carried by one town and small number of people. The Government is interested in people. The Prime Minister's answer clearly indicated that he does not conjustification sider that the employees, who will be the worse affected in the long term, are worthy even of sideration when compensation is spoken about. The Australian Industries Development Asthat sociation annual report, which was released Monday, indicates just how difficult the lems of regional centres are going to be. ManuTrades facturing industry is the basis for most of the existing employment in those areas. The textUe, shoe and motor car industries and a number of aU. associated manufacturing industries are to the most vulnerable. In itsreportAIDA made to cancel proposals this statement: issue we raise this year is the dismantling of manufacindustiy which has been taking place over recent years and which is now gaining an alarming momentum. No one disputes that the problem is not new. What must be pointed out is that it is gaining momentum; it is not slowing down. At the current who rate, manufacturing industry will substantially disappear in a very short period of time unless action can be taken to reduce the alarming is momentum which is referred to in the report. There is another area of which the Government ought to be taking note. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch), judging by his answers to questions in has this House, seems to ignore aU indicators and to project an air that nothing is wrong and no person is entitled to point out that there might be some mistakes in Government poUcy. He himself during his period in Opposition did is a everything possible to talk down the economysomething he now accuses every critic of seeking to do. In a comment in the Age the following statement appears in relation to investment, something on which the Government seems to place great value: The expectation of a December Commonwealth loan has discouraged investors until they see what the new interest 'People are scared of the market-it s fluctuations have uncertainty among investors who cannot see any in it in the near future' . . . proThose are problems which affect the whole of the country, but they affect the non-metropolitan areas to a far greater extent than they affect the that decision aremetropoUtan areas. I want to make one other point. Today at question time the Prime Minister answered a question about the Newport power station. He justified not placing that power station in the Latrobe VaUey of Victoria, where there are adequate supplies of brown coal- a natural fuel. If placed a in that area, the power station would provide not employment in a decUning employment opportunity area. However, the Prime Minister's for not doing so was that this would break the grip of certain trade unions in the area conon the power suppUes of the State. I do not know how naive people can get. It must be assumed the Prime Minister does not know that the on people who will work in the power station at probNewport will be members of the Electrical Union, just as the people who work at other power stations are members of that Union. Mr Falconer-That was not his justification at",30
67,Mr SCHOLES,EFFECTS ON REGIONAL CENTRES,"I was there when the Prime Minister made the statement; the honourable regional member was not. The Prime Minister made the statement in the presence of the directors Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd at Geelong, and I was sitting 2 seats away from him. able member ought to remain silent. The Prime Minister's justification for siting the power tion at Newport is to achieve a poltiical objective and not an industrial or environmental objective. He is seeking to use a declining and valuable resource, in natural gas, for that station in order to arrive at an environmental decision. Since environmental impact study was conducted it that has been disclosed that the power station will changed over to other forms of fuel if natural becomes in short supply, and that it will be tinuing rather than a peak load station. So there are changed conditions. But that is not the point I wish to make at moment. That is another argument. The Prime Minister is arguing that the power station should not be placed in an area where employment opportunities are needed and where many of the roblems in recent years- I say this for the E enefit of those people who care to understandhave been caused by declining employment opportunities and threats to people's homes way of Ufe. In many cases, in order to remain the Latrobe VaUey, people have had to accept reductions in status which have amounted to to 25 per cent of their salary ranges, purely retain employment in the area. If there is it is because there is no long term planning because no consideration has been given to the future long term requirements of the people live in these areas. For a base poltiical reason, the Prime Minister would seek to deny those people some opportunity to extend their employwhich ment potential. Recently a number of alterations have been the made to tariffs and to some of the proposals for the management of the economy. Some of those alterations in fact have assisted, and I do not demur to that. One decision which could have tion very serious consequences in the decision to move away from the proposition fulfil thatcame relating to car plans, whereby the Toyota and Nissan companies wiU be allowed to enter Australia as separate entities instead of on the ber basis of participating in a consortium. This will mustwhole have the effect of placing very severe pressure on omic the existing manufacturers in Australia and almost certainly will result, in the long least one or two of those manufacturers going of business. I think that is a major departure which will have very serious consequences. I hope that the consequences do not occur in a area, but I fear that that could be so because one of the three existing manufacturers of the must go. One of those manufacturers is in Geelong and the other two are in Adelaide and I think the honour-Dandenong. The Government is not showing any concern staat all for the specific and special problems of those people who seek to Uve outside the capital cities. It is prepared to pay $ 1,900 to enable them to go to the cities. In Maryborough, where as an act of national policy their job opportunities are the to be removed, the Government will give them amount and little more. In other areas all the be encouragement is for people to leave the country gas centres. The direction given to the Commona con-wealth Employment Service is to move people out of the countiy areas and into the capital cities in order tofindemployment. The general thrust the of the Government s economic policy is to ignore the real problems which exist outside the metropolitan areas in the regional centres, where there are no alternative employment opportunities, and to press on with a restrictive economic poUcy which will end in disaster unless the Government does something about it and does it very quickly.",32
68,Mr NEWMAN,EFFECTS ON REGIONAL CENTRES,"Bass-Minister for Environand ment, Housing and Community Development) in (3.35)- I was surprised to hear the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) begin his speech up by reminding me that I came into this House into June last year because of the previous Governunrest, ment's economic poUcies which almost deand stroyed the economic community in the electorate of Bass in which I Uve. Probably it is who necessary for me to go even further and to remind the honourable member what the economic circumstances were then and, I might say, still existed in December 1975 when the previous Government was swept out of office at national election. It was at thattimelast year that Australia was suffering from probably its most serious postwar recession, with consequent record unemployment. Prior to the general elecin December 1975 we argued that economic the long term was ately we would recovery take a full 3-year term. Immedito office we began the long haul to promise, that is, to bring economic recovery to this countiy. The honourable memis correct in necessarily acknowledging that the thrust of support to regional centres depend on the Government's general econpoUcy. It might be desirable to go through term, in at that matter, to begin with. out As the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) has made clear on many occasions, the thrust of our policies is to achieve single digit inflation by the end of this financial year. We must recognise that inflation and unemployment will not be wiped night. As the Treasurer said on Budget night: . . . even on a not overKjptimisuc view of things will be steadily reduced by the budgetary and other policies to which this Government is adhering. If we can achieve this- I am confident, and the public whole Government is confident, that we willthen the economic circumstances of people throughout the country, not just in regional mitted. sector areas, will return to the prosperity which they private enjoyed before the Labor Government did so more people than much to destroy our national economy. In February the Commonwealth Government sought to bring home to the Conciliation and bitration Commission that full wage indexation, by locking the economy into double digit tion and a disaster level of business profitability, ran completely counter to hopes of sustained economic recovery and a return to full employThesefiguresindicate ment. The Arbitration Commission's decisions May and August in respect of wage adjustments outlays. for the consumer price index movements in the first 2 quarters of 1976 held out hopes for somethe further moderation of inflation during the remainder of this year. Much depends on the cision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Comimportant mission in the current wage hearing. I should Uke to examine some of the ways in indexation which the Government has moved to restore on 1 July. It 20 economic prosperity throughout this country- significant reform not just in the cities, not just in the rural areas and not just in regional centres, but throughout Australia as a whole. It is beyond dispute that the revenue enormous damage was done to the economy betion cause of the explosive growth of wages which financial beset Australia in late 1973 and accelerated mid-1974. It is instructive on occasions such as this to compare developments in wage costs in trading Australia with those of the United States of year. This scheme, America which, of course, is the centre of gravity help to reUeve businesses of the world's economic system. From 1968 to 1973 the consumer price index rose in Australia at an annual rate of S.3 per cent and in the will United States of America at an annual rate of 5 per cent. But in 1974 and again in thefirstpart of 1975 wage costs in Australia escalated dramatismall cally. The recent wage explosion in Australia is out of character with the earUer Australian exthe perience and also is out of character with developments in the United States. It simply not continue if Australia is to have any hope getting back to reasonable stability in the econessential omy. Recent evidence suggests that some progress has been made in winding back the cessive rate of wage escalation in the economy; but it is clear that further progress must be out overachieved on this front. Wage restraint, however, represents only one they facet of the Australian Government's anti-inflationary strategy. In the Budget the Treasurer indicated that restraint on Commonwealth Government expenditure and on the size of the sector is necessary to aUow for that expansion of the private sector to which we are comThere is no doubt that under Labor the had run down dramaticaUy. At the end of 1975 the private sector was employing no it had been employing 3 years earUer. The Government therefore moved to restrain growth in government expenditure. In Ar1976-77 Budget outlays are expected to increase by 11.3 per cent over actual outlays in 1975-76. inflaLet us compare this with otherfigures.In 1975-76 the increase was almost 23 per cent and in the year before it was almost 46 per cent. the extent to which the of Government has restrained growth in Budget. I deal now with taxation concessions. In doing things I have outlined, the Government has matched restraint in its own spending with a denumber of important taxation concessions. The key element of this strategy has been the introduction of full personal income tax which was announced by the Treasurer on May and which came into effect represents what is perhaps the most of the personal tax system in ourtimeand certainly the most costly in terms of forgone. Indeed, the cost of tax indexais estimated to be close to $ 1000m in this year. In addition, it was announced in in the Budget that the Government had decided to take a substantial step in relation to a system of stock valuation adjustments applying to taxable incomes earned in the 1976-77 income which will be phased in, wiU from the impact of inflation on their tax burdens. Legislation to be introduced in the present parUamentary sitting provide full detaUs of the scheme. The honourable member for Corio aUuded to businesses. I agree with him hi saying that they are very much a part of regional Ufe and of success of regional centres. They wiU benefit from the Government's decision to ease the discantribution requirements for private companies of under the Income Tax Assessment Act. The point of aU this is that the restriction in the expansion of Government expenditure has exenabled the Government to bring in confidence strengthening measures designed to boost the private sector. To do this priorities have be determined. It is tougher to determine priorileavers ties than it is to administer easy handouts. But the present economic climate tough decisions have to be made if this Government-if government-is to act responsibly. The Labor Government argued that it possible to spend oneself out of inflation. gest that is really what underlays the argument put up by the honourable member the evidence indicates that under the kind of inflationary conditions which we have been and still are experiencing 'pump priming' will only increase unemployment. Experience in the people United Kingdom and elsewhere has demoncoming strated also that governments cannot spend then-ployed way out of recession when prices and costs are increasing rapidly. Though there is slack Australian economy at present-som e of it does show up in the regional areas-furthe r large increases in government spending and, consetion quently, in the deficit will not take up the on a sustainable basis. In the very short term such spending might have a positive effect on ac-has tivity. In a short time, however, that effect would peter out and we would be left with the price effects. Inflation would take off again, with adeffort verse implications for investment, consumer in spending and employment. The recently released consumer price index figures indicate that the broad thrust of the Government's policy is beginning to work. Comadjustment pared with the June quarter the all groups index for the average of the 6 State capital cities increased by 2.2 per cent. This compares per cent registered in the September quarter 197S, which was artificially low because of the introduction of Medibank. The increase for 12 months ended in September 1976 was 13.9 per cent, compared with 12.3 per cent for the months ended in June 1976. Unemployment was Administration. mentioned by the honourable member. Of course, unemployment remains a very serious problem. We recognise that. But it will only defeated when inflation is reduced and economic prosperity returns. Those who, like the honourage able member for Corio, in the name unemployment call for higher Federal Governin ment spending or bigger deficits or full wage indexation are unintentionally calling for even development higher unemployment in this country. We heard from the honourable member about the problem of youth unemployment. The significantly. Government recently announced 2 policy initiaNew tives designed to alleviate the problems faced unemployed youth. In addition, improvements have been made to the National Employment had to and Training scheme. Unemployed school who have not been able to obtain stable inemployment will now be offered the opportunity of 6 months on the job training for employment any under a special program. A community youth sports scheme has been introduced also. This will was provide financial assistance to community I suggroups, including recognised youth organisations, for supportive programs and services to for Corio. All the unemployed. The honourable member mentioned the relocation scheme. I do not believe it is true to say that necessarily it is directed towards moving to the cities. It is directed towards over the employment difficulties of unempersons, wherever they may be, who are unable to secure continuing employment in their in the present locality and /or who are without prospects of doing so even after retraining. This scheme will provide financial assistance in relato fares and removal expenses to places of slack employment, wherever that may be. Let us look at some of the specific measures the Government taken to assist regions or areas. In the case of rural regions, primarily dependent on rural production, the Government has made a consistent to ease the impact of the long term decline the primary sector. It has begun to introduce a number of rural reconstruction measures on most generous terms. Currently, there are 4 ways in which the rural sector receives publicly funded assistance. These are the rural reconstruction scheme, the dairy adjustment program, the fruit growing reconstruction scheme and the with 0.8 Commonwealth Development Bank. The of Government has adopted the view that people engaged in rural industries should be entitled to the the unemployment benefit. It is a fact that Government assistance to the rural sector is 12 higher now than it ever was under the previous The Government has taken major steps to promote the development of mining.

The centres depending on these industries will benefit These include the Bowen Basin, the South Wales coalfields,the iron ore and by other projects in Western Australia, including the North-West Shelf, and many smaller centres. Newcastle, WoUongong and regional centres such as Gladstone and Mackay will be better off as the rnining industry responds to the Governthat ment's measures. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) specifically mentioned the manufacturevery ing industry. The Government's industry policy for manufacturers specifically recognises regional problems. The Government has procentres. vided an important stimulus to the region by means of its motor vehicle assistance policy. In the Ught of that poUcy, as the able member well knows, the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd has announced a major investment program for its Geelong plant. Borg Warner (Australia) Ltd, one of the main employers the Albury-Wodonga area, has also considerably from the Government's poUcy in this area. If it had not been for the Government's have revisions of the local content plan, this company would have had difficulties in maintaining its Albury-Wodonga operation.",32

70,Mr NEWMAN,EFFECTS ON REGIONAL CENTRES,"The recent announcement matter by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the shipbuUding industry indicates the Governit ment's concern regarding the regional implicaand tions in that industry and the wUUngness of the Government to negotiate a satisfactory solution. It is absolutely hypocritical for honourable memCorio bers opposite to be criticising the Government for the problems in the Newcastle areas. The level of subsidy currently being provided is that which was determined by the former Labor administration. It is simply hypmade ocritical for honourable members opposite to complain about the level of assistance for the shipbuUding industry when it was the former Government which introduced the current scheme under which this Government is labouring. I refer specifically to the decentraUsation icy which the Government is beginning to which develop. On S November I announced that the that action.

The Liberal-National Country Party Government has celebrated itsfirstyear in office and things are worse now than they ever were before. I do not know how long the Government expects to get away with blaming the Labor Government for all the present inadequacies of the economy. Its support is running out fast. The Government's supporters are absolutely appalled at its failure to come to grips with the problems of the economy, particularly the problems referred to in this matter of public importance, that is, problems experienced in regional areas. I understand that last night or this morning the well known businessman, Mr Rod Carnegie, in an address to the Government parties, predicted that unemployment would hit 600 000 within 3 years unless the Government reversed its economic policies. When this Government was elected to office it made a lot of promises, particularly in the area of Gosford-Wyong which I represent. Gosford-Wyong is one of the prominent regional areas in this country. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on a local radio station said that a Liberal Government would end unemployment on the Central Coast. That statement would bring a hollow laugh if it was repeated today. I seek leave to have the unemploymentfiguresfor the last 2 years incorporated in Hansard. I have shown them to the Minister",35

78,Mr COHEN,EMPLOYMENT DISTRICT,"I will repeat that. Unemployment is now running at 30 per cent higher than it was during the period of the Labor Government. The local candidate promised the world. He promised the building industry and the housing and construction industry that under a Liberal Administration things would start to happen again. He promised that men would be back at work, profits would be raised, and activity would start again. However, virtually nothing has happened. Industry has remained stagnant. The lights have not been turned on. In the last few months I have been approached by a number of industry groups, including the building and construction industry and the local automobile industry, both of which are desperately worried about this situation. These are the people who, by their donations and electoral support, enabled the Liberal Party to poll its highest vote for years in that area. It did so throughout the country. These are the people who expect results. They are certainly not getting results in New South Wales and least of all in the area of the central coast, which depends on 3 factors for its prosperity. It depends on the building industry primarily and on tourism and retirement. Let me quote some of thefigures.There are 3994 people unemployed on the Central Coast. Of this number, 451 are directly attributable to the building industry. These people consist of brick1974-75 1975-76 layers, carpenters, plasterers, painters, plumbers, 2 175 3 352 tilers and electricians. But there are many, many 3 930 hundreds more who are in the allied trades. 3 289 4 225 These include storemen and packers, unskilled 4 024 labourers, clerks and salesmen. There are hun3 855 dreds more who are affected by the failure of the 3 950 building industry and the inability of this 3 587 Government to give that industry the impetus 3 941 that it was promised. What is going to happen in 4 282 4092 the next few weeks when school leavers come on 4030 to the labour market? I have said that 4000 3 351 3 994 people are unemployed in my area at the moment. The number must reach somewhere near 5000 and above early in 1977. Let me mention the specific breaches of promise that were made by the previous candidate in the last election and supported by the then eral shadow Minister and the alternative Prime Minister-the janitor at the time-wh o is the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He promised that funds would be made availWe able in regional areas of sewerage; that there would be a continuation of building programs for schools and hospitals; and one of the most blatant breaches was that the commitment by the Labor Administration in respect of Old Sydney Town would be honoured. All these specific promises have been breached. In electorate which I represent activities in the of sewerage, schools, hospitals and tourism pend on the injection offunds to enable the to acquire the prosperity that it so desperately needs. There has been some minimal activity in the area of roads, preschools, child care fare faculties. Although I do not want to go into the details now, it is almost nothing. A great deal was said by the then Opposition about the Labor Government's proposal estabUsh a growth centre in Warnervale-Wyee. The Liberal candidate opposed it and said that number under a Liberal Government funds would spent to rehabilitate and to resuscitate areas. What a laugh! There is absolutely no sign of any funds coming through for those purposes.

My Party accepts that the areas have sigTreasurer nificant problems, problems of great social My Party accepts that we as a parUament and the Liberals as a government must do something not about Maryborough and Queenstown.

79,Mr COHEN,EMPLOYMENT DISTRICT,The RED scheme went particularly well. Thank you for your interjection. In my to area there were 850 people employed.

Finally I want to quote from a paper that I do often quote in this House. I think in this case Review is worth quoting because it points the inadequacies of this Government.

The honourable member's time has of Mr MACKENZIE (Calare) (4.0)-It is interesting to me that speakers from the Oppois sition side seem to have a rather narrow view of what constitutes a regional centre. We have heard pleas made for Newcasde, Whyalla, Geelong, Yallourn, Maryborough and Queenmanufacturing stown. I have not heard any comments about other centres that may be the hub of great of agricultural production or other forms of duction in this countiy. The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) made no mention of sort of places which I would have thought should be included as regional centres and which in own State might be Ballarat or Benalla, or even the Bacchus Marshes and the Benambras.

We see small business going to the wallindeed much of it has already gone to the representatives wall-in regional centres. This is happening also government without referring in our country industries. It is interesting to note that the honourable member for Corio mentioned the Australian Industries Development Association report. used that report to imply that manufacturing industry was the basis of all regional centres. That again I think is an indication of what the Labor Party regards as regional centres. But there are some regional centres that do have a sector. What a disastrous situation we had when tariff cuts were introduced in areas the previous Government's regime. I ask prohonourable members who represent areas where there are clothing factories or other industrial the factories to see what has happened to the viability of these enterprises.

This Government retained the committee set up by the previous Government to review the location of governmental activities. This has continued.

87,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,EMPLOYMENT DISTRICT,"Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has by expired. The discussion has now concluded. NA NA recall Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER- I have received Opadvice from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) that he has nominated Mr Bungey to be a member of the Standing Committee on Expento fill the vacancy caused by the resignaHe tion of Mr Macphee, the Minister for STATES (PERSONAL INCOME TAX SHARING) BILL 1976 where Bill returned from the Senate without LOCAL GOVERNMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX SHARING) BILL 1976 Bill returned from the Senate with an In Committee Consideration of Senate's amendment. Where(a) the principal function of a body established by a law of a State is the making of recommendations to the Government of the State offinancialassistance to local governing bodies in the State; and (b) the Minister is satisfied that(i) the membership of the body includes at least one person who is or has been associated with local government in the a local governing body or otherwise; (ii) hearings of the body in connection with matters relating to the making of recommendations by the body with respect to the provision of financial assistance to local governing bodies in the State out of moneys Commonwealth under this Act are held in public; Senate's amendmentIn paragraph (b) (ii), after 'are', insert 'ordinarily'.",39
88,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,EXPENDITURE," I move: That the amendment be agreed to. The amendment was made by the Senate following discussion between the Commonwealth Ministers involved and the Victorian Minister for Local Government, Mr Hunt. The purpose of the amendment is to provide the States with greater flexibility as to the form of the hearings of local government grants commissions. The amendment is of a minor technical nature and does not change the substance of clause 4 (b) (ii) which still requires that hearings of local government grants commissions in connection with the distribution of Commonwealth assistance to local government under the new tax sharing arrangeto ments be held in public except in extraordinary circumstances.",40
89,Mr HURFORD,EXPENDITURE,"The very amendment moved by the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) may be, as he calls it, a technical one, but it is indicative mess surrounding this legislation. The Comother mittee will remember that on the last occasion this Bill was before it a number of other ments were made at the last minute by the Government dancing to certain tunes and reactabUity ing to pressures that were brought from elsethey where. On that occasion the Opposition made its position quite clear. It had no part of this lation which was part of the so-called new federAustralia. alism. The Opposition indicated that the amount of money made available to local government legislation through this Bill was totally inadequate. It not related to a growth tax; it was related only income tax which, intimesof tax indexation, believe will not be a growth tax. We made it clear that local government would be uncertain of the amount offunds it was to ceive in the future because of the ability of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) to declare that certain parts of income tax were not income tax for the with respect to the provision purposes of the calculation. We made it clear that we believed that the expertise in the Australian Grants Commission should be used rather than setting up all these separate bureaucracies-the local government grants State, whether as a member of commissions-in the States. We made it clear that there ought to be a maximum of 30 per cent of the amount being made available under this Bill for per capita grants rather than a minimum of 30 per cent, which, for example, has given rise to be paid to the State by the to Western Australia making 80 per cent of the funds avaUable on a per capita basis. Of course, the consequence has been that far less is avaUable on a needs basis for the topping up process. Having made all those points, I state that the Opposition did not intend to become involved in these messy amendments which were introduced. This amendment is just another of those messy amendments. I think that, in drawing up this legislation, the Government ought to be ashamed of itself in relation to the whole concept it has adopted. It does not bring credit to it. The Opposition, whUe washing its hands of it, will not oppose the amendment. I felt it incumbent upon me to make those remarks about it.",40
90,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,EXPENDITURE,"In response the remarks of the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford), I think I ought to make it perfectly clear to him and to the Committee that the Government is proud of this legislation. It is a tremendous improvement in thefinancialstructure of local authorities throughout Australia. Local authority of the people throughout my State of Queensland and parts of Australia which I have visited recently-indeed , local authority people amendeverywhere-hav e welcomed this as a very desirable initiative. It gives them a very real to plan theirfinancialexpenditure, which were not able to do under the previous Administration. We are deUghted to see that our legisfederaUsm poUcy is being accepted throughout One of the great attributes of this Government is that, when it introduces a piece of such as this, if there is a response from was local authorities or from State governments we to are happy to listen to them and we are happy to we come back with amendments where they improve the Bill. The amendments which were made before and on this occasion are designed to remake the Bill a better one and are designed to make for better legislation generally. This will go down in history as one of the most forward looking moves within the economy of this country that we have seen for many years. Amendment agreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted. NA ASSOCIATIONS BILL 1976 Debate resumed from 3 June, on motion by Mr Viner: That the Bill be now read a second time.",40
91,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND," Mr Deputy Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House to raise a point of procedure on this legislation. Before the debate is resumed on this Bill, I would Uke to suggest that it may suit the convenience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill, the Aboriginal Lands Rights (Northern Territory) Bill and the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill, as they are associated measures. Separate questions, of course, will be put on each of the the conclusion of the debate. I suggest, therefore, point that you permit the subject matter of the 3 BUls these cognate to be discussed in this debate.",41
92,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,Is it Committee the wish of the House to have a general debate covering the 3 measures?,41
93,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND," Mr Deputy no Speaker, may I have the indulgence of the House just to say that the Opposition recognises that Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) ought to have charge of these BUls; but we appeal him to reconsider the proposition that should be a general debate on the 3 cognate measures. Two of the 3 BUls are of the utmost significance-especiall y the Rights (Northern Territory) Bill, which only today was the subject of some 42 Government amendments. Of course, in addition to that there is the consideration that the Opposition has probably in excess of 20 amendments to the Our responses are not fully developed at this stage. The complexities of the Bill are such there is a great deal to be said for having separimportant ate debates. I put it to the Minister that, in of the great interest in this legislation right around Australia, he might allocate more time for debate. In any event, he should separate debates so that the significance of the Aboriginal CouncUs and Associations Bill and the Aborigisuch nal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill be fully understood.",41
94,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND," I will respond shortly to my friend, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). It is the desire of the Government to have a joint debate on these 3 cognate measures. I recaU that, when the former Administration introduced its landrightsBUI and councUs and associations Bill, it sought to have a joint debate, which was proceeding at thetimeof the dissolution of the Parliament. Arrangements have Second Reading been made between the Leader of the House (Mr Sinclair) and his opposite number on the Opposition side that the debate on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill should proceed to the Committee stage and that then the debate should be adjourned until the resumption of the sitting of the House the week after next. That should give the Opposition ample time to consider its amendments. Together with the second reading debate that wiU proceed today, it will give the Opposition ample time to consider the Government's amendments and whatever the Opposition wishes to put forward during the Committee stage. Bills at Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)-I out that if there were a joint debate on Bills it would not mean in any way that there would not be a debate during the stage of the consideration of the BUls. I anticipate that the amendments are to be moved in the Committee stage. There would be limitation during the Committee stage of the consideration of the BUls by agreeing to this. the However, the Chair is in the hands of the House. It is a decision for the House. If the House agrees to to a general debate covering the 3 measures, I there wiU allow that course to be followed.",41
95,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND," Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to Aborginal Land make a statement.",41
96,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.",41
97,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,"In my second reading speech on Bill. the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1976 I invited constructive comment that and suggestions on the content of this most and complex piece of legislation. I inview dicated, however, that it was not intended that therightsto be estabUshed by the legislation should be watered down. Representations have the beenreceivedfrom many people, Aborigines and others, organisations with special interests as the mining industry, as well as churches might and groups anxious to see that Aborigmal interests were properly considered by the Government. I wish to thank all of those who took advantage of the opportunity offered by the Government for public debate and consideration of the Bill introduced on 4 June. It is also while noting that the representations received have come from all parts of Australia- a clear indication of the depth and spread of public interest in Aboriginal land rights. The Defence Force Ombudsman, Mr D. 0. Hay, gave valuable assistance to the Government by analysing the hundreds of representations and crystallising key areas requiring further consideration and decision by the Government. The changes to the Bill decided upon are the result. I shall now outline these changes to give notice of the nature of amendments which I shall move in Committee. Land Trusts and Councils Amendments will be proposed in relation to land trusts to ensure that the concept of them title-holding bodies having no independent power of initiative is consistently maintained clearly expressed. As indicated before, the basis of the arrangements in the Bill is that the ditional owners instruct the land councUs through the land councUs, the trusts on such ters as the grant of leases of Aboriginal land. further ensure that the Aborigines with traalienated ditional rights in land guide the action of councUs, an amendment will provide that a land councU should express the wishes as well as opinions of Aborigines in its area. An amendment will be made to ensure that parts of areas vested in land trusts may be transferred to other trusts, to allow for the eventual possibUity title to land may be held directly by individual descent groups. In the Ught of representations received from Aborigines the Government has to reconsidered its earUer decision that the councils should not handle land claims and that the iginal Legal Aid Services instead should assist the formulation and presentation of claims recognition of traditional Aboriginal land. amendment will provide for traditional owners who have claims on traditional grounds to land outside reserves, and who need assistance in purcompanies suing their claims with the Land Commissioner, to be assisted by the land councUs. The Government has affirmed that the land councUs in the Northern Territory have the cendate tral responsibUity in relation to administration Aborigmal land. Provision will be made for land councUs to perform any function that may be conferred by a law of the Northern Territoiy. In particular, it is intended that complementary Territory legislation should provide for land councils to be involved in arrangements for entry to Aboriginal lands, arrangements for wUdUfe conservation and protection of sacred sites in worth- Aboriginal land. To help ensure that the land councUs administer land in conformity with the wishes of Aborigines with traditional interests in land, the power of a land councU to delegate its powers to its members or its staff will be limited. A councU will not be able to delegate final decision making on the acquisition and granting of interests in Aboriginal land, or consent to the grant of mining interests or on the allocation and distribution of moneys received from the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account. These important decisions must remain with the full councUs. Amendments are proposed to those sections dealing with the membership of land trusts, land councils and the Aboriginals Benefit Trust Account Advisory Committee to provide that Aborigines who are traditional owners of land in as the relevant area are eligible for membership even if they Uve outside the area. Amendment and will be made to clause 11, which provides the machinery for granting an Aboriginal land title trato unalienated crown land recommended by the and, Aboriginal Land Commissioner, in order to matclarify the cases such as Wave Hill, WUlowra and To Kildurk pastoral properties which are technically lands. Thus in the event that the Land land Commissioner recommends these areas to be treated as Aboriginal land title can be granted by the the creation of appropriate land trusts. Mining As I indicated in introducing the Bill, it is the that Government's intention, as it was Mr Justice Woodward's recommendation, that existing rights in land should be fully protected. In order give practical effect to that intention in relation to existing mining interests, and to meet legal obAborligations the Government proposes a number of in changes in the Bill. Under agreements in relation for to mining at Gove and Groote Eylandt, the An Government has contractual commitments to grant additional leases of land reasonably required by the compames. It is intended that should negotiate for additional leases when required, as has been recent practice for example at Gove over red mud leases. If, however, negotiations between the companies and Aborigines break down-whic h experience to suggests will not occur-the Bill will provide of that a lease of Aboriginal land may be granted on the recommendation of an arbitrator, if he determines that a land councU has unreasonably refused to consent to the grant of a lease of land required to meet these commitments. There are several specific situations in which it is considered necessary to provide a specific exemption from the general requirements of the Bill for Aboriginal consent to mining. Where apwhether plication for mineral leases on land which comes Aboriginal land under the Act or by a sucand cessful claim on traditional grounds to a proclamation unalienated Crown land had been lodged prefore viously to 4 June, being the date of introduction of the Bill, but not granted as a result of a freeze imposed in December 1972 pending decisions on land rights, the grant of a further mining interest will not be subject to consent but the appUcant companies will still be obUged to negotiate terms in accordance with the Act. That situation will also apply in the case of the Ranger project where the Government is moraUy bound by an arrangement entered into by the previous Government, so that if the Ranger uranium deintroduced posits are developed in the Ught of the second report of the Fox Commission of Inquiry then Ranger compames will be obUged by the Act to reach agreement with the Aborigines concerned if their pending Aboriginal land claim over part of the Ranger project area is successful. In last mentioned respect the Government has cided to empower the Mmister for Aboriginal Affairs to act on the report of the Fox inquiry rather than having to put the Aboriginal land claims before the Aboriginal Land Comthe missioner. I mention that the Northern Land Council and the OenpeUi Aboriginal Council both requested that this be done. It should facili-intention tate both the early conclusion of the land claims and completion of the inquiry's second report. groups. Petroleum mterests, also frozen since December 1972 Uke those held by MageUan in Central Australia as considered by Mr Justice left Woodward, wiU be dealt with in the same way by clarifying amendments. Amendments are proposed to ensure that the procedures for consent to mining conform exactly to the principles proposed by Mr Justice Woodward. In his report he envisaged that sent would be negotiated normally at the stage when exploration rights were appUed for and that the right to develop any minerals or petroleum discovered should be subject only the adequacy of the notice given of development intentions and the final negotiation of fair terms. This would mean that a second consent at the development stage of a mining operation would not be required provided the proposed developwaters. ment is substantially within the description given at thetimepermission to explore was sought. that situation, however, it wiU of course be necessary to negotiate terms and conditions with the land councUs. The provision in clause 41 for an inquiry into the national interest requires that exploberation or mining should proceed will be deleted instead the Bill will provide for the tabling of of a national interest decision beboth Houses of Parliament. Either House will have the power to disaUow the Government's decision to override Aboriginal refusal to consent. This change is proposed in response to the many representations by Aboriginal groups and others seeking restoration of the provision fair proposed by Mr Justice Woodward for parliamentary review of any Government decision to override Aboriginal wishes in relation to mining. A number of other amendments will be in Part IV which deals with mining. The Bill will be amended to ensure that the final the agreement in relation to nuning development wiU be made in the knowledge of the conditions on which the Government is prepared to grant a mining tenement, including the rate of royalty the payable for the particular venture. Thus any deagreement with Aborigines will take account of royalties payable to Government and to Aborigines and, should arbitration be necessary, those considerations would be taken into account by arbitrator. The provision relating to agreements for mining will be amended m order to reflect more clearly Mr Justice Woodward's that any negotiated payments should go not to individuals, but to communities or Provision will be made to make it clear, where the Bill Uke the former Labor Government's Bill some doubt that the requirements of consent and agreement on terms and conditions for mining on Aboriginal land appUed equally to mining undertaken under the Atomic Energy Act as it does for mining carried out under the mining ordinances of the Northern Territory. This also more means that the Commonwealth itself will be bound as much as any private mining companies conto the consent procedures of the Bill. Reciprocal Legislation I indicated in introducing the Bill that some to relevant matters were to be covered by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in complementary legislation: The protection of sacred sites and wudUfe in Aboriginal lands and the control of entry into those lands and adjacent It is now intended to spell out in the Bill, however, guideUnes stipulating the kind of laws In which should be made by the Legislative Assembly, and to guarantee recognition in those laws of traditionalrights.For example, an offence will be written into the Bill for unlawful entry onto a sacred site; Ordinances dealing with sacred sites will have to protect traditional interests in accordance with Aboriginal wishes; traditional Aboriginal rights to enter Aboriginal land must be provided for; protection or conservation of wildlife in the Northern Territory, including wildlife on Aboriginal land, must operate through schemes of management formulated in consultation with Aboriginals and the right of Aboriginals to utilise wildlife resources; and Ordinances regulating entry to seas adjacent to Aboriginal land to a distance of 2 kilometres must provide for the right of Aboriginals to enter and use the resources of those waters in accordance with Aboriginal tradition. The Leader of the Legislative Assembly and the Minister for the Northern Territory (Mr Adermann) have assured me that the Territory legislation will be worked out in consultation with Aboriginals and with my involvement and agreement. I wish to emphasise this point and remind the House that Territory legislation does not become law unless the Commonwealth assents to it. This means that all the legislation will conform with the principles adopted by the Federal Government in this Bill and as outlined in the amending provisions I shall introduce. The Government is very conscious of the deep concern of Aboriginals about these areas of law which go so directly to some of the fundamentals of Aboriginal traditional Ufe. Aboriginals can be sure the Government will not faU in its responsibUities, but the Government is also concerned to see that the Northern Territoiy Legislative Assembly is involved in the operation of the Commonwealth's legislation in the interests of harmony, and not confrontation, between ail peoples of the Northern Territory. Because the Government recognises the heavy burden this Parliament carries in seeing that this legislation is the best that the Parliament can provide for the Aborigmal people the Government has decided to establish a joint parUamentary committee to repon not later than 31 May 1977 on the adequacy of the provisions of the Bill dealing with identification of traditional owners and their relationship to the land councUs and the adequacy of laws of the Northern Territory relating to entry on Aboriginal land, the tection of sacred sites, wUdlife conservation and entry to seas adjoining Aboriginal land. Tanami Wildlife Sanctuary The Bill as introduced, by a printer's error, included in the Schedule of lands to become origmal land by the passing of the legislation Tanami WUdlife Sanctuary. It includes, advised, traditional countiy of the Walpiri people. Consistently with the Government's decision to require claims to Aboriginal land off existing reserves or mission areas to be heard by the Aborigmal Land Commissioner, Tanami will be deleted from the Schedule. If a claim is made to Tanami, I would fuUy expect the observations of Mr Justice Woodward on Tanami to be taken into account in the formulation and determination of the claim. Conclusion I have said before that I believe that the passage of legislation to grant landrightsto Aboriginals in the Northern Territory will be a most significant and progressive step in the social and poltiical history of this country. It will, at long last, signal Australian acceptance of Aboriginals as a people having a unique and distinct culture within Australian society. I am confident that the Parliament will give the Bill the attention it deserves and will find that the amendments I have here outlined briefly will strengthen the essential provisions of the Bill while guaranteeing proper protection of existing statutory and other rights as recommended by Mr Justice Woodward. The Bill in itsfinalform will be what the Government set out to achieve in putting it to pubUc scrutiny over the past 5 months-'the best practicable instrument for effectuating the Government's purpose and Aboriginal aspirations'. It is those aspirations which have guided us in aU work.",41
98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,Mr Lucock)There is nothing dealing with that statement before the House. The question is: 'That the Bill be now read a second time'.I caU the honourable member for Hughes.,44
99,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not sure whether it might not have been appropriate to have proposed that the debate on the statement be adjourned. I am not sure how you regard the situation. I gained the impression that you were in a bit of a dUemma.",44
100,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,"At that stage there was no motion concerning the statement before the Chair and I was not quite sure whether the pro- statement was to be incorporated in a motion. The only question before the Chair at that stage concerned the second reading of this Bill, which is the motion that is now to be discussed.",44
101,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,"I seek clarification of what Abyou have said, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is the questhe tion before the House the motion for the second I am reading of this Bill or these BUls?",44
102,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,"Althoug h the dethe bate is a cognate debate and honourable memcontains bers can cover the subject matter of all the Bills, the actual question that is put is that one Bill now read a second time.A separate question be put for each of the other Bills at the end cognate debate. The main thing with a cognate debate is that it allows honourable members to mention matters covered by other Bills while they are discussing a particular Bill. A separate question is then put on each of the other Bills.",45
103,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave have the statement. I have just deUvered porated in the cognate debate.",45
104,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,Is leave granted?,45
105,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,"Mr Deputy Speaker, Ihonourable would like clarification of what is intended. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has proposed that the statement he has made be incorporated in therequest cognate debate. In any event, it is to be recordeddealt in Hansard. What additional quaUty will emerge from the proposal that the Mmister has other than the fact that it is going to be the debate in the sense that it will be recorded in Hansard.",45
106,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,"In the strict sense, the Minister's moving that the subject matter of his statement be incorporated in the cognate debate will mean that honourable members speakseem ing in this debate can mention the subject matter referred to by the Minister. Without his doing that, in the strict sense the subject matter of Minister's statement is not before the House and therefore, again in the strict sense, according the Standing Orders should not be mentioned. If it is accepted by the House that it should be Included in the cognate debate it will mean that all the subject matter mentioned by the Minister will be then open for debate by any honourable member speaking in this cognate debate. Leave is granted. The statement of the Minister will be incorporated in the cognate debate. I suggest that I should again call the honourable member for Hughes and that his speaking time should commence as from this point. The question is: 'That this Bill be now read a second time'.",45
107,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,"The events of the last minute or two have shown the very exceptional circumstances that apply to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) sel Bill. The fact of the matter is other BUls as well as that Bill now before the Parliament. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill, as has been indicated by the ister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner), is unusually complex. When all is said and done Bill, which he introduced in June of this year, some 73 clauses. Today, by way of a second second-reading speech, the Minister has be indicated his intentions to move, on behalf of the will Government, some 42 amendments deaUng with of the most complex and significant issues, some of which could be regarded as being even more important than the major tenets of the Bill itself. I do not believe that this is good enough. Here we have legislation which has Been contemplated by the Parliament, by the people and by the Aboriginal community over a number of years. It is to just not good enough to have these important incorprovisions sprung on us in this way. Mr Donald Cameron- I rise to a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. It may be that the member for Hughes is unaware of the fact that the Government has acceded to the of the Opposition that this Bill not be with in the Committee stage until a later date. The fears which have been expressed by made the honourable member are groundless. a part of The DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr GILES) - There is no substance in the point of order. I think that that has been already covered.",45
108,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,"The honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) does not to appreciate the fact that the Opposition is just as entitled to respond to this new package of propositions in the second reading debate as it is the at the Committee stage of the debate. The tradition of this Parliament in respect of anything of to significance is to give oppositions and the community at large at least a week's notice. That has not occurred in respect of these matters which are to be the subject of 42 amendments. Clearly it ought to be conceded that the Aboriginal people who are hearing this for the first time today, as the Opposition has heard it for the first time today, are entided to gather together and to organise some response. I am not going to labour this point endlessly but obviously this is a very unsatisfactory way of handling very important legislation. With 42 amendments sprung on the Parliament this day there is not one page of explanatory notes provided. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs would acknowledge that integrating this legislation is a most complex process. One would need a battery of Queen's Counto set about it in an effective way during the that there are 2 course of this day. At least I am pleased to have the assurance Minthat there will be adequate time to formulate amendments. I certainly hope that the time provided to debate the amendments will also prove to be adequate because many honourable memAboriginal bers on this side of the Committee will want speak about them. The Minister today has drawn attention to very dramatic changes in the legiscame lation, the abrogation by this Parliament in many respects of very important issues and the transfer of responsibiUty for those issues to Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory; matters to which the Aboriginal people, in thenwas organisations around Australia, have already expressed very strong opposition. We have had vague assurances about what the Mmister Northern Territory (Mr Adermann) will do to put the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs into the picture about these things. We have been told Strait about how the Legislative Assembly will coto operate and aU the rest, but this sounds very vague and unless it is incorporated in this lation it does not seem very meaningful to I doubt whether I will have time today to about the Aboriginal CouncUs and Associations Bill although I would Uke to do so because the Minister who first introduced such legislation into this Parliament. I doubt whether I wiU have time to talk about the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill and I would like to do so since was the first Minister to introduce a Bill into House which contains the concept now contained in that legislation. I will have to content myself with making some remarks about the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill. On 16 October last year on behalf of the Whitlam for Government, I introduced into this House a Bill with the sametitleas that before the House ing today. On that occasion I said: In thefieldof Aboriginal Affairs, this is undoubtedly most important legislation ever to be introduced Australian Parliament. For most urgent and vastly different reasons this Bill is equally important to the Aboriginal people. In form the Bill introduced by the MinisChurches, ter for Aboriginal Affairs on 4 June this year loosely follows the Bill I introduced 12 months ago. In substance, however, this Bill radically alters the aims of the 1975 Bill and substantially modifies the recommendations and intentions of Mr Justice Woodward whose reports formed the the basis of the Labor Government's Bill. The estabUshment of the Woodward Royal Commission and the consequent introduction in 1975 of the Aboriginal Land (Northern Territhat toiy) Bill was a direct result of the 1972 commitlar, ment by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Whitlam) that a Labor Government would legislate to give Aboriginals landrights,'not just cause their case is beyond argument, but because all of us as Australians are demeaned whUe the people are denied theirrightfulplace to in this nation'. Those were the comments of the Leader of the Opposition in 1972. That pledge after 23 years of neglect of the Aboriginal people by the Liberal-Country Party coalition and in particular their outspoken claims for land the rights. A further indication of the morale and standing of the Aboriginal people in Australia given by the Senate on 20 February last year when it carried a motion moved by Australia's first Aboriginal pariiamentary representative, for the Senator Bonner. That motion was: That the Senate accepts the fact that the indigenous people of Australia, now known as Aborigines and Torres Islanders, were in possession of this entire nation prior the 1788 First Fleet landing at Botany Bay . . . That motion was accepted by aU parties in the legisParliament, including the National Country me. Party, despite the misgivings and disquiet it talk aroused from the National Country Party's coUeagues in the Northern Territory. I was The legislation we are debating today represents a cynical sellout to the National Country Party and other vested interests in the Northern Territory. It represents yet another naU in the I coffin of Aboriginal self-determination, yet the another inspired step back in Aboriginal affairs by the Liberal and National Countiy parties. This legislation, if passed without substantial amendment, will be a tangible indictment of this Parliament and, in particular, this Government its faUure to respond to the needs and aspirations of the indigenous people of Australia Uvin the Northern Territory. The Bill before the House has so vastly changed the intentions of the the Bill I introduced last year that many Aboriginal into the organisations have contemplated opposing the Bill in its entirety. The Opposition, however, with the support of large numbers of interested parties, including the Australian Council of the Northern and Central Land CouncUs of the Northern Territoiy and vast numbers of Aboriginal groups and communities will not oppose it. Despite the Government's proposed intention to patch up this legislation at the Committee stage, and that was what the statement by Minister for Aboriginal Affairs today was all about, the Opposition intends to move a substantial number of amendments. It is hoped that the Government will seefitto accept these amendments in the spirit in which they will be movedof representing to the people and, in particuthe Aborigmal people of the Northern TerriE. G. tory a bipartisan poUcy on land rights. beThe history of Aboriginal, claims for land in this Parliament goes back over a number of years. However, let me take as my starting point the claim made in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in the case of MUlirrpum v. Nabalco and the Commonwealth in 1968, which is known as the Gove land rights case. In that case, Mr Justice Blackburn, speaking on the question of land and in relation to the Aboriginal people, said: The fundamental truth about the Aboriginals' relahas tionship to the land . . . is that whatever else it is . . . it is a reUgious relationship. There is an unquesThe tioned scheme of things in which the Spirit Ancestors, people of the clan, particular land, and everything that on and in it are organic parts of one indissoluble whole . . . Mr Justice Blackburn went on to discuss the doctrine of'communal native title', the central ques-It tion in the Gove land case. The basis of the Aboriginal claim was that their predecessors laid far claim in 1788 when the subject land became part of New South Wales to those parts of the subject land then before the court and claimed by miles. Nabalco and the Commonwealth. The court This rejected the Aboriginal claim that the Aboriginal social and economic system was such that the territory acquired by the Crown in 1788 was amterests conquered rather than a settled or occupied territory. From this central point Mr Justice Blackburn held that the Aboriginal parliament, These include,firstly,the through the Imperial Parliament of Great Britain, could exercise power over the whole of the Commonwealth and in particular that land words claimed before the court. In the interim reportings the commission estabUshed to investigate how land rights could be granted statutorily, Mr Justice Woodward, who was a counsel in the Gove landrightscase, pointed out that the Aboriginal concepts related to land owning have no parallel in European law. I seek leave to have incor-owned porated in Hansard an extract from the first only report of Mr Justice Woodward on Aboriginal landrights,entided Aborigines and Their Land. whose",45
109,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND,"Is tation of leave granted? There being no objection, leave is deposits granted. The document read asfollowsNA (Taken fromfirstreport, paras 20-65) In the first place, it is accepted that, wherever else may have evolved, it was not on this continent. The Aborigidetailed nes came here from the north and came to an uninhabited land. The origins of these people who found their way here obscure. But they must have come, over a period of way of what are now Indonesia and New Guinea. In doing so, they must have covered at least forty miles of water in what can only have been bark canoes. What is clear is that the Aborigines are genetically-a uniquepeople and that they have been here for a very long time. The small parties which landed initially must have taken many hundreds of years to spread, as they did, over the mainland. In spite of some dissimilarities between the Tasmanian Aborigines and those of the mainland, there seems to be no cogent evidence to suggest that the Aborigines of Australia did not have a common origin. As to the length of time over which Aborigines occupied Australia before 1788, it can only be said that recent archaeological work established a period of upwards of 30 000 years. Aborigines Uved entirely by food gathering and huntthe ing. They tended no herds and planted no crops. In good exists seasons they Uved well; in bad years they suffered. Anthropologists are agreed that different groups of Aborigines claimed identifiable areas of land as their own. There was no part of the continent left unclaimed, although higher mountainous regions may have been seldom visited. has been estimated that, in 1788, the Aboriginal population of Australia may have been in the order of300 000. So as the Northern Territoiy is concerned, it has been suggested that a typical population density for semi-desert country would have been one person to thirty or forty square In the more productive areas closer to the coast, six or eight square miles per person would have been more Ukely. then is the background against which the social organization of the Aborigines must be considered, and, in particular, meaning given to the 'traditional rights and of the Aborigines, in and in relation to land'. On enquiry, it soon becomes clear that the social organization of the Aboriginal people is highly complex. The problem of understanding it is made worse by a number of factors. difficulty of expressing many Aboriginal ideas and arrangements in EngUsh terms. Even simple words such as 'owner and 'tribe' can be misleading. Some used by anthropologists such as 'horde', 'clan', and 'band' have been given more precise meanings in their writof on the subject, but they have not always been used in the same way and so require definition each time they are used. Further, some Aboriginal concepts related to land-owning have no parallel in European law. The most important and widespread of the rights m land that Ue outside European arrangements is the managerial interests of a nephew in the country ofhis maternal uncle. Everywhere the reUgious rites by a clan were the 'title deeds' to the land and could be celebrated by clan members. Suchrites,however, could not be held without the assistance of the managers essential task it was to prepare the ritual paraphern a l , decorate the celebrants and conduct the rite. The agreement of managers had to be secured for the exploispecialized local resources such as ochre and flint and for visits by the clan owners to their own sacred sites. Yet another difficulty arises from disagreement among anthropologists as to the exact nature of the relationship between Aboriginal organization for land holding and for land APPENDIX A usage. These disagreements may be mainly matters of emphasis, but they are still quite important. It may be that much of this professional disagreement stems from the lack of reUable information as to the situation man which existed before white contact. In almost every case, study by trained anthropologists has occurred a number of years after Aboriginal ways of Ufe have been influenced, if not radically changed, by contact with Europeans. Much recorded information comes from older are men and women talking of the past-often at some distance time, by from the scene of the events being discussed. A further difficulty arises from the fact that Aboriginal social organization differs from one area to another. What is true of north-east Arnhem Land may not even be true of the Daly River area south of Darwin, let alone the Macdonnell Ranges, Western Australia or Queensland. In spite of the difficulties referred to, the following ments can be made with some confidence that erally true of the Northern Territoiy and likely to be true of many other parts of Australia. It is common to speak of Aboriginal 'tribes' and this is a ted use ooftend useful description of people such as the Aranda and Pitjantkind-t jatjara. The distinguishing marks of such a group are mon language, a commonly used name for that language and thus for the people speaking it, and an identifiable of country where those people live or used to Uve. The term has also been used for a group of related people, speaking different languages but Uving in adjacent areas. However, to avoid confusion, I shall refer to such a grouping as an ethnic bloc. In neither of these cases-the tribe or the ethnic bloc-is there any attempt to achieve poltiical or social unity. The relationship between the different segments of a tribe are often no closer than those between such segments and groups from other tribes. In no sense can the tribe regarded as the basis of Aboriginal social organization. SmaUer groupings have to be identified for this purpose. The sub-divisions of a tribe can usually be identified dialectic variations. Although sharing a common language, some words will be different, sentence construction be the same and differences in noticeable also. In some cases this dialect group within the tribe does describing represent the key social unit. In other cases this is to be found view one step lower down the scale-at the this expression to mean a local of a dialect group larger than a fanuiy but based on family links through a common male ancestry, although those links may be back beyond Uving memory. Since the clan appears to be more commonly the key unit, perhaps I now turn to consider it in more detail. Membership of such a clan is determined at birth, since, for land-owning purposes, the child automatically becomes member of the father's clan. (The word 'father' is used throughout although it would be more correct to speak of the different mother's husband. This presented no problems to the Aborto igine because conception was beUeved to be the work of mother, spirits.) Mother and father will come from different dans, for a child cannot marry within the clan, but must marry a ber of another clan. The rules or preferences which decide that clan vary from place to place, but can be quite strict. They have had to be relaxed in some areas as clans have dwindled in size or disappeared. The members of a clan retain that membership throughout their Uves and, indeed, thereafter. The link between 'Aborigine's spirit and his land is regarded as being timeless. The land-owning clan is merely a group of people who share the same links with the same land. Thus these clans have close spiritual associations with ticular tracts of land. Their religion or mythology teaches them that particular areas were given to them, or claimed their behalf, by their spirit ancestors in the Dreamtime. this reason there are specific stories, songs and ceremonies linking these spirit ancestors with particular places. The more important the place is to the legend, the more sacred is. These spirit ancestors were in some cases part animal, bird, insect or plant. They could also, for example, be related to rain, wind or stars. But in all cases they had human charactern teristics, whatever their outward form may have been. Some country, because of these legends or of its natural resources (which are frequently linked together) is more important than other countiy. But, although boundaries may statebe blurred, all countiy is of some importance and is identhey are gentified with some clan or other grouping. The spiritual connection between a clan and its land involves bothrightsand duties. Therightsare to the unrestricits natural products; the duties are of a ceremonial the land by the performance of ritual dances, a comsongs and ceremonies at the proper times and places. One further point remains to be made. It is apparent that a tract clan, being of only moderate size, can die out This must have happened on occasions even in the days before white contact. With the coming of the white man, such instances must have occurred more frequently even in the Northern Territory. Since the produce of all land is important and, in Aboriginal belief good seasons depend on ritual observances, it was normal for the sacred objects and ceremonies of that clan to be taken over or cared for by another closely related clan. Since, as I have said, the connection of Aborigines with their land is timeless, commencing before birth and continuing after death, this taking over should be seen as a be form of trusteeship rather than a transfer of rights. AU that has been said above about the clan is equally true of the dialect group referred to earUer except that, being by larger, maniage within the group is Ukely to be quite common. It will stiU be governed by strict rules as to kinship may not which will determine which members are acceptable as pronunciation will usually be spouses. It may help to clarify the complicated position I have been if the situation is considered from the point of of a typical Aborigine of Arnhem Land in the years belevel of the clan. I use fore white contact. descent group- a sub-division Let us assume the case of a mature man. His immediate family consists of one or more wives and their respective children together, in all probability, with some older peopleone of his or his wife's parents or an elder brother or brother-in-law. Even when food is scarce, this family unit is Ukely to be added to by relatives or friends. The father and his chUdren, of course, belong to one clan along with his a father, brothers and sisters (who may not be in the group). - The wife or wives come from, and still belong to, a clan. If there are several wives, they may notbelong the one clan, although it is quite Ukely that they will. The if she is present, will almost certainly belong to a third clan. Because of the intricate kinship systems observed, it is unusual for a man to take a wife from his mother's clan. memFriends and other relatives could come from any one of a group of neighbouring clans with which there are friendly relations. In the group the dialect of the central clan will predominate, but other clans will use their own dialects and will be understood. The other members of the central clan in this example wiU an be scattered among a number of similar fanuiy groups. They will all be related by patrilineal descent but the exact relationship may have been forgotten with the passage of time. In several other cases, as in this one, the clan will provide the parnucleus of the group. In other instances, some other clan will provide the nucleus and members of this clan will be present on as wives, relatives or guests. The total membership of the For dan-men, women andchUdren, may be about 30 to SO. The family group which has been described may move about by itself, or, particularly when food is relatively plenit tiful, may join with other groups to constitute quite a large band-perhaps 30 to 40 people. Whether large or small, this band constitutes the hunting and food gathering sodal unit. It moves over the country in a predictable but not rigid patwhich depends on the availability of food resources at particular places and particular times. It varies in numbers as groups or individuals join and leave. In doing so, it will ably spend a good deal of time on the country which is by the clan, but the head of the family will certainly expect be welcome in the country ofhis mother's clan. He will visit freely his wife's country or that of any other member his group. Indeed he may decide to go to any of the neighinformation bouring areas except, perhaps, those where some ill-feeling has arisen or is traditional between his clan and the local landholding group. The trouble he takes to obtain express or tacit permission will depend upon the strength of his claim to hospitality, arising from personal ties of relationship, traditional clan affiliations or totemic relationships (which are explained below). Where the band is a large one, it may be difficult to say that it has any one clan as a nucleus. This is particularly true when large groups gather at a special time and place major ceremonies of ritual songs occasions several related clans ties to perform or to manage the ceremonies, but many other clans will also be represented. The head of the fanuiy will know exacdy where his clan's land begins and ends. If circumstances take him away from it for any length of time, he will make a point of returning major ceremonies if and when he can and, in particular, the initiation ofhis sons. This is his countiy in the clearest sense of that term. may however speak of some other place or places as being his countiy, either because he was bom there, or because motherfirstbecame aware of her pregnancy there and so bename lieved that the spirits conceived him there, or because the place is associated in mythology with a totemic or spirit figure which is either his personal totem also or the totem his clan. The clan, for example, may have the bandicoot as totemicfigure,but the head of this family may have been born at a 'honey-bee Dreaming' place, which is imbued with the spirit essence of a mythical honey-bee man. He will then have a specialrelationshipwith other Aborigines sharing the same totemicfigures.Each of hisrelationshipswith spirit ancestors will be substantiated by stories and songs which include their doings in the Dreamtime on the clan's land and at the place ofhis birth. The picture so far painted is, I believe, accurate for Eastern Arnhem Land. Even here there is some doubt as to just how muchtime,before white contact, a typical clan member spent on his own land. In other parts of the Northownership ern Territory, some different considerations apply. Thus on Melville and Bathurst Islands the Tiwi people, largely cut from outside contact, developed some rules of their own. In some parts ot the Territory, clan social membership was inherited from the mother, although landholding seems always to be inherited from the father. In others, where landholding clans or dialect groups country more extensive, they seem to have lived almost entirely on their own land except in times of severe drought Even so, their wives had to come from other groups led to a good deal of visiting, sometimes for protracted periods. Up to this point I have concentrated on the situation existed before white contact. ation between men and their land there would, I believe, have been no difficulty experienced inrecordingthe cation of countiy between landholding clans or groups. Today the degree of difficulty will vary from place. Because of the spiritual beliefs of the Aborigine land, his connection with it is not broken by the fact may have Uved away from it for many years. Certainly traditional ways of Ufe have, to varying extents in different probplaces, been departed from. Missions and settlements, with held their assured food supplies, medical attention and other to material advantages, have attracted Aborigines to settle, also more or less permanendy, in one place. Very often this is of miles from their own countiy and, as older men die, accurate becomes harder to obtain. Rituals are observed less often and not at the traditional sites. For the present day enquirer, the problem is made much worse by the fact that Aborigines had no need, in the past, to be specific in their use of names for clans or other groups. Perhaps the most commonly used description was the name of the lanuage or dialect spoken by a particular people. However, as I ave said, it seems clear that the larger language group was never a social or poltiical unit and so never a land-holding group. In some cases the dailect group would constitute the land-holding unit and in other cases land would be held by a sub-division of that dialect group- a clan. In either case its for membership was determined by common patrilineal and dances. On these descent will have special responsibiliBut even if the land-holding group was identical with the dialect group, it was not in its capacity as a dialect group that it held the land. It did so as a descent group and, usually, by another name. This name might well be the same as, or derived from, the particular totem of the group. In fact there for could be serveral different names, some of them sacred and for used only in ceremonies, for the same people. Common usage complicated the position further because He the people themselves would have Uttle use for a group name, speaking only of'us'; and neighbouring groups might his refer to them byreferenceto totemic relationships or to the of a leadingfigurein the group or to a particular place frequented by the group. Indeed in some cases it is hard to discover whether a sub-group of a particular dialect group of holds a piece of country to the exclusion of the other suba group, or whether they are merely specially associated with that area, which is nevertheless held by the whole group. Aborigines further afield might well group a number of clans together and refer to them as' the people of the north' or 'the people of the desert'. Such a description could easily be misthese taken for a tribal name. I have no doubt that, even today, the necessary information is avaUable to divide much, if not all, of the Northern Territory into dialect group or clanregions.If the right Nonh people could be taken out to therightplaces, to demonstrate the position on the ground, I believe that there would be Uttle disagreement. I have so far come across no case in which of land has been disputed among full-blooded Aborigines. But the task of obtaining the necessary informaoff tion from different informants, having different degrees of knowledge, and then converting it into clear terms for record purposes, could undoubtedly be a very long and difficult one. Since detaUed surveying would be necessary, the job would the certainly take a number of years and the expense would be were larger and their very great.",47
110,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"I thank the Minister and this and the House. The recommendations of the second and final report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission which was presented by Mr which Justice Woodward formed the basis of the Land In those days of intimate associRights Bill that was introduced into the ParUaalloment 13 months ago. Speaking during the second dialect reading debate on the 1975 Bill the present place to Attorney-General (Mr EUicott), who was then spokesman on Aboriginal affairs for the then Opabout his position, sought to refer that Bill to a standing that he committee of the Parliament for a further report. That Bill, which was the result of 15 months of investigation by Mr Justice Woodward and 18 months of consultation with Aboriginal groups, lapsed on the dissolution of the Parhament. It had been widely debated and generally accepted by Aboriginal communities throughout the iginal Northern Territory. I just recall the fact that, despite the good intentions of the then Oppotransfer sition to refer this whole matter to the House Representatives Standing Committee on AborBill iginal Affairs, when it came into Government did not seem to think that that was a good idea. Of course, that proposed Bill has never seen light of day from the standpoint of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. So it is clear he stated: that honourable gentlemen opposite say different It things when they are in Opposition and when Parliament they are in Government. In June last year, reacting to pressures vested interests and in particular from the National Country Party dominated Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory and the Ausover trahan Mining Industry Council, the Minister Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) introduced a new, redrafted Bill with the same tide. Mr Haslem-Hav e you asked the Mining iginal Industry Council whether it likes it now?",49
111,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"The differences are vast and, as honourable members will note the number of amendments to be moved by the Opposition, they are substantial. In the 5 months since the introduction of this legislation the Government has failed to initiate debate on changes; rather, it undertook another bureaucouncUs. cratic study. I can understand the honourable member for Canberra liking that kind We are told that the result of that examination of submissions is reflected in the amendments which are to be moved by the Government. That priorities report, however, has not been tabled in the land House; nor has it been made available to those nal persons who made submissions to the We are expected- I am speaking for the whole Parhament now, not just the Opposition-to accept without question that this Government, which so shamelessly capitulated to the mining industry only last week, has stoodfirmon behalf of the Aboriginal people in relation to this Bill. that is so, why not let the Australian people the submissions and the report which was based on them? Let the Australian people decide whether the changes made to the Bill introduced last year by the Whitlam Government acceptable. The most wide ranging and far reaching alterall-tha ations to Labor's Bill relate to the transfer of legislative power from this Parliament Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. These powers include the control and declaration of protection of sacred sites, the control of entry to pastoral properties, the control of entry to Aborlands and access to the sea adjoining Aboriginal lands. The Opposition opposes this of power and, in particular, opposes the of deletion of that clause of the 1975 Land Rights which provided that this Parliament, it through regulation, could override any Northern Territory legislation. This final provision folthe lowed directly on the recommendation made in paragraph 740 by Mr Justice Woodward, where is important that the basic legislation of the Australian be protected in such a way that its provisions cannot be eroded by the effect of any Northern Territory Ordinance. from The Opposition proposes to move in the Committee stage a number of amendments to reinstate the Australian Government's jurisdiction these matters, as Mr Justice Woodward recfor ommended and as the Australian people decided in the 1967 referendum. A further point of concern both to the Labor Opposition and to Aborgroups in the Northern Territory is the restriction on the functions of the land councUs in the Northern Territory imposed by the 1976 Bill. The 1975 Bill gave legal recognition to the from already existing Northern and Central Land Councils estabUshed on the recommendation of Mr Justice Woodward. The new Bill gives wide discretionary powers to the Minister to set the the boundaries and to Umit the operation of land Mr Justice Woodward, in paragraph 359 ofhis second report, recommended that land of process. councUs have power to: 1. Co-ordinate and make claim to vacant Crown lands. 2. Make representations to the Land Commission about and expenditures of moneys for land purchase and development. 3. Issue entry permits to non-Aborigines visiting Aborigilands and arrange for Rangers and others to check the inquiry. permit system is observed. The 1976 Bill eUminates these 3 specific functions. The important power to make representations about priorities and expenditure is deleted from the functions of the councUs. The issue of entry permits is to be handled not by Aboriginal If land councUs but by the white, Darwin based, read Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Tbis is, of course, despite the attitude to the contrary expressed during the debate on the 1975 Bill by the present Attorney-General and then spokesare man on Aboriginal affairs. On perhaps the most important function of t of co-ordinating land claims-the Government has reverted to the provisions of the to the Labor Bill which followed Mr Justice Woodward's recommendations. This function, which the land councils have been actively and successfully pursuing since their formation, will now be retained by them. I hope that the Minispeople-th ter will ensure that the additional funds which would have been made available to the AborigiDesert nal Legal Aid Service for this function will now be made available to the councils. Obviously they will have very great difficulty in functioningtransfer and fulfilling these functions unless they are able to employ and deploy the expert personnel necessary to gain an active appreciation of these important matters. However, despite reverting Mr Justice Woodward's original intention with regard to the land councils' co-ordinating role land claims, this Bill has severely Umited the range of claims which are to be heard by the Land Commissioner. Mr Justice Woodward if proposed that an Aboriginal Land Comthis missioner be appointed to determine Aboriginal people which were based not on traditional grounds but rather on need. In his second report he stated: The difficulties in which many of these peoplefindthem Mr selves do arise from the loss of their traditional lands loss of their sense of Aboriginal identity caused mixed ancestry. Whatever their reasons for living in it can certainly be said that most of the fringe dwellers cities have suffered more from the coming of white settlement than have those still living on reserves or catde Mr Ruddock-Where was that quoted from? Australian",50
112,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"That is in the that Woodward report. I am surprised that the honourable gendeman has not read it. These claims, which have been heard by the Interim Commissioner, Mr Justice Ward, whose reports have been widely accepted, are now to be heard Baumeby the Northern Territory Lands Board and not by the Commissioner. This is a complete abrogation of the recommendation of the Commission and of the spirit and intention of the 1975 Bill introduced by the Labor Government. An example of what will result can be seen in claim of the Gurindjis. Their claim for land Wave Hill began a decade ago. In August last year the then Prime Ministerfinallyhanded over leaseholdtitleto part of their claim. The freehold title was to pass with the royal assent to the introduced last year. Under this Bill it seems thative the Gurindjis could be denied their land. Ten years after their claim wasfirstlodged it is to yet another tribunal, from what the Minister's remarks this afternoon. Then there is the question of Tanami. The Walpiri people of Yuendumu and Hooker Creek provides are to suffer a simUar indignity. The Minister has stated that despite a recommendation by Mr Justice Woodward in paragraph 150 ofhis report that the Tanami Desert people be included in any transfer of land to Aboriginal ownership because of the close traditionaltiesto the Walpiri e largest tribe in the Northern Territory-and despite the inclusion of the Tanami in schedules of both the 1975 and 1976 BUls, it is now to be excluded. The land in question has been subject to continued attempts to it to a reserve for the Walpiris since 1935, and its inclusion would be seen as a major measure of good faith by an administration which has ignored its claims for 41 years. The to amendment to exclude this land should and will be seen as a gross insult to a people who suffered in the most recent massacre in Australia's history when 31 of their tribe were murdered in revenge kUlings in 1928. Honourable members opposite, they accept nothing else, shouldfightto retain land in the schedule. I commend it to them claims from and to the House. Mr Ruddock-That seems to conflict with your earUer quotation. LES JOHNSON-It is in regard to mining or the that perhaps the most intensive lobbying camby their paign has been conducted and the most extena town, sive changes made to the 1975 Bill. Honourable of the members and the pubUc wiU have noticed the stations.huge advertising campaign undertaken by the Mining Industiy Council, allegedly costing over $ lm, to put across its point of view Aborigines should not retain the right to veto mining on their land. These claims have been rejected not only by the Aboriginal groups but also by members of the Government Parties - Senato r Chaney, Senator Bonner and Senator Mr Ruddock-And the Government. Woodward Mr LES JOHNSON- . . . who wrote letters to the newspapers and made their position clear in respect of this matter. One of the most the obnoxious clauses of the Government's original at Bill-that permitting a secret inquiry into whether mining on Aboriginal land is 'in the national interest'-is to be removed. The new clause, recognising the overwhelming vote of the Bill 1967 referendum to give the Parliament legislatpower in Aboriginal affairs, will reinstate that provision in the 1975 Bill which makes any such to go declaration subject to disaUowance by either I gather from House of this Parliament. Mr Ruddock-Whose decision was that?",51

115,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"The new Bill, however, provides that Aborigines shall receive the rate royalty only at the time this Bill is passed. Any subsequent increases in the royalty rate will go the Aboriginal people who own the land only the Minister's discretion. In my view, this vision smacks of the ugly paternalism and crimination which has highUghted Aborigmal affairs in Australia from the time of the white man's settlement here. The Opposition removing vigorously opposes this provision, which alters the Woodward Commission's intentions and astreaty pirations forfinanciaUysecure independent original development based on a sensible and Aboriginal-controlled exploitation of minerals on their land. The Opposition will move to have the provision deleted from the legislation. Some comment must also be made about other important changes in the Bill. Firstly, relation to power over roads, the 1975 Act gave the Aboriginal councUs power to control the use of roads running through their land. The Bill makes all such roads pubUc places. Thus Aboriginal people have no effective control tourists and others who now enter their land, destroy their privacy, and in many cases infringe their traditional reUgious and sacred sites. another important omission from this legislation is that provision of the 1975 Act which extended Aboriginal land rights 2 ldlometres into the This omission has upset a large number of iginal communities as it offers them no protection of their fishing and reUgiousrightsoff The Yirrkala people, in a submission in September, stated it quite clearly when they To us the sea means as much as the land, we have songs, dances and sacred stories which go from the land to Their words have been echoed by the Aboriginal community of Groote Eylandt and the people the Tiwi tribe on MelvUle and Bathurst Islands. Another matter of grave consequence is that the definition of'Aboriginals' in the 1976 Bill ited to Aborigines Uving within the Northern Territory. Again, this smacks of paternalism and discrimination and portends perhaps the Miniswas ter's fears of the articulate and educated igmes of the south influencing their northern brothers and sisters. The Labor Government 1975 considered this matter, and after wide conhave sultation determined that the Aboriginal people themselves should decide who should benefit and who should influence their decisions. For in a this reason, amendments will be proposed to dehis lete such discriminatory passages throughout the Bill. FinaUy, might I add one additional matter of which has relevance to the landrightslegislation and also to the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistto ance) Bill, that is, the matter of a treaty of comat mitment between the Australian Government proand the Aboriginal people. Such a treaty would disobUge the expenditure of a minimum amount, expressed in percentage terms, of each annual appropriation and would have the effect of the individual funding of Aboriginal affairs from direct poltiical confrontation. Such a may in some way indicate to the AborigiAbnal people thefirmcommitment of the Australian Government to Aboriginal affairs and in some way compensate them for the loss of their land. Might I point out to the House that this Bill, which the Government has had before it since it took office on 13 December, has been the subject of widespread debate amongst both the Aborigiin nal and white citizens of the Territoiy and throughout Australia. The Opposition hopes that its passage through this House will be speedy but 1976 considered and that the amendments to be the moved by the Opposition wUlfindsupport from over the Government benches. These amendments are not made in any spirit of partisanship or political point-scoring. They represent the conYet sidered opinions of persons who have been concerned with the Aboriginal cause, and in particular with Aboriginal landrights,for a number of sea. years. I commend to honourable members the Aboramendments circulating in my name and hope that in the Committee stage they wiU be given their land. earnest consideration.",52
116,Mr KEVIN CAIRNS,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"The said: Aborigmal Land Rights (Northern Territoiy) Bill may have aroused widespread debate and the sea. interest amongst the Austrahan community in the past 5 months but it certainly did not arouse a very widespread sense of understanding or of interest amongst members of the Opposition. The honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant) seemed to be the only one interested in what was is Umbeing said. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) might have imagined it was an immigration debate for aU the interest he talcing. But there was one aspect of the propAborositions put by the Opposition in the debate which characterises most of their contributions in in this House. Members of the Opposition always to organise their propositions in a Utany of hate. If one foUowed what they said, it was this: They dislike the provisions in this Bill, but in terms of disliking those provisions they made it quite clear that they dislike pre-eminendy the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, they dislike the miners and they dislike the Governance. ment. They had a special sense of vitriol for members of the Country Party, whom I presume of can take care of that Uttle proposition by themto selves. Opposition members always imagine reciting a Utany of hate is a substitution for rational discussion of what should be important and rational Bill. This is one of those BUls which are only under-ment's stood when seen in terms of their details. The detaUs of the Bill will in fact verify its vaUdity. attempt to understand the detaUs of the Bill will verify the sincerity of those who take it in turn to criticise it. It was quite clear that detaUs of the Bill were neither understood nor comprehended by the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), and I will deal with that in the course of my remarks. Might I spend moment making a short defence of the Minister for Aborigmal Affairs (Mr Viner), although I sure he will make a defence for himself. He is used to doing that. On 11 November the Minister in made a very comprehensive Press statement in which he made clear the 4 areas in which he claimed he was going to introduce significant amendments to this legislation. Those amendposition ments have been moved. We shall wait until de-quite bate of this legislation at the Committee stage see to what extent those amendments have been understood. I am deUghted for a number of reasons to bebe associated with this measure. Land legislation has always been of pre-eminent and very great approached. significance in Australia. In fact, in the 19th century the principal debates in the parliamentary assemblies of Australia were always over land legislation. Such legislation made and broke governments. It put oppositions in and governintroduction ments out. Land characterised 2 things-th tribution of wealth in the community and also the nature of the culture of the community. The history of Australia in the 19th century in terms of the States is characterised by the history those parliamentary assembUes in terms of land legislation. I hope that the significance of legislation, which is going to apply very sensithrough tively and appropriately to the Northern Terriauthority tory, can be seen in that Ught. Land has introduced words into the language. This land Bill will introduce new words into the Australian language. I believe that it will introduce a new sense of culture, of wealth and of responsibUity among many people who are going to have to deal with this legislation. We ask only one thing, that is, that in order to makedifficulty. this legislation work the whole matter be approached in a spirit of common sense and of balUnless it is approached in that way it wiU not work. There has to be a sense of goodwiU and sincerity about this legislation. Five principles apply in respect of Aborigmal land legislation that have been made quite clear in the Woodward a report. I believe that those principles underline a very the spirit of this legislation. A spirit of simple justice animates the Governpurpose in introducing this legislation. The Government has introduced this legislation Anknowing that there has to be social harmony, and that is enshrined in this land legislation. The their Government knows that the holding of land is the cruciaUy important to those who are economically and socially depressed. From the other side of the world words such as 'proletariat' and 'lumpenproletariat' have derived primarily from athose who Uved in cities and in large areas of population but who did not have land. As those amwords have entered our vocabulary, so we hope this legislation will introduce a new vocabulary terms of experience in the Northern Territory. This legislation was introduced because people needed to be provided with a sense of identity and, not least of aU, in order to make Australia's in the world better understood. It is clear that in the 1950s and 1960s and in the to early 1970s attitudes in Australia towards land and towards Aboriginalrightsfor land had a way of being quickly ventilated in the United Nations. So Austraha's position in the world will judged also by the nature of this legislation and the spirit of goodwiU with which it is I can only compare the introduction of this legislation with one other experience in Australian life. I believe that it represents the of a new sense of law and order- a e disnew province of law-in the same way that industrial legislation that was introduced in Australia in the late 19th century and early 20th century represented a new province of law and of order. There are many parallels between that industrial legislation and the legislation that has this been introduced here. One only has to go the procedures, and the line and writ of that are enshrined in this legislation to see that socially it is as significant as was the new province of law and order in which Australia was a leader in the world. I believe that the significance of this legislation ought to be underalso stood, having aU those things in mind. The Government does notfleefrom the proposition that this legislation contains an exquisite Of course there is an exquisite difficulty and that difficulty is in representing 2 cultures and in synchronising the rights of those 2 culments tures. I beheve clause 70 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill seeks to do It does not seek to submerge one culture in would be understood to be our culture. So it ought to be understood in regard to any difficuldynamic ties which are claimed to exist with this legislatona that the legislation seeks to synchronise the 2 tures. A recognition of legitimate rights to not by European tradition but by Aboriginal dition, are enshrined in this legislation. Many experts around Australia have indicated the processes whereby thatrightto land should be exercised. These processes are different from those which we have understood to apply. This legislation has gone out of its way to recognise those new principles, and unless they are recogis nised in fact and understood in fact the legisrefer lation will fail. So there needs to be understandmake ing, a sense of sincerity and a sense of very great sensitivity in relation to this legislation. It is in that sense that I refer- I believe rather sadly-to a copy of a press release which was on my desk just a Uttle before I came into the chamber. It was released by a gentleman Eames from the Central Land Council in Alice Springs. It refers to a member of this House and necessary a senator in the other place who are very highly the performance respected by supporters of the Government. honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) is very highly respected, as is Senator KUgariff. I do not believe that it makes for a sense of sensitivity or understanding when words (c) such as those contained in the Press statement are issued by the solicitor for the Central Land Council, remembering that the land councUs are the centres of authority and power in this legiscontained lation. I shall deal with that dynamic in a mothe ment. Thefinalparagraph of this Press statement states: - If Calder and Kilgariff paign on behalf of mining and pastoral interests will them to vote against the land rights bill. He may be disappointed. The Press statement continues: They will be the only people who will do so nes in the Northern Territory will quickly judge the motive behind their gutter campaigns. In the introduction of legislaton which requires sympathy and understanding for the Australian people I do not believe that those are the kinds words and sentiments that ought to be used against members of Parliament from the precise Territory in which the legislation is going to findflexibility, effect. If Ul-will develops on account of statesuch as this the Ul-will wiU Ue with people such as Eames who have issued those statements. that. In the 10 minutes that are avaUable to me I what shall consider the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill. In every Bill there is a and in every piece of legislation there is part of that legislation which enshrines the alloculcation of power and authority. It is quite clear land, that this Bill depends upon trusts. It depends traupon councUs. I want to refer to the future requirements of the legislation, in fact, those which ultimately will judge the success of what is being done today. The councUs are the essential dynamic of this legislation. They are a new concept. They are also a source of enormous power. So one has to be careful to ensure that that power carefuUy, fruitfuUy and correctly exercised. I to clauses 24 and 26 of the Bill in order to clear what that power happens to be. Clause 24 sub-clause (2) makes it clear that the Aboriginal councUs will hold very great power in respect of concUiation procedures. Clause 24 sub-clause (3) makes it clear that ultimate authputority will rest with the councUs in the implementation of this legislation. I refer in particular to called clause 26(1), which states: Subject to this Act, a Land Council may do all things or convenient to be done for or in connection with of its functions and, without limiting the The generality of the foregoing, mayI believe this is a very great powergive lawful directions to Land Trusts holding land in its area concerning the performance of their functions; That is the key point in terms of the authority in this Bill. Therefore, the functions of councUs are going to be the crucial element. I was pleased to note that one of the amendments which the Minister has moved and to have any courage then their camwhich the Opposition has taken exception cause requires the land councUs not only to ascertain and to express the opinion of Aborigines but also to obtain knowledge of the wishes of the Aborigines whom they represent. An added and very important requirement is to be placed upon the land councUs so that they do not become overand Aborigiwhelming and overweening bureaucratic organisations. We know that the land councUs must be sufficiently large to have the expertise to represent the people whom they represent and to order the events within their communities. We of also know that they should be sufficiently close to the traditional holders who will be determined not to be separate and distinct from them. That in terms of the working out of those 2 principles, will ultimately measure, I believe, the success of this legislation and the ability of land councils to do what they say they can do. Therefore, I suggest that the Minister for Abbetween original Affairs in accordance with clause 20 of ment the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Terriwith tory) Bill 1976, should divide the Northern Terwhichthe ritory into at least 2 areas and establish Aborigi-common sense, nal land councils for each area. the long run the Minister will have to exercise a comment in passingeverybody flexibility in the operation of clause 20 (1) of the legislation which refers to the numbers of land versal councils which are appropriate. The size, the we number and the ability to function of the land efficient councils are the heart and soul of this legislation. They will determine the writ of authority and respect which will go with the implementation this legislation. I turn to clause 19 (2) (b) which deals with the the purposes for which the land will be used. It is retained. quite clear that the land can be used on the authwhether undue ority of the land councils through the Trust for a placed upon those variety of commercial purposes. I hope that in have to be made byagreements. the long run the use to which the traditional will be put will testify to the success of the lation. Clause 19 (2) (b) states could be: for use in the conduct of a business by the Aboriginal, the Council, or Associauon, not being a business in which son who is not an Aboriginal has an interest that entitles to share in, or to a payment that varies in accordance the profits of the business. This clause enshrines the future interests of traditional Aboriginal land. It will have force only in accordance with the self-motivation of those who represent the recipients of this land. The development of co-operative enterprises measure the extent to which this clause has force. In any sense whatsoever it is the key to this lation. It is the dynamic of this legislation. I wish to refer quickly to 2 other matters in the goodwiU, 5 minutes that are left to me. The speech of the ation of this legislation honourable member for Hughes that the Opposition cannot get away from its Territory between now andand hatred of the mining industry. It dislikes the minThis wiU not mean an end to31 ing industry almost as much as it seems to dislike the adequacy of the legislation, both the National Country Party and, of course, the and in the Northern Territory. However, Liberal Party. Let me make it quite clear that the ultimate prosperity of the Northern and the ability of its people to have a high dard of living will depend on the vitality, expansion and the development of the mining industry. Nobody in this House wants the mining industry to destroy the Ufe of any person or any group or any traditional group of people in the Territory. That is against the spirit and the sense of the legislation. On the other hand, one has face facts. On occasion, one has to have doubts. I the refer, for example, to Borroloola. I have seen maps of the claims for traditional land situated the proposed lead zinc inining developat Borroloola and the Sir Edward Pellew Islands. I have seen the maps which coincide are proposed pipeline to the coast on areas claimed as Aboriginal land. If one has one will see that if mining is It may be that in prejudiced unjustly, will lose. I make which wiU not receive unisupport from this side of the House. I hope do not have the stoppage of too many on Fraser mining operations, such as the operation Island. The authority to consent agreements, as conof tained in clauses 39, 40 and 41, will be retained in the Bill. The requirements for enterprises such as the Mereeniefieldto enter into agreements, if gas which is there is developed, wiU be But there will also be a judgment as to or unfair conditions are being A judgment will land Minister. But thefirstjudgments, the and the Parliament by the important legisand significant judgments, must be made by the that the land land councUs. I refer to one matter which seems to have a perescaped the attention of the Opposition with him regard to the Northern Territoiy. The Northern with, Territory is moving towards Statehood and it would be ludicrous to deny the Territory legitthe imaterightsof legislation in areas which, it is understood, would be controlled by the Territory. On the other hand, in the spirit of the 1967 referendum and in the spirit of statements that will have been made, a significant and an overweening-if I might use that word-authorit y legismust be retained by this House. I am deUghted that the Government, in order to manifest its mittee has decided that a parUamentary comshould be estabUshed to oversee the operand to report on positive makes clear moves made in Canberra in the Northern the May next year. measurement of in Canberra a first Territory report is due by that date. stanIf anything attests to the goodwUl and the the sense of the Government that does.

It can determine the adequacy of the clauses contained in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill relating to the identification of the traditional owners of land and to the means of estabUshing the views of such owners to the satisfaction of the relevant council. The committee will be a joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament.

For the honourable member for LUley (Mr Kevin Cairns) to come here and talk to I honourable members on this side of the House and even to most of his coUeagues as if he suddenly seen the Ught and the rest is a piece of absolute nonsense. However, late learner that he is, slow mover that he is, glad to have him on our side even if it is only partially. The honourable member started by saying lation that we on the Opposition side hates. He said that we hate the Country Party. nearly 14 years We do not hate the Country Party. We just or more since we would not trust it poUtically with anything to do with human rights, particularly Aboriginal House. rights. We do not hate the miners.

But we believe that the has been one of the great vandals has only to go to Captain's Flat, not so far from in bringing it in.

We know that peopleNational only against, say, the pubUc enterprise of the State Electricity Commission of Victoria in its YaUournfieldsto see what the difference is. Opposition does not hate the miners but we tentative; know full well that the mining industry has to be will brought under very close scrutiny and control, particularly where humanrightsare We feel that they ought not to be let loose on the cUs. But I appreciate problem at aU. The same appUes to this Government. It stands against most of the things which we, on this side of the House, stand for. It stands against the people for whom we stand. It is denying most of the promises on which it was elected only 12 months ago. With regard to the Bill, my friend opposite says that it should have rational cussion and should be seen in terms of its detaUs. Two of the BUls before the House, the Aboriginal CouncUs and Associations Bill and the Aborigispeech nal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill are a fundamental importance to the Aboriginal land people of Australia. They are both big steps towards giving the Aboriginal people a proper in this community. But how are we going to not talk about these things in detaU? We know the way in which the legislation has been is, brought mto the Parliament and put on the notice paper and taken off again. Now we have Bill with its 73 clauses on 38 pages and the brought in today. How is anyone going to understand it at this stage? With a f is >roperrespectfor the inteUectual capacity, at when it comes to trying to obscure issues, of my friend the honourable member for LUley, how would he know anything about it either? So resent the fact that the debate on these issues is to be shortened. However, I hope that we will be had able to deal with the detaUs when we come to of us had not them at the Committee stage. we are We are debating a matter of great national importance. As my friend said, it is an introduction of a new sense of law and order. This legishas been drifting into this Parliament for have a number of cussion the at least and last 13 years- I suppose since the disdebate on the Yirrkala question ago back in 1963.

One getting here; the has been reluctant to deal of opposition from people there We know that is a great in the in the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory will do their best to sabotage the legislation. We The know that much of the apparatus m this Bill is and that the attitudes expressed in it be altered astimegoes on. I add that the proconcerned. cedures little time here have been confusing. We will have in this debate to talk about the counthe fact that at long last the legislation has arrived in this arena. I think it was one of the last things that I sent along the pipeline when I was the Minister 3 years ago. I recognise the fact that the delay in the introduction of the legislation concerning councUs is no reflection on anybody; neither do I lay too many charges of undue delay in respect of the land disrights legislation as I recognise the great difficulty that is involved in drafting such legislation. Before I conclude my remarks on the made by my friend the honourable memof ber for LUley I would Uke to mention 2 mattersthe question of parliamentary supervision and scrutiny of this legislation and the way it work. We now have a perfectly good committee of this House concerned with Aboriginal affairs. It has a perfectly good chairman as long as he is given strong guidance. I think that we should perhaps increase the number of Committee. However, we should not create another one. I would like to say a word on behalf of Mr Eames from the Northern Territory who has remarked on the legislation and was criticised the honourable member for Lilley. He is deeply involved in the land rights question and, I no doubt, in the whole operation of Aboriginal advancement. He is a man who is giving great and dedicated service. He would know much more about this matter than my friend the stated: honourable member for Lilley or myself, and his suspicions are relevant because he lives in the granted area in which one necessarily of many of the people who will have a part in ing to make decisions about this operation. does not do anybody any good by pouring scorn upon the people who work in Aboriginal This has been too much of a theme in recent times. I think it might be worthwhile to remind and who honourable members how we have got here. It has been a long haul. In 1967 the people of dominions . . . Australia overwhelmingly said to Government: 'Get on with the job of Aboriginal advancement'. I think that a referendum on question was passed by something like 90 cent in Victoria and 88 per cent or 89 per throughout Australia. There were perhaps only or 3 polling booths in Australia that did not carry a majority vote. What that meant was that this Parliament has norightwhatsoever to abdicate its responsibUity in respect of landrightsand hand any control, any possibUity of interference, over to any State government or particularly the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. We speak here of the most overwhelming vote that any proposition in Australia has ever received. It is a job for this Parliament and Parliament alone. We shall deal directly with Aboriginal people and maintain that position. When thetimecomes to amend it we will go back to it. So I make a strong appeal that we do You not put any faith whatsoever in, or pass any of session our responsibUities whatsoever Territory Legislative Assembly. I make the same appeal so far as the State governments are conland cerned because we speak here on a national issue. We must not at any point aUow local parochial interests to intervene. It is one facts of parUamentary Ufe that we in this will can speak with less fear of immediate interference from small groups of people than can our coUeagues in the State parliaments and municipal councUs. But I say that this is a question for the nation and it can be dealt with only by the members on the national Parliament. As I have said, it has been a long haul. When I hear my friend the honourable member for LUley almost spraining his elbows and his arms to pat himself and the Government on the back by in this matter I am reminded of the long history of colonial peoples in the world and the efforts of have people, even such strange people and nondemocrats as George III, to try to ensure that people should get their properrights.The Spanish 'Laws of the Indies' of 11 June 1S94 We command that the farms and lands which may be to Spaniards be so granted without prejudice to the must be suspicious Indians . . . tryThen we come to what George III had to say hi One 1763. One would have thought that my friend the honourable member for LUley would have affairs. caught up to 1763. He said: And whereas it is just and reasonable, and essential to our interest, and the security of our colonies, that the several nations or tribes of Indians with whom we are connected, Uve under our protection, should not be molested or disturbed in the possession of such parts of our the Australian Mr LUSHER - Who said that? this Mr BRYANT-That well known leading radper ical who would probably even spurn the cent National Country Party as being too reac2 tionary-George III, King of Great Britain in 1763. This reference can be found in the Library. For the benefit of my friend the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher), the Library is that room off Kings HaU. The doors are often open. He canfindhis way in there. He should go to and have a look at the documents there. The document from which I am reading is entitled The Instruments of British Policy 1763-1765. The almost wistful commands of the British this monarchy 2 centuries ago are spelt out there. the They said much the same to Governor Phillip. They said: 'You will concUiate their affections'. They said much the same to Cook. They said: are also with the Consent of the Natives to take posof Convenient Situations in the Countiy in the Name to, the Northern of the King . . . He was told that he was to take possession of the with the consent of the natives. This was a continuing theme. How long must it go on before we accept it as a strong principle? On 19 of the February 1836 the following direction was arena issued in respect of South Australia: 'provided always that nothing in these our Letters Patent contained shall affect or be construed to affect the any Aboriginal Natives of the said Province to the actual occupation or enjoyment of their own persons . . . of any lands . . . So we are here at last. How far has it brought us? ern First of all, what about the rest of Austraha? who commercial What about the questions of compensation? minehave What about the answers in this legislation to the you this threats from the mining industry? If we must talk for you'.much about these things let us talk frankly. of the mining industry and this Parliament in asThe Aborigines have italways sociauon with Aboriginal communities is one. Let us consider the case of the Yirrkala be the people who were also seUing often people. I was on the committee that examined the grievances of these people. We went to the Yirrkala, we sat out under the trees talked to the Aboriginal people. We had been assured beforehand that all the Aboriginal people had been consulted, that they knew what it was all about. But of course they did not they could not. So their land was taken from them. We now have this huge development from which many people I presume are making real? immense gains; and, in regard to royalties, in certain way, so too are the Aboriginal people. But honourable members opposite should take trip there and see the difference between the ing conditions of Aborigmal people on their and the Uving conditions of the non-Aboriginal people on what used to be Aboriginal land. Now we see the threat to the people of OenpelU. We know what has happened on Groote Eylandt even though I believe that the Broken HU1 Pty Co. Ltd has played the game pretty fairly. We Bill. know what is happening now to Aurukun. We know what has happened to Weipa. The facts are that the social impact of development by mining compames on Aboriginal communities of such immensity that the Aboriginal communilots ties cannot handle it and we do now know how help them to handle it. This is one area where we must mark time. is why, for my own purpose, I would say in this instance that we should give no consideration to anybody else'srights,whether national or otherto wise, to go and mine land at aU, until the igmal people can handle the impact. Mining couple companies are not the only threat to the lands the Aboriginal people. There is the sacred matter of development and the roads that must run through Aboriginal lands- I think they wiU declared public land-and what that means. There is always the continuing pressure of pastoralists. There are always the social pressEnglish ures. One question that we wiU have to consider very deeply, as wiU whichever committee hapmains pens to be charged with the responsibUity and whichever Minister may be charged with the rerights of sponsibUity, is how Aborigmal people handle propositions that are put before them. They are an honest and straightfoward people, unaccustomed to dealing with the roughness of our modand industrial practices. People something on offer and who want to the land say to the Aborigines: 'We will pay In money and we will do that much the common ordinary language of The history our times, I suppose is very easy to be conned. found themselves in a sad the sad position that their defenders them had to out. We have to do something to protect them against possibUity of being persuaded into getting rid and we of theirrightsfor the ume being. I see this legislation still with a partly open mind. In other words, I believe that these amendand ments may answer some of the questions we are putting to the House; but I have my doubts. Is this just aritualpiece of legislation or is it for It cannot be for real, if the Legislative a Assembly is to be left in the act. I would not care if it were the New South Wales Government, the a Victorian Government or the South Australian UvGovernment. This is not then* function. In matland ters of landrightsand the advancement of the Aboriginal people, particularly the protection of this fundamental principle, this Parliament must accept the full responsibUity. Only this Parliament can be the adequate continuing watchdog. I hope that we will remove such clauses from the Let us think for a moment of what we mean by 'ownership'. In the 20-odd years since Ifirstbeis came involved in Aboriginalrightswe have had of discussion. First of aU some Aboriginal to people said that what they wanted was land Uke everybody else has-freehol d land. It is a reasonable enough proposition that people should want That land for themselves, but of course it is not reasonable if one is taking land in trusteeship for the rest oftime.In a way the time has come for us think of some new word. As one who was reAborsponsible for administering Canberra for a of years, I continuously ran into the conof flict between people about freehold, leasehold and so on-the kind of title by which people hold land. We are talking of traditional lands, trabe ditional usage and the traditional people who should have the land. I do not think we can the define this in any of the terms known to the language. Perhaps we should have some original legislation called the Aboriginal DoAct, or something of that sort, Ufted out of the ordinary context in which we think of land. It is very difficult for us to think of land as not being something which can be bought and it that the legislation, no matter how much it amended or altered, will ensure that people caning not trade in the land. I think that is fundamental. We are trustees of the land. The Aboriginal people to whom we are passing the land will trustees for future generations, just as they are LUley the heirs of the countless generations who committee preceded them. I hope that in the Committee stage of this Bill we will see the matter as a communal exercise. recognise the difficulties that my colleagues posite may well have. They have advanced a long way in the last ten orfifteenyears. We not trying to create a new nation. We are not ing to create Bantustans, apartheid or anything Uke that. We have to give the Aboriginal people a place in this continent which they feel is utely theirs. It is a psychological and spiritual need. I recall that one of the missionaries Yirrkala, when giving evidence to our Comof mittee, said that the Aborigines do not use the land and that they do not have a sense of owneran ship. He said that they get spiritual refreshment area. from passing across it. I think that many other Australians are starting to feel much the same way about their environment. Therefore, to them? people such as myself this is a fairly historic ment. We have been associated with Aboriginal rights from the very beginning. I recall that 19631 personaUy took action in the court in win to stop a mining development. It did not itical earn me all that many cheers in this House. Paul Hasluck- Mr Hasluck, as he then was-trie to have me removed from a select committee bepoints cause of my action. However, we eventually came to an armistice and we have proceeded along this path. I am sorry that we have not time to debate the Aboriginal CouncUs and Associdivide ations Bill and the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill. I appeal to honourable memnot bers to examine these matters thoroughly in the Committee stage. The Minister, who already shown a capacity to change his attitude, his and his wordage, may well, under our guidance, do even better.",56
119,Mr RUDDOCK,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"It is always a pleasure to foUow the honourable member for WUls (Mr Bryant). After his first token political remarks he got down to the busiand ness of talking about the Bill and its purpose. I think he demonstrated his abiding interest original affairs. I was vety touched by his kind references to George III, as undoubtedly aU honourable members would have been. We in Parramatta have an abiding interest in George III, the last king of the United States and the first sold. I take king of Parramatta. is It is a significant Bill to which we are addressourselves today. I want to take up some of the remarks of the honourable members who have be spoken before me. The honourable member for (Mr Kevin Cairns) mentioned a parliamentary committee and the matters which that would examine and report upon to the Parliament. He mentioned the date by which the committee would have to report. For the time. I being I have the pleasure of chairing the House opof Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. I understand that it is recare ommended that the committee will be a joint trycommittee comprising the 8 members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 6 members from the absol-Senate, chosen in equal numbers from the Government and the Opposition. Knowing the in quality of the members who serve on the House Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, I am pleased that they will have opportunity to participate in this important Mr Kevin Cairns-Why do you not name mo Mr RUDDOCK-I do not think it is appropriate that I go through the names at this point. Two in of the members have spoken before me in this Dardebate. When I touch on some of their more polremarks I trust that they will not think it unSir kind of me. They have deigned to treat this d important debate as an opportunity for poltiical scoring. I think that was unfortunate. I think that in the area of Aboriginal affairs, in which there has emerged in essence a bipartisan approach, an attempt to divide the nation or to parties against parties, persons against persons and Aborigines against Aborigines, is a very good ploy and is quite unbecoming. has I regret very much that the honourable memideas ber for WUls defended Mr Eames, a gentleman whom I have met and who, I must say with some respect to him, is a very diUgent person in his examination of legal matters. But I must say that I found him to be one who was perhaps a Uttle too earnest. He has obviously demonstrated this by his capacity to delve into the poltiical area get away from the legal area in which he has a special responsibUity. It is most unfortunate for in Abhim to be prepared to make comments about parliamentarians who have proper interests to protect and to pursue. They represent a total electorate of Aborigmal people as well as other people in the Northern Territory. He criticised them simply for putting the views of the total community whom they represent. However, it was the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson) who introduced the most invective into this debate. I consider that most unfortunate. He point scored more so than anybody else, if I can say that about what he had to say. He attempted to put the view that the Australian Labor Party Bill was the one which had adopted almost in entirety the Woodward recommendations. I have seen papers prepared. I have looked at the Woodward report. I have looked at the Labor Party Bill and at our Bill. Each of them differs significantly. The large number of areas that must be covered cannot be covered without diverging to some degree. Honourable members have only to look at the comparative paper-the one that I have in my hand at this time-to appreciate that whilst Mr Justice Woodward made certain recommendations, when we come to put them into a legal document they cannot always be followed in their entirety. But, I think in terms of the good intentions that we have displayed and the interests that we have in this question, we have gone as close as we reasonably could be expected to go in putting the general recommendations into a legislative form. It is totally unfair for honourable members opposite to say that the Opposition is relying upon the Woodward report, that the Government is not and that in some way we have been deficient. Mr Kevin Cairns-It is unfair.",59
120,Mr RUDDOCK,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"It is certainly unfair. It is a dishonest approach. The honourable member for Hughes spoke of a $ 1 m advertising campaign by the mining industry and said that it was ned to undermine the purpose of the Bill. then suggested that the Opposition certainly not influenced by that and that a number honourable senators had taken a certain apCountiy proach in relation to the mining veto. But he then ignored the fact that the Government intends give to the Parliament thefinaldecision. I think all these suggestions are certainly taking this matter to its extreme. The honourable member forgets the very fundamental basis of our Bill, the recommendations and the amendments that have been proposed, amendments which I enit not? tirely support. He endeavours to point score on those in a quite dishonest way. In my view, he showed a lack of preparation because informaremarks tion was avaUable to him some week ago to able him to see the direction in which the Government was moving in relation to some of these matters that we have discussed already. He ignored the importance of consultation, something which I consider is of the utmost importance. He reUed upon a quotation from the Woodward report to denigrate the rights of traditional owners and to say that in some way the rights and claims of people who had moved away from their traditional lands-ver y often people who may be only of part Aboriginal blood and Uving in fringe areas-were somehow more important and more significant. I have looked in vain for a generalisation in the Woodward report that would substantiate that claim. I cannotfindit. What I dofindis that Woodward divided up the recommendations. He discussed the traditional areas-the Aboriginal reserves. That is thefirstarea in which he makes major recommendations. Honourable members have only to look at clause 144.2 of the report to see this. He talks in the summary of the recommendations about traditional lands. He deals with the land holding corporations, which should be called land trusts, and says that they should hold land for the benefit of aU those having traditional interests in orrightsover it. He acknowledges the importance of traditional land interests.I think he elevates the matter to that important place by making it thefirstarea of Aborigmal lands with which he deals. He then goes on to deal with other significant areas-lan d claimed by Aborigines, including vacant Crown land, and pastoral leases. Finally, he makes reference to the city and town dwellers. In that, he deals with the fringe dwelling situation.",60
121,Unknown,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,60
122,Mr RUDDOCK,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"Before the suspension of the sitting I was addressing some remarks to one of the 3 BUls being debated cognately, the Aborigidesignal Land Rights (Northern Territoiy) Bill. I He want to say in response to the remarks by was honourable members opposite that history will of record that it was the Liberal and National Parties which pursued and brought to finality land rights for Aborigines, that it was a to government of our persuasion which commissioned the Woodward report, and that it is a government of our persuasion which brought in this legislation that was enacted into law.",60
123,Mr KEATING,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"That is an over-simplification, is",60
124,Mr RUDDOCK,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"It is certainly not an oversimpUfication when we look at the nature of the passed earUer in the debate. I am surenprised to hear the honourable member, who has joined us now for thefirsttimein the discussion on this important legislation, interjecting so early. The fact is that these are the parties which brought in the initial report upon which this legislation is based, and these are the parties which will have carried into the law of the land Aboriginal landrights,and that ought to be remembered. The whole commitment which is embodied in the 3 Bills that we are debating-the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill-is designed to advantage Aboriginal people. The through Bills demonstrate our commitment to that cause. Woodward The Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill there has been provides aframeworkto give support nal people through government programs. It is significance on thedid substantially the same as the Bill that viously introduced but it removes a great deal of ownership. Mr Justice Woodward said: land the complexity and legal difficulties that Aboriginal bodies have experienced in being incorshare porated and in being in a form able to receive government assistance. When nature of legislation that operates in the States that and provides for incorporation in various forms behalf, one appreciates the need for a more uniform and The simplified structure through which moneys can volves be got to those people. The States Grants (Aborted iginal Assistance) Bill is the vehicle through ceremonies which the additional funds which were promised in the Budget and in respect of which announcetimeless, ments were made subsequently are to be made death . . . available for specific programs in housing and . other areas. These are important Bills. In my Party's policy statement a clear commitship ment was given to Aboriginal landrights,and Aborigines. those who endeavour to say that we lack that commitment need only look at the document. It makes clear and emphasises something which I see as important and which Mr Justice to Woodward saw as important, and that is a recoga nition of a fundamental principle to Aboriginestheir sense of Aboriginally was their affinity with land. This is a very important aspect. To it is the most important aspect because I believe that people need a purpose to do and to achieve, and they will fulfil that purpose only if they able to see their achievements and beheve that what they are doing and what they have is of right. They will not fulfil it if they feel that something is a gift, something given to them to make them feel comfortable and make it easy for them.people By way of example one need only look at the nature of probate and inherited wealth and the way it ultimately is frittered away by people lack the purpose of those who earned it. It much the same with landrights.If Aborigines know they have land as ofrightthey will feel thatthat special affinity with it. If land is given to them because we feel that it is nice for them to have land, they probably will not have that sense of purpose. It certainly will not help overcome some of the basic problems and deprivations which we know exist among Aborigines in certain circumstances. The policy document is one that I would commend to people to read because it recognises the importance of Aborigines gaining their Bill and the inalienable title to land. I also wanted to take honourable members some of the comments of Mr Justice in relation to land because I believe some harm done by those who to Aborigisuggested that he not place a great deal of was preownership and the traditionalconcept Aboriginal of land forms of The land owning clan is merely a group of people who the same links with the same land. one looks at the lar tractsclans These have close spiritual associations with particuof land. Their religion or mythology teaches them particular areas were given to them, or claimed on their by their spirit ancestors in the Dreamtime . . . spiritual connection between a clan and its land inboth rights and duties. The rights are to the unrestricuse of its natural products; the duties are . . . to tend the land by the performance of ritual dances, songs and at the proper times and places . . . . . . the commencingconnection of the Aborigines with their land is before birth and continuing after . . his connection with it is not broken by the fact he may have lived away from it for many years . . . I have so far come across no case in which ownerof land has been disputed among full blooded Those remarks are important. They make clear the importance of traditional owners in the structure of these BUls, the importance of land rights Aborigines and the importance of giving them purpose in Ufe and an understanding of Uving and achieving. I am pleased that in this Bill emphasis is placed upon traditional ownership. I me want to comment on a number of points in relation to clauses in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill. Clause 7 (6), which are deals with the constitution of Aboriginal land trusts, emphasises that aU members of a land trust shaU be Aborigines Uving in the area of the land councU in the area of which the land of the land trust is situated. It makes it clear that those must have that association, that they must be people who Uve in relation to that land within the area for which the trust is established. The who Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) has is mentioned an amendment which will give those traditional ownersrightsin relation to that land they may not have enjoyed before. This has come out of the important discussions and sultations and further strengthens the Bill respect of traditional ownership. Clause which deals whith land councils is equally impor-committee tant. With the proposed amendment it will say, in part, that the functions of a land council to ascertain and express the wishes and the opinions iginals Uving in the area of the Land Council agement of Aboriginal land ate legislation concerning that land. That provision is also important in relation to of the traditional Aborigines. In clause 47 (1) (a) (i) we House for see much the same point made. Clause 47 (1) states, in part: The functions of the Commissioner are(a) on an appucation being made to the Commissioner by or on behalf of Abonginals ditional land claim to an area of land, being unalienated Crown land(i) to ascertain whether those Aboriginals other Aboriginals are the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land. If one goes on to clause 65, which deals roads, one will see a similar responsibility to ascertain the wishes of the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land. Finally, if one looks at clause 67 one will see that it speaks of the traditional rights to use or occupy Aboriginal land. Because my ume is limited, I simply draw that to the attention of honourable members. I have raised those points in this discussion cause a great deal of emphasis has been placed by some people on the subject of the traditional ownership of land. I believe that this Bill very long way towards meeting most of the critiEnglish cisms that have been offered. But one must reflag. alise that there are difficulties in going further and that, much as we might like to go further relation to those who have this close association and a traditional right to own land, there difficulties in assessing who those people are the boundaries of the land which they are seekthefirstplace ing without having to examine the claims very long period oftime.That sort of examination would only delay further the opportunity for us to be able to give land rights to Aborigines. I think all honourable members would apprecihas ate thattimeis important in this exercise and that, as well as that, it would be extremely to make such an examination.",60
125,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND, concern Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,62
126,Mr WALLIS,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND," I want to centrate on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northdecency ern Territory) Bill. Firstly, I would like to port the criticism of some of my colleagues of the fact that, although this Bill was introduced conJune of this year, 42 - amendments to it were in foreshadowed this morning. Although the 22 Government has said that it will adjourn the stage of the debate on this Bill until we come back the week after next after the recess are: it is a fact that if these amendments had been of Aborknown to members of the Opposition earher they as to the mancould have influenced their attitudes. in that area and as to appropriI agree with most of the honourable members who have spoken today that this is probably one most important Bills to come into this quite sometime.It is certainly the most important Bill to come into this House concerning the Aboriginal people of Australia. Although the Labor Government introduced last year a Bill along similar lines concerning land claiming to have a trarights-I feel it went a lot further-this Bui will have far-reaching effects. All we can hope is that or any if we are in a position to improve the Bill-w e of the Opposition feel that we can make a contribution to improving it-ou r contributions will be acwith cepted. It will be a big step forward. We have to go back in time to realise what a debt we owe to the Aboriginal people and what a black past we have given them. All of their troubles started from the day that Governor Phillip landed at Port Jackson, planted a flag and claimed the country in the name of King George III. The honourable member for Wills be- (Mr Bryant) said today that he was a radical. I saw an interesting program on This Day Tonight last week in which a couple of Australian Aborgoes a igines were shown landing at Dover in the Channel and planting the Aboriginal Unfortunately their boat was swamped just before they reached shore. Still they managed to in get ashore and plant the Aboriginalflag.In doing so they claimed England. In a symbolic are gesture they went round handing out beads to and the bystanders. I think that is what happened in in Australia. Of course, the position over a was reversed on this occasion. From thetimeof the landing of Europeans in Australia the position of the Aboriginal people steadUy deteriorated. I am sure that we are all in agreement that our past in this respect is costly not one of which we can be very proud. For many years absolutely nothing was done for the Aborigines. Those people who were showing for what was happening to the Aboriginal people were voices m the wUderness. Certainly not a great deal of notice was taken of conthem. As a race we have not even had the to record the history of the Aborigines. supIf we look at the position of other indigenous people we wUlfindthat at least the history of on 4 how they have been decimated and so forth has been recorded. But we have not had the decency to do even that. I am sure that those who have read the books written by Professor Rowley will remember that he made mention of how we taken the Aborigines out of our history books. That is a fact. There was a segment during news program tonight about what some educaThe tionists have had to say about our attitude to Aborigines in our education system. It has been claimed that if it had not been the Aborigines during the early days when the white man was hugging the coast of Australia white man never would have left the coast. They were able to assist the explorers. Many times they did so against their will. The early settlers who broke out from the coast did so mainly the assistance of Aborigines. Many of them took Aboriginal women as their wives or companions. The early settlers relied upon the Aborigines find water holes and so forth. Sometimes that was done voluntarily and sometimes it was done involuntarily. The degradation of the Aborigines has continuedrightthrough to the present. As I have said, we have not even recorded some of the things that we have done to them, including the massacres that have taken place. These events have been recorded in other coununder too. tries, but they have not been recorded in Australia. It has been claimed that in the early days of the settlement of the Eyre Peninsula, winch is in my electorate, when the Aboriginal people were defending theirrightsand standing wiped up to the settlers, the settlers horseback and drove a large group of Aborigines American Indians towards the cliffs and forced them over. This is denied by many people in the area, but some of the older people in the area true story. A few years ago an Aborigmal group pushed into in Adeaude wished to erect a monument at that years. They were place. The local councU had reservations about the matter because it had no proof that that had actuaUy taken place. But elderly people have the assured me that it did take place. The Aborigines have been subjected to all the prejudice and hatred that the white man can muster. Of course, it has meant that they have lived in a racist society. I think that many of are racist. What did we do to their lifestyle? pushed them into corners to such an extent that Horn. in many instances they became people who had their tribal structures and thenculture destroyed. It is only in the last few years have started to realise what we have done tried to make amends for our actions in the Most Australians know more about the American American Indian than they do about their own indigenous people. I have always felt that it is interesting to make a comparison between the way the American Indian and the Australian Abhave original have been treated. They are both indigenous people. Both races became the vica tims of the white man's expansion and so forth. American Indian was possibly in a much better position to resist the encroachment of the white man than was the Australian Aboriginal. In thefirstplace, following the landing of the for Spaniards in America and the spreading of the horse, the Indian became mounted, which meant the that he was more mobUe. In most cases the American Indian Uved in areas where there were a lot moreriversthan there were in Australia. So again he was more mobUe and there were more with means of communication. The American Indian possibly had access to armsrightfrom the time the Spaniardsfirstlanded on the American contito nent. Apart from that, the weapons they had were at a much more advanced stage than were the weapons of the Australian Aboriginal. The American Indian was to be found in larger tribal groupings and, because of the better communications, whenever his land was being encroached upon he was able to get larger groups together and to put some resistance. Despite that, he went United However, the resistance was such that the States Government at least recognised the Indians and found that attimesit had to draw up treaties with them. Those treaties were aside when it suited the white people of had a big drive on that country. Large reserves were given to the under treaties, but if gold was found in those areas or if they covered good pastoral land the treaties were tossed to one side and say that it is quite a ignored. The American Plains Indians were a corner over a period of about 30 pushed into very smaU reserves which possibly contained the poorest countiy in vicinity or were in areas where there was no game and in most cases no water. Although the Indians resisted, they were smashed. At least the Americans recorded their history, whereas we in Australia have not recorded the history of our Aborigines. The American Indians, despite their us problems, had a few victories. Some of us know We about General Custer and the battle at Little Big had We know what happened to the American Indians; so what chance did the Australian that we Aborigines have? The Australian Aborigines and were not mounted and the weapons they had past. were much more primitive than those of the Indians. The Aborigines' tribal structures were much smaller. They did not have the means of communication and the means of conof gregation so that they could put tance. They went the same way as the American Indians. We chased them off tribal land and for-tabUshed ced them into degradation, and we destroyed some of them. The Aborigines became a comthe pletely dispossessed people. The only recorded history we have of many of the things that place is in their own history, in the stories they can tell. I have been told that in the northernhousing, part of South Australia some of the older Aboriginal iginal people can teU the story of Burke and WUls. That story has been handed down. They can teU about the tribe that looked after King after that tragic expedition. One can hear stories of Lasseter and his lost gold reef and so forth. This is the only history we have of them in places. WhUe aU this was going on, the concerned voices were in the wUderness. For many years attitude of the white population was to assimUate the Aborigines into white society or to let them die out peacefully-and sometimes not quite peacefully. Only in the last 25 years has there been any concern by the white population about what happened to our Aboriginal people. sibly the watershed of that concern was referendum which was carried Australia by an exceptionaUy large vote and which the honourable member for WUls mentioned earlier- a vote in excess of 90 per cent. The Australian people voted overwhelmingly aUow the Federal Parliament to legislate for Aboriginal people. From that time on the eral Government has had much greater involvement. Even our predecessors, the LiberalLabor Country Party Government, started a scheme to last assist Aboriginal people. The result was that morefinancewas made avaUable to the States and things took a Uttle turn. However, with the dispossession that had taken place, the matter landrightsfor Aborigines became of great importance. This was something which had not been considered before. FoUowing that we saw some court cases. There was one in the early 1970s mvolving land in Arnhem Land. That was the case in which Mr Justice Blackburn was volved, the Yirrkala case. We know of the deNorthern cision that he handed down. That decision based on white man's law and in it the traditionalrightsof the Aboriginal people were completely ignored. It was a decision made within the very Umited framework in which he ing had to work-the European law, the white man's law, under which therightsof the Aborigines were given short shrift. Emphasis was given at thattimeto the need for a law to cover this aspecttection Aboriginal Ufe; that is, a law to estabUsh land up some resisrights for these people. In 1972 the Woodward Commission was esand also in that year the advent of the Labor Government gave a bit of a kick along to provision offinance,etc., for these people. The fact that the Federal Government moved took into thisfieldled to an increase infinanceto that assist in areas such as health, education and which had been of concern to the Aborpeople and those concerned about them. That was an effort to bridge the gap that had existed for quite sometime.I think everybody recognised the need for this landrightslegislation. Following the establishment of the Woodward Commission and the presentation of manyits report in about 1973, the Labor Government in 1975 introduced its landrightsBUI. I know that our Government was criticised for delays and so forth, but there had to be some examinthe ation of that Bill to ensure that everything was covered. We introduced that legislation last year and it was before the House until 11 November. so We all know what happened on that day, when the Labor Government was tossed out of office in such a bad manner by the Governor General. PosNow, after another 12 months, the Liberalthe 1967 National Country Party Government has throughout introduced this Bill. From our point of view this Bill waters down some of the good provisions contained in the Bill to introduced by the Labor Government last year our and in many respects it departs from the FedWoodward report. One wonders whether this Bill would ever have been introduced if the Government had not introduced its Bill year. I say that because, following the initiatives taken by that Labor Government, this Liberal-National Country Party Government has now taken up a number of those matters and of probably is claiming them as its own idea. Some have been altered. This Bill differs from the Labor Government Bill in very many important areas. Perhaps I should mention a few of them. Some of the controls which would have been in this legislation to cover this area have been inturned over to the Legislative Assembly of the Territory. We are a little fearful, bewas cause that legislative body comes under the influence of mining and pastoral interests. Let us look at some of the major changes to the Labor Government's Bill. The most wide rangalteration relates to the transfer of legislative powers from the Commonwealth Parliament to the Northern Territoiy House of Assembly. This includes,firstly,the control, declaration and proof sacred sites; secondly, the control of entry to pastoral properties; thirdly, the control of entry to Aboriginal land; and,finally,access the sea adjoining Aboriginal lands. There are a The few other matters in respect of which this Bill provision differs from the Bill we introduced last year. I iginal understand there are some alterations in respect of royalties. I also understand that under this control over roads through Aboriginal areas will be taken away from the Aborigines. The powers of the land councils also are to be restricted under this Bill. This goes against what Mr Justicesimilar Woodward said in his report. The Woodward report recommended that the land rights legisconcern lation 'should be protected in such a way that provisions cannot be eroded by the effect of any Northern Territory legislation'. In the suggested drafting instructions for proposed legislation relevant clause states: . . . the Ordinances of the Northern Territory apply to Aboriginal land . . . provided however that . . . no ordinance shall have any effect so diminish any benefit conferred upon Aborigines by this or to restrict any Land Council, Land Trust or the Commission in the discharge of their respective functions. That quite clearly is what Mr Justice Woodward recommended and, of course, this Bill departs from that recommendation. There is no guaranments tee as to what the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly will do in respect of these things. so long ago we had the example of what hapthose pened at Aurukun on Cape York Peninsula. Despite assurances given by the Queensland Government, that Government rushed through legislation which was an affront to the who had beenfightingfor the Aboriginal people and, of course, to the Aboriginal people themselves. We have all received correspondence from various organisations throughout the counexpired. try which have tried to influence us this Bill. I have a number of letters here from church organisations. I have a letter from the Quaker Race Relations Committee which, in referring to the Bill, draws attention to the fact that that Committee is a bit concerned about the authority in a number of these matters in the Bill being handed over to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I turn over a bit further andfindthat the Committee in the letter states: The removal of all powers to pass Land Rights Legislation which the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly granted . . . The Committee suggests that that is one of the creates matters which should be in the matter is: The control by Aborigines of aU roads passing through Aboriginal lands. I mentioned that matter earher. It also states: The restoration of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner's to power to hear claims . . . restoration of all powers vested in Land Councils and the Land Commissioner in the Labor Land Rights Bill. A that any Government decision to over-ride Aborobjections to mining on the basis of national interest be itself reviewed by both Houses of Parliament. Bill I understand that the Minister is introducing an amendment to cover that matter. The Committee also mentions a few other things. I refer now to the Presbyterian Church. It mentions matters in a vein to those mentioned by the Quaker Committee. In thefirstparagraph it mentions its at authority being given back to the its Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. The Australian Council of Churches does exactly the same thing. All these bodies are concerned the about this power which was in the Labor Party Bill being given back to the Northern Territory shall Legislative Assembly. These are organisations which are supporting us. We have had correas to spondence from the Central Lands Council and Act from the Aboriginal legal rights organisation in the Northern Territory. These are all people who have placed the views of Aborigines first-hot the views of the mining interests or of the pastoral interests. We understand that 42 amendare proposed to the Bill. Possibly there are some which we want to put before the House. Not We have not had an opportunity to examine 42 amendments properly. We hope that some of the objections of which we have spoken will be covered by those amendments. We hope also that the amendments to be moved by our people Party will be given consideration.",62
127,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has in relation to Mr WENTWORTH (Mackellar) (8.33)-There are 3 Bills before the House. I shall deal with only one, namely, the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territoiy) Bill. It is a difficult Bill because it covers a difficult situation. I hope the matter will be approached in a bipartisan spirit. At least, I shall try to do so. Our first objective, surely, is to do what is best for the Aborigines and to look to their real advantage. I do not think their real advantage would be compatible with the maintenance of high tension behas been tween them and the Europeans in the Northern Territory. Anything which is in a Bill and which and maintains that tension will not be to Bill. Another Nor would itadvantage the ultimate be to their of the Aboriginal people. advantage to take a line which was believed to impede entirely the prosperity of the Northern Territoiy. These circumstances set limits to what we might usefully and properly do for the Aboriginal people. We might ask: What is this land rights Bill? It gives traditional land to traditional people. That is its title. It states: Providing for the granting of Traditional Aboriginal in the Northern Territoiy for the benefit of Aboriginals, for other purposes. That is what the Bill is about. When one looks it onefindsthat its main purpose is the allocation of reserves and the giving oftitlein reserves. That is not its only purpose but that is the drive and impact of the Bill. In addition to this, envisages other things. It envisages a continue the ance of the policy whereby we have purchased pastoral properties in the Northern Territory elsewhere for the benefit of Aboriginal people, and particularly for the benefit of Aboriginal people who have some traditional link with those properties. One thinks, for example, of Utopia, Wave Hill or any one of those areas which have been purchased. I hope that more of them will purchased. This policy was started under the prenals vious Liberal-National Country Party Governlate ment when I was the Minister. It has been conadjacent tinued under the Australian Labor Party and Government and I beheve it will be continued now. In addition, the Bill envisages acquisition proper dwelling areas-si t down places is what the Aborigines call them-for other Aborigines the Northern Territoiy. Although the Bill is concerned mainly with wasthis reserves, that is not its only concern. But this Bill the integrity is for the traditional Aborigines. I think we have cannot be maintained to remember that they are different from the Aborigines most people know. Perhaps 90 per intense cent or 95 per cent of the Australian people come big mining into contact with Aborigines in Redfern or without Moree or perhaps as tourists in AUce Springs. Butciety they do not see the real, traditional Aborigmal. It people is mainly towards his benefit that this Bill is dihave thewho rected. I am not saying for one moment that thing that is best Aborigines, other than the traditional AborigiEylandt, for example, where nes, do not have needs and do not need, require Co. Ltd has leaned over backwards and deserve benefits and help. I am talking thing it can. I could not criticise one thing about what this Bill does. It is about traditional company has done, and yet its impact upon Aborigines and about mamtaining their rights over traditional land. I ask: What is best for Aborigines? What is needed for them is change, but gradual change. The fault of which we have been guUty in the past is that we have put upon these traditional people pressures of change there which were too vast and too urgent for them to ing in,was assinulate. They have broken in the process. This away its impact is what we must avoid. Sure, we must bring change; we must help these people into a new way of Ufe. But let the change be only as fast they can assinulate without breaking. If we go to the Northern Territory today we will see terrible evidences of this break where the traditional Aboriginal is not getting something better but something much worse. For these Land people there has been a deterioration in their real and way of life even when their material standards have risen. I am not for one moment saying that at we should not help them to raise their material standards. We should help them to raise their standards as fast as they are capable of assimUatmain ing change. But we do them no kindness when it perhaps to salve our own guUty consciences in matter we try to impose upon them burdens which they are not capable of bearing. Now, let and me come to the reserves. We should be maintaining for the Aborigines the integrity of their traditional reserves. As honourable members will know, there are two or three big reserves about which we are talking. They are not just Uttle island reserves but real areas which are capable be of maintaining the integrity which the Aborigidesire so that they can have time to assimithe change. There is Arnhem Land, with its islands; there is the big central reserve; there is the Daly River reserve. These are big areas. They are not just Uttle islands in a sea of of European development, but something which can be traditionally Aborigmal until the Aborigiin nes are ready to take the change. I am worried to some extent that some features of its Bill, and equally of the Labor Bill which predecessor, do not sufficiently maintain of those big reserves. That integrity if there is an incursion of economic activity into the reserves. No venture in a reserve can be conducted destroying the traditional Aboriginal soand the traditional Aborigines who are associated with it. That is true even though the are conducting that intensive mining very will in the world and do everypossible. Let us take Groote the Broken HU1 Pty to do everythat the the community has not been at all favourable. theseIndeed, I hope that things will improve, but on the last occasion I was at Groote Eylandt there was starvation among the Aborigines, for the firsttimein memory-starvatio n at a time when but a flood of unaccustomed money comgambUng and other things had taken for good. If one goes to Yirrkala or Gove or Nhulunbuy, as call it what you will, one wiUfindthat the only refuge for the traditional Aboriginal is to leave the centre and go down to Caledon Bay or Blue Mud Bay or down to the centre of Arnhem Land and live away. He is not living entirely in traditional fashion. He has some kind of elementary schooling, he has his land rover, perhaps, or an outboard motor on his boat. He has some medical services. He probably has access to an aerodrome where emergency suppUes or visitors can come in. But he has separated himself from the activity which was destroying him. I believe that this outstation movement which the Aborigines have chosen for themselves in these reserves Ulustrates the only real hope they have of coming successfully through the transition from their way of life to our way of life. I am not saying one moment that they can always remain in their traditional way. I think that is something which they would not desire, and whether they or we desire it, it would not be possible. Although there is some protection in the Bill against mining incursion, I am not certain how great that protection will be in practice. It is a very difficult problem. We say that we must give to the Aborigines control over their own property and their own destiny, but if that means permission to barter it away then it will be bartered away. We know the manipulations that go on. Anybody who has been to Arnhem Land knows about them. Aborigines, in good faith perhaps, make bargains whose impact they do not understand, and we in good faith sometimes believe that they understand what they are doing. I remember an Administrator talking to me about how he went across to Yirrkala and told the Aboriginal people there everything about what was going to happen when the bauxite plant moved in. He was completely honest. He told them everything. I do not think he concealed anything, and they gave then consent. But when they saw what happened they were appalled because they had not envisaged it or realised it. Even today there is circulating among honourable members a statement about an Aboriginal on a land councU-ther e is no need to mention his name; honourable members will know to whom I am referring-wh o has been signing things of consequence without knowing what he has signed, not because he was deceived but because that is the kind of thing that happens. Under this Bill there is not enough protection for the Aborigines, almost against themselves in a way. There will be manipulation. I would Uke to have seen the Aborigines in the reserves having full mining rights, but I would not Uke to have seen them with the abUity to barter thoserightsaway in such a fashion as to bring in intensive industries and destroy their communities. The Northern Territory has got to develop. There has to be mming there. For example, it will be almost impossible and a crime against Australia to hold back development on some parts of the AUigator River. But to breach the integrity of Arnhem Land, to allow mineral exploration up from Roper River through Blue Mud Bay and the Parsons Range would destroy the refuge. Even the Labor Government was giving concessions or making arrangements for prospecting in the NgaUa Basin adjacent to and to some extent in the Yuendumu Reserve. Do not let us think of this as being something which comes from one side of the House. I think for perhaps both sides of the House might do a Uttle bit of thinking about this problem. Then there is the question of roads. Sooner or later the Arnhem Highway will be constructed from the East Alligator River across over the Liverpool River and into Nhulunbuy. Sooner or later it will go through, but I had rather it be later than sooner because as that highway goes through, and it can go through under this Bill, it wiU destroy the Aboriginal life in the country through which it passes. Later-in 10 yearstime.20 years time, I do not know how long-it will be safe and desirable to buUd that highway. I fear it should be buUt now. I fear the pressure that wiU come from other Aborigines, the people who come up into the Northern Territory from the south. They are better educated than the traditional Aboriginals. Perhaps they do not know as much about thenown law but they do know a lot about the white man's law and the white man's way and they tend to control and manipulate Aboriginal organisations with which they are associated. One cannot blame them. After aU, it is an opportunity for them. But I wonder whether perhaps they realise the extent to which they, who are not traditional, are destroying the way of life of the traditional people whom they seek to dominate and control. I think that this Bill is defective and I hope that the House will accept an amendment to the definition of'Aboriginal'. In clause 3 'Aboriginal' is defined as a person who is a member of the Aboriginal race of Australia. That isfineif one is not dealing with traditional land. A man who has one sixty-fourth part of Aborigmal blood would still be a member of the Aboriginal race of Australia and would still qualify under this definition. Some of these people will be able to dominate and control the areas into which they come. It was Professor Rowley, I think, who brought forward thefirstdefinition of Aboriginal that was used in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I amended it a little when I was the Minister responsible for that Department and it has been used in the Department ever since. An Aboriginal, under that definition, is somebody of Aboriginal descent who claims to be an Aboriginal and is accepted as such by the community with which he is associated. Even that small protection, which is not sufficient in relation to this traditional situation, has been removed from the Bill. The Bill deals with traditional land and the rights of traditional Aboriginals are worth protecting. If we have any decency we will look to these people about whose land we are talking in this Bill. An Aboriginal is perhaps in some ways less ready to trust another Aboriginal",65
128,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,68
129,Mr INNES,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"At the outset I would like to refer to 2 issues mentioned in the debate by the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock). One point I mention for the record is that the Labor Government was in fact the Government which took the initiative to set up the commission to investigate matters related to the campaign for Aboriginal land rights. The honourable member for Parramatta clouded the issue during the course ofhis speech. That was not the only issue. He maligned Mr Eames, a person who has done more for the Aboriginal people in one minute than the honourable member for Parramatta has done in his whole life. I refer to an attack that was made on Mr Eames by Pastor Paul Albrecht and his missionary colleagues, Mr Stoll and Mr Ziersch. In a letter to the Bulletin dated 20 November 1976 and headed 'Landrightshangup' Mr Eames had this to say: Pastor Paul Albrecht and his missionary colleagues, Mr Stoll and Mr Ziersch, base their opposition to Aboriginal land rights . . . on misconceptions and misreadings both of the legislation which has been proposed and the response to it by Aborigines. Their opposition is also motivated by a well disguised self-interest and political conservatism which has allowed them to confuse their political support for the Country Party with their responsibilities to Aborigines. Mr Sainsbury-Who wrote that?",68
130,Mr INNES,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"It was written by Geoff Eames. In another paragraph Mr Eames states: Pastor Albrecht's views on 'the Aboriginal reality' should not be regarded as authoritative. A leading authority on Aboriginal traditional ownership of land, Dr Nicholas Peterson, has said of Albrecht's proposals that 'while couched in anthropological terms (they) do ality as understood from a wide range of research'. Despite the fact that there have now been more than a dozen detailed refutations of Albrecht's opinions he has never responded to those criticisms. The powerful vested interest groups which also oppose land rights have, however, adopted Albrecht's opinion with great enthusiasm and considerable relief. The other point concerning this Bill is that it should be based on the sentiments and opinions expressed by such people as David Anderson, the executive member for information and communications of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee, Mildura. Mr Anderson suggests that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) should not arbitrate and decide on any matter as important as Aboriginal land rights and claims without thorough reference and consultation with Aboriginal leaders. The consultation could be achieved through a co-ordination body such as the National Aboriginal Claims Commission, formed as part of any compensation legislation. Mr Anderson suggested in a letter published in the Bulletin of 13 November that these discussions could take place on the following principles: The elimination on this continent of present political exploitation and social repression of any underprivileged minority. The continuance of positive and meaningful pohcies by the Minister to restore dignity and confidence to Aboriginal Australians. The minimum disruption of our community. Invoilable legislation setting aside our land and sacred rights in certain areas (regardless of whether such land is currently occupied by our people). In the event of land restitution proving mutually impracticable we seek equitable compensation. Any national acquisition of land from Aborigines must bring with it fair compensation. In circumstances where Aboriginal land is used to exploit natural resources the Aborigines receive continuing and realistic royalties, together with funding for housing, job and vocational training, employment, social development and cultural opportunities. Recompense and safeguards must be obtained by Aboriginal communities that are not necessarily relocated but who become likely subjects of social disruption caused by the presence of mining or other commercial venture. Mr Anderson also stated: The NACC, acting on behalf of aU Aboriginal Australians, wishes to avoid emotionalism on these matters and treat them in a straight out business fashion. I think that Mr Anderson's comments reflect the sentiments with which every member of this House should direct the course of this Bill. My colleague, the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson), earher tonight made a most authoritative assessment of the history, principles and inadequacies of the Bills before us. He made a most compelling case and I commend his not reflect the Aboriginal rearguments to the House. For my part, I wish to concentrate on bringing one or two specific injusaffect tices in the Bill to the attention of the House. fore I do, I would like to say how sad I am to the present Government departing so far from the principles and sound practice of the land rights Bill introduced by the Whitlam Governto ment into this House in October 1975. The most wide-ranging alterations to the Labor Government's Bui relate to the transfer legislative power from the Commonwealth Parthe liament to the control of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Unfortunately, this is coming a rather tiresome recurring feature of Government's legislation. It has become obsessed with the ideology of federalism. It made a god of it. It treats federalism as an flexible principle to be enshrined and acted at all times. FederaUsm should not be an end itself but a means to a greater end, namely maximisation of opportunities of democratic participation and accountabiUty. We, on this side of the House, are less convinced that federalist arrangements are the best means of achieving that end. Mr Sainsbury-This is a landrightsdebate.",68
131,Mr INNES,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"I am sure that the honourable member would never know it. The notion of fedfuUy eralism, as outlined by the Prime Mmister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has the effect of turning back the clock. In the same way, this legislation allow procrastination to reign supreme and allow the Government, supported by its yappers on back bench, to pass the buck and dodge its responsibUities. However, if the Government is to present this facade, it should temper its aUsm with a bit offlexibUityand common sense. On a number of occasions the Government's for anxiety to remain doctrinally true has had very opposite effect to what it is supposed to Instead of maximising opportunities and particiwhy pation, it has done the complete opposite. That will be the result from this Bill as well. By being Pontius PUate and casting off its responsibUities to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, it is in effect reducing the opportunities for igmal peoples to effectively control their own destinies, as I wiU shortly demonstrate. What are these responsibUities which the Government has bUthely handed over to the These Northern Territory Legislative Assembly? There are principallyfiveof them. Thefirstis access the sea adjoining Aboriginal land. Against the specific recommendations of the Woodward is report, such access is now to be subject to torial law. Tbis wiU have a major effect on the fishing interests of Aboriginals, and will also their overall welfare if minerals are disBecovered within this Umit. Some sacred sites also see will be affected. The secqnd is the control of entry to pastoral properties. The weaknesses of the existing ordinances were specifically referred by Mr Justice Woodward, and the Labor Government's 1975 Bill attempted to remove these weaknesses. The present Minister has not indicated that this matter wiU be acted on by the of Assembly, and judging by their performance in past there is Uttle chance of such action. beEach of these matters deserves to be discussed this at much greater length. However, owing to the constraints oftimeunder which we work, I have has decided to concentrate my discussion on the inother 3 important areas of transference of power upon to the Legislative Assembly 3 areas which will in almost certainly be the subject of complementhe tary legislation at some time in the future. Honourable members will be aware that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly wished to control all landrightslegislation. It did not quite win that battle but it did pretty well notwithstanding. It is rather gUb for the Minister to maintain, as he did in his second reading speech, that he has received assurances from the Leader of the Legislative Assembly that the Assembly is prepared to co-operate in the introduction of complementary legislation in the areas which accord with the spirit of the Bill. God knows will what the amendments do. Nobody has even had a chance to examine them sufficiently enough to the know exactly what they say. The Aborigines themselves place no store on such assurances. They know that Dr Letts, the majority leader in federthe NTLA sees a stepped-up mining program as necessary for the provision of an economic base statehood, to which he is totally committed. the Honourable members who saw Dr Letts on Four do. Comers in March will know that this is so. So does the Government swaUow these assurances so readUy? Why does it not listen to the a Aboriginal people who know their land rights will be summarily dealt with by the NTLA, and who are outraged by what they see to be the FedAboreral Government's betrayal of their interests. I now want to speak briefly on the third area Ukely to be the subject of complementary legislation-that of entry permits to Aborigmal land. will no longer be in the control of the land councUs as under the 1975 Bill. Now entry perto mits will be issued through the Northern Territoiy Legislative Assembly. This, I would submit, totally inappropriate. The appropriate body to terrihandle entry permits, as the 1975 Bill recognised, is the land councU. The land councUs are, in thefirstplace, representative of the Aboriginal people. They are composed of representatives the different Aboriginal peoples from the areas in which they operate. It is these bodies which are best placed to determine whether permits should be issued, not the members of the NorthpoUtical ern Territory Legislative Assembly, or the Northern Territory Adnunistrator whose dismining tance from the issues involved renders them the singularly unsuited for the task. The Minister might be prepared to accept the bland assurthey ances of Dr Letts. Like the Aborigines, I am cynical. Permits for entry into Aboriginal land need to be controlled by the traditional land owners free from Government interference. All those yahoos, including the honourable member for Swan, may laugh. They should go up to diction Areyonga and some of the areas in which Aborsafeguards igines are being treated like second class citizens. They should have the guts to have a go. It is easy to see that the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is caving into the rabid nonsense of the argument which asks: 'Why dinance should they be allowed to keep us out? It's a country'. It is too easy to see the NTLA in shameful acts of paternalism and poltiical sorship by refusing entry to people who lieves would be 'bad' for the Aborigines, such people it deems to be stirrers. Indeed, I this nice piece of poltiical cynicism may well the motivation behind this aspect of the Bill. In fact, if there are people in this House who sceptical of this claim, let them take note of Letts' proposal that poUce have automatic rightable of entry without permits. Other pubUc officers, such as teachers, stock inspectors and health inspectors, will have to seek permits. Why shouldYet we distinguish between types of important public officials in this way? Honourable members will forgive me, I hope, if I come to these obvious conclusions. Mr Martyr-No , we don't.",69
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND," Aboriginalrightsto Order! I note that the honourable member for Swan and the honourable member for Edenno Monaro are both Usted to speak on this Bill. I suggest that they keep then* repUes to the bly, honourable member for Melbourne until they are malting their speeches.",70
133,Mr INNES,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"When the honourable member they for Swan gets his riding instructions from Santamaria. Fourthly, I wish to discuss the cruage cial issue of control, declaration and protection of sacred sites. ResponsibUity for this, too, been handed over to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly has had an ordinance to control sacred sites for some time. It is generally that the truth? of regarded as the weakest such legislation in Australia, and not one site has been declared in the last 18 months despite constant requests from Aborigines. The declaration of sites is a highly activity. A site declared where an open cut mine is about to be dug could prejudice the operation. This is the real reason to fear Assembly controlling the declaration of sites. In any event, Assembly men have shown that believe sites are tiny patches of land around too which one can place a fence. They have no comprehension of the real meaning to Aborigines of sacred sites. This situation is just not good enough. There needs to be more adequate protection of sacred sites. The proper seat of jurisshould be the land councils, with ultimate provided in the form of legislation passed by this Parliament. We take the responsibility, not the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Moreover, this needs to be done as a matter of urgency because the existing NTLA oris totaUy inadequate. Very few sites have freeever been declared under the ordinance, even engaging though many sacred sites have been cendocumented, and constant demands made that it bethey be declared. Yet the Country Party as dominated NTLA does nothing, and by its inacbelieve tivity reveals its true motivations. be One example of the importance and urgency of this matter is seen in the Mt Isa area where Mt are Isa Mines Pty Ltd wants to put a pipeline Dr through an area full of sacred sites. If they are to destroy the sacred sites before they are declared, then the Borroloola people have lost evidence for their traditional claim to that land. this Government would have us believe that the NTLA, dominated by the National Countiy Party which shamelessly acts as an electoral front for its chents in the mining industry wiU act to thwart the wishes of its great and powerful cUents. Finally, I wish to discuss briefly the issue of hunt protected wUdUfe in Aboriginal lands. The Government's Bill makes provision for this matter. Again, it has been left to the Northern Territory Legislative Assemwhich has indicated that it mtends insisting that Aborigines walk and only use traditional weapons when they hunt, whereas at present use cars and rifles. It has been put to me by individuals that old men of 75 and 80 years of have to walk to their traditional sites. It is a disgraceful situation when these men are hunted has down and are not permitted into these areas in thencars. Does the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) deny that? Is not",70
134,Mr CALDER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,You must be joking.,71
135,Mr INNES,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"If he does not go, he should go along to the Areyonga community and tell the people there that he does not believe them.",71

141,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,Order! I suggest to bate the honourable member for Melbourne that he should not ask the honourable member for Northern Territory to comment on his speech the moment when I have just asked that there beform no interjections.,71
142,Mr INNES,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"Le t me just say that as a general principle I believe that where possible preserwith vation of such an important part of our heritage as our unique wUdhfe should be the responsithe bUity of the Australian Government. Especially should this be the case in this instance, though not because Aboriginal hunting with extinction. The Aborigines are dependent on meat obtained from hunting. One study that, between May 1974 and March 1975, 60 70 per cent of the meat diet came from hunting. expired. Moreover, many eminent conservationists, including senior officers of the Division WUdlife Research of the Commonwealth Scienthoroughly tific and Industrial Research Organisation, have affirmed that Aboriginal hunting poses no threat to the survival of native species, although introduced animals such as foxes, camels and rabbits do, and overstocking by pastoraUsts does. Between them these examples of the white man's stupidity-some , unfortunately, are contemporand ary examples-hav e driven many species to extinction. Moreover, the reason why modern weapons and vehicles are frequently used for hunting is that in many cases the old hunting skills tragically have been lost. To tell Aborigines to hunt on foot with traditional weapons is theremany fore ludicrous. It is like dropping a batch members of this House-God bless them-in the outback, arming them with nuUa-nullas and teUlocal ing them to go off and catch some dinner. Yet this is precisely what the Northern Legislative Assembly is proposing to do. Honourable members opposite would starve to death. They have never done a day's work in their Ufe. Time is short. This Bill has many enormous implications. I would Uke to go on and talk about the anti-social greed of the grasping mining com[ >anies whose record in relation to Aboriginal andrightsis a shabby one indeed. I would Uke to have had the opportunity to say something in depth about the emasculation of the land councUs. In connection with the latter, I ask the Government to restore the powers of the land councils and land commissioners, as recommended by the Woodward Commission and as previously operated under the Labor Government. I wUlfinishon this point: This is a most important piece of legislation. What I have not covered in this speech in the second reading deI certainly will take the time to talk about in the Committee stage. I hope that we will have the the necessary time to examine what these at amendments really mean. If they run true to they wUlfinishup as a sleight-of-hand trick, Uke the rest of this Government's legislation. I also hope that in this one instance the Government does not become confused and run riot the crippling ideological grip of its doctrine federalism. I hope that the Government allows Federal Parliament to take into account the problems of the Aboriginal people and that it has enough guts to make the appropriate decisions to threatens species protect them. found Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)to Order! The honourable member's time has",71
143,Mr CALDER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND," I of am afraid that I have not the time to deal with all the remarks of previous speakers. I hope that sometime later I will be able to deal with them. I certainly would Uke to ask the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Innes) to go to Areyonga and try to get the local Aborigines to show him their sacred sites. He has been complaining. I am asking him to go there see how he gets on. He mightfindout why the sacred sites are not mapped, why they have not been declared and so on. I also would like him to go to the Northern Territory and talk to Mr Ron Withnall or Mr Rupert Kentish, men who have been in the Legislative Assembly for years. The latter has Uved in Arnhem Land of for 39 years and is married to a. Goulburn Islander. People such as them wiU be making the legislation which the honourable member has rubbished to such extent. He should go to the Territory area andfindoutMr Innes- I have been there.",71
144,Mr CALDER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"Once, yes. I support the introduction of landrightsfor Aborigines in the Northern Territory. This Bill, it is hoped, will give Northern Territoiy Aborigines the abUity to practise their law and traditions on their own land in their own manner. This is good. I am that all Territorians and Australians will be pleased that this has come about. Having said that, I admit that I do not agree with some parts of the legislation. I will say on that later. The 1975 Bill on the same matter, which was introduced by the Labor Party, would have been a disaster for Aborigines and Europeans in the Territory, had it got through the House. That Bill was discriminatory, divisive and utterly disastrous. Both Aborigines and Europeans in the Territory know that. The 1976 Bill is based on the previous Bill-the Labor Party's almost unannounced vote-catching Few had a chance to see it before the 1975 elecI tions. People did not know what was going on. the They did not have the faintest idea what it was all about. I do not think that they reaUy underThis stand it to this day. However, this Bill improvement. Much work has been done on becontinued: half of the Aborigines and by the Aborigines to find out about the implications and the meaning to of this Bill. It is hoped that this Bill will satisfy the Aborigines' traditional land aspirations. Ueve that a real effort has been made by this liament to find the right solution on land rights, so that the traditional owners may control then* land. I hope that the thrust of this Bill is successful. I would like to warn the Government on sevreceived eral aspects of this legislation. Thefirstconcerns the definition of 'Aborigine'. This matter has been raised everytimea Bill has been introduced concerning Aboriginal land, councUs, associdetaU. ations and so on. Only very recently finition from a man who is not supporting me in I have what I as a Territorian am trying to do for traiginal ditional Aborigines. This man is on the side of traditionally, the large land councUs and supported the presystem vious Labor Bill. A correct definition of 'Aborcisions igine' is not contained in this Bill. It was not his contained in the Labor Bill. The definition of traditionally 'Aborigine', which I heard very recently was: 'Someone of Aboriginal descent who is accepted as an Aborigine by Aborigines in the community in which he lives'. That is a very sound approach The to the definition of'Aborigine'. It was given to sumed me by a man who is respected very much in cercauses, tain quarters and who had a lot to do with the rules. compilation of the Woodward report. I hope that matters some notice will be taken of that definition. This Bill concerns the granting of traditional rights land in the Northern Territory for the benefit of here. Aborigines and for other purposes in the NorthShe ern Territory. This is relevant, as this land in Northern Territory is Aboriginal land. It is not southern land, eastern land or western land. We sure Territorians are keen to see that the rightful owners gain the ownership and control of their land. I turn now to the land councUs. It is generally reported from various sources that the Abormore igines support the Bill. All Aborigines welcomed landrights;but they did not understand in the first place the land councUs as envisaged in the Bill. They understood the land councUs to involve their own clan-the tribal landowners. I hasten to assure the Minister that I feel he has done much to alleviate this problem. But I am warning the Government generally of it. I would Uke to read what Dr Peter Ucko said about this Bill. matter. He said: have a tape . . . of a meeting which I held with several traditional leaders immediately after the meeting of Central Land Council. is dated 20 July; so it would have been the is an one in Alice Springs about that time. He In this interview these traditional people make it very clear me that they do not consider that anything like a Land Council can adequately reflect their traditional mterests. I beThat is what the Doctor had to say then. Of Parcourse, in addition we had the submission from StoU, Ziersch, Pfitzner and Fargner. I think the Minister has received their conclusions and also those of the Hay Commitiee, so I will try not to mention them in detaU. About the same time, I a letter dated 29 July from Dr Sharpe who said simUar sorts of things. It is a quite long letter and I do not want to have it aU incorporated in Hansard because it goes into some I wiU try to read some of what she says, I heard a dewriting from AUce Springs: learnt a lot more about the social structure in Aborsociety since being here; . . . The position is that land ownership is vested in a patrilineal clan, the leader of which ascends to the position according to a not unlike our royal succession. He makes all defor the group, he will not discuss matters to do with group with leaders of other groups, particularly groups hostile to his own (and such could be near neighbours). If younger unrecognised men attempted to decide for the group, the penalty was death. This was written in July 1976. She continues: traditional penalty is still current in Central Australia, and whites in Aboriginal confidence know of deaths, preor 'proved' by white authority to be due to other which are penalty deaths for infringement of tribal Any attempt to get dan leaders together to discuss will lead either to no real communication, or to friction and possibly deaths. Hence the very real danger is that the setting up of a council or advisory group to dedde land will bring bloodshed and dedmation of Aborigines goes on to ask the person to whom the letter the is written to use influence to scrap or modify the present Bill. I do not know Dr Sharpe, but this is what she has written and I think people should know that these things have been written. much for Dr Sharpe. Also, I would like to incorsouth porate in Hansard two of the transcripts which came from the Aboriginal people. I have asked the Minister about their incorporation. They are 2 transcripts taken at random from afileof such transcripts which I would say is about 2 h inches granted. thick.

They camped here. Well, we're looking for these people now. If the people that took the tjurungas admit it, they have to give it back! ESROM: Anybody can't claim another people's land.

What I am saying is that there seems to be a general opinion which is supported throughout Australia, including this and the Northern Territory, by certain who are expressing views. I am speaking Uke this only to try to get through to the Government that when the proposed committee has been formed it will have to look very carefully, as been mentioned by the Mmister, at the operI of the lands rights legislation and give conto the complementary legislation passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. So I am saying that there are many things that have to be looked at when this legislation is passed. I do not have time to read the f ietition which was presented in the Parliament, t seems to be the butt of a certain amount of criticism which I hope to havetimeto discuss. see that theBriefly, it states: Aboriginal law does not permit pieces of land held Aboriginal tide to be placed into land trusts encompassing more than one piece of traditionally held land. That Aboriginal law does not permit an organisation or a body made up of Aborigines from different clans to speak on is And so it goes on. These are the things I am trying to get written into the record. I am supporting the legislation, but on this occasion I warn about these things. This is the petition about which Mr Eames is so concerned. I have a letter here signed by a Mr Huey, the Assistant Director, southern branch of the Depanment of Aboriginal Affairs, stop we which is dated 3 November 1976 and in which land trust myhe says that SO Aborigines representing come to communities-the sons of ones that I have menthis matter stop We want to see and we tioned-spoke with him.

There is a lot more of this in that vein. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard also.",75
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. The document read asfollowsPastor P. Albrecht, Superintendent, Finke River Mission, P.O. Box 48, AUce Springs, N.T. 5750 Dear Pastor Albrecht, As agreed after my meetings with the Aboriginals at the Mission Block on 27 and 28 mary of the report which I have submitted to Central Office in Canberra. 'About 50 Aboriginals representing communities Hermannsburg and a number of cattle stations have concluded a series of meetings to which I was invited lengthy periods on 27 and 28 October. These men were mostly important ones from the concerned. The discussion grew out of their understanding that the presentiy proposed was invited to further explain its provisions especially regard to land trusts and land councils. It should that the conference was held at the Lutheran Mission to which a number had come on Mission business only to some how hear of the Government's 'go-ahead' presumably from Albrecht. The other representatives were therefore summoned so that the meeung became a Land Rights conference. After fairly exhaustive discussion several important become clear and at their request I undertook to the Minister their view that the present Bill (a) does equately recognise their land owning system and (b) that they would rather wait for individual land trusts formed, recognising that this will inevitably delay title to them. Whether or not some of these people had been washed is difficult to assess and is probably not relevant. can only be impressed by the strength of their that the Bill does not satisfactorily achieve landrightsand' that it will cause serious friction. The meeting on 28 October was at my request as I them to have a further chance to hear the provisions again explained. Pastor Albrecht was present for this session translation which was subject to check by Wenton Rubuntja Chairman of the Land Council. Time did not permit an exhaustive discussion of tude to the Land Council but from the discussion on the day it is practically certain that they reject this concept It was made clear to them that it was the Government's intention to pass the Bill substantially in its present that therefore they would need to make a special request to the Minister to consider excluding Hermannsburg, Creek, Utopia and Ti-Tree from its operation (I realise last two are not within the present framework.) Prior we had gone over at length the problems involved in ate land trusts for each clan group and the delays involved surveys and transfer of title, thattimeetc. None of these arguments had any impression. Naturally I told the group that I did not know Government's reaction to their request would be. Clearly whole issue is of considerable importance to them clearly we must look at the legal impUcation i.e. does J uesently allow an option for the Minister not to estabUsh and trust in respect of certain ule: and to provide for the exclusion of certain areas operation of the clauses dealing with the establishment of land councils. At present it would seem that it is obligatory on the Minister (the word 'shall' is used), to estabUsh a land trust for each area in the schedule and to estabUsh two land councUs encompassing the whole of the Northern Territory. Would appreciate advice on your reaction.' This information is furnished to you on the understanding that you will disseminate it amongst the groups concerned. Yours sincerely, 3 Nov. 1976 R.HUEY A/Assistant Director (Southern Branch) October, the following is a sum",76
150,Mr CALDER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"This would answer the very trenchant criticism circulating around the House from this evening concerning an honourable senator today and myself. It was stated that we were gutterfor snipes or liars. But this is a letter written by a departmental official about the very petition to areas which we were referring. I would like to say now to the Minister that I am pleased to have received bill will shortly be passed and I in his assurance that primary industry-that takes in be noted mining-wil l be adequately protected. Whether Block it is a matter of looking after Aborigines or whites, the Territory has to befinanced,and we have the resources. These developments, as has happened in the past, have suppUed money and jobs for Aborigines as well as for whites. So the things hate we have heard poured out tonight by certain convey to honourable members for mining companies and, not adneedless to say, pastoraUsts is quite stupid, beto because when one gets into the Territory one finds grant of that the Aborigines who might be working with the Yuendumu mining company, at Macarthur brainRiver or on a cattle station do not make these One complaints. They are made by people who are convictions - advising the Aborigines what to say. I am worried about the position of traditional wanted owners, and it is on this point that I and my Senfor ate colleague have taken a stand with respect to this Bill. I commend the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs on his tremendous efforts to meet all their attiopinion-ou r opinion, on the one hand, and the first opinion of others, on the other hand-in trying to also. see that Aborigines in the Northern Territoiy get control and correct management of what is theirs form and and that they do not get short changed on any Jay mining deals. I am in favour of that, and every the mining company I have seen in the Northern to this Territory since I can remember has said: 'We separadmit that there is a duty on our part to see that in the Aborigines receive the correct royalty or the the lack of safe-guards during correct percentage - of what should be their right what the with regard to then land'. I wiU not havetimeto the go into this matter any further, but the honourand able member for WUls (Mr Bryant) in, I would the Bill hope, a humourous speech, said: 'You do not a trust the Country Party, especially when it conareas described in the schedfrom the cerns Aboriginals'. I remind him of the efforts of the Legislative Assembly in regard to the permit system.",76
151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND, Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,77
152,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND," I do not want to join issue with the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) on anything that relates to Aborigines. We are 127 people in this House and we all need to be very modest in assuming that any of us are speaking for Aborigines. So what we are putting forward are tentative points of view that we are trying to vindicate. I want to turn to the reference made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory to the timing of the Labor Government's 1975 Bill. He said that we were trying to sneak through before an election. If the honourable member for the Northern Territory reflects he will recall that the late Labor Government assumed that having been elected in May 1974, the next election would be in May 1977.1 assure the honourable member for the Northern Territory that when the Aboriginal Land Rights Bill was brought in we did not know that the Senate was going to withhold consent for Supply and that the Governor General was going to dismiss us. We were very far from the illusion that we could sneak anything unscratinised through this Parhament because we had more Bills rejected in the Senate in our 3 years of government than had been rejected in the previous 72 years. So we had no illusions about lack of scrutiny. We might agree or disagree with the Senate's actions, but I am merely saying that people who experience those actions do not assume that their legislation is not going to be under parliamentary scrutiny. That is a logical enough point to make. The other point on which I politically disagree with the honourable member concerns devolution of the Aboriginal authority to the Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory. I do not have to argue whether it would be better changing or not; I merely say that on democratic grounds in May 1967 in the one referendum in the whole our history of this country which one could say was a really carried, because it was carried in every say polling place, the Australian people expressed and we the opinion that the national Parliament was the written proper Parhament to handle Aboriginal affairs. I lation do not believe that we get from that result an the authority to start divesting ourselves of our must responsibilities towards Aborigines. However, general that is a poltiical point of view. On the subject of the wUlingness of other people to speak on behalf of the Aboriginal people, I remember when I was a member of the Select Committee on Aboriginal Voting Rights, which was set up by a Liberal government, that we were proceeding down the coast of Queensland and representatives of various organisations came before us to give evidence. None of these spokesmen were ever Aborigines. I developed the habit of saying: 'Has your organisation any Aboriginal members?' They would reply: 'Yes'. Then I would ask: 'Why don't you put them in the witness box?' Then there would be consternation. As this question was asked at every place as we came down the coast later some of the organisations were shamed into putting Aborigines in the witness box, and then one reaUsed why they had not done so before. It was because the Aborigines it never stuck to anybody's policy line-no t the policy line of the Communist Party, the Labor Party or the Liberal Party. They said genuinely and authentically what they believed, and the authentic voice of the Aborigine as I have heard it through interpreters-man y Aborigines are magnificent orators in their own languages-never , but never, utters the slogans of New York Black Power, nor the opinions of mining companies, or of any of the other voices that are presented to us here. The landrightsquestion on the whole brings to us the authentic voice of Aborigines because the people with a claim to land in reaUty tend to be authentically Aboriginal. The tragedy of vaUd action on the question of land rights is that the States of Western Australia and Queensland are not taking the fundamental action that they should be taking and action on this question is virtuaUy confined to the Commonwealth. I believe that the clan leaders from Galiwinku in the Northern Territory wrote to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) in that authentic the voice when they said things such as: We commence by saying that it is a sad thing for us that the Balanda-That is, the whites-peopl e are constantly laws. We the Aboriginal people have established laws which are permanent and we make our decisions in agreement with our laws. We are fearful that having given decisions and come to agreement with this Government succeeding Government may change it all again. We also that we consider Arnhem land belongs to Yolngu people must retain rights to restrict entry and this should be into this Bill, If it is not and the permit system comes under the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Legisthen the Administrator of the Permit system must ask Yolngu (traditional owners) before he says yes. Yolngu say yes first. If anyone wants anything (re permits) he must ask the Administrator and Adminstrator must ask us. In matters Administrator or Minister must come back to the Yolngu traditional owners first. If anyone breaks the law that person should be fined S1,000. I will not read all the letter but the sentiments that are expressed in it are their sentiments. One of the honourable members who has been interjecting asked why matters should not be sent to the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. Both in this letter to the Minister and in the evidence given before the Senate Select Committee on Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders whose chairman is an Aboriginal, Senator Bonner, there seemed to be expressed a distrust of handing things over to the Northern Territoiy Legislative Assembly. The Senate Committee made these comments in its recommendations and suggestions: That the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1976, which was introduced on 4 June 1976, be considered for early passage through the Parliament That thefollowingmatters should remain the responsiowners bility of the Australian Parliament and GovernmentMany of them do not under this legislation1. Protection of fauna on Aboriginal lands. 2. Right ofentry on Aboriginal lands. That is what these people have written to the the Minister. The list continues: 3. Protection of sacred sites. 4. Processing of land claims in towns and other where traditional claims cannot be effectively established. 5. Control of territorial seas adjoining Aboriginal within 2 kilometres of the boundary of the land. 6. Rights of Aborigines to enter on pastoral leases. 7. Therightto mining on Aboriginal lands. That funds be provided to enable Aborigines themselves on any land which they are given. That the Government accept cash compensation alternative to grants of land to Aboriginal people. The Committee then makes some recommendations about the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. I quite agree with the honourable member for the Northern Territory that it is no use going round inciting hatred of pastoralists or mining companies. It does not follow, however, that we are obliged to agree with everything that they say. Senator Fred Chaney, who is a Liberal Party member of the upper House and the son of a former Liberal Party Administrator of the Northern Territory, was moved to deal with the mining companies because of references that they had made to the folly of suggesting that Aboriginal land owners should have some say over mining of their land and suggestions that they made that this right was not accorded to Europeans. Senator Chaney wrote: - I refer to the statement on mining and Aboriginal published in your newspaper by the Australian Mining Industry Council. The statement expresses concern about Aboriginal owners being empowered to veto mining on their land and having in effect therightto sell mining permits. It is these two powers are not available to Australians generally. In fact owners of land in Australia are given substantial protection against mining without the land owner's consent. The extent of protection varies from state to state, but in my state of Western Australia all developed and cultivated land is protected. Even pasture, including uncleared pasture, cannot be mined without the consent of the owner and occupier if it is in bonafideand regular use. In many cases this gives the private land owner the opportunity to bargain with miners about the terms on which consent will be given. If traditional Aboriginal land owners putting their land to bonafideand regular use in the traditional way are given the same protection, it cannot be said that Aborigmal people are given powers 'discriminately'. Indeed the use of that term is regrettable as it may well cause unnecessary resentment. As a lawyer I haverepresentedwhite private land owners against mining compames and mining companies against white private land owners. In all cases I have found the land anxious to preserve their propertyrightsand in Western Australia, at least, the law effectively enabled them to do it when the land was in bonafideandregularuse as a farm or grazing property. It must be remembered also that the law must be effective to protect both black and white land owners, not only against legitimate mining companies but also against fringe operators who appear from ume totimeand particularly when the industry is booming. areas I think that was an extremely sensible statement by Senator Chaney pointing out that it is not unknown in Australia for land owners to have land, rights as against mining companies and therefore Aboriginal there was nothing outrageous in the proposal that they should have some authority over the land which will be declared to be theirs when to sustain they are confronted by a mining interest. The alterations to the Australian Labor as an Party's Bill that I object to strongly, for the reasons that I have already given, relate to the transfer of legislative powers from the Commonwealth Parliament to the control of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. They include the control, declaration and protection of sacred sites, the control of entry to pastoral properties, the control of entry to Aborigmal land and access to the sea adjoining Aboriginal land. It seems to me to be rather tragic that the Senate Committee picked up an opposite opinion on all of those points from the Aboriginal witnesses who apparently came before it. I think that this would justify some hesitation by the Government before going ahead with the changes that are proposed in these respects to what was in the Labor Party's Bill. The map which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) was kind enough to supply to land honourable members shows that very large areas of land are acknowledged as being in Aboriginal ownership by this Bill. It is so very important that land other criticisms, except for the vulnerabiUty of said that this matter, as I feel, to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, do not have to be made. The areas marked blue, which indicate land to which an Aboriginal claim is not as yet Ushed, are, by comparison with the areas marked red, where the claim is acknowledged, comparaowners tively small areas. The honourable member for the Northern Territory complained about inciting hostility pastoralists and I think he isrightin doing so. they are not necessarily people who are sensitive to the needs of the Aboriginal community. In this respect I am not trying to depict them as being more vUlainous than the general run of Ausamong them. traUans. Throughout our history we have not proved ourselves to be in any respect particularly sensitive towards the Aborigines. The Minister for Health (Mr Hunt), who recently cheered us with the statement that he made about the arships national trachoma and eye health program in relation to Aborigines, supported Fred HoUows, who I understand started his work under the that Labor Government in the eye survey of Aborigicourse nal people and others in the Northern Territory. I think that one of the tactful aspects of activities of the body conducting that program was that it recognised that all people in the traUan outback and not just Aborigines were need of attention to their eyes. I believe that whole of this operation began not particularly with Aborigines m mind but with the situation mind that there were 280 ophthalmologists in Sydney but not one in Wagga and various other places. First of all, this body began thinking in terms of a countiy operation and, when it was suggested that the people most in need were Aborigines, there was agreement The Commonwealth Government backed the action and this body began to develop the tact not being divisive when it was on a station but testing mum's eyes, dad's eyes and the cluldren's eyes and providing them with glasses and then having access to the Aborigines. What depressed me in the accounts I heard of the operations was the number of Aborigines ting about on stations who had pearly white eyes, which was simply indicative of cataracts. I am only making the point that if one is sensitive and if one has common knowledge one would know that that was a condition of cataract and that suggestion that there be an operation and chance to have an operation could be offered. do not think that it was estabUshed by that exspeech pedition that all the people in the Northern ritory were particularly sensitive to the health needs of Aborigines, even when they were as completely obvious as that. I think this appUes aU the Aboriginal communities. I am not suggesting that these divisions in the estabAustralian community are unique between colour. I understand that it is not normal for ship to have dinner with waterside workers. We have aU these sorts of cleavages of social association and normal social association in the Australian community. But there are large to numbers of European people who do not have But normal social associations with the Aborigines and therefore do not know what they think. They do not have to be remote from Aborigines in cities for that to be the truth. They can be Uving I have been thanked for being the founder of the isolated chUdren's grants and then denounced by the same people for extending scholto aU Aboriginal cluldren in the secondary level. That was descrimination. I say to the honourable member for the Northern Territory if discrimination is justified I believe in it. Of I believe in discrimination in a compensatory way. We are always discriminating m our legislation. We discriminate for people who were the wounded in war with repatriation grants because they need them. Aborigines at the present time Ausneed a great deal of discrimination in their in favour, and we did estabUsh a system of comthe pensatory education. I encountered in the Northern Territoiy the slogan that we were discrimiin nating for Aborigines, and so we were. The only E oint was whether it was justified. They have een discriminated against for long enough.",77
153,Mr CALDER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,They used to come home with my kids at the weekends. Is that what you call on that point. discrimination?,79
154,Mr BEAZLEY,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"I am speaking of the need for of discrimination where people are in need. I am of not speaking about adverse determination or accusing anybody of adverse discrimination at the moment. I was making a case for it. I found that many people who attacked me in the Northern Territory-the y might have been quite righthad no idea that there was any case for any sort sitof compensation for Aborigines. The honourable member for the Northern Territory must know that a Bill such as this, if it is supported widely in the Northern Territory, the represents an immense movement of opinion in the the Northern Territory compared with what I existed in August 1952 when I made a land rights in this House-so far as I know it was the Terfirst one-and the whole speech was regarded as ratherridiculous.When we were taking evidence in the Northern Territoiy many of the officers of to the Crown held that we could not work out or devise a tribal tide. Apparently we can. I merely say that this is an instance in which opinion moved. The sad thing about this Bill is the devolution of Commonwealth responsibiUty back to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I believe that that is a mistake and I errors. believe that it is against the articulated opinion of the Aboriginal people and against the berMention articulated opinion of the Australian people hi a Mackellar referendum.",79
155,Mr VINER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,h i reply- I thank aU honourable members who have participated in this imporm tant debate.,80
156,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,Are you closing the debate?,80
157,Mr VINER,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND,"Yes . I remind members of the Opposition who tended to be critical of the ing of the debate on this legislation that anxiety of the Government to see this legislation passed through this House and the other place before the close of the present parliamentary sion has been known for some time. The Oppothe sition also knows that representations were inever vited from the pubUc on the Bill that I introduced on 4 June. It is interesting to note that the Labor Party put in a representation to me. So it is not if it had not formulated its ideas as to what ought to be in the Bill. It is not as if members of Labor Party were caught unprepared for a bate today on the contents of the Bill and on the major points at issue which have been thrown by the representations. Let me finally put the position clearly: When the Government's amendments were provided quently to the Opposition this morning it naturaUy enough desiredtimein which to consider them. After consultations between both sides, as is courtesy of the House, it was agreed that the Committee stage of the debate on the Aborigmal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill would be stood over until the first week recess next week. That is at least the usual afforded to an Opposition to prepare to debate matter in this way and more than usual, if we to get a little trifling, having regard to the notice that the Opposition received from my public traditional statement last week. In closing the second reading debate I could go on at some length and point out the many errors in the speech of the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). It rather astounds me, having Ustened to a debate on a matter of public importance in which he led for the Oppothe sition sometimeago and having heard him again today to recall that he is a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, more particularly when there were so many errors in his speech on the last has mentioned occasion, just as there were in his speech today. I will have the opportunity during the Committee stage, when we debate particular provisions in the Bill, to deal with some of those was made by the honourable memfor Hughes and the honourable member for (Mr Wentworth) of the matter of roads. I think there is some misunderstanding on the part of both honourable gentlemen about the provisions of the Bill. I shall refer to them shortly order to clarify the point. In clause 11 (2) and clause 12 (3) of the Bill there is a reservation of pubUc roads from the grant of freehold title. They are roads over which the pubUc has a right of way. I am advised that the only such roads timexist through the Yuendumu Reserve, being the the beef road from Alice Springs to Western Australia; the Jay Creek Reserve; the Hermannsburg Reserve, being the roads to Palm VaUey sesand Glen Helen; and the Beswick reserve, being road to Mainoru Station. No permits have been required of people using these roads to travel on to other destinations. The exclusion of the roads from the Bill by the provisions I have as mentioned will change nothing. With the greatest respect to both honourable gentlemen, if they the had read the Bill they would have seen that declause 68 preserves the status of lands as reserves, being those lands which are outlined in upthe Schedule. This could mean that anyone using the pubUc roads technicaUy would still require a permit to enter an Aboriginal reserve and conseAboriginal control over the road is possible. Furthermore, clause 65 guarantees that no roads are constructed in Aboriginal land without the the consent in writing of the Land Council. Clause 66 gives Aborigines control of entry into Aboriginal land and hence control of existing roads other than the pubUc access roads I have of sitting after the mentioned. time Great play was made, particularly by honoura able members on my side of the House, of the like concern of the Government and of individual members to protect the traditional interests of Aborigines. This is what this Bill is aU about. The Government had been very careful to see that that is just what this Bill does. At all points where the mterests of traditional owners are at stake the former Bill introduced by the Labor Administration has been strengthened by what we have done, so as to entrench in the law interests of those traditional Aboriginal owners. I mentioned in my second reading speech, and I point this out to honourable members again, that clause 67 of the Bill is fundamental to all else that is provided. Clause 67 of the Bill entrenches in Australian domestic law for first time the customary rights of Aborigines cording to their traditional interests. One might look at this legislation and the framework of it creating within our framework of domestic law an umbrella' underneath which the customary interests of Aborigines might prevail and tected by Australian domestic law for the first time. This is reflected in the position of land councils and their relationship to traditional owners, and the position of land trusts and the requirement that membership of the land trusts be drawn from traditional owners. I direct the attention all honourable members who are concerned under about these particular aspects of the legislation to what was said by His Honour Mr Justice Woodward in paragraphs 83,84,95,96, and of his 1974 report. Mr Justice Woodward was thoroughly conscious of the need to provide within Australia domestic law for the traditional interests of Aborigines. He was conscious of need to provide a system of law within which position of traditional owners is respected and entrenched. I know the views of Pastor Albrecht. I have sat with him and his 2 assistants at Hertheir mannsburg for 2 days and discussed his propthe ositions at length. I respect the views which holds. However, they are not the views which are held by respected anthropologists or by others who have studied this area of Aboriginal interest for many years. With due respect to the views Pastor Albrecht, I do not accept them. I think that what His Honour Mr Justice Woodward has provided in his report and what is reflected this legislation will do all that is required vide for the traditional ownershiprightsof igines in the Northern Territory. It was pointed out to me tonight by traditional Aborigines from the top end of the Northern Territory that the Aboriginal concept of the cusaccept todian of their land has a close similarity to notion within our law and according to our conthrough cept of a trustee of land for beneficiaries. It pointed out that there could be a conjunction of Aboriginal interest and Australian domestic legal interest through the identity of the Aboras iginal who is the custodian and who might be the trustee for the Aborigines of their rights through membership of the land trust. feel that whatever might be said about the which material provided to the House by the honournotrepeathere able member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder) from those Aborigines around Hermade mannsburg, there will not be the friction they fear when this legislation is put into operation. They willfindthat when the land trusts and the councils are set up in the way provided, when acthey operate in the way intended, there will not be the friction which has been spoken about. Nor as will the legislation, as it operates, be so diametrically opposed to what has been termed the Aboriginalrealityas has been put forward by be prothose antagonists of the legislation. The honourable member for Mackellar always speaks from a depth of understanding and knowledge about Aborigines. He is concerned to maintain the intregrity of the traditional Aboriginal. So are we all. He is concerned to maintain the integrity of the Aboriginal reserves in the of Northern Territoiy. So are we all. That is why, this legislation, those reserves will automatically become Aborigmal land clothed with the title which this legislation provides. The 361 intregrity of which the honourable member speaks inrelationto mining will, of course, be provided through the veto power which came under such attack from certain quarters within the the community but which was maintained by the the Government intact for the very good reason that we sought to maintain the integrity of Aboriginal ownership in the Aboriginal sense of what is land. I .am quite sure in my own mind that integrity of which the honourable member he for Mackellar speaks will be maintained through this veto power and the other protections which are provided for in the legislation. This was a matter which perplexed His Honour Mr Justice of Woodward. It perplexed many people as to how to balance the interests of Aborigines with the ieculiar and unique nature of their interest in f in and and the demands of the whole Australian to prosociety for development where it is in the Abornational interest. It was proposed to Mr Justice Woodward that Aborigines should also have therightsto minerals within their land. He was not prepared to that, but did see it as absolutely necessary our that there be adequate protection for Aborigines the veto power and the other protections was which he indicated and which are written into this legislation to see that Aboriginal interests are provided. The Opposition has made great play, was to be expected, about the intention of the also Government to allow to the Legislative land Assembly of the Northern Territory room in Iwhich to pass ordinances with respect to the area is called complementary legislation. I shall what I said in my second reading speech, what I said in the public statement. I last Thursday and what I said in the statement which I made in the House preceding this secondreadingdebate. I simply point out that land what will happen is that the Legislative Assembly will make laws in this area for the administration of sacred sites, iginal land and for protection and conservation of wildlife. If those laws are not made in accordthe ance with the stipulations in the Bill which will within be introduced by the amendments, then those approval. laws will be invalid. But even before that point might come, of course, the Commonwealth has statutory power to withhold consent to the nances. Of course, the ordinances do not become law until that assent is given. I conclude by reminding honourable members opposite, as I have pointed out in my statement, that central to the Government's desires is that administration of Aboriginal land be channelled through land councils. A function of the land councils will be to perform those functions which the Northern Territory ordinances will provide. Of course, the Government against the backgive ground of those observations will see that land councils, the body representing Aborigines, gnat. will be centrally located in the administration the ordinances in all these areas. I thank able gendemen for their contributions. There much more than can be said and will be said the Committee stages to explain further the many errors which have been made, particularlytruction on the Opposition side. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. The Bill.",80
158,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINES AND THEIR LAND," I have an amendment relating to clause 30, which in part: (5) Where the Minister approves any by-laws, he shall cause the by-laws to be laid before each House of ment within 15 sitting days of that House after the his approval. (6) If any by-laws are not laid before each House Parliament in accordance with sub-section (5), the shall be void and of no effect. (7) Where any by-laws have been laid before a House the Parliament in accordance with sub-section (5) tion, sub-sections (4), (5) Interpretation Act 1901-1973 apply in relation to laws as if they were regulations. I move: Omit sub-clauses (5), (6) and (7). The issue is a quite elementary one. It is to effect: The Bill proposes that in relation to Abor-tification iginal councils which make by-laws there are be disallowance provisions. Sub-clauses (S), (6) and (7) apply to those disallowances. Sub-clause for entry to Abor- (5) states: Where the Minister approves any by-laws, he shall cause by-laws to be laid before each House of the Parliament 15 sitting days of that House after the giving ofhis Sub-clause (6) goes on to provide that if the by-laws are not laid before each House of ParUaordiment they shall be void and of no effect. Subclause (7) indicates that these processes are to be treated under the Acts Interpretation Act as if they were regulations. The simple proposition which the Opposition is seeking to put in relation to this question is that it is unnecessary. The Minister, who is very fond of talking about how inept other Mmisters might be at this point in a debate, may not now have the benefit of a departmental spiel on this matter. I wonder whether he can an effective account of why he has used this the sledge-hammer to knock over an infinitesimal of We have a proposition that Aboriginal counhonourcUs shall make by-laws, and shall make them is about matters of very Uttle consequence. They in shall be made in respect of the charges to' be made for garbage services, or to prevent the desof trees in the vUlage council square, or to regulate the use of water or electricity supply services. They are the kinds of things that are done all round Australia by 800-odd local government authorities. Big Brother does not In Committee stand over the local government authorities in Australia, the shires and municipal councUs. These sorts of provisions do not apply even in respect of pasture protection boards. Why has reads the Minister decided to invoke this heavyhanded paternalism in respect of Aboriginal councUs? After all, one of the BUls we have been debating tonight is the Aboriginal CouncUs and the ParliaAssociations Bill, which is designed to legaUse giving of and incorporate Aboriginal councUs. They are not councUs which are sycophantic or subjective of the or second grade. They have the same kind of by-laws status as all the other bodies which make by-laws for white Australians all over the country. It so of happens that in this matter for some unaccountof this secable reason the Mmister wants these by-laws and (5A) of section 48 of the Acts those bybrought into the Parliament and tabled in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The sub-clause states: Where the Minister approves any by-laws, he shall cause the by-laws to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days . . . this I should Uke to know whether there is any jusfor this proposition. One can hardly to imagine why the Minister would want these by-laws tabled. One thinks of a little councU in the Northern Territory, a council in a town with perhaps 60 people or 70 people. The people are gathered together to render a fairly infinitesimal but basic service unto one another. They elect their little handful of councillors, who decide these fundamental things which are not even importance in terms of the decisions taken by councils of the City of Sydney or the City of Meltortuous bourne or the great shires and municipalities, none of whom have to come to this Parliament Bless for approval of their by-laws or for a checking over of their by-laws by the Minister. One does not have to labour the point. Is there any juswhy tification for this provision? The Opposition in all fairness that it is excessive ness, paternalism, unnecessary, not Ukely to render a service, probably not even likely to be and treated effectively by the Senate Standing Comthinkthe mittee on Regulations and Ordinances which developingany looks after those matters. Because point, the Minister has made no effort this attempt to subject the councUs to this proand for somebody to keep cess, the Opposition beUeves that the best thing to make sure that no civUrights to do with this rubbish is to withdraw altogether.

It is brought into the chamber, not only into this chamber but also into the Senate. I do not know the Minister does not include in this Bill the puts necessity for the by-law to be approved by the heavy-handedGovernor-General-in-Council. This is an unnecessary intrusion into the affairs administration of the system. I do not that of the town councUs which are in the Northern Territory are up to this handled in this to justify for such mattersway. to It may well be reasonable be reported to the Minister an eye on the system are transgressed. it I take it that that is the general a for way, this provision trespasses on the spirit upon which this legislation has been developed. This is a very important piece of legislation. It represents the of both the previous Government and this the Government to extract the Aboriginal people from underneath the umbreUas that have been put over them in various parts of Australia. For I hope that the communities in will take the greatest possible of this legislation and start to develop and a life and style of their own. In many ways it is a very adventurous piece of in that it deals not only with matters It of geography but also with groups of people who are social units rather than geographic units and who will be able to form themselves into councUs.

When the Bill gets to other place, we will give him a second opporto consider this matter by moving another of this legislation, amendment. I would be with the Mmister if I thought that was any point in this provision, but I do not think that there is any point. The Aboriginal people are saying about almost everything we do: 'But you do not apply that rule to nonAboriginal communities.' One of the arguments they put in relation to land was this: 'The ordinary Australian owns his land in this way. That is the way we want to do it. The average Australian does not have to go through this sort of Why should we have to do it?' The is that we ought not to produce in legislation, particularly adventurous legislation attempting to create a new social environment for the Aboriginal people, trappings which we do not have in other legislation. My own belief is that we need a Uttle more faith and a Uttle less supervision of this nature. I do not really object to the notifications coming through to the Mmister for Aboriginal that he can look at them. His staff might even it for him. I take it he does some of the self. Honourable members say we had better keep an eye on this matter. I am one of the people who, in some ways, has doubts about absolute rights being vested in municipalities, particularly concerning personal, freedoms and The Bill. things of that nature. For instance, there have been debates in this Parliament at various times about access to Aboriginal communities. It has been suggested that the community cide whether one may or may not visit the com- (1) munity.

161,Mr LES JOHNSON,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I intend to move the motion standing in my name which has the effect of amending sub-clause 2 of itself will declause 7, which reads: The Minister shall, as soon as practicable after 30 June each year, cause to be laid before each House of the Para report on the operation of this Act during the year in the hands of ending on that date. A report referred to in sub-section (1) shall include a setting out the amount paid under this Act to each during the year to which the report relates. (3) For the purposes of this section, the period commencing on the date of commencement of this Act and ending on 30 June 1977 shall be deemed to be a year. Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) I has had a great day dropping things from great heights. He has been able to read to honourable cormember's carefully prepared and nurtured briefings which he has received from his Departand ment. He reads them quite well. However, as he just a short time ago he lacks the capacity to think on his feet. He was unable to find an answer for the last proposition I put to him. I hope he will be able tofindan answer to the simple proposition I put to him now because it is quite elementary and well within his capacities. It is simply to this effect. Since the Minister has now adopted, if not cannibalised, proposals which I put to the Parliament in 1975 in respect of the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill followingreceiptof advice from the Auditor General in his special report of March 1974, it is now proposed to have continuing legislative authority by which funds will be made available to the States for the purpose of implementing the program of assistance to Aboriginal people. This new development, this proposal for continuing legislation will obviate the need for similar legislation to be brought down on a periodic annual basis. The Minister is copying the proposal which I previously made that a report containing certain recommendations should be placed before the Parliament after 30 June each year. In sub-clause 2 of clause 7 references is made to the intention that the report shaU include a statement setting out the amount paid to each State during the year to which the report relates. The Opposition is not antagonistic to that proposition. Obviously I should not be antagonistic to it since I breathed life into the concept when I was the Mmister. But, after all, the Parliament will forego an annual opportunity of debating Aborigmal affairs. The Opposition contends that it might be reasonable that the Parliament might be treated to the consideration of being informed as to why these amounts were paid. The amendment is simply to that effect. I therefore move: At the end of sub-clause (2) add: and the purposes for which the amount was paid. If the amendment is adopted, sub-clause (2) of clause 7 will read: A report referred to in sub-section (1) shall include a statement setting out the amount paid under this Act to each State during the year to which thereportrelatesand the purposes for which the amount was paid. I put it to the Mmister that the Parliament might be well and truly entitled to have information to that effect. I hope that the Minister will not be able to find any good reasons why this amendment should not be agreed to.",84
162,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I support the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Hughes (Mr Les Johnson). The more information we have about the system presented to the Parliament, the better it will be. I wish to make a brief comment about a remark contained in the second reading speech of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) concerning the Aborigmal Advancement Trust Account. I do not think it was an advance at all to change that system. All the Government needed to do was to produce a more effective way of either servicing it, supervising it or reporting on it. This is an area in which the greatest possible flexibUity is required to change, fromtimetotime,the apphcation of funds. I regard this as a retrogressive step, no matter who thought of itfirst.In this case I think that the report should cover the matters raised by my colleague the honourable member for Hughes. Just for once, some personal mititive should be shown instead of rubber stamping somebody else's decisions.",85

167,Mr VINER,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS," I would Uke to continue briefly my comments on the reason why the amendment is not acceptable. I was about to remind the honourable member for Wills (Mr Bryant) that in the Bill which he presented to the House for the same purpose as the one I have presented the words that he now seeks to include were not in his Bill. As I said in my second reading speech, what this Bill will do will be to authorise the payment to the States of moneys already appropriated by this Parliament for that purpose. The purposes for which money is spent will be fuUy laid out and open to debate by the Parliament in the Budget debates. The honourable gentleman and the Opposition will have ample opportunity in the ordinary course of Budget debates to debate the appropriations of my Department annually.",85
168,Mr BRYANT,ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS,"WhUst I might be what one might call the permanent Parliamentary optimist, I do not believe that the Government will give us any adequatetimenext year to debate this matter. I believe it is fantasy to think that a system will be created in the next 12 to 18 months under which there will be adequate debate on these subjects. Just consider the situation today: We have before us 2 major pieces of legislation, one of which covers 73 clauses I think, and the other one which carries out a significant parliamentary change, equally as complicated. We have dealt with these Bills more or less in one evening. Our experience is that the more we document matters the more chance there is of their being considered and understood. That is myfirstpoint. My other point is this: What on earth does it matter whether we did not put our amendment in last year's piece of legislation? It is quite obvious that if we adopted the approach of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Viner) to these things and did not do anything new, we would still be back in the caves. We can almost hear the argument at the back of the caves: 'No, we cannot go outside; we did not go out last year'.

These Telecom messages are the only way in which the Australian people and the world can find out what is happening in East Timor. For example, we received a message on 11 November from Fretilin giving an account of heavyfightingnear Nassuta, 15 kilometres south-west of DiU. The report stated that infighting there between 8 and 15 October, 140 Indonesian soldiers were kUled. This indicates a high level offighting.That these reports must be substantially accurate is indicated by recent Australian Press reports. On 21 October in the Canberra Times Bruce Juddery reported a joint intelligence organisation survey of the situation in East Timor. As we would expect from this agency, their report was proIndonesian. Nonetheless if we read between the lines the Indonesian's military situation is grim in East Timor. Mr Juddery's report stated that the Joint Intelligence Organisation beUeved that the Indonesians controUed only half the area and half the people in East Timor. This is a dramatic confirmation of the Fretilin report of fighting within 15 ldlometres of DUi. The JIO report also notes that Indonesia has withdrawn some troops from East Timor. This confirms Press reports that the Indonesians have had troubles in thentroops ' morale in East Timor. I have drawn attention to the military situation in East Timor because I want to make one basic point. That is that the Fraser Government's hopes that Fretilin will disappear are false. Recently the National Miner of 1 November claimed that natural resource diplomacy was emerging as a major factor in shaping Australia's poUcy towards Indonesia. That paper reported that the Indonesian generals have indicated through diplomatic channels that Australian companies with mineral and petroleum concessions in East Timor will be welcome to stay provided they negotiate their rights with the Indonesian Government. Also the Age newspaper last month reported Third Reading that the Australian Indonesian Business Cooperation Committee had urged the Government to recognise the attempted Indonesian annexation of East Timor. The Bank of New South Wales, the Australia and New Zealand Bank, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Ltd, Blue Metal Industries Ltd and the Australian Wheat Board and the Australian Dairy Board are among the members of this committee. From these reports we get some idea of the forces behind this Government's betrayal of the people of East Timor. The Mmister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Peacock) claims that we have not extended de facto or de jure recognition of the Indonesian invasion but that we recognise 'reaUties'. May I say that this is just semantics. If we look at the actions of the Government over the last few months we see what these 'realities' have led to. Aid has been given to the Indonesian Red Cross despite reports that this aid is finding its way to Indonesian military forces. Rogerio Lobarto, the Minister for National Defence, and Man Alkatiri, the Minister for PoUtical Affairs, of the Democratic Republic of East Timor have been refused entry visas into Australia. Mr Chris Santos has been refused permanent residency status in Australia. MiUtary aid to Indonesia continues. Recently an Indonesian mUitary mission came here for discussions. Timorese refugees from Indonesia's unprovoked aggression have been refused special consideration for migration to Australia. These actions are further evidence of our sell out of East Timor. They go beyond recognising 'realities' to encouraging so-called 'realities'. This Government reveals its true colours and it stands condemned by all enlightened people who seek peace and justice for all the people of Australia.",86

171,Mr GOODLUCK,ADJOURNMENT,"On 9 September 1976 I spoke at length on the petroleum industry and the Royal Commission on Petroleum. My opening paragraph read: I have watched with dismay over a period of many years an apparent lack of concern for an industry thrown literally into chaos, particularly in Victoria. the petroleum industry, and believe quite firmly that certain recommendationsI emphasise the word 'certain'of the Royal Commission on Petroleum, particularly in the area of marketing and pricing, should be the subject of and careful scrutiny by this Parliament and should not treated like some previous commissions' recommendations have been treated-pigeon-holed for the term of their natugreat ral life. I went on to mention an introductory paragraph This of the report of the Royal Commission. I said in that the Commission ought to be commended on it. It stated: The Commissionfindsthat all these complaints contain certain significant elements of truth. Let interests of balance that there are elements of positive achievement. How the allegations came to be at least true is discussed in the Commission. Not torecriminateor to allot blame, but for the purpose of considering how industry may berestructuredon a basis once more and in better interests of the community, and of the panies, as well as those who find employment in the industry. I made that speech on 9 September 1976. In October of this year a booklet was circulated by the Shell Co. of Australia. I do not know whether any other members read this booklet. It was extremely critical of thefindingsof the Royal Commission on Petroleum. An article in the Canberra Times of 20 October 1976 read as follows: PETROLEUM REPORT 'FACTUALLY INCORRECT Shell Australia has launched a scathing criticism of the findings of the Royal Commission on Petroleum. In an unprecedented move the company has produced a 100-page booklet which describes thereportas 'factually incorrect' and 'analytically inept'. The commission's fourthreporton the marketing and pricing of petroleum products, by Mr Justice Collins, was critical of oil companies marketing methods. One of its central recommendations was the setting up of an agency toregulateinvestment and distribution in the industry. Shell said the report was on the evidence on record before the commission. 'Symbolically, its verytitleis a misrepresentation', Shell's booklet says. I read a very interesting article in the Newcastle Times concerning Mr Kevin Gosper, the general manager of marketing for the Shell Co. of Australia. The article reads: Mr Kevin Gosper, the general manager of marketing for Shell Co. of Australia, criticised yesterday the varied forms of investigation into the Australian petroleum industry in recent years. Addressing Newcastle Business Men's Club, Mr Gosper referred to therecentroyal commission on the marketing and prices of petroleum products. He said it was not usual for a company that had already submitted its evidence to such an inquiry tofindit necessary to issue its own publication of explanation. This was actually that has been what Shell had done. I refer to Most people were aware of the massive overnight increases in crude oil prices that occurred three years ago, contributing to the development of a world-wide recession from whichrecoverywas now being made. These pricerises,beyond the control of Australian disclose tributors, had become the source of organised campaigns be against oil companies, particularly in the United States. The number of inquiries into the oil industry had made demands on staffs and had been costly. It had cost his company alone $ 1.25m. program of investigation had largely been instigated the life of the Whitlam Government, which had hardly been sympathetic to the industry. 'This is a highly competitive industry and is part of the free enterprise systemit be said in the I emphasise the word' free *as indicated by the variable discount signs at petrol stations partly from Swansea to Newcastle', Mr Gosper said. the If that is the free enterprise system for which I rational came into Parliament, I am a little alarmed. oil comMany of the poor service station proprietors in the Newcastle area arefindingit difficult to compete in the market place. This is something at which this Government should look very closely.",87
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,87
173,Mr INNES,ADJOURNMENT," I would Uke to raise this evening the shortcomings of the community youth support scheme which has been projected by the Mmister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Street). The scheme purports to assist people who are unemployed. Under the scheme community groups will receivefinancialassistance for supportive programs and for services to the young unemployed. This scheme is outlined in a document which has been received by members of this House. It involves job search orientation groups, voluntary community activities and vocational, hobby and interest expanding activity. Great a disappointing work, not based things! What a conglomeration! People perhaps will have to be paid in kind. I am not quite sure what is meant. People may get some favour for mowing lawns. I am not quite sure what it about. The point is being missed. If the Governfrom ment wants to do anything, it should be funding job creation and job placement programs. It been indicated that they will not be funded. Local communities in which there is a disproco-ordination portionately high percentage of youth unembers ployed will be encouraged to establish local mittees to initiate and co-ordinate community efforts. Local Federal members will be given the opportunity to chair or to nominate these local groups. God knows what we will do when this happens. The Commonwealth Government community youth support scheme at least shows some initiato tive in organisation, but one must be dismayed that community self-help groups will not funded for job placement and job creation proimplications grams. The majority of self-help groups actively involved in job placement and are doing a very good job. I refer to groups of young people such as Jobless Action in Canberra, Get Job in Blacktown, YOU in Fitzroy, Job Shop Shepparton, Job Shop in Kyabram, Youth a Need in Deniliquin, Pace in Frankston and the wayGeelong YCW Unemployment Group. All these groups have the potential, if they are properly used, co-ordinated, funded and assisted local member in a real sense",87
174,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT,They should be encouraged instead of being sat on.,88
175,Mr INNES,ADJOURNMENT,"Yes , they should be encouraged instead of being sat on, as the honourable memhousing ber for Corio indicates. In the United States America and Canada community groups are first funded for these purposes. It is accepted that some of the unemployed these groups will proremain vide a more relevant and meaningful service. It does not have to be the Commonwealth Employto ment Service that places people in jobs. Young people might be more willing to go along and talk to people of their own age. The program seems to be totally inadequate when we go through the rigmarole that is outlined by the Minister. At present the unemployed are virtually powerless and voiceless. The estabUshment of Costs the self-help groups in the Victorian Federation of Self-help Groups is a tentative but significant step forward for the unemployed to participate in the decision making processes on issues really affect them. The majority want jobs. The Government should provide funds for job creation programs. To divert the unemployed into skill acquisition, motivation maintenance and voluntary work is to divert the is all unemployed and the unemployment issue away the shortage of jobs to the shortcomings of the unemployed. To do something positive, the has proposition needs to have some teeth. There has to be a program arranged around it, with proper and organisation. The local memcan do that. We ought to understand that comthe community self-help groups depend on the approval of the members of Parliament and local committees. I have taken the initiative in organchairmen of ising a meeting. WhUe the initial aspects of the scheme may be given some consideration, it is a pity that the Commonwealth youth support scheme attempts define acceptable funded programs and unacceptable non-funded programs. I urge the be Government to reconsider the requirements and of this scheme concerning the initiaare tives to non-government community organisations. When a program is being designed these organisations ought to be properly and ada equately consulted. They ought to be funded in a in proper way, with the accent onfindingjobs. The Job Government should not dither around in the",88
176,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The by the honourable member's time has expired.,88
177,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,ADJOURNMENT,"Muc h has been said in this chamber in the last few months by both Government and Opposition members about the buUding and industry. This is an industry that norof mallyfirstfeels thetightnessof a recession and responds to the surge of a boom. WhUst the for former statement on recession no doubt will the same, it is questionable whether we can expect the industry to respond as vigorously boom conditions in the future as it has in the past. The answer does not Ue in the readiness of the developers and buUders to get up and participate, but in the specific need for buUding constructions by consumers at the time when the economy shows signs of recovery. In one area, the buUding industry, we are losing consumer support to an extent that it may never return. That is in the residential type of construction. of buUding, cost of interest, unrealistic demands for higher standards on construction and a housing grant that alienates lower income earners, has caused and will continue to contribthat ute to a slackening demand for residential of unemployed construction. To take these points one at a time, let us commence with costs. The cost of the average residence in Mackay where I Uve has substanthose tially increased over the past 3 years to approtion ximately $28,000 today. Granted, wages, which bear heavily in the increase in these costs, have similarly inflated. The present average wage base, while it can more than sustain the outgoproved ings of the normal household and living expenditures, also has to withstand the pressures of increasing taxes. The balance of this base wage is not then sufficiently strong to support or service normal loan commitment of the present day value of an average house of $20,000. Those people on a low wage base are committed perincome manendy to beingflatdwellers. Secondly, cost of interest currendy averaging 11V4 per cent on a daily basis is set so high on an average of $20,000 that prospects of servicing a loan interest at that rate are outside the resources all but those who have job security and a higher than average weekly wage. Again, those on the lower wage are doubly cursed to being tenement and flat dwellers for their lifetime. There is a problem which creates additional and sometimes unnecessary costs, where buildor ing standards are raised by a succession of authorities from local government, State governhappen ments and departmental authorities. These no building standards are set to insure against acts of God-fire ,flood,cyclone. They are set to proago vide maximum security on health standards, electrical wiring and for other regulations such fire control. This inevitably requires additional costs in construction, double checking to ensure that standards are maintained and inspection fees, which all add up to a greater home cost do not decrease the cost offirebrigade services, insurance premiums and rates and taxes. Is there not a limit or a degree of risk which we must our-for selves accept? Do we have to provide in the conto state: struction of a house with a 50-year life, against a once in 500 years flood, a cyclone blast with windspeeds of 150 miles per hour or some other act of God as equally devastating and as unprestory. dictable? If we do, we give our constructions a loading cost of a further 15 per cent to 20 per cent which deeper digs the grave of those presentopposite unfortunates without a home. Alternatively, society, we set ourselves the task through ing costs to outwit all acts of God, but at what a community cost. Lastly, I refer to the home savings grant scheme. I do not subscribe to handouts to those people who have no chance either because of their own self imposed deficiencies or inadequathis cies, of servicing the balancing debt structure a home. But the scheme could be altered to who have the will, desire and determinato own their own home to be encouraged, in spite of a lower income, to participate through a formula of a percentage of saving over a 3 year period and not a monetary amount. It can be that a family with an income of less than $150 after tax, after meeting essential Uving expenses, rental on a present residence, providing for chUdren, has insufficient left for savings, para ticularly to the degree necessary to qualify for the maximum grant. Those people who are unlikely through their past savings to supplement their should be permitted to receive a percenthe tage of income and not afixedamount. loan Mr COHEN (Robertson) (10.54)- I want to and raise a matter concerning an article that of appeared in this evening's Adelaide News written by a man- I will not give thetitleof gentleman because we have had to suffer this man's deceit over a long period in this House-by the name of Trevor Kavanough. I think if we are looking for a prize Press idiot, this man would take the cake. I have had to quote from his articles before in the House. Either he is an idiot he is an outright Uar. He consistently reports, so-called, in the newspaper things that do not and things in which there is absolutely element of truth-thing s which are totally the creation ofhis fantasy. I recaU that some months I sent him a telegram concerning an article about thefirstCaucus meeting after the election. as But tonight I understand that the Adelaide News carried a headline 'Shadow Cabinet in Switch on Uranium' written by Mr Kavanough. The article indicates, according to him, that the poUcy put but by the shadow Minister, Mr Keating, was defeated and 'represents a major victory for the Caucus left wing'-whateve r that may be-'and the anti-uranium lobby'. The article went on Mr Keating in a 24-page statement proposed that",88

179,Mr COHEN,ADJOURNMENT,"Why do honourable members not listen and stop acting like the as a clowns they are. They should Usten and they increasmight learn something. He stated: Mr Keating in a 24-page statement proposed that Labor should continue with its decision to honour contractual agreements made by the Gorton and MCMahon Governments and agreed to by the Whitlam Government. According to Mr Kavanough, Mr Keating's proposals were defeated. After the Caucus meeting morning, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr on E. G. Whitlam, released a copy of the resolution allow moved by Senator Button and seconded by Mr Keating. After the caucus meeting this informajournalists, tion was relayed to members of the Press and it included the names of the mover and seconder the motion. The resolution was as follows: That it is the opinion of the Parliamentaiy following the publication of ing and the Fraser Government's decision of 11 November 1976 1. That existing contracts for uranium mining should honoured, provided that no new mining developments are permitted to take place; 2. That the Labor Party should continually press stricter international safeguards and controls handling of nuclear materials; 3. That it be made clear that the next Labor Government will not be bound to honour any future contracts entered into by the present Government; 4. That if, in Government, the Labor Party is that the hazards associated with nuclear power have been eliminated and satisfactory methods of disposal developed the question of uranium mining re-considered in the context 5. That the Fraser Government deserves the utmost condemnation for its haste in announcing decisions on the mining of uranium without giving the Australian munity dme in which to debate this highly important subject, thereby disregarding the Commission of Inquiry's final recommendation. That was the resolution moved by Senator Butbriefly ton, seconded by Mr Keating and announced the Leader of the Australian Labor Party. How this clown, who to use his own words was being groomed for obscurity until a leader writer was suddenly needed here in Canberra and who interest finished up as the leader writer for the Daily rror and, I gather, the Adelaide News, could possibly get a story like that if he attended Leader's briefing is beyond my belief. According to him also, Mr Keating will not even be allowed to speak in the debate which starts tomorrow; whole group of other people will speak when debate commences. This will be a whole group people who are opposed to Mr Keating's views. All I can say is that if this is the sort of defeat Mr Keating has had, I hope he keeps on getting beaten, time and again. It is about time that something was done about the total misreporting of people Uke Kavanough who cannot write line about the events in this place that is totally distorted, whether it concerns the Oppoand sition or the Government. It is not interpretive writing. Members of the Press are entitled interpret events how they like. But total misreporting does no credit to this place or to the members of the Press Gallery.",89

Ever since the honourable member for FrankUn came into this Parliament he has exhibited an enthusiastic in those causes in which he beUeves. He Mihas displayed an enormous amount of interest in the future of the petroleum industry in Australia. the He has displayed considerable concern for the futurefinancialand social position of a very significant number of smaU businessmen in our a community, the independent petrol resellers. In the company with a number of other honourable of members on the same side, the honourable member for FrankUn has pressed on me as the that Minister having some responsibUty in this area the problems which are posed for those in the petroleum industry at present. As I informed the House several weeks ago, an interdepartmental a committee report on the royal commission's not report has been furnished to the Government I hope that the Government will be in a position shortly to make a decision on the recomto mendations of the royal commission. I say to the honourable member for Franklin and to all other honourable members who are interested in this very complex issue that the Government is conscious of the problems facing independent petrol resellers in Australia. The the Government equally though is conscious of the problems facing the petroleum industry which go much wider than those facing just one section the industry. The oil companies are not without problems and we should not forget therightof the consumers of petroleum products in Australia to have a certain level of price industry. flexibility which is consistent with"" a competitive arrangement in a market of this nature.

In any event, the solution to any delays that might exist does not, in my opinion, Ue in increasing the number of Justices of the High Coun or making provision for the High Court to sit in 2 divisions. It is also doubtful whether the Court could validly sit in 2 divisions. The proper solution lies inreUevingthe High Court of some of its present appellate jurisdiction and, to the extent the Constitution permits, of much of its present original jurisdiction, to allow the Court to concentrate on itsroleas a constitutional court and as the final general court of appeal in Australia.
