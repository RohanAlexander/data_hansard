1,The SPEAKER,Unknown,Hon. David Hawker) took the chair at 9 am and read prayers. NA (TARGETED ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Julie Bishop. Bill read a first time. Second Reading,19
2,Ms JULIE BISHOP,INDIGENOUS EDUCATION,"Curtin-Minister for Education, Science and Training and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues) (9.02 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The primary purpose of this bill is to amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 by appropriating additional funding of $26.1 million over the 2007 and 2008 calendar years to improve opportunities for Indigenous students in the school, vocational education and training and higher education sectors. This funding will be used for the expansion of the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, the expansion of the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program, the provision of infrastructure funding for boarding school facilities and, where government and nongovernment education providers agree, the conversion of Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) program places into ongoing jobs in the education sector. The Australian government places great importance on achieving better educational outcomes for Indigenous students. To achieve this, new investment is necessary in the areas of school, vocational and technical education and higher education sectors. The Australian government is committed to developing the capacities and talents of Indigenous people so they have the necessary knowledge, understanding, skills and values for a productive and rewarding life. The proportion of young Indigenous people living in remote areas who reach year 12 is approximately half that of their metropolitan peers, and only one in 10 actually completes year 12. Approximately one in four 15to 19-year-old Indigenous people lives in a remote area. Up to 1,610 students will benefit from the expansion of two successful programs, the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program. The increase in the number of scholarships offered under the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program and the places available under the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program will allow more young Indigenous people to access high-quality education and training to make informed life choices. The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program will be expanded by around 860 places over the next four years, 2007-08 to 2010-11. In the 2008 calendar year, $2.6 million will be used to increase the number of places available in that year. The number of scholarships available through the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program will increase by 750 over four years, 2007-08 to 2010-11. Over the 2007 and 2008 calendar years, $4 million will be used to increase the number of scholarships available in these two years. The increased funding for these two programs will provide support for Indigenous young people to relocate from remote and regional areas to access high standards of education, training and employment opportunities not otherwise available to them. Indigenous students will benefit from funding of $14.1 million over two years to provide infrastructure funding to existing boarding schools catering for significant cohorts of Indigenous students. This will facilinity) tate the urgent upgrade of accommodation facilities to prevent a loss of existing boardnificant ing places. Approximately 200 Indigenous people will benefit from the provision of funding of $5.3 million to convert, where government and non-government education providers agree, Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) program places into ongoing jobs in the education sector. In the 30 years since CDEP began, Indigenous people have been delivering services for all levels of government. Through this initiative, CDEP participants will gain the full benefits of employment including wages, leave, superannuation, training and professional development. The initiative will be available to both government and non-government schools and systems. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. SCHOOLS ASSISTANCE (LEARNING TOGETHER-ACHIEVEMENT NA OPPORTUNITY) AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Julie Bishop. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",19
3,Ms JULIE BISHOP,THROUGH CHOICE AND,"Curtin-Minister for Education, Science and Training and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women's Issues) (9.07 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Schools Assistance (Learning TogetherAchievement Through Choice and OpportuAct 2004 (the act). Through this legislation the Australian government provides sigfunding to support government and non-government schools. Over 2005-08, a record $33 billion will be provided by the Australian government for schools across Australia. The Howard government believes that through this investment of taxpayer funds parents can be assured that their children will have a greater opportunity to receive a quality education by high-quality teachers in a high-quality environment, regardless of the location of the school they attend or whether it is a government or a non-government school. The Howard government is boosting this significant investment by delivering more than $843 million over four years to schools through the Realising Our Potential package announced as part of the Australian government's 2007-08 budget package. The total schools budget will provide over $9.7 billion for the 2007-08 financial year, bringing the Howard government's total increase in school funding since coming to office in 1996 to 172 per cent. Around 3.4 million students from over 9,600 schools and school communities across Australia will benefit from the range of significant educational initiatives. This amendment bill will implement two important budget measures for schools. This bill will provide funding of $121.1 million for regional and remote nongovernment schools in addition to current funding. Students in more than 400 regional and remote non-government schools will be supported to achieve better educational outcomes for their students. A loading provided to non-government regional and remote schools recognises the higher cost of delivering schooling in regional and remote Australia. Schools will be able to direct the increased funding to improve the educational opportunities for students in these regions. The Howard government recognises the unique hardships regional and remote schools face, and these funds will enable those schools to target the areas that most seriously affect their capacity to enhance educational outcomes for their students. Student achievement against the national literacy and numeracy benchmarks shows that students in non-metropolitan areas of Australia achieve well below the level of their peers in metropolitan regions. By providing additional funding to these schools they will be provided with the means to afford greater support to their most educationally disadvantaged students. The funding could be directed to additional resources, attracting quality teachers, increasing staff retention, improving ICT facilities or improving teacher access to professional development This additional funding will be provided in the form of a loading in addition to general recurrent funding provided by the Australian government. Eligibility for the loading will be determined using a remoteness classification as defined in the remoteness structure under the Australian Bureau of Statistics Australian Standard Geographical Classification and according to the remoteness of the census collection district in the school campus is located. The delimitation criteria for remoteness areas are based on the Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA). Non-government schools, or campuses of schools, located within areas classified as ‘moderately accessible', ‘remote' or ‘very remote' will receive an additional five per cent, 10 per cent or 20 per cent respectively of the funding entitlement associated with their socio-economic status score. This additional funding will be available for schools from 1 January 2008. It is time that all governments recognised that regional communities face unique hardships and need assistance through the provision of funding where it is most needed. State government schools will also benefit as the Howard government, as part of the next schools funding agreement, will require state and territory governments to provide an equivalent increase in funding for their regional and remote government schools from 2009. The Howard government will continue to invest in young Australians in regional and remote areas to ensure all students, no matter where they go to school, receive the educational outcomes we expect for all students. The second bill measure implements a humanitarian settlement initiative. The bill will provide increased per capita funding to assist with intensive English as a second language tuition for students entering Australia under the humanitarian program. Through this measure, an additional $127.8 million will be committed over the next four years to demonstrate the Howard government's commitment to supporting newly arrived humanitarian entrants and acknowledges that English proficiency is a vital aspect of successful settlement. The budget initiative will double the per capita rate of funding paid to which government and non-government education authorities for students in primary and secondary schools who enter Australia on a humanitarian visa. It builds on the success of the existing English as a Second LanguageNew Arrivals Program, which last year provided assistance for about 13,000 eligible primary and secondary students around Australia, including more than 5,000 humanitarian entrant students nationally. For humanitarian entrants in Australian primary and secondary schools, intensive support to improve English language skills is one of the best ways to improve the educational outcomes and future employability so that they can participate more broadly in Australian society. The Realising Our Potential package as announced in the budget will ensure that the Australian education system better meets the needs of students and the expectations of parents, enabling them to prosper economically and socially in a global environment. It will improve quality, ensure consistency and assist students falling behind in the fundamental areas of literacy and numeracy. The Realising our Potential budget package also includes: - the National Literacy and Numeracy Vouchers program, which will provide assistance to parents of students who have not achieved minimum literacy or numeracy standards in years 3, 5, 7 and 9; - a new Australian Government Summer Schools for Teachers program, offering our best teachers more professional development with upskilling in important areas such as literacy and numeracy, maths, science, English and Australian history; - grants for schools of up to $50,000 under the Rewarding Schools for Improving Literacy and Numeracy Outcomes initiative; - the Improving the Practical Component of Teacher Education initiative, to ensure the practical experience of student teachers is of high quality and sufficient length to prepare teachers for the classroom; - a new pilot program to trial the use of aptitude tests by universities for assessing year 12 students seeking tertiary entrance each year; and - funding to develop core curricula standards in year 10 in a number of core subjects, and in years 11 and 12 in subjects including English, Australian history, biology, chemistry and physics as well as funding for the development of national teacher training and registrations standards. In addition to the total funding provided for schools in this year's budget, the Howard government will, from 2009, require that government and non-government education authorities focus on lifting school standards and quality, including through: - introducing national teacher training and registration standards to improve the skills of new teachers; - including external assessment as part of year 12 certificates and common descriptions of levels of achievement; - introducing greater principal autonomy in school management and teacher employment arrangements; - introducing performance based pay for teachers to encourage and reward excellent teaching; - reporting school and student performance against national benchmarks, including literacy and numeracy results, with school and state comparisons; and - encouraging the states and territories to establish more selective high schools. The Howard government is putting measures in place to ensure all Australian schools focus on improving quality, so that parents can be confident their children will receive a high-quality education and develop the core skills to be successful in their careers or in further education and training. The Realising Our Potential package will drive quality improvements in Australian schooling for all students. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND NA AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES No. 1) BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Ley. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",20
4,Ms LEY,FORESTRY LEGISLATION,"Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (9.17 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The red-meat processor industry has a value of about $15 billion a year and earns nearly $7 billion in export revenue. Collectively-funded marketing and research and development (R&D) have underpinned this industry's value to Australia's economy and enabled it to meet its whole-ofindustry commitments as envisaged under the red-meat industry's memorandum of understanding (MOU). Since the 1998 red-meat industry restructure, a voluntary contributions system has funded the meat processors' marketing and research and development programs. These programs have been managed by the industry's service company, Australian Meat Processor Corporation Ltd (AMPC). For the past three years, the industry has been engaged in discussions on the future of this funding arrangement. As a result, in December 2006 a clear majority ballot conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission voted in favour of replacing the voluntary contributions system with a statutory levy on the slaughter of cattle, sheep and goats. The processing sector also made it clear that its preference is to continue using the existing service company, AMPC, to administer the levy funds and not Meat and Livestock Australia Ltd (MLA) as provided for in current legislation and the industry MOU. The other sectors of the red-meat industry also support the preference for AMPC. The government believes collectivelyfunded marketing and R&D programs are key to continued industry growth and productivity. Consequently, the government supports the move to a statutory levy and has no objection to AMPC receiving and administering the funds. A funding agreement will be drawn up between AMPC and the Commonwealth to ensure the funds are managed in accordance with the government's accountability requirements. The Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 makes no provision for a meat processor services body to receive levy funds. It limits the disbursement of levies and charges to an industry body and a livestock export body, namely, MLA and the Australian Livestock Export Corporation. Without amendment to the act, the funds would automatically flow to, and be administered by, MLA; contrary to the meat processor preference. The bill amends the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 to allow the minister to determine a meat processor marketing body and a meat processor research body and for these bodies to receive revenue derived from statutory levies. The intention of the act, whereby MLA is the predominant red-meat industry research body and marketing body, remains. This means the government will continue its dollar-for-dollar matching of payments to the industry research body, that is, to MLA, in respect of industry research expenditure. As was envisaged by the government under the 1998 restructure, this will preserve the incentive for research services to be provided by the industry research body, while allowing for the meat processor sector to have ownership and control over its own R&D funds. Under the statutory levy system certain disaggregated levy payer information would not be available to industry as it has been under the voluntary contributions system. As a separate process, amendments are being proposed to other legislation to allow the information to be disseminated to the red-meat industry. However, those separate amendments will not make provision for the Commonwealth to control who in the industry can receive statutorily collected levy-payer information or to specify how that information can be used. Accordingly, this bill makes provision for such a control. The intention is for the dissemination to be limited only to the red-meat industry services companies. The proposed level of control is similar to that already in place for the dairy industry. The bill does not change the act's broader intentions of viewing the red-meat industry as one industry and at the same time providing for autonomy and self-determination for the sectors within. Rather, the bill responds to specific indusStrait try needs. It gives effect to changes in the face of clear indications from the meat processor sector that existing arrangements are no longer supported and that the new arrangements will enable the sector to continue to meet its own and whole-of-industry commitments. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Ley. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",23
5,Ms LEY,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (9.22 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The bill will improve the management of the Torres Strait fisheries, better enable monitoring of fishing activity in Commonwealth fisheries and deter illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in Australian waters. The primary focus of the legislation is to amend the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 to modernise fisheries management practices. This will make them consistent with those already in place under the Fisheries Management Act 1991 and Queensland's Fisheries Act 1994. The Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 has largely operated without amendment since 1985 and a range of operational and administrative practices require greater support in legislation. These amendments will ensure that the Australian government, including the Torres Strait Regional Authority, working in partnership with Queensland through the Torres Protected Zone Joint Authority, PZJA, will be better placed to manage the commercial harvest in the Torres Strait Protected Zone fisheries. This will ensure that the Torres Strait communities, and the adjacent communities on northern Cape York, can continue to enjoy their traditional fishing rights as well as participate in the commercial fisheries. The importance of the Torres Strait Protected Zone fisheries to the economic development of Torres Strait communities is undeniable. Commercial fishing is the primary source of non-government economic activity in the Torres Strait. It is important, therefore, that these fisheries can be managed sustainably into the future. As I mentioned earlier, the Australian government relies on the cooperation and support of the Queensland government in managing these fisheries and in fulfilling its rights and obligations under the treaty with Papua New Guinea. Where fisheries are managed by the PZJA, this bill will provide it with the capacity to determine a management plan in the Torres Strait fisheries. This power currently sits with the Australian government minister only. The bill will enable the PZJA to implement a quota system in these fisheries. To complement this regime, the bill will also establish a register which will record all interests conferred under a plan of management. To support these new management arrangements, the bill enhances the existing licence regime. This includes the introduction of a new fish receivers licensing regime, a requirement for fish receivers to report on product delivered to them, and the capacity to regulate people who hand fish for commercial purposes. To provide sufficient time for industry to adapt to the new licences, these aspects of the bill will commence 12 months after royal assent. To support compliance with the new quota systems, licensing regimes and requirements to provide information, this bill also introduces penalties and, by regulation, an infringement notice scheme. These enforcement mechanisms will be consistent with those in place in other Commonwealth fisheries. The bill also provides for a demerit point regime to be introduced by regulation to deter repeat offenders. This new management regime will better enable the Australian government to fulfil its catch-sharing obligations with Papua New Guinea as set out in the treaty. The bill amends the objectives of the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 so that the objectives of the treaty are better articulated in the legislation and will ensure fisheries can be managed consistent with the requirements of the treaty. In addition to the amendments concerning Torres Strait fisheries, the bill will also amend the Fisheries Management Act and the Fisheries Administration Act 1991. These amendments flow on from the government's successful Securing Our Fishing Future package. This initiative has led to significant reductions in fishing effort along with a $220 million adjustment package to enable fishing operators to exit, and the associated industry to adjust. The amendments will assist AFMA to implement the ministerial direction that was made in November 2005 by enabling it to introduce a comprehensive set of management measures involving harvest strategies and enhanced monitoring of fishing. These initiatives are designed to ensure Commonwealth fish stocks are managed both sustainably and profitably in the long term. New management measures introduced by the legislation include clarification of AFMA's powers to place observers on board fishing vessels. Further, the legislation will amend the Fisheries Management Act to enable AFMA to share information with environment and law enforcement agencies. This will facilitate the investigation of serious crime, fisheries and wider marine monitoring and enforcement. The type of information to be shared and the agencies with which it will be shared will be specified in regulations and, as such, be a disallowable instrument. The bill also contains amendments to implement government policies to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone, AFZ. The Australian government devotes significant resources to address the risks posed by illegal foreign fishing vessels and has announced a range of additional measures in recent years, including custodial penalties to further deter illegal incursions. The Fisheries Management Act and the Torres Strait Fisheries Act were amended in 2006 to provide for custodial penalties ranging up to a maximum of three years for foreign fishing offences in the territorial sea of Australia. These offences reflect the inherent sovereignty violation with such incursions. Further amendments are required to deal with evidentiary problems in securing custodial convictions. For example, it is difficult proving the fishers were aware they were fishing in Australia's territorial sea. The bill addresses this problem by applying strict liability to this aspect of these offences, while leaving the overall offence a fault based one. The bill also makes complementary amendments to the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 to ensure that the new custodial penalty offences can be effectively investigated and prosecuted using surveillance devices. By overcoming the current impediments to prosecuting the new offences, the bill will strengthen the government's overall policy response to illegal foreign fishing. The bill will also strengthen forfeiture provisions, allowing for the forfeiture of the boat, catch and all equipment on a foreign fishing boat that has engaged in illegal fishing in the AFZ at the time of its seizure. These amendments are intended to further deter foreign fishers from illegally fishing in the AFZ. Knowledge by illegal foreign fishers that they may be given custodial sentences, and lose the boat, catch and all equipment any time after the offence occurs also makes it more likely that the owner will exercise vigilance to prevent the vessel being used to illegally fish in the AFZ. Finally, the bill will amend the Fisheries Administration Act to provide certainty regarding AFMA's governance arrangements. The Australian government has decided to establish AFMA as a commission on 1 July 2008. In keeping with this decision, the existing directors' terms of appointment expire on 30 June 2008. The current legislation does not provide for the directors' terms to be extended. The amendment will give the minister a temporary power to appoint the directors of AFMA for up to nine months at a time without going through the selection and appointment prescribed in the act. The power will only be exercised if AFMA does not become a commission by the proposed date and will have a sunset clause of 30 June 2009. In summary, these amendments will improve the Australian government's domestic fisheries management arrangements, they will support this government's strong stance against illegal unreported and unregulated fishing and they will bolster our capacity to end overfishing in Australian waters. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA BILL 2007 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Ley. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",24
6,Ms LEY,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (9.30 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The bill contains amendments which are consequential to the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 and complements the Howard government's efforts to modernise legislation affecting the governance and management of the Torres Strait fisheries. Together, the bills will provide the minister and the Torres Strait Protected Zone Joint Authority-PZJA-with broader powers to implement cost recovery in these fisheries consistent with Australian government and PZJA policy. These amendments appear in a separate bill to the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 because levies are a form of taxation and, under the Constitution, require separate legislation. The Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill 2007 will enable the minister and the PZJA to introduce plans of management for Torres Strait fisheries which are underpinned by output controls, for instance a quota management system. The bill will make it possible for the costs of managing Torres Strait fisheries governed by these management plans to be recovered from fishers. The bill also makes it possible for levies to be collected against a new licence ‘without a boat'. The Fisheries Levy Act 1984-the act-is the mechanism for collecting levies in fisheries managed under the TSF Act. Under current arrangements, the act provides for levies to be collected against a plan of management as determined by the Fisheries Act 1952, which has been superseded by the Fisheries Management Act 1991, the FM Act. Plans of management for Torres Strait fisheries are made under the TSF Act rather than the FM Act. The definition of a management plan will be amended by this bill to include a plan determined under the TSF Act. The bill also consequentially amends references to ‘units of fishing capacity' in the act so that these references are consistent with those in the TSF Act and so that levies can be calculated according to arrangements set out in management plans determined under that legislation. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INCOME TAX REDUCTION) BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 May, on motion by Mr Costello: That this bill be now read a second time.",27
7,Mr BOWEN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"The Labor Party supports the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2007 and supports the tax cuts contained in it. This bill provides that the 30 per cent tax threshold will be increased from $25,000 to $30,000 from July 1 this year. The bill also increases the low-income tax offset from $600 to $750 a year and raises the threshold at which the offset starts to phase out from $25,000 to $30,000. The level of income at which the offset ceases will increase from $40,000 to $48,750. From July 1 next year, 2008, the 40c threshold will increase from $75,000 to $80,000, which will deal with bracket creep for those income earners. The 45 per cent threshold will increase from $150,000 to $180,000, which better aligns our top tax bracket with international standards. Labor support each of these measures, and we do so for several reasons. Firstly because they are good policy, and the Australian people do not expect the opposition to oppose for opposition's sake but to lend bipartisan support where appropriate. That is what we are doing today. It is because they are good policy that Labor has been calling for tax cuts for years. It is because they are good economic policy and because they are fair. That is why the Labor Party have been calling for these types of tax cuts, and that is why we support them. Ms Julie Bishop interjecting",27
8,Mr BOWEN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"We have been calling on the government to reduce the punishing, very high effective marginal tax rates at the lower end of the scale. The minister at the table scoffs, but Labor has been calling for this for years. The evidence shows that we have been calling for these sorts of tax cuts for years and they conveniently ignore the facts. I had a look at the relevant bill from last year, which introduced last year's tax cuts, and I see that the shadow treasurer, who led the debate, moved a second reading amendment which the government voted down. It said, in part, that the House notes the government: ... failed to systematically address the punishing effective marginal tax rates faced by: (a) second earners, most particularly women; (b) individuals moving from welfare into work; and (c) middle and low income families with dependent children. The Labor Party laid this out at last year's budget, that this is where our priorities would be. And the government comes in with the budget-an election budget-and has miraculously come up with tax cuts for lowand middle-income earners! The shadow treasurer laid out some tests earlier this year as to whether the opposition would support the tax cuts in this year's budget. There were two tests: do the tax cuts tackle disincentives for workforce participation and skill formation? That is test No. 1. Test No. 2: are they appropriately staged to minimise inflationary risks? I am glad to say that these tax cuts pass both of those tests. Labor has been calling for tax cuts such as this for years for two reasons: firstly because it is good economic policy and secondly because lowand middle-income earners need relief. They are struggling with eight interest rate increases in a row and four since the last election, when the Prime Minister promised to keep interest rates at record lows, and they are struggling with spiralling petrol prices and cost of living increases. Let me deal firstly with the economic management arguments in favour of these tax cuts. Australia has some of the most punishing effective marginal tax rates in the world. The OECD has shown that average workers in Australia face the highest EMTR in the world-63c in the dollar-compared with an average EMTR for all workers across the OECD of 31c in the dollar. It is particularly punishing for second income earners and sole parents-the types of people we need to be attracting back into the workforce. We see the effects of these punishing effective marginal tax rates in our participation rates. Australia's labour force participation rate is 73.6 per cent. Let us look at comparable countries. In New Zealand it is 76.6 per cent, in the United States it is 75.4 per cent and in the United Kingdom it is 76.2 per cent. The government's own budget papers show that Australia has lower labour force participation than Canada, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Sweden and the United States. An increase in labour force participation of just one per cent can make a huge difference to the economic performance of the nation. Our participation amongst workforce aged males is 25th out of the 30 OECD countries. We do a little better with females, who come in at 23rd out of 30. As the population ages, we face the urgent task of increasing participation rates. It is one of the most important mediumto long-term economic challenges facing this nation. The ratio of dependants, mainly aged dependants, to workers is set to double in Australia by 2040. That is what makes it vital to improve our labour force participation rate. Of course it is also important for social reasons-to give young people a role model of work and to break what is in some places and in some cases an intergenerational cycle of poverty and despair as generation after generation is out of the workforce. Yet the government have presided over a regime of punishing effective marginal tax rates at the low and middle income of the spectrum. They have had 11 years to act on this, and in an election year they start to act. We have seen the Welfare to Work reforms-the Welfare to Work changes, perhaps more accurately. What did the Welfare to Work changes do? In some cases, they managed to increase the effective marginal tax rate of people seeking to move from welfare to work. This is the party of incentives. This is meant to be the party of building incentives into the economy. I seem to recall the Prime Minister, in a previous incarnation, calling it the ‘party of incentivation'. Yet for 11 years we have had punishing effective marginal tax rates, locking people out of the labour market. Labor agrees with the OECD and others. Back in 2004 the OECD said this: An additional important issue is that of effecthe tive marginal tax rates which, despite recent reforms remain high for many low income earners, deterring labour force participation, including by secondary earners and older workers. The priority for tax reform should be the simultaneous continuation of policies which contribute to lowering these high effective marginal tax rates and the raising of the threshold at which the maximum marginal income tax rate cuts in, consistent with budgetary objectives. The OECD also said: The pace of reform has recently not been as strong as it could have been. In fairness, the government have dealt with the low rate of cut-in for the top marginal tax rate, and we support the measures in the budget to increase that rate of cut-in even further. It is an appropriate thing to do. But the government have been very tardy indeed in dealing with the high effective marginal tax rates at the low and middle income of the spectrum. We also agree with Professor Brian Andrew of the University of New South Wales. I was drawn to some comments of his recently. His contribution is worth quoting at some length. He said: The economic impact of the EMTR problem is very serious because it hits a large number of middle income families where the second spouse could make a contribution to the workforce if the EMTR was reduced. At a time when the Australian population is ageing it is essential that we encourage the second spouse in each family to participate in the workforce and we should not underestimate the disincentive to workforce participation provided by an EMTR of 65% coupled with the cost of childcare and transport. Tax reform which moved the EMTR problem to a different income level and reduced its impact upon middle income families could make a significant contribution to the economy. He went on to say: The EMTR problem is well known and has existed for a long time and it is hard to understand why there has not been a serious effort to address problem in a concerted way. Now is the time to attack the problem, as there is relatively full employment and a skills shortage which can only be addressed by encouraging more people into workforce. I agree with Professor Andrew: it is hard to understand why there has been no concerted effort. It is hard to understand why lowand middle-income earners, who have been ignored in successive budgets, are having their tax rates cut in this election budget at five minutes to midnight. I think lowand middle-income earners understand why that is the case and view the budget, appropriately, cynically. I do not want to leave the impression that this budget and the tax cuts contained in it for lowand middle-income earners have dealt with the punishing EMTRs. Far from it; there is much left to do. The budget papers indicate that it is predicted workforce participation will increase as a result of these tax cuts, and that is welcomed, but we still have a huge EMTR problem. That problem will fall to the Rudd Labor government to fix should we be elected later this year. Real reform can only come from a complete package examining tax rates and the taper rates of welfare payments. As I say, we have seen a Welfare to Work package from the government which in some instances increased effective marginal tax rates for people moving from welfare to work. Well done: a Welfare to Work package which actually punishes people for moving from welfare to work. They must believe, after being in office for 11 years, that punishing effective marginal tax rates at the low and middle income of the spectrum is good policy. They either believe in it or they are too lazy to fix said: it. That is the approach we have seen from the government. There is an economic argument for increasing participation rates by reducing the effective marginal tax rates on lowand middle-income earners, and there is also an equity argument. Lowand middle-income earners are doing it tough, despite the Prime the Minister saying in this House that they have never had it so good. Firstly, there is the impact of eight consecutive interest rate increases. Since the last election, the last four interest rate increases have seen average mortgage payers in Australia's capital cities paying $65 a week extra-and even more for many in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Perth-in mortgage repayments. The percentage of household income going towards mortgage repayments is the highest it has been in Australia's history-higher than in 1990 and 1991, higher than the high interest rates under Treasurer Howard in 1980 and 1981. They are the highest in this nation's history. Lowand middle-income earners are that doing it tough. So the $14 a week or the $21 a week tax cuts are welcome, but they will go in some part to subsidise the increases in interest rates that the Prime Minister told the Australian people they would not have to worry about. They will go to subsidise the increase in interest rates brought about by this government's failure to deal with the skills crisis and the infrastructure crisis facing the nation, which are the reasons highlighted by the Reserve Bank for the increases in interest rates over recent years. Then of course there are petrol prices. For a lot of families, when petrol prices rise this acts just like a tax increase. It reduces discretionary spending and puts pressure on the family budget. Caltex recently confirmed that petrol prices in Australia have increased substantially since the start of the year. Australian families needed no reminding. Caltex Petrol prices in Australia have increased 21 cents per litre on average since January due to sharp increases in international prices for petrol. The price of unleaded petrol now stands at an average of $1.30 across Australia's capital cities and, of course, it is more in many rural and regional areas, as the shadow minister for regional affairs at the table well understands. Some economists, particularly those at CommSec, have predicted that petrol could hit $1.50 in the near future. This bill provides a tax cut of $21 or $14 a week, depending on where you are in the income scale. Let us have a look at what the impact of an increase in petrol to $1.50 would mean for some people. If petrol prices go from where they are now to $1.50, a person who drives a 2006 Commodore will find that they are paying $15 a week more for petrol; a Falcon, $13.60 more a week; a Toyota Corolla, $11 a week; a Ford Focus, $11 a week. Again, the $14 a week tax cut is very welcome. It goes to subsidise the increase in petrol. The government wonder why the Australian people have not been overcome by joy at the budget and by gratitude to them since they presented it. Perhaps it is because the tax cuts are helping people cope with (1) the increase in interest rates, (2) the increase in petrol prices and (3) the general increase in the cost of living. Labor has always maintained, and I have always said, that the biggest impact on the increase in petrol prices is world oil pricesno-one would pretend otherwise. But in this environment where Australian motorists and families are facing the highest petrol prices on record, we need to be assured that the federal government are doing everything in their power to ensure that Australian motorists are not paying one cent more than they need to. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer can give no such assurance. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have been on radio assuring people that they are taking this issue very seriously. The Prime Minister said: We will again ask the ACCC to look at these prices. No, they will not. And they have not. A simple way they can do it is: the Treasurer signs a letter to the Chairman of the ACCC which says, ‘I direct you to formally monitor petrol prices.' It is easy to do. It is a one-page letter. It is not hard to do. It is only necessary because, very early in their term, the government changed the act governing the ACCC and took away its power to do that of its own volition. Now the Treasurer has to write a letter, not go on radio or to the Telegraph and say, ‘I'm asking Graeme Samuel to look at petrol prices.' That is not how you do it. You write him a letter. No letter has been sent, and no letter has been received. The government have to be honest about this. They cannot go on radio and say: ‘We're going to be really tough. We're going to ask the ACCC to have a good look.' The ACCC is doing the best it can with the powers it has, but what it is doing is a Google search. It does a very good job at monitoring petrol prices through the internet-and I do not mean that facetiously. It does a good job. It does the best job it can with the powers that it has. But let us give the ACCC the powers it needs to do its job as the Australian people's watchdog. Mr Howard says that he will ask the ACCC to have a look at petrol prices, but he gives it no power to do so. The Treasurer could write to the ACCC and notify it to formally monitor petrol prices under part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act, but he refuses to do so. As I recall, my predecessor, the member for Hunter, even wrote the letter for the Treasurer, handed it to him across the dispatch box and said, ‘Here, sign this.' It cannot get easier than that. But, no, the government refused to act. As I said, I do not suggest for one second that giving the ACCC the power to do that would bring petrol prices down overnight. I do not suggest for one second that we have a magic bullet or an easy solution to the problem of petrol prices. Anyone who suggested that would not be being honest with the Australian people. But what I do suggest very strongly is that there is an obligation on the government to do absolutely everything in their power to ensure that there is no uncompetitive behaviour, that there is no price gouging and that Australian motorists are not paying one cent more than they need to-and they refuse to do so. The Treasurer comes in here with a great deal of hoopla and announces his tax cuts, and then he wonders why the Australian people are not overwhelmed with gratitude for his generosity in the budget. Perhaps he will realise that it is because his tax cuts are going some way to help lowand middle-income earners deal with the increase in the cost of living that they are facing. These tax cuts are welcome, not just because the Labor Party called for them this year but because we called for them last year, the year before and the year before that. The tax cuts are welcome because, finally, we have seen some decent tax relief for lowand middle-income earners. Although we do not see real reform of effective marginal tax rates, we see a step in that direction. On that basis, we support that step in that direction. Labor do support these tax cuts, but there is more to be done. The Treasurer said, ‘The Labor Party doesn't have a tax policy.' He very conveniently misquoted the shadow Treasurer, although we have already laid out that dealing with effective marginal tax rates will be one of our priorities should we be given a mandate later this year to form government. Mr Crean-And we did it in office, seven times.",28
9,Mr BOWEN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"We did it in office, as the member for Hotham said. This Treasurerand the member for Hotham makes a very worthwhile contribution from the dispatch box-and this government said, ‘We are the only party which have ever introduced consecutive tax cuts.' Let us recall that Labor, when in office, introduced seven tax cuts across the board-not just for high-income earners, not just for low-income earners, but across the board. Labor reduced the top marginal tax rate from 60 per cent to 49 per cent. Mr Crean-What did John Howard leave it at?",32
10,Mr BOWEN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"Labor reduced it from 60 per cent, when John Howard handed over the Treasury to Paul Keating, to 49 per centwhich, at that stage, was close to world's best practice; it was cutting edge. Of course, the world has moved on and we need to do better but, at that stage, 49 per cent was one of the world's lowest top marginal tax rates. So let us have none of this nonsense. Let us have none of this selective quoting, where the government gives a very one-sided account of history in question time-which it is able to do in question time because it is the government's forum. Let us have none of this rewriting of history-that the Labor Party does not propose tax cuts in office; only the government does. The Labor Party introduced tax reform that was opposed by those who now sit opposite. We introduced tax reform to broaden the base so as to provide tax relief to lowand middle-income earners. We introduced the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax to broaden the base so that personal tax rates could be cut across the board. The Prime Minister said, ‘The Labor Party has opposed all our reforms.' Let us not forget that the Prime Minister's party opposed some of the great economic reforms introduced by the Hawke and Keating Labor governments that reduced personal tax rates and lifted the burden of high taxation, with a punishing top marginal tax rate of 60 per cent. They opposed base broadening. They opposed the introduction of a fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax to broaden the base. They opposed the superannuation reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments, which they now wrap themselves in as ‘the best friend superannuation ever had'. Now they come in here and say, ‘We're the best friend superannuation ever had.' They opposed it at conception but, now, they pretend to be the ‘best friend'. Let us have none of this nonsense. All of these measures were opposed by the Liberal and National Party opposition. Conversely, the Labor Party stands here today in support of these tax cuts. The Labor Party stand here today in support of this measure, which goes some way to dealing with the punishingly high effective marginal tax rates suffered by lowand middle-income earners in this country. These tax rates are some of the highest in the world. We stand here in support of economic reform to increase participation rates, to encourage more people into the workforce. We support proper reforms, not punitive and ideologically driven reforms which increase the effective marginal tax rates that are encompassed in the government's so-called Welfare to Work reforms. We support real reform to reduce the effective marginal tax rates and to increase the incentives for people moving from welfare to work. These tax cuts are welcome because they are good for the economy and good for lowand middleincome earners; however, the real job of reform will fall to the Rudd Labor government should we receive that mandate later this year.",32
11,Mr SLIPPER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I am someone who, for a long time, has believed that the tax rates in Australia are too high. am really pleased that, in the budget this year, income tax cuts have again been factored into benefit the majority of taxpayers. It is obvious that the government of the day has to calculate the income that is needed to provide services to the community; however, it ought to always be a primary aim of government to reduce taxes by as much as possible so that one is able to give more discretionary spending to the people who produce the income from which taxes are paid. Wherever possible, it is vital to reduce taxes because, when you reduce taxes, you create incentive. The lower the tax rate, the more people will be prepared to work harder and longer to achieve more. Historically-unfortunately-when Australia had a 60c in the dollar tax rate, people simply were not prepared to work. This government, this Treasurer and this Prime Minister have led the charge in reducing taxes. The decision made in the budget to further reduce taxes-to bring in income tax cuts for the majority of taxpayers-is yet another big stride forward and gives the taxpayers of Australia a greater opportunity to choose how to spend the money they earn. These tax cuts were possible because of sound economic management since 1996, when the Howard government was elected to office. Tax cuts were not the only initiative contained in the budget delivered by the Treasurer this month. The government brought in a cash surplus of $10.6 billion-this government's 10th surplus since 1996. A strong budget enables continuing investment to improve Australia's long-term economic growth and prosperity. The Australian Labor Party is trying to masquerade itself as financially responsible, but one knows that, historically, whenever the Labor Party has been in charge of the Treasury benches-whether at state or federal level-there has been a diminution in I fiscal responsibility and the government of the day spends more than it earns. Mr Bowen interjecting",33
12,Mr SLIPPER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"The member opposite ought not to laugh because he would be well aware that this government inherited $96 billion of government debt. Through sound economic management over the last 11 years we have repaid all of that $96 billion. Had we not done so the government of the day would be paying $8½ billion in interest every year. The Labor Party actually spent more on interest than it spent on roads, education and schools. So by repaying $96 billion of debt this government has given the government the economic wherewithal to bring about very important and meaningful positive social outcomes such as the Higher Education Endowment Fund announced by the Treasurer in the budget. That fund will be implemented through legislation introduced by the minister at the table, Minister Bishop. I have spoken to university vice-chancellors and they are strongly supportive of this initiative, because they say that for the first time ever a government is prepared to put the investment in place-a fund which will enable tertiary education in Australia to obtain the world-class standard that we all desire it. The budget tax cuts mark a sensible spending decision by a government responsible for an economy that is doing well. The Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2007 serves to introduce changes to the Income Tax Act that were announced in the budget by the Treasurer. They will benefit taxpayers this year. Also included are further changes, which will take effect from July next year. Obviously there is always a great deal of deliberation and discussion in the parliament and in the mediaand, I suppose you could say, more generally in the Australian community-about the benefits contained in any budget. But most people, regardless of whether they are government supporters, accept that this was a sound budget. In fact, the shadow Treasurer was able to say that he supported what was in the budget. He could not find a fault in budget. It is good to see the shadow Treasurer agreeing with the Treasurer in this particular area. We ought to recognise that if Labor Party were elected to government we would go back to what we had before. That, in my view, would be unacceptable. I am hopeful that when the election is held later this year the people of Australia will also find unacceptable a return to the same form of economic mismanagement we saw during those years of Labor, from 1983 to 1996. As I said, through its formalisation of the income tax cuts this bill benefits taxpayers now and through until mid-2008. The income tax changes outlined in this bill will take effect from July this year and July next year. By increasing the upper level of the 17 per cent tax threshold from $25,000 to $30,000 and likewise the lower level of the 30 per cent tax threshold from $25,001 to $30,000, the government has enabled all taxpayers in these brackets to receive a reduced tax liability while also ensuring that spendfor ing patterns do not blow out to create undue pressure on inflation. The modified 17 per cent tax bracket will also be reduced to 15 per cent from July. Under this bill, in July 2008, the upper threshold for the 30 per cent tax bracket and the lower threshold for the 40 per cent tax bracket will be increased from $75,000 to $80,000. The ongoing pattern of sensible economic management since 1996 has enabled the coalition to announce these and future changes with confidence that the economy will support them. Taxation is a contentious issue. It is necessary, of course, to collect funds to provide the services required by the community. I stress again that it is important that tax levels are not so high as to leave residents unnecessarily short of spending power. It is important to allow people to have the discretion to spend the money they earn. This bill also provides additional benefits. It amends the the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to increase the maximum amount of the low-income tax offset and also raises the income level the threshold at which this offset begins to reduce. It also amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the income threshold under which some taxpayers are eligible for a tax rebate. The delivery of tax cuts is a sensible allocation to ordinary Australians by a government that has presided, and continues to preside, over a strong and stable economy. The honourable member for Prospect mentioned the impact of interest rates and petrol price rises. Nobody likes petrol price rises but, as the member conceded, the price at the bowser is really determined by world fuel prices. Of course, those prices go up and down. A lot of people raise with me their concerns over high petrol prices. I can understand that concern; however, this is really a matter that is not under the control of the Australian government. It is under the control of the market. The honourable member opposite conceded that. He said that he hoped that the government made sure that taxpayers were not paying one cent more in petrol prices than would be desirable. I am quite sure that this is exactly what the government is doing. He referred to interest rate rises. You have to look at these things in perspective. Under the Labor Party, interest rates were at an extraordinarily high level, and that was because the Labor Party was not running the Australian economy well. You have a situation where, although interest rates have increased to an extent, they are still at historically levels. Interest rates are actually determined independently now, and not by the government of the day. That means that we have this objectivity with respect to the management of the Australian economy. This government has made a lot of very substantial and important changes in the area of taxation. We are returning flexibility, and we are returning discretion to the taxpayer. The tax cuts included in the budget are strongly welcomed in my electorate and, I believe, more generally throughout the Australian community. We have been able to give tax cuts while at the same time we have been able to find the money for desirable social objectives. Honourable members would be well aware of the fact that in the budget the government was able to improve childcare assistance. We were able to improve investment in land transport infrastructure. We were able to assist retirees and carers. We were able to benefit our environment. We were able to bring benefits to rural areas. We were able to make our national security and defence an ongoing priority, and we were able to improve health and aged care. This is a case where there are only winners; there are no losers. The fact that along with the desirable social spending included in the budget we are able to have tax cuts means that this government has got the balance right. I am very pleased to be able to commend the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2007 to the House.",33
13,Mr SWAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2007, which will deliver tax cuts that are long overdue for middleand low-income working Australians. Labor welcome these tax cuts and we support them, but low Australian taxpayers should be under no illusion as to why these tax cuts are finally being delivered to them, on the eve of an election, where the coalition will be saying anything, doing anything and spending any amount of public money to cling on to power. Over successive budgets the Treasurer has largely ignored middleand low-income taxpayers. He has made them wait while their mortgage repayments have spiralled upwards, petrol prices have gone through the roof, the cost of child care and education has gone up and up, and food prices have consistently outstripped the official CPI. It is true that the Treasurer has delivered tax cuts in five successive budgets, but middleand low-income taxpayers have had to wait until this budget to finally get back their fair share of the extra tax that has ratcheted up on them in recent years. Labor will also support these tax cuts because they reflect worthwhile progress on good policy. Last month Labor set two tests for any budget tax cuts. Firstly, we said they should tackle disincentives for workforce participation and skill formation. Secondly, we said they should be appropriately staged to minimise inflationary risks. On both these scores the tax cuts get a tick, but, as I will point out later in my remarks, there is still some way to go. It is important that we continue to improve the competitiveness of our personal and business tax systems. Capital, and increasingly labour, is mobile, so we need to make sure our tax settings promote investment and reward hard work and enterprise. Before I come to the detail of the measures in this bill, I must say I have been a bit baffled by the Treasurer's response to Labor's approach to these tax cuts. His public comments reflect, I think, a certain desperation. I would have thought he would have welcomed Labor's unqualified support for these tax cuts, but I think he has been a bit like an inebriated nightclub goer who is wandering the streets desperately wanting to pick a fight. Perhaps it is the fact that the public have not given him the credit he thinks he deserves for this budget, or perhaps it is more likely that the Treasurer is quite embarrassed that he has been forced to adopt tax changes that Labor has been calling for and Labor presented to this House only two years ago. This bill comprises a number of relatively straightforward adjustments to our personal income tax system. From 1 July 2008 the thresholds for the top two marginal rates are lifted from $75,000 to $80,000 and from $150,000 to $180,000 respectively. Labor supports these changes as they will help prevent middle-income earners getting a bit of overtime being snared in the 40c tax net. The top threshold increase will better align our top rate with that of other international jurisdictions. The most substantial and welcome element of the tax cuts is the measures targeted at middleand low-income earners. As I said earlier, these groups have been waiting a very long time to get a fair go from our Treasurer. Prior to this year's budget, a taxpayer on $50,000 a year received an average annual tax cut of just $3.30 a week each year over the last six years. Think about thatthose on $50,000 a year received $3.30 a week each year over the last six years. So I think we can forget the sandwich and milkshake sized tax cut; we have really only had a milkshake sized tax cut each year for the last six years: $3.30 a week. Whilst people would have been grateful for that $3.30 and they will be much more grateful for the extra $14 a week in this year's budget, it still has to make up a lot of lost ground. Significantly, from 1 July this year the bill increases the threshold of the 30c marginal tax rate from $25,000 to $30,000. This follows the increase in the last budget in this threshold from $21,600 to $25,000. The bill also increases the low-income tax offset from $600 per year to $750 per year and aligns its 4c in the dollar phase-out with the new $30,000 threshold for the 30c marginal tax rate. These two measures combined account for approximately 85 per cent of the value of the tax cuts in this year's budget. They are, if you like, the centrepiece of the budget's tax measures. Indeed, since the 2005 budget, changes to the 30c threshold and increases in the low-income tax offset have comprised $8 out of every $10 of additional tax relief. Labor welcomes these changes-after all, it was Labor that authored them. Let us go through the history here so we can cut through the rubbish the Treasurer has been presenting to this House day after day. I was bemused on Monday during question time when the Treasurer claimed: So if we want to find out what the Labor policy is, we have to look at the coalition policy to work it out, which is why I say to the people of Australia: go to the originators and not the imitators. It was not the Labor Party that thought up moving those thresholds and increasing the LITO ... He said this-that it was not the Labor Party that thought of these moves. Well, Treasurer, just who are the imitators here? These comments from the Treasurer got me thinking, and I decided to look back at some speeches I have made on tax over the years. In a speech to the Sustaining Prosperity conference on 1 April 2005 I made the following observations: The other key problem with the marginal tax rate structure is where the 30 percent rate cuts in - just $21, 600. For a single income couple this 30 percent rate may be combined with a 70 percent withdrawal of their spouse's parenting payment, and a 4 percent reduction in the low income tax offset - giving rise to a marginal tax rate of 104 percent. Lifting the threshold for the 30 percent rate would diminish this interaction by extending the coverage of the 17 percent rate - a 13 percentage point improvement. Reforms that further sought to align the withdrawal of the low income tax offset would reduce the marginal tax rate by a further 4 percentage points. Lifting the 30 percent rate from $21,600 to $30,000 is also a costly proposition. It would be a cheaper option than an equivalent increase in the general tax free threshold. So in April 2005 Labor was talking about lifting the 30c rate to $30,000. That is a Labor proposition. I would be happy to table that speech, but somehow I suspect the Treasurer has already got a copy of it and has read it-and I would assume he has read it on many occasions. The speech also canvassed the option for a significant increase in the effective tax-free threshold through a tax credit, otherwise known as the low-income tax offset. In May 2005, we put down the colour of our money in the budget where we had our first instalment of these reforms. The Treasurer would of course recall the 2005 budget. That is the budget where the Treasurer claimed Labor opposed tax cuts. Of course we did not; we actually proposed an alternative set of tax cuts. I will table those amendments, which every coalition member voted down. I seek leave to table those documents.",35
14,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,Is leave granted?,37
15,Mr LLOYD,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I have not seen the documents.",37
16,Mr SWAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,They are the amendments that we put in the House. I seek leave to table them. Leave granted.,37
17,Mr SWAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"Those are the amendments that we moved which the coalition voted down-amendments that would have doubled the tax cuts for middleand low-income earners, amendments that would have increased the threshold for the 30c rate and amendments that would have increased the low-income tax offset from $235 to $680. This is proof that these are Labor propositions put in this House two years ago-and the Treasurer has the hide to come into this House and claim that he authored them. It is fairly typical of this Treasurer. When the Treasurer says, ‘Go to the originators,' he is backing Labor, because we put down the marker on the low-income tax offset, we put down the marker on the threshold for the 30c rate and we forced this government to deliver a better tax deal to middleand low-income earners. The Treasurer might not like admitting it, but there it is in black and white on the public record-and now tabled in this House. Since the 2005 budget, the mining boom has delivered even more revenue than the coalition could have imagined, so further tax measures have been made possible since Labor first moved these amendments. That is entirely appropriate, and Labor supports all of them. That of course has not stopped the Treasurer from running a desperate scare campaign over the last few days claiming all manner of things. As a matter of record, I will again state my response to them all. Apparently the Treasurer has got all worked up over comments I made last week to the National Press Club. He has claimed, for instance, that Labor does not intend to have a tax policy for the election. That is another porky from the Treasurer. He quoted me as saying",37
18,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,The member for Lilley will withdraw that remark.,38
19,Mr SWAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I withdraw. He quoted me as saying: I am not anticipating taking forward any significant change to the personal income tax system at this stage. Conveniently, the Treasurer neglected to mention that I immediately went on to say: ... except to make this point - that many of the disincentives, particularly for second income earners that are still in the system, are punishing lot of those second income earners when they work a few additional hours and they're mainly women. Peter Costello runs probably, when it comes to tax, one of the most discriminating personal income tax systems against part-time working women in the world and that's not good. But we'll take our time to work our way through the area but in terms of personal income tax we've finally got into the system now a much fairer outcome than we've had for a while and that has some impact on incentives lower down and that's a good thing. There's still problems in that area and we'd hope to be able in time to do more. The moral of the story: never trust the Treasurer's version of events; they are often inaccurate. Labor will be taking a tax policy to the next election. The Treasurer already knows that in our budget reply we proposed a halving of withholding tax on foreign managed funds in Australia. As an aside, I look forward to the next occasion he talks to the Australian managed funds industry and explains why the nation's Treasurer does not like foreign investment. As for personal income tax, I have stated on the record that Labor will pay every dollar of the tax cuts in this budget if elected. Further, as I said at the Press Club, we will see what further improvements can be made to improve incentives for middleand low-income earners, subject to our strict budget rules and other competing priorities for the election. Even after this budget, many middleincome families with children face steep effective marginal tax rates. These disincentives have, in some cases, been exacerbated by a new overlap that has been created with the taper range for the low-income tax offset, family tax benefit A and the 30c marginal tax rate. In addition, many second-income earners still face effective marginal tax rates in excess of 60 per cent. Better incentives are needed in these areas, but we will only do a what is affordable. The Treasurer, on the other hand, confirmed on the weekend that he will only be taking his budget tax cuts to the election. So expect no extra help from the Treasurer, but expect much more desperation and untruths.",38
20,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,The member for Lilley will withdraw ‘untruths'.,38
21,Mr SWAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I withdraw ‘untruths'. His next big porky of the week was his claim yesterday that LaborMr Hardgrave- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I invite you to note that he also said another ‘porky'.",39
22,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"No, that was withdrawn. If ‘porky' was said a second time it needs to be withdrawn.",39
23,Mr SWAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I withdraw ‘porky'. I withdraw ‘untruth'. What was the next outrageous claim from the Treasurer? It was his claim yesterday that Labor has plans to abolish the $600 FTB A supplement. We will not. And, while I am at it, I would like to set out for the public record the Treasurer's continued blatant untruths on the $600 payment.",39
24,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,The member for Lilley will withdraw ‘untruths'.,39
25,Mr SWAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I withdraw ‘untruths'-his blatant misrepresentation of the $600 payment. Yesterday he continued his fiction that I said the $600 payment was not real. I never have. In the run-up to the 2004 election, I said the $600 family tax benefit supplement would be clawed back from families, and after the 2004 election I was proved correct. I seek leave to table the legislation and Bills Digest for the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Adjustment of Certain FTB Child Rates) Bill 2005, which was introduced after the 2004 election. Leave granted.",39
26,Mr SWAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,The purpose of this legislation was to restore indexation provisions stripped away when the $600 supplement was introduced. Mr Lloyd interjecting,39
27,Mr SWAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"He does not know what he is doing. He is in annihilation mode. The purpose of the legislation was to restore indexation provisions stripped away when the $600 supplement was introduced, which would have seen its real value erode completely over time through less-generous indexation arrangements for fortnightly family tax benefit payments. This was a typical sneaky attempt to give with one hand before the election, only to take back with the other hand after the election. We so embarrassed them during the campaign and put them under such political pressure that they were forced to backflip. They were going to take it back. They fiddled the indexation provisions, and it was going to erode over time. We forced them to redress it under enormous political pressure. Yesterday the Treasurer said voters should be wary of the fine print from Labor. This heist which the coalition tried to pull on families shows it is the fine print from this Treasurer that families certainly need to be worried about. I would urge the Treasurer and government members to familiarise themselves with the legislation which they were forced to introduce to preserve the value of the $600 supplement. Without this legislation the value of the $600 supplement would have been whittled away. The sorry excuses for parliamentarians who sit opposite should have the decency to own up to this fraud which they tried to inflict on families rather than mindlessly repeating the Treasurer's political mantras. That brings us to the area of state taxation-and the Treasurer's porkies are evident here as well.",39
28,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,The member for Lilley must know by now that that is not parliamentary. He will withdraw it and not use it again.,39
29,Mr SWAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I withdraw. The Treasurer's blatant misrepresentations do not stop there. The final misrepresentation of the Treasurer I want to draw the public's attention to today is his claim about the taxation of the states. Normally I would leave it to the states to defend themselves, but the Treasurer's comments on Sky TV on Monday cannot go without mention. The Treasurer said: If you want to see people who have to be dragged to cut taxes, go and have a look at the Labor and Labor governments. How many State Governments, now let me ask this … He went on: … how many state Labor governments have cut tax at all let [alone] in 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 with a prospective tax cut in 2008? He said: None of the above. That is quite a claim from the Treasurer: the states have not cut any tax at all since 2003. Perhaps the Treasurer was too busy selling his budget to hear that the Western Australian government, in its budget, cut stamp duty for first home buyers, with no stamp duty at all on houses up to $500,000, or that the Queensland government in last year's budget lifted the payroll tax threshold from $850,000 to $1 million, lifted the land tax threshold from $450,000 to $500,000 and implemented stamp duty relief for first home buyers and principal residence concessions in the 200405 budget. The list goes on. But if the Treasurer bothered to read his own budget papers he would know that the states have voluntarily cut second tranche intergovernmental agreement tax relief relating to stamp duties on non-residential conveyances, non-quotable marketable securities, leases, mortgages, bonds, debentures and other loan securities, credit arrangements, instalment purchase and rental arrangements, cheques, bills of exchange, promissory notes and so on. I seek leave to table a summary of those cuts. These are not on the record. Leave not granted.",39
30,Mr SWAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"That'd be right! For someone who says that being on top of the detail is a prerequisite for disciplined economic management, the Treasurer has proven himself to be completely loose with the truthall the time.",40
31,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"The member Party for Lilley will withdraw that remark. If he uses any terms like that again, I will sit him down.",40
32,Mr SWAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I withdraw. Perhaps the Treasurer thinks that if he can repeat his tax fiction enough times it might become tax fact. This is a Treasurer who cannot tell the truth about his morning run, a Treasurer so full of hubris that he is increasingly desperate. The Treasurer has not proven himself up to the task when it comes to the detail of the tax system. Notwithstanding the improvements in this budget, the Treasurer has proven himself to be somewhat inept at addressing disincentives in the tax system. Indeed, up until recently he denied that high effective marginal tax rates were a problem that potentially hampered labour supply. The Treasurer has argued on many occasions that high effective marginal tax rates are just an inevitable part of any targeted welfare system, inferring that no care should be taken to avoid the worse disincentives. Thankfully, Treasury have succeeded in bringing him around-and I welcome the Treasury secretary's comments in his postbudget address pointing to the importance of resolving these issues and the potential labour supply spin-offs. This is something that Labor has been raising in this House year after year after year, so I am delighted that the Treasury have bolstered their modelling capacity, particularly in relation to labour supply effects, using a modified version of the Melbourne Institute's MITTS-B model. This expertise will add significantly to the policy debate about tax reform, and that is a very good thing. I am glad we are now having a more sophisticated debate about tax reform in this country. But despite the progress in this budget there are still hundreds of thousands of Australians who need and deserve better incentives, and they will not get them from the Howard government. (Time expired)",40
33,Mr HARDGRAVE,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"The member for Lilley has spoken for 19 minutes and 40 seconds, and still no tax plan from the alternative Treasurer of this country. The accusations made by the member for Higgins, the Hon. Peter Costello, the nation's Treasurer, still stand: there is no ternative vision from those opposite. In Queensland we are very used to the member for Lilley. We know the famous expression ‘gilding the lily', but I do not want to be parliamentary by suggesting he is ‘the member for gilding the Lilley'. I think we should be greatly concerned that there is no tax plan and no disclosure to the people of Australia about what a potential Labor government would do when it comes to taxes. As I have remarked recently, 30 years ago the late Sir James Killen made the point about Labor in this place that they would ‘favour a tax on brains because they know that every year they would get a refund'. I am greatly concerned that the hard work, the effort, the hard yards that the people of Australia would expect from those who want to be the government of Australia should produce a tax plan not just at the height of an election campaign that will come at a later point this year. It should be well disclosed, well announced and offered to the people so that there can be full and proper scrutiny. Meanwhile the member for Lilley spent most of his speech, in a juvenile way, suggesting that the Treasurer had stolen his playlunch and had eaten his Jatz crackers. He essentially suggested that Labor might have said something about this a couple of years ago and the ‘nasty Treasurer' has taken it and done something with it. This is a government that actually does things. We take seriously the responsibility of managing a $1.1 trillion economy. We are a government that say, ‘We trust the people.' That is what personal income tax cuts, as provided for in the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2007, are all about. This side of politics says, ‘We trust individual Australians to make the choices that are going to work best for themselves.' I firmly believe that average Australians know best what to do with their money. They know albetter than government. I see the member for Melbourne is here. We know the quote from his 1994 speech about the idea of increasing personal income tax. I am sure he will have un- something to say about that during the debate, probably to distance himself or recant, or perhaps to reinforce the red thread. Nevertheless, it is absolutely important that we put a philosophy underpinning the government action. After all, if you do not have a mission statement, if you do not have logic underpinning all of your actions, you may fail. So the government very plainly say that our philosophy, our underpinning, our mission statement is about reinforcing the rights and responsibilities, the role, of individual citizens, trusting the people to do the best they can for themselves, to look after themselves, to spend money according to the priority they set for themselves, to make plans for the future and then, with their own personal ambitions met, with the generosity that we see in Australia today, to provide for those who are less fortunate. It is nice to see the member for Barker here. The amount of tax people pay in this country is only ever going to be fair, is only ever going to be fully subscribed to if the system is simple enough and encourages personal initiative. If you have a taxation system which is complex, the people cannot understand it. There is a tax here, a tax there, every time you turn a page there is another tax-‘A system where we see a tax on a tax approach with stamp duty on things like insurance and house transfers, and things like tolls'. I see the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads is here. He understands this issue very clearly because he has been into my ‘parish', as Sir James Killen used to call it. He has seen for himself. The Beattie government has a personal income tax imposed on people in my electorate that is not imposed on any other Queenslanders. It is called the toll on the Southern Brisbane Bypass-the best road you could imagine. I know the member for Barker would love to have the quality road that the Logan Motorway and Gateway Motorway represent, with four lanes of traffic. The sad reality is that only three to five per cent of its proper capacity is utilised on any given day. It is empty. It is heavily geared by the Queensland government. For every other road project they do in Queensland they borrow against the Southern Brisbane Bypass. It owes 10 times what it cost to build because it is so heavily geared. For people in my electorate to get access to this road they have to pay a personal tax. And they pay the GSTwhich the Queensland government receives in record amounts-thrown in on top. If you go on at Persse Road at Runcorn and you want to travel to work at the wharves or over at the industrial areas on the south side of the river-if you go to the north side, you have to pay another tax on the bridge-the only bitumen that is taxed, that is tolled, is in my electorate. If you go on at Persse Road at Runcorn it is $1.50 each way. One woman said, ‘I've got three cars in my household. The most convenient road, other than using local streets, is this road. That total of $45 additional tax we pay each week in our house.' The member for Lilley can talk all he likes to try to reclaim a spot in history. In his tribution in this House on Monday, he yearned for a return to the days of the accord where we saw wages crushed and businesses paying more tax in the form of superannuation guarantees, with no dividends being paid to the workers until down the track. The member for Lilley can try to rewrite history all he likes but the Labor Party stand for higher tax for one clear and simple reason: they do not trust the people. They believe government knows best how to spend your money: tax them high, spend it big, make people feel as though they are victims, always relying on the teat of government and never able to fend for themselves; whereas we on this side have a very simple, straightforward philosophy-that is, we trust the people. We know we are also challenged by the people to deliver. We inherited a $96 billion debt, $10.5 billion in just one year-they overspent by $10½ billion in one year. At the time, spending on roads and education was lower than the amount of interest we were paying on the massive debt which they clocked up, and personal income taxes were higher as a result. Because of the Howard government's strong economic management and the deliberate strategy of trusting the people, we have found ways in which to return on that trust through our own efforts and the work by average Australians. With more people in work and more people paying tax, it is quite right and reasonable that we secure and deliver a lower personal income tax rate. This is the fifth successive budget, the fifth in a row, where the government has been able to cut taxes and it is only because of our strong economic management. Look at Labor budgets. I had a chap say to is a me the other day, ‘We've gone away from the old tradition where you tune in on that Tuesday budget night, wondering how much the smokes are going to go up and how much con- the grog is going to go up.' Remember the Labor approach of midnight flits to turn up the wholesale sales tax? They did that a couple of times. They went to a couple of elections and said, ‘No new taxes: vote for us.' Up went the wholesale sales tax from 10 per cent to 11 per cent and from 11 per cent to 12 per cent. That was the reward the people of Australia got after the 1993 election. Is it any wonder they had that famous baseball bat, which the Courier-Mail journalist Dennis Atkins, who was then working for Wayne Goss, used to talk about. He was also working with the member for Griffith. They were all in the same part of the Queensland government at the time they decided against the Wolffdene dam, which has robbed Queenslanders of water today. That baseball bat was out for one reason. Before 1996, the Australian government did not trust the people. It taxed highly, it increased taxes and it spent big. People are definitely feeling the tax-take pressure in respect of fuel, but fuel taxes under this government are extremely low. This government has stopped the old Labor Party approach of high taxes that increase every year according to inflation. We cut fuel tax and froze it at 38c in the litre, not in the lar. Some people in my electorate are paying extraordinarily high prices for fuel; I have seen prices of 120c, 125c and even 129.9c a litre. One day last week the price went from $1.15 to $1.29. That is a 14c increase overnight. In spite of that, motorists are still ing only 38c a litre in fuel tax. If this government had followed Labor's example, motorists would be paying another 15c a litre in tax. That is the way Labor would have had it. The member for Lilley raised commodity prices and said that some have increased at a much greater rate than inflation. It is the nature of commodity prices to bounce around. If a cyclone hits Queensland, bananas go up in price. I think there was a bit of market exploitation last year, although I have no evidence, Your Honour. I simply make the point that, as soon as the price of bananas went up, Coles and Woolworths decided that the price of every other type of fruit should go up as well. One day perhaps someone will ping them on that. Nevertheless, that is what happens with commodity prices. Not only has this government cut personal income taxes for the fifth year in a row; it has also ensured that pensioners will receive a pension increase before prices increase. In other words, their pension will be fixed to male total average weekly earnings to ensure not only that it is always 25 per cent of that rate or above but also that it remains at 1.5 per cent above the rate of inflation. Essentially we have guaranteed, as Labor had in their high-taxing regime-the catch-up pay rise always put pensioners behind-that we now have a circumstance where the money is paid ahead and pensioners always stay ahead of inflation. Keeping inflation low means that pensioners are in a better position than they would have been. Personally, I would always like to see pensioners earning more. This government continues its efforts on behalf of people and continues to display its dolunderstanding of the people's trust by trusting them completely. We can work even harder to deliver on that. The government's policy is very plain. It is built around trust in people, keeping taxes as low as possible and ensuring that people paywho are in the tax-paying part of our economy pay their fair share, but not one dollar more. This bill is about cutting tax. It will take effect in two stages-on 1 July 2007 and 1 July 2008. From 1 July 2007, the 30 per cent rate will apply only to income above $30,000, up from the current threshold of $25,000. The government has examined the lowincome tax offset, which assists people at the lower end of the earning scale and means that a larger number of people pay no tax. The offset will increase from $600 to $750 and will not begin to phase out until earnings reach $30,000. That means low-income earners who are eligible for the offset will pay no tax at all on their income up to $11,000. You and I, Mr Deputy Speaker, start to pay tax at $6,000. Admittedly, we are paying tax at a lower rate than ever before at 15c in the dollar. But, because of the offset, lowincome earners will not begin to pay tax until they earn above $11,000. Many pensioners with a little bit of income and self-funded retirees who have set aside money for a rainy day-that is an unfortunate metaphor because we have not had much rain-know that in their retirement years they can draw on those savings without suffering the impost of additional tax burdens. I believe these changes will continue the journey this government started in 1996 when it made the hard economic decisions to undo the mess Labor left us. We have delivered, and the country is strong and prosperous and people are encouraged and confident. I made some remarks in the House earlier this week about the real estate industry my electorate, but it is still worth putting it on the record in this debate. We have seen record quarterly sales of real estate across south side of Brisbane, which is evidence not only of all the Victorians flooding north of the Tweed but also that there is an enormous amount of confidence in the community in south-east Queensland. They understand very clearly about the Australian government's strong economic management and the signals it is sending to them about being confident and knowing that we trust them to do what they can with their money, that they know best how to spend it. This has materialised in house purchases and investments. An extraordinary number of real estate agents have spoken to me about this issue, and that is a positive sign about where things are at. The government also wants to encourage people at the lower end of the income scale to improve themselves. These personal tax changes will provide greater incentives for part-time workers to take on the extra shift because they will keep more of what they earn rather than pay it to the government and will also generate incentives for people to improve their skills. With better skills and experience, under the Australian government's Workplace Relations Act they will be able to say to their employer, ‘I have skills, ability and experience; now pay me more.' Employers who do not look after their staff in the current environment do not deserve to keep them. As long as staff and employers are involved in one-on-one discussions, that should continue. The last thing anyone in my electorate wants to see is union bosses again involved in those negotiations, demanding but not offering, standing by the till in every small business deciding what goods and services will be sold, when the business will open and close and who should be hired and fired. in That is the lack of trust that the Labor Party and the unions want returned in Australia. Who could forget the strikes held 20 years the ago about tomato sauce not being available in restaurants? Who could forget the dim sim allowance? Workers at Darling Harbour went on strike because of the fumes wafting from Sussex Street. I am not talking about the fumes from the Labor Party headquarters but from the Chinese restaurants. We witnessed that sort of stupidity at a time of high personal tax and a time of lowering circumstance in the economy. The government's tax measures that are contained in this bill will, from 1 July next year, see the income thresholds for the 40 per cent and 45 per cent rates rising to $80,000 and $180,000 respectively. To put it another way, it will not be until you earn $80,000 a year that you will pay tax at the rate of 40c in the dollar. These figures were not imaginable under the previous government; they were never even thought about by the previous government. This government is saying, ‘Go and earn more money; go and back yourselves; go and back your ambitions; keep more of the money you earn and pay less in tax.' It will ensure that 80 per cent of taxpayers have a marginal tax rate of no more than just 30c in the dollar, with only two per cent having the top marginal rate of 45c in the dollar, which occurs after you earn $180,000 in income. So if you are earning $50,000, three years ago you were paying $11,172 in tax; now you are paying just $9,600. That is a cut of 14 per cent. If you are earning $40,000, your tax has been cut by 24 per cent. If you are earning $30,000, your tax has been cut by 45 per cent. If you are earning $25,000, the reduction is 41 per cent; on $20,000 it is 37 per cent; and on $15,000 it is 54 per cent. These are the sorts of tax cut percentages that have been delivered over the last few years by this government. For 2007-08, taxpayers will not reach the highest tax rate til they earn more than 3½ times average weekly earnings. Next year, relative to the average wage, Australia's top tax threshold will be the eighth highest in the OECD; three years ago, it was the 20th highest. We have managed the economy in an effective way that has paid off debt, delivered dividends and made sure that those on fixed wages are supported, while those who are out there earning money are able to earn the money and keep it. That is because a sense of trust has now been returned to Australia. The last thing we want to see is a return to the lack-of-trust approach that the Labor Party always seems so proud of wanting to tout when it is in office. No more high-taxing governments; no more big-spending governments: this is very much about letting individuals in Australia take up the challenge to do it for themselves, and do it for Australia as well.",41
34,Mr TANNER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"Melbourne) (10.47 am)The Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2007 that is before the parliament this morning will implement the tax changes that were brought down in the government's 2007-08 budget, which the opposition supports. In contrast to some of the previous tax cuts that have been provided by the Howard government, these tax cuts, in our view, are broadly reasonable. They deliver back to Australian taxpayers money that is clawed away from them by bracket creep-the effect of the interaction between inflation and the gradual increase in both wages and prices, which pushes people, bit by bit, higher up the income tax scales and, therefore, by stealth, takes away more tax than notionally would be the case. They do have a positive effect with respect to workforce participation. There is more work to be done on that front but we do acknowledge that, finally, the government has taken some steps to reduce the impact of un- high effective marginal tax rates, and we would expect that this positive effect will be beneficial for workforce participation in ensuing years. On balance, we believe the tax cuts are unlikely to have an inflationary effect. They are unlikely to push interest rates higher. We believe the government has sailed rather close to the wind in this regard. It is interesting to note that one per cent of GDP or one per cent of the economy has become an unofficial measure of the desired budget surplus, which ensures that the fiscal settings are not putting pressure on inflation and interest rates. Time will tell whether that is an appropriate judgement, but if you look at the forward estimates for the scale of the surplus that is presented in this year's budget, you will see that the figures all hover roughly around the one per cent mark, and it is clear that the tax cuts have been calibrated to fit with that particular framework. That judgement, in our view, is a fine culation. There have been a number of market economists who have suggested that the budget, including the tax cuts, may put undue pressure on interest rates and inflation. On balance, we do not believe that is the case, but certainly the government is sailing close to the wind, and time will tell whether it has sailed too close. It is important to recall what the Liberal Party is actually about. The Liberal Party basically represents the interests of the better-off in our community-people who have higher incomes and are in better circumstances. Ultimately, it will always be on about increasing their share-the share of the better-off-of total national wealth and total national income. As a necessary consequence of that, it will reduce the rewards that people on lower incomes, with less bargaining power, fewer skills, less marketability and less of a chance in life. That is ultimately what their infamous Work Choices legislation is all about. It is all about removing the interventions in the marketplace that are there to protect people at the bottom, at the lower ends of the spectrum, in order to ensure that they have some basic minimum protections and that they get a half-decent living wage that enables them to live as ordinary members of our society. That is what Work Choices is all aboutremoving those interventions to increase the gap and the inequalities that exist in our society. In previous tax cuts, we have seen this position, which is at the core of what the Liberal Party stands for, in a number of regards. We have seen over the last couple of years, for example, the heavy weighting of tax cuts in favour of higher income earners. The GST package ultimately was all about changing the tax mix, increasing the extent to which people paid tax through a consumption tax cal- that was the same whether you were rich or poor. If you buy something-some clothes, for example-it does not matter whether you are the wealthiest person in Australia or the poorest; you are still paying the same tax. It was also about reducing the emphasis on income tax, which of course has a relatively modest progressive scale that is designed to ensure that, as you earn more, the proportion of your earnings that is taken in tax increases. The whole purpose of the shift to the GST was to change the tax burden, to increase it on lower income earners and reduce it on higher income earners-and, of course, they succeeded in doing that. Indeed, when the former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer was challenged about this point, his only flow to response was to say, ‘We're not communists.' In his mind, the former Leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister qualifies as communism any kind of tax redistribution, any kind of notion that well-off people pay higher amounts of tax in order to help keep lower income people with fewer advantages in life in a reasonable state of living. We, of course, do not regard that as communism. Finally, it is worth noting the comments on budget night of the head of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr Peter Hendy, in response to the budget and the tax cuts. He said that, in effect, the bulk of the tax cuts were merely handing back bracket creep, merely correcting for the inevitable continuing expansion of the tax take as a result of inflation pushing people up through the tax scales. If you want evidence to back up his point, all you need to do is to look at the budget papers' projection for government revenue, which is overwhelmingly tax revenue, for the forthcoming years. What you will see is that, in the financial year that will complete on 30 June this year, the federal tax take-excluding the GST, which of course is artificially excluded but is in reality a federal tax-or the government revenue, will be 22.8 per cent of our economy, 22.8 per cent of GDP. It is projected, inevitably as a result of the tax cuts, that will fall. The government revenue, which is overwhelmingly tax revenue, will fall to 22.5 per cent of GDP in the financial year we are about to start. But, in the financial year 2008-09, guess what? The revenue of the federal government and therefore, by definition, its tax take, will in effect be back to 22.8 per cent, which is the current level, and, in the following year, it will be up to 23.1 per cent. In other words, notwithstanding the apparent generosity of the tax cuts, in reality they predominantly consist of handing back bracket creep. They merely create a relatively small blip in the government's overall share of the economy for one year and, within one financial year, that share will be back to where it was prior to the tax cuts, inevitably creating a need for further tax cuts in two or three years time. So, reasonable as they appear on the surface-and as I have indicated we support the tax cuts because, for once, the relative distribution across the income scale is not outrageously weighted in favour of higher income earners-it is important to keep the tax cuts in perspective. Largely what they are doing is handing back the money that is clawed off people in addition to the ordinary taxation they would be paying as a result of inflation and bracket creep. It is good that that is occurring, but it is something that governments should do as a matter of course, not as some kind of extraordinary demonstration of generosity or concern for the living standards of ordinary working families.",45
35,Mr CREAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"Tax policy should be about fairness and about encouraging greater participation in the workforce. In both cases, the group most deserving are the lowand middle-income earners. It is also the group which pays the biggest dividend, if it is targeted properly, in responding to that participation effect. This budget targets that group, and that is why we this support the measures. We support them, because for the first time ever the government has got the target right. Previously, in its budgets, these people have been the forgotten people. Essentially, in all the 11 years, this is the first time this group has been the prime target for tax relief. It is no coincidence that it is this group the government is trying to woo back because of its desperate plight in the polls. Nevertheless, we welcome the targeting of this group. We have consistently called for it and therefore we strongly support what has been given. Essentially these lowand middle-income earners are the people who are experiencing extreme financial pressure. Since this government got re-elected, there have been four interest rate rises, which have added $240 to average monthly mortgage payments in the capital cities. Before the election, this government promised that interest rates would not rise under them, but now the lowand middle-income earners are struggling under the weight of increased financial burden. So the tax cuts for them are welcome. It is also encouraging because of the participation effect. Labor proposed these sorts of measures before the last electionincreasing the low-income tax offset. In the parliament yesterday the Treasurer criticised Labor for never having thought of it; he said that it was all his idea. But this is something Labor has been proposing since 1998. It is something Labor costed and funded before the 2004 election. It is something we asked the Melbourne Institute to model in terms of its impact on the economy. What the Melbourne Institute found, on the basis of the proposals we put forward to expand the LITO, the low-income tax offset, and to target tax relief, including lowering the rate for lowand middle-income earners, was that our measures then would have seen a participation effect of an additional 72,000 jobs created-people coming back into the workforce. Under the crippling effective marginal rates under this government, they were discouraged from coming back into the workforce. Our measures were not just about redistribution and fairness; they were about encouraging participation. Not only did the Melbourne Institute talk about and model the 72,000 additional people who would come back into the workforce; it said that there would be a fiscal dividend for the nation in excess of $800 million. That was something we put forward in the costings before the last election. So again I make the point: tax cuts have to be about fairness and redistribution, but they can also be about driving the economy better. Mr Murphy-Hear, hear!",47
36,Mr CREAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"They can also be about increasing the participation of the economy. We have been saying that, as the member for Lowe knows, for many years. Ken Henry, the Secretary of the Treasury-the Treasurer's own departmental head-has been urging it for years as well. He talks about the three Ps: participation, population and productivity. But it is only in this budget that Treasurer has picked up Labor's solution and the urgings of his own Secretary of the Treasury and done the right thing in targeting the tax cuts. The Treasurer should have listened to us earlier and he certainly should be listening better to his departmental head, because the nation would have been better off. But he is only listening because he can hear the drums of electoral defeat getting louder and louder. That is why he has listened now. But where did he turn to get inspiration and a solution? He turned to the Labor Party and our policies-to us. That is where we believe the electorate should turn within the next six months, and it is what we will continue to campaign on and remind. I might also say that these tax cuts truly are well affordable. According to the budget figures, despite the tax cuts that are offered-not just this year but also next yearover the forward estimates the government will still be collecting $10 billion more in direct taxation. Even after these tax cuts it will still be miles in front. The Treasurer wants to put this down to good economic management. It is down to the resources boom and the strong demand from China. That is what it is about. As I say: while we welcome it, it needs to be put into context. There are two tranches associated with these tax cuts. From 1 July of this year the 30c rate will have its threshold lifted from $25,000 to $30,000; the LITO-the lowincome tax offset, which is targeted tax relief for low-income earners-will increase from $600 to $750; and the alignment of the LITO phase-out will also coincide with that higher threshold rate of $30,000. In effect what the low-income tax offset does is increase the tax-free threshold for low-income earners. As I say, it is a policy response that Labor have been urging since 1998 and that we put the forward in the 2004 election. We costed it and we funded it. I also make this observation: interestingly enough, before that last election we proposed to increase the LITO. We costed it and funded it within the then budget parameters. We proposed an $8 a week tax cut to lowand middle-income earners. When the government won the election and we found the budget revision upwards-that was the 2005 budget-we did not oppose tax cuts. We proposed alternative tax cuts, and the $8 grew to $12. The point I am making is: had the government adopted our solution two years earlier, we would not just be awarding the $14 to $20 tax increase now; people also would have had the advantage of an additional $12 for the past two years. That is what they would have had, and that has been a wasted opportunity for them. When does the Treasurer pay this money? He only pays it just before an election. He should have been paying it, because the resources of the nation could have afforded and the budget could have afforded an additional $12, over two years ago. But no, these people were not in the Treasurer's mind then. They were in our minds and in the mind of the Secretary of the Treasury, but they were not in the Treasurer's mind. The only time it comes to his mind is just before an election. The second tranche of tax cuts will occur 12 months down the track, on 1 July 2008. At that time the 40c rate will have its threshhousing. old increased from $75,000 to $80,000 and the threshold of the 45c rate will be increased from $150,000 to $180,000. As I said, we support these tax cuts because they are what Labor has been arguing for not just in recent days but over recent years, consistently and honestly. We have funded them and we have been committed to the view that these are the people deserving of them and these are the people we can target and reward. I want to make the point, in saying that we have been urging it from opposition, that Labor also practised significant tax reform when it was office. ",48
37,Mr CREAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"In the 13 years in which we were in office we gave seven tax cuts. I say to the fool of a minister at the desk, who simply prattles away and never reads anything except what is on the front page of a newspaper: seven tax cuts were awarded by the Labor government in its 13 years of office. It gave back more than bracket creep in the time it was there, and in every one of our tax cuts we reduced the rates. We did not just adjust the thresholds. We also broadened the base of taxation in this country. I heard the Prime Minister yesterday in question time saying it was the ACTU that killed off option C and tax reform in 1985. We did not. It was the Business Council of Australia supported by the Liberal Party, led by John Howard, that opposed the basebroadening measures. It is true that the ACTU, of which I was part at the time, did have concerns about what was referred to as option C. We thought it was unfair in that it was an across-the-board tax that targeted everything, like the GST does. We sought an exemption to what was then option Cwhich was a retail tax not a GST, I might point out-to exclude food, clothing and We said that if those exemptions were prepared to be made we would accept the base broadening on the expenditure side-on people's expenditure-but only if business was prepared to accept base broadening in terms of business taxation, capital gains tax, fringe benefits and the like. Do you know who said no? It was the Business Council of Australia, supported by the Liberal Party of Australia. John Howard, the Prime Minister of this country, talks about how they supported Labor every inch of the way in genuine tax reform. They did not support tax reform in 1985. They opposed root and branch any attempt to broaden the tax base in terms of business taxation. That is why the tax summit failed. It was not because the ACTU scuttled it; it was because the Business Council of Australia, supported by the Liberal Party, scuttled it. Let's get the facts right. Labor understood the fundamental need to reform taxation at the same time as delivering fairness in the package. We did that consistently when we were in office. We used taxation to not only provide redistribution but also manage the economy. And manage the economy we had to do. I remind the House, just for the record",49
38,Mr CREAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"The minister prattles on about our $96 billion of debt when his government came to office. Let me remind the House of the sclerotic state of the economy in 1983 when Labor came to power. Who was Treasurer of the nation at the time? It was John Winston Howard, the current Prime Minister. The economic mismanagement and mess that was left to us we had to correct. We had a recession in 1982-83 and real GDP had fallen 1.4 per cent. We had unemployment at 10 per cent, inflation at 11½ per cent and interest rates at 16 per cent. That occurred when John Howard was Treasurer of the nation in 1983. That was the legacy that Labor inherited. That is what Labor had to turn around. The minister talks about the debt that Labor left. Let us remind the House of the debt that John Howard left this nation. There was debt in every one of the years from 1976 to 1982-83, accumulative-a $35 billion debt in those days. I have not had a chance to calculate what the figure would represent today, but if you made a comparison with 1996, when they won office, it would be higher, I suggest, than the $96 billion. This government believes that it is the one that corrected the state of this economy. It did not, because Labor inherited that sclerotic mess and set about correcting it. It set about correcting in cooperation with the trade union movement in this country, through the prices and incomes accord. Do you know why we had such a pathetic performing economy with high unemployment, high inflation and high interest rates when John Howard was last Treasurer?",50
39,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,The member will refer to other members by their title.,50
40,Mr CREAN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"He was John Howard the Treasurer then. He was the former Treasurer, the current Prime Minister-if it assists you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The government had no effective wages policy. Wages were out of control. The then Prime Minister and the then Treasurer proposed a solution, which was to freeze wages. They sought to blame workers again. It sounds familiar, doesn't it? They cannot manage the economy so the solution is to hit workers again. Their proposal in 1982 was to freeze wages. People might like to remember it. It was Labor, when it came to office, that unfroze them and introduced the prices and incomes accord, which laid the basis for this nation's prosperity. For the first time it delivered a wages policy that did not drive inflationary pressures, a wages policy that actually delivered low inflation and low interest rates. We did it through wage trade-offs. We said that we should not just put the cost onto the employer but that we had to deliver fairness in the workplace and, rather than doing that through wages, we would do it through disposable income, tax cuts and what was referred to as the social wage-family payments, family benefits. We introduced groundbreaking initiatives such as superannuation, so we were able to deliver income for people in their retirement, not just when they were working. These Labor initiatives it, were opposed root and branch by the Liberal Party. They never supported any of our initiatives to establish compulsory superannuation in this country. And they say they were the builders? They were the wreckers. The only people who have built the prosperity of this nation have been members of the Labor Party. We did it in the period from 1982-83 to 1996. We will do it again if we are given the chance. This government has inherited the golden goose. It has inherited the prosperity that we never had. It has inherited a resources boom, driven essentially by the huge and sustained growth in China. That presents many challenges to us, not the least of which is how we perform on export markets. But under this government, despite the resources boom, we have been performing appallingly. Labor, in its 13 years of office, was able to grow exports every year by eight per cent. This government, in its 11 years, with a resources boom over the last five, has only been able to grow exports by four per cent. It has halved the rate of growth in exports, despite the strongest resources boom almost in the history of this country. It is not a good economic manager. People deserve tax relief but they also deserve a government that introduces and develops policies that lay the prosperity for this nation. You cannot pay for anything unless you have that prosperity. It has to be sustained prosperity, but there has to be fairness in its distribution. The people who built the prosperity, who laid the basis for this nation's prosperity today, have been members of the labour movement. I say that in the broadest sense, because so often we get criticism and ridicule from those opposite about the influence of the trade union movement. I am proud to be a member of a trade union. I am proud to have led the trade union movement, but not just for self-interest and their benefit. I wanted to lead an organisation and a structure that drove forward, with purpose, the future direction for this country. I firmly believe this: if people participate structively in contributing to growth, they should be entitled to fairness and a fair say its distribution. So I have no qualms about sitting down with the trade union movement at any stage and arguing distribution. My only challenge to them-and it always has been; and when I led them. I insisted on this-is that you have to be part of the wealth creation. You cannot just argue about distribution; you have to be part of the wealth creation mechanism. The labour movement has been a proud contributor to wealth creation in this country, and I have been proud to be part of a movement in many guises that has contributed as such. We welcome these tax cuts, but we also say that after 11 years, for the first time ever, this government has targeted the right people first. And the only people who have ever consistently looked after them in this country have been the Labor Party. We look forward to having the opportunity to represent them again from that side of the chamber, because they will get a better deal in the future just as they did in the past under us. (Time expired)",50
41,Mr MURPHY,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"What an unalloyed pleasure it is to follow the member for Hotham after his passionate and blistering contribution to the debate. The people of Hotham who listened to his speech today no doubt understand how well represented they are. It also says a lot about the wisdom of the ALP branch members in Hotham who, last year, stood up in such vast numbers in support of him. His intelligence and energy are a source of inspiration to me. I am sure the minister at the table has been listening to and making notes of the member for Hotham's contribution.  Mr Crean-He's learnt the truth.",51
42,Mr MURPHY,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"He has, Simon. I rise to support the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal con- Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2007. I support it solely on the basis that any reduction in in taxation is a good thing for the public. However, this is a case of too little too late. I will reflect on that, because the member for Hotham said this in an earlier address-in reply to the budget-and he will remember it when I get to it. For reasons which I will put to the House, we make the retort, yet again, to this government that by doing good, they shall do much evil. What is the good in this bill? Obviously, there are reductions to personal income tax. At face value, that rings well in the ears of the public-until we look at the real impact and the net impact of this bill. This House and the public may ask: what are the real impact and the net impact of this bill? This bill is ultimately one of a raft of taxation bills proposed by the government. As a taxation bill, it falls within fiscal policy. It a fruitful exercise to discern what real impacts, if any, these so-called tax cuts will have on the economy. In my view, when discerning the real impacts we must have regard, as the member for Hotham pointed out, to Mr Henry's key impacts. These are known as the three Ps: population, participation and productivity. The three Ps are reflected upon in a Parliamentary Library article published on 21 May entitled Budget review 2007-08. The three Ps concern, inter alia, the following matters of fiscal significance: economic stimulation, particularly in the areas of job creation, job retention and productivity; impact on net and real disposable household income and thus influencing population issues, including disposable income, dependent spouse rebate, and Medicare rebate; and the relationship of tax deductions to the net inflation rate, a major variable in the participation rate through wages, costs on employment and, hence, inflation. The Budget review said: It remains to be seen if the balance of measures provided by the Budget will be ‘too little too late' ... I note that this bill bears a striking, if not identical, resemblance to an earlier bill titled the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2003. I again cite part from the Budget review, under the chapter titled ‘Personal income tax and superannuation': Another Budget, another set of personal income tax cuts. The Treasurer thinks we should be happy that we have seen tax cuts in every budget since 2002. However, looks are deceivingand this budget is no exception. When you read between the lines as well as the financial figures, you see where the truth lies with our so-called tax cuts. As members will recall, the 2003 bill was first introduced into the House on 29 May 2003 and was passed is by it on 4 June 2003. The bill's assent was on 24 June 2003. The 2003 and 2007 bills have striking similarities. Indeed, I am reminded of the words of Field Marshal Rommel when he said: ‘They came in the same old way and they died in the same old way.' He was referring, with irony, to the Duke of Wellington at the Battle of Waterloo. The 2003 bill raised the ire of the Leader of the Opposition at the time-the member for Hotham, the Hon. Simon Crean, whom we have just listened to. He decried the 2003 bill. In his budget reply, he said: The highest taxing government in our history has given you the smallest tax cut in our history. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer think that Australians earning between $30,000 and $50,000 a year are affluent and that they only need another $4 a week. But while they give with one hand they slug you with the other: up to $50 to go to the doctor, $32 per week extra in HECS debt and $125 per week to pay off your new student loan. If this were simply about dollars and cents, the budget would appear to be a step in the right direction; however, there is little said about population as a discrete subject matter within any analysis of the three Ps. The Australian economy is one of gross imbalances. It is immoral that there can be fantastic sums of money offered to the corporate elites and the corporate masters. Obviously the corporate masters-Allan Moss, the Chief Executive of Macquarie Bank, and his investment banking chief, Nicholas Moore-enjoy an annual joint income of $66 million between them. The article titled ‘Trough-fest at millionaires' factory', dated 15 May 2007, notes: Another four executives collected between $14.6 million and $22.9 million last year. One may expect that these fantastic sums reflect performance based salaries and stipends at Macquarie Bank. If the corporate executives are doing that well then they ought to contribute more money than the paltry microshifts going on in these tax reductions and make a real difference to fiscal impact. Indeed, the spin being afforded is that these tax cuts are at the expense of the corporate world. Such adjustments are a drop in the bucket to the real costs on family and the environment because the real test of fiscal policy is indeed based on population no less than participation and productivity. There is a saying that this House should remember: we are all slaves. This saying reflects the real economic disparity that our country has fostered. Are we supposed to be grateful for these tax cuts when excesses of greed are running at the rate where executives in Macquarie Bank-which is the notorious failed raider of our beloved corporate icon, Qantas, and a host of other utilitiescould be so richly rewarded? If the economy is doing so well, why does our real population growth continue to flounder at less than zero? Why is our fertility rate languishing at 1.9 children per mother? Why is there one divorce for every two marriages? You may ask, ‘What has this got to do with fiscal icy?' The answer is: population. Fiscal policy is a vital factor leading to healthy population activity. The words of my friend and previous speaker Simon Crean in 2003 are equally relevant today. This budget is indeed a case of ‘too little too late'. When we compare the budget to real outcomes, we are still left with aggregated government policy that is destroying family life through falling disposable household income. I note in particular that in real terms access to education and the cost of education, including deferred HECS payments, places a person in debt for the remainder of their life. Banking fees and overall household debt continue to rise in Australia. On 15 May 2007, the Sun Herald reported information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics: Total personal finance commitments fell 1.0 per cent in March, seasonally adjusted, to $6.690 billion compared with a downwardly revised $6.755 billion in February. The ABS further noted: Housing finance for owner occupation climbed 1.7 per cent to $14.523 billion from an upwardly revised $14.276 billion in February. Despite the small decline in personal debt, households remain overstretched to afford housing and essentials of life. Australia is a nation living on credit. Any inflationary increase will trigger a debt level that the household sector will be hard pressed to meet. Despite this, we are led to believe that this fiscal policy is a success in population terms. We are barely growing in population terms. Every year, it seems, the government must increase skilled and business migration quotas just to bring in more persons to fill the ranks of children that have not been born in Australia to native Australians. It is clear to me that the cost of marrying and living in family relations is simply too expensive, and would be families are opting out of raising pol- home-grown Australian families. It is tempting to look at this bill purely in financial terms; however, fiscal policy is not a purely utilitarian exercise. Success can never be measured in purely financial outcomes. All the money in the world does not matter if families are shattered or never get off the ground, no matter how attractive a tax reduction may look. Equally, what does it matter how much money one has when the environment is ruined? The biblical saying holds true: What does a man gain if he gains the whole world and loses his soul? The analogy is to this present circumstance. We are told there is a record surplus-a bumper budget surplus-and there are tax deductions all round. However, we do not compare the financial benefits and costs to the social benefits and costs in true cost benefit analysis. We ignore in this analysis the family breakdown rate in society, the financial factors contributing to our statistically high matrimonial breakdown rates and the abortion rates. If the economy is going so swimmingly, why are these social indicators not reflected in the economic good times we are supposed to be having? I put to the House today that these tax cuts are a drop in the bucket. This means that the reduction in taxation is not meeting socially responsible outcomes of significance. Until these real costs to the financial benefits are married up, these tax cuts are puerile and insignificant. It is my firm belief that much more money will need to be injected into the household sector before we see tangible reductions in the social costs of divorce, suicide, single lifestyles, low fertility rates so forth, which produce an economy that is sterile-that is, not growing of itself and increasingly dependent upon migration to sustain even its own existence. Equally, at a time when Australia becomes an ageing population, it is self-evident that Australia needs to address the population issue with added urgency. For this reason, fiscal policy must create the economic environment in which families can build with financial confidence to give them significantly greater disposable income so they can afford and have access to health, education and other necessities of life. In this budget as in the succession of other budgets, to steal a line from Midnight Oil's song, ‘the rich get richer; the poor get the picture'. The general public cannot conceive of a single individual like Allan Moss getting nearly $34 million per year. This is an unbelievable sum of money to the average Australian. The government says that the Australian taxpayer is getting a tax cut, but they are going into more and more debt in a bid to pay-guess who!-the likes of Macquarie Bank and the other banks for increasing mortgage debt in order to afford necessities of life. This demonstrates that in fiscal policy terms this government is not passing on the so-called productivity bonuses of the executives to the general public. The productivity gains are being hoarded by selfish, uncaring and greedy people. Let us be blunt about the Realpolitik of this budget. Yes, it is true that the Australian public is working harder than ever. The Australian public is working longer and harder, yet the real gains are being enjoyed by a few in the corporate world. Huge profits accruing to the corporate world are being siphoned off, with the so-called executives getting fantastic sums of money while Australian workers must pay disproportionately high percentages of their incomes, leaving them in and absolute terms with very low disposable incomes. Even if Mr Moss pays an extra $1 million in tax, he can easily afford a flagrantly affluent lifestyle. However, homeowners must receive substantially more money if they are to have children, or even if their matrimonial relationships are to survive under the pressures of the ever-increasing financial costs of living. This bill is based on greed out of all proportions. The 2007 bill is too little too late. When we measure this bill against the effects of the still massively underfunded passing-on of financial windfalls to the household sector, we still find households that cannot afford to pay their children's costs, medical costs, education costs and the general costs of marriage. Still the family is the subject of exploitation by the eternal greed of the likes of Macquarie Bank-the millionaires factory that glories in their grotesquely inflated, self-serving distribution of profits towards a board of directors who are not worth the estimated $206 million per year collectively. I can only ask the question here today: what does one man do on a board that makes him deserving of nearly $34 million a year? What does Mr Moss do, on a day-today basis, to deserve $34 million? Receiving $34 million per year means receiving a little under $635,000 per week; even allowing for tax, that is not a bad take-home salary! It is the price of a new home every week. It is about 109 times the salary of the Prime Minister, who has to run a $1 trillion budget. absurd. It is staggering that the rest of us, under this government, are supposed to make our contribution under this draconian Work Choices legislation by making sacrifices for the so-called betterment of the economy, yet people who are on the board of directors of Macquarie Bank rake in $206 million per year collectively. Little wonder that people are saying to us that they have stopped listening to the government and that the government is getting tired. It seems to me that the government are looking after those who really do not need looking after. We have seen it in much of the government's legislation. I suppose the best example-the one I was most interested inis in the government rewarding the two biggest media companies with a massive concentration of media ownership. It was just a shocking assault on the public and the future of our democracy. But the people of Australia will make a judgement later this year, and I suspect that they have tuned out from the government; perhaps that is why the polls are the way they are at the moment. Let me finish by saying this. Let us be clear: until this government moves serious money into the household sector, our population policy outcomes and fiscal policy will reflect households with families that continue to be snookered by rising health, education and transport costs. Those people will continue to be compelled to spend what nominal gains they may get from these paltry tax cuts. Thankfully, people will get the choice-probably on 13, 20 or 27 October this year-to make a judgement of the government and to make a decision on whom they think this government really represents. It does not represent the people I represent in Lowe.",51
43,Mr KERR,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"The government seems to be quite thrown by the opposition's support of these measures in the It is Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2007, but there really ought to be no surprise in relation to our support of these tax cuts because the opposition, for a very long time, has been identifying a failure of this government to address the welfare and economic needs of those who sit in the middleand low-income bands. There is an old saying-I think it is attributable to Lord Keynes; I may be wrong and I apologise if I am-that taxation is the price paid for civilisation. We all have to pay tax. We expect our governments to raise revenue, and we expect them to utilise those revenues in the public interest. What has been so particularly galling for the Labor Party, over the last five years in particular, is the squandering of the period of quite unprecedented economic growth that this country has benefited from. It has been a period of worldwide strength in the global economy. The actions of this government have been focused upon benefiting its narrow apex of most elite supporters, forgetting the large national issues that required significant infrastructure investment, and treating those in the middleand low-income bands in Australia with indifference but expecting them still to give their political fealty to the Howard government. The chickens are coming home to roost. One of the things that are inherent in politics is praising your own game and damning, either by faint praise or by direct criticism, the strength of your opponents. For the last year or two we have had Peter Costello, a flat track bully, to use cricketing parlance, boasting about how well the Howard government has managed the national economy, against a background of governments, competent and incompetent, across the globe benefiting from an economic circumstance of unprecedented generosity. I thought the Leader of the Opposition put his finger squarely on one of the key failures of the Howard government in his budget reply when he pointed out a very thoughtful remark of the former President of the United States: ‘The time to fix the roof is when the sun is shining.' What is troubling about this government is that, at a time when the economy has been strong and when managing it has been a doddle, it has given tax cuts to the very apex of Australian society, frittering it away on those who least require the benevolence of the national government. It is forgetting the interests of those on lower and middle incomes and in particular avoiding its long term responsibilities for investing in the looming challenges of the future: the challenges of climate change and of making certain that our education and health systems are fit for future generations. The Leader of the Opposition's remarks in his budget reply put me in mind of, I suppose, a grown-up version of Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. This government has been behaving like the grasshopper-fiddling around, squandering a period of economic growth when the summer sun is high and the corn is lush, and not putting it away into those large national projects that we will need when economic circumstances are not so robust. It has not planned for circumstances we will inevitably face. At some time in the future, we will need independent strength to weather changes in economic circumstances, when the engine rooms of China and the other economies which have given us the resource boom are not dragging us along quite so firmly in their wake. That is where we will truly see the cost of the economic failure to think ahead and plan for a national future. That has been so characteristic of the indolence of the last five years of the Howard-Costello government. It is not surprising that those who have not been the focus of this government's largesse over the last five years are feeling pretty damn grumpy about it. I would too, were I in their shoes, but I am not; I happen to be in the band of income earners that has benefited reasonably well from the Howard government's largesse. I am not right up there at the top. The previous speaker made remarks about those who are paid $33 million or $34 million per annum in executive salaries. Their effective tax treatment has been so generous as to truly be shameful. But I sit in the upper-middle-income band, when you take it against average earners, and I have done okay. But, if you look at the vast majority of those that I represent in my electorate, who earn substantially less than I do, it is not surprising that household debt has increased from 50 per cent of disposable household income in 1996, when the Howard government came into office, to 150 per cent of disposable household income in this current year. It is not surprising that people in lower and middle-income bands are not responding with huge whoops of joy to a government that has finally, in its hour of electoral need, found it in its stony heart to vide tax cuts to them. The magnitude of this needs to be put in context. Those tax cuts represent in the order of $31 per week at the highest level. The norm would be in the order of $20 per week. That is less than two packets of cigarettes per week. It represents about the average increase that people are paying in petrol due to higher petrol prices. It goes nowhere near compensating people for the higher interest rates that have occurred in the last two years since this government was elected on its shabby commitment to keep interest rates low. This was projected as a pledge that interest rates would not be increased-another act of political chicanery and trickery, for which this government is duly famous. As the previous speaker also said, we do not live by bread alone. There is a real sense of moral failure about this government. It is complicit in a range of less than savoury conduct, which undercuts any claim to legitimacy in the eyes of the broader Australian community. Who can forget the distinction between core and non-core promises that started this government's retreat from the high statements of principle on which it came into office? A range of political circumstances have now led people in the community to look to someone with a higher sense of aspiration and to values which are a little more inspirational than they have had presented to them as being representative of their interests by their government. So many human values have been disregarded by this government. Think of the ‘children overboard' incident, where the governmentknowing the falsehood of its own accountprojected it as truth throughout an election campaign. Think of the industrial relations those Work Choices legislation, where the government said conditions were protected by law knowing it to be untrue. Now it is forced into retreat and is spending taxpayers' money proto persuade them of its next round of lies. Think now of Abu Ghraib, where the US coalition forcesMr Dutton- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: this is a contribution from yesterday's man-there is no question about that. How is this possibly relevant to the bill being debated in the House at the moment?",55

45,Mr KERR,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"Abu Ghraib is the straw that will break your moral authority because, as we heard last night on television, this government was advised months before those events were acknowledgedMr Dutton- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the member is clearly in defiance of your earlier ruling. This is nothing to do with the bill before the House, and I ask you to draw him back to this debate.",57
46,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"The minister will resume his seat, and I will rule on the point of order. Mr Griffin-On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: this fundamentally goes to the question of the way this government behaves, and the points being made by the member relate to that question.",57
47,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"The member for Denison has the call, and I am sure he will refer back to the bill.",57
48,Mr KERR,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"The point I am making is that this government, in its late conversion the interests of those lowand middleincome earners who it purports to represent, is on course and on par to continue the deceptions that it has played upon the Australian public for far too long. I make the same point that has been made in this debate by previous opposition speakers that we do not live by bread alone, that values matter. This bill represents the worse of values, in the same way as this government has corrupted the political process in so many other areas. As I was saying of Abu Ghraib-because the government certainly does not want to know-last night there was a clear accusation, unanswered, that this government was aware of shocking abuses occurring in detention facilities before pictures were in our newspapers, and it gave an untruthful account of those matters to the public in the parliament. It has not acknowledged it; it has not come clean. It is on a par with the ‘children overboard' incident, it is on a par with the account the government gave us about the venture into Iraq, it is on a par with its advertising about people's rights being protected by law in industrial relations and it on a par with its complicity in a whole range of other areas of untruth. It is an accurate reflection of the moral vacuity that this government reached when it dealt with refugee policies and the death penalty, where it has failed to stand up on a simple, straightforward basis that Australians should never be complicit in carrying out the death penalty. The Australian public is beginning to wake up to the fact that this government, on a whole range of issues, exercises its rule with a moral blindfold. Similarly, the short term has always been privileged over the long term. This legislation is short term. It provides welcome measures to those who need tax relief at the bottom end, but had it not distorted the benefits that had been given in budget after to budget-privileging those at the apex of its political power base rather than spreading benefits through the community-we would not have a community as resigned to the ugliness of politics in Australia and as ready to consider a change of government as we presently have. We need a change of government to one that can look forward to the large challenges that our nation faces. Climate change is not merely an economic issue. There is no doubt that it is an economic issue. That has been demonstrated by the Stern report. Even the hard-headed of those who have been critical in the past have come to realise that the science is so persuasive that there is no alternative but to accept it. Now those leaders in the economic profession recognise that the failure to act in a responsible way will bring about long-term economic costs. Climate change is also a moral question, because those who have the greatest capacity to give leadership are those in the privileged First World countries of the United States and Australia. And there too we have been complicit with the deniers-those who have is wished the issue away, those who, in the beginning, lined up with the economic interests who wanted no change and persuaded this government that it was something they could turn a blind eye to and ignore-that we need not sign up to Kyoto, that we need not have effective agreements transcending national boundaries and that we could sit out this dance on climate change. Of course, again the chickens are coming home to roost. So why would the public give credit to the government for bringing in these welcome tax cuts? The government is rather hoping that the opposition will oppose these measures. Of course we will not. I understand that the shadow Treasurer has said in this debate that he would have thought the Treasurer would welcome Labor's unqualified support for these tax cuts but ‘like an inebriated nightclub goer he is wandering the streets desperately wanting to pick a fight'. How sad it is that our political dialogue and discourse has come down to this. How sad it is that this government, which has had the benefit of benign economic circumstances for a long time, has been so reduced in its political authority that it is wandering around the streets, like that street slugger, looking for a fight on an issue that we have been advocating for years. And how pathetic is the idea that we would steal the government's clothing! When the government, in its year of desperation, is choosing at last to follow the recommendations that the opposition has been putting to it-spending some of the largesse on those who most truly need it-it is the most extraordinary perversion of truth to say that Labor is copying the government. I find that so sad. The public is ready for change. All these things add up together: the government's inhospitable and foolish indifference to the long-term challenges we face on skills, climate change and the great challenges of the future; the government's privileging of the very rich, its strongest support base, against the broad base of the community; and the government's failure to act in the national interest at a time when its coffers are overflowing with money. These are things that are leading to judgements in the Bulletin poll today. On the question ‘Do you feel better off now than before John Howard was elected Prime Minister?' 35.6 per cent said no and 32.6 per cent said yes-in a period of economic prosperity, what a condemnation. On the question ‘Do you think Australia is better off now than before John Howard was elected Prime Minister?' over one-third say no-despite a decade where the most benign international economic circumstances exist. What a condemnation! And it is so well deserved. (Time expired)",58
49,Mr DUTTON,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (11.56 am)-I thank those members who have made a contribution to this debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Reduction) Bill 2007 and I would like to respond directly to some of the comments by the member for Denison. What his comments say most about him is that he is a failed Labor minister from the Keating period. He has displayed all the virtues of Mr Keating today. He is completely removed from the common people within his electorate and this country. He likes to grandstand, generally with the same debate, and he comes into successive speeches with the same talking points. He is stuck in the past, and he is displaying all the arrogance of many of those opposite at the moment, who believe that the Australian people are going to surf them into victory at the coming election. This government has never taken the Australian people for granted. We have listened to the Australian people and we will continue to listen to the Australian people. We will not, though, take advice from people who were born of the Keating era, who have nothing to contribute to modern Australia and who would be a return to the past were they ever to be elected again to ministerial positions in this place. The opposition has made some contributions in relation to this debate which should be praised, but there are many contributions that cannot be praised because they are factually incorrect, misleading and an affront to the facts that are relevant to the debate before the House at the moment. The Labor Party in government delivered to small businesses and to a whole range of Australian people who were trying to make a go of it in the Australian economy a regime of high interest rates and high government debt and of saying to the Australian people that they were incapable of managing the Australian economy-and nothing in the last 11 years they have been in opposition would demonstrate anything other than that. The reality the Labor Party today is that they do represent the past. They want to return to domination by the union elite in this country, and that is a great threat to the Australian people. The government have been able to introduce these tax cuts because we have managed the economy well. We have not been dictated to by union leadership. We are not like the Labor Party, which is 70 or 80 per cent made up of ex-union bosses, ex-union hacks. When you consider that they would be sitting around a cabinet table making economic decisions, it is unrealistic to expect anything other than what they delivered when they were last in government-that is, bad outcomes for Australian families and bad outcomes for Australian business. The measures contained in this bill provide personal income tax cuts of $31½ billion over four years, as announced in the 2007-08 budget. These tax cuts will increase disposable incomes for all Australian taxpayers and will provide further incentives for individuals, including part-time workers, to participate in the workforce. These changes build on the substantial reform delivered in previous budgets and will further enhance Australia's international competitiveness. From 1 July this year, the 30 per cent marginal tax rate threshold is to be increased from $25,001 to $30,001. The low-income tax offset is to be increased from $600 to $750 from 1 July 2007. It will begin to phase out at the start of the new 30 per cent threshold of $30,001 and those eligible for the full low-income tax offset will not pay tax until their annual income exceeds $11,000. From 1 July 2007, senior Australians eligible for the senior Australians tax offset will not pay tax on their annual income up to $25,867 for singles and up to $43,360 for couples, depending on their income split. The increase in the 30 per cent threshold and for the low-income tax offset will provide more incentive for those outside the workforce to re-enter it and those in part-time work to take on additional hours. From 1 July 2008, the threshold for the 40 per cent rate will rise from $75,001 to $80,001 and the threshold for the 45 per cent rate will rise from $150,001 to $180,001. In 2008-09, taxpayers will not reach the highest marginal tax rate until they earn more than 3½ times average weekly earnings. Increasing the top threshold will improve the competitiveness of Australia's tax system. In percentage terms, the greatest tax cuts have once again been provided to low-income earners. More than 80 per cent of taxpayers face a marginal tax rate of only 30 per cent or less over the next four years. As my contribution to this debate, I say that to change the government in this country at the moment would be forever to change the face of the economy. We cannot take for granted the gains that we have been able to lock in over the last 11 years. The Labor Party still stand, as they did when last in government, as the greatest threat to future prosperity not just for the Australian economy. When we talk about the economy, we talk about the benefits flowing to Australian families. We talk about the capacity of managing the Australian economy resulting in being able to give more back to Australian families. We talk about giving more back to small businesses. We talk about generating an environment where more people can go into employment, where more people can enjoy the gains that the management of a strong economy brings. At the moment we have a very stark contrast between the opposition and the coalition government, who have delivered well over the last 11 years and want to continue to manage the economy well, to provide support to families and to small businesses, and to create an atmosphere of continued economic growth so that we can return more dividends to Australian families and to Australian small business. On the other hand, the Labor Party want to return management of the Australian economy back to union bosses. That is why they are bringing more union bosses into parliament, which will increase representation in the parliamentary Labor Party to about 80 per cent of those people who, in government, would sit around a cabinet table making decisions about the economy which would be in the best interests of unions and union bosses, not in the interests of workers, Australian families or Australian small business. That is something we need to consider as part of this debate before the parliament on this very day. I thank all members who have contributed to this debate. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",59

Bill read a third time. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 May, on motion by Mr Dutton: That this bill be now read a second time.",61
51,Mr BOWEN,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"The Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007 implements two measures announced in the 2007-08 budget, both of which enjoy the Labor Party's support. Part 1 of schedule 1 to this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to increase the dependent spouse tax offset from $1,655 to $2,100 from 1 July 2007. The separate net income at which the rebate is completely phased out will increase from $6,901 to $8,681. The full dependent spouse tax offset is available to a resident taxpayer who contributes to the maintenance of a low-income spouse. The dependent spouse rebate was introduced in 1975 as one of the new rebates for dependants to replace the old income tax allowances for the maintenance of dependants. Taxpayers are eligible to claim a dependent spouse tax offset if they maintain a spouse on either a married or a de facto basis and the taxpayer claiming the offset or the spouse is not entitled to family tax benefit B. The full offset is only available where the taxpayer has a spouse who earns very little or no income, as the tax offset is reduced by $1 for every $4 by which the dependent spouse's separate net income exceeds $282. The income of the higher income earner is not taken into account. The dependent spouse tax offset is currently indexed each year by reference to the consumer price index. Labor supports this proposal to provide a more significant tax offset to taxpayers supporting a low-income spouse than would be provided for under the normal CPI adjustment. The dependent spouse rebate is one of a number of rebates provided to taxpayers who support a dependant. Others include the invalid relative rebate and a rebate for taxpayers who support a parent or parent-in-law. The invalid relative rebate is provided to taxpayers who support a child who receives a disability support pension or a special needs disability support pension or who is certified by a medical practitioner as having an inability to work. The parent tax offset is provided to taxpayers who support a parent or parent-in-law. These offsets and other offsets are increased by this bill in line with CPI increases. They are indexed each year. Part 2 of schedule 1 to the bill amends Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals and families. The dependent child/student component of the family threshold will also be increased. The increases are in line with movements in the consumer price index. It will increase the Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners below age pension age so that they do not have a Medicare levy liability where they do not have an income tax liability and it will increase the Medicare levy surcharge low-income threshold in line with movements in the CPI. These increases occur every year and are announced in the budget. The Medicare Levy Act provides that no Medicare levy is payable for low-income individuals and families where taxable income or combined family taxable income does not exceed the stated threshold levels. The family income threshold increases by a set amount per child. The Medicare levy shades in at a rate of 10c in the dollar the taxable income or combined family taxable income exceeds the threshold amounts. The bill increases the low-income thresholds for individuals and families for the 2006-07 income year in line with movements in the consumer price index. The individual threshold is to be increased from $16,284 to $16,740. The level of the family income threshold is to be increased from $27,478 to $28,247. The family income threshold is to be increased by a further $2,594 instead of the previous figure of $2,523 for each dependent child or student. The schedule also increases the threshold for pensioners below pension age for the 2006-07 income year and subsequent income years. The increase ensures that pensioners do not have a Medicare liability where they face no income tax liability. That is sensible and, of course, has the opposition's support. the The threshold amount for pensioners who are under the age pension age is to be increased from $19,583 to $21,637. The phase-in limits are also increased. The phase-in limit for individuals is increased from $17,604 to $19,694. The phase-in limit for pensioners who are under age pension age is increased from $21,170 to $25,455. References to the individual low-income threshold amount of $16,284 in the Medicare levy surcharge provisions in respect of the surcharge payable on taxable income are also being increased to $16,740. Labor supports this proposal to provide assistance to low-income earners by exempting them from paying the Medicare levy. The opposition has no criticism of this bill. We support each of the clauses. We particularly support the increase in the dependent spouse rebate, which is higher than inflation would indicate, as a suitable recognition of the burdens on lowand middle-income earners, particularly those who are sustaining where a non-working partner. We support that measure, as we support the other measures which are annual increases in line with inflation.",61
52,Mr HARDGRAVE,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I thank the member for Prospect for his support on behalf of the opposition of these measures in the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007. There is no doubt that this year's budget is all about paying forward a dividend on the government's strong economic management over the past decade. It is important that, as the Treasurer says, we lock in the gains, do the hard yards, put in the effort in the way in which Australians from many backgrounds and with many different beliefs and experiences have cooperated in such a constructive and proactive way to make a difference for themselves and their families. The rub-off in our society is most pronounced. It is worth noting that the way this government has introduced the family-friendly measures in this legislation sends a signal to people on the margins. The Welfare to Work reforms have been very much about coercing and coopting people who perhaps because of taxation imposts have believed it is cheaper for them to stay at home rather than go out to work. As the member for Prospect said, this legislation goes beyond making CPI adjustments, which the member for Melbourne in an earlier debate alleged. The government is saying: ‘We want to put your money where our mouth is. If you are on the margins of decision making and under pressure to get back into the workplace, the rewards will be there.' The government, in dealing with working and non-working family members, understanding the impact of the number of children in a family and adjusting the tax scales according to those differences, recognise that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work and that we simply cannot say that every family has 2.4 kids-we would all like that but the figure is about 1.7 kids per familyand make our laws based on that average. There are plenty of families in my electorate with six or seven kids. Refugee families love receiving the bonuses the government have paid in the past. One Sudanese woman told me that she had seven kids and that she had never before had $4,200 in the bank. This legislation does not seek to impose a onesize-fits-all approach; it recognises the range of differences in each family. This bill does several things. First, it troduces the dependent spouse tax offset. It addresses the threshold amounts and the phase-in limits, to use the technical jargon that we hire accountants to work their way through. It also deals with families and pensioners who are under the age pension age limit and increases the threshold below which a family member is not required to pay a surcharge on any taxable income. The government is increasing that threshold so that low-income earners do not pay the Medicare levy. The bill does that in part by increasing the threshold from $16,284 to $16,740. Based on the income you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I earn-and we do earn itthat may seem a modest amount. However, it will make a difference in low-income households. The level of the family income threshold, which is referred to in various subsections, is being increased from $27,478 to $28,247. The threshold is to be increased by a further $2,594, instead of the previously stated figure, for each dependent child or student. For some large families, this measure may lead to quite a substantial lift in their income threshold and a reduction in the levy payable, if their family income is within a particular range. For individual taxpayers, no levy is payable if their taxable income does not exceed $16,740. For a pensioner, the threshold is $21,637. Obviously, we are making sure that pensioners, and people who earn bits of income while in receipt of a pension, will not pay the Medicare levy out of that income. With respect to families with large numbers of children, if there are six children, no levy is payable if the family income does not exceed $48,811. For families with two children, the threshold is $33,435. It is worth noting that the government is not trying to impose a one-size-fits-all measure. It understands that there are a variety of infamily sizes in this country. Equally, the phase-in-or phase-out, depending on how you look at it-aspect means that a reduced levy applies to those on incomes between $16,741 and $19,694. For individual taxpayers, an ordinary rate of levy is payable once they get past that amount of $19,694. For a large family, one with, say, six children, the ordinary rate of levy is not paid until they reach an income level of $51,542 or, in the case of a more moderate sized family, one with two children, $39,335-up from $35,159. I make the point yet again that we are not adopting a one-size-fits-all approach. We understand that individual families and the decisions they make can be built around some of these cost pressures. Hand-in-glove with that, as a result of the extra personal cuts announced in the budget, there is an $11,000 effective tax-free threshold for lowincome earners through the low-income tax offset. All in all, the range of measures contained in this bill, and those contained in the budget as a whole, ensure that people are paying less tax. The dependent spouse tax offset increases from $1,655, with effect from 1 July, to $2,100. It is an offset that is available to resident taxpayers who contribute to the maintenance of a resident spouse whose separate net income does not exceed $282. For those who make the decision to stay at home and raise children, this will provide a greater sharing of the tax responsibility across both spouses. The measure will increase the level of separate net income at which the tax offset is completely phased out from $6,901 to $8,681. This provides further assistance for people who enter the workforce on a part-time basis. They will not have to be afraid that a dollar earned will somehow be robbed by way of a dollar taxed, or that they will literally be working just for the taxman. The government is putting the money where its mouth is on these issues. We are saying to people who are prepared to take up the challenge and engage themselves back in the workforce, ‘We will back you as well through the taxation measures that we are introducing.' I want to speak for a moment about the Medicare levy. As we all know, the Medicare levy does not fully pay for Medicare services in this country. The Medicare levy is a contribution by taxpayers. This legislation increases the income threshold before people have to pay the Medicare levy-$16,740 for individuals and $28,247 for families. This year, with additional government expenditure tax factored in on top of the Medicare levy, taken in the form of tax by those who are earning a wage or income, we will see a lot more work being done for Australians, particularly those with lower incomes. I refer to the additional $378 million for greater access to private dental services. Patients under a GP treatment plan can receive up to $2,125 per year in Medicare rebates. If there is a health related problem as a consequence of poor dental work, they are able to seek support through the Medicare system for that work to be done. I often remark that the Queensland government run their own free dental service, but generally the waiting list is five, six, seven or eight years long before you get access to it. A number of people have come to me over the years who are upset about the fact that, even though there is a dental service at the PA hospital and at the QEII hospital, it takes forever to get access to it. They talk about the genuine hurt that they have felt over the years. I know there has been a lot of pressure on the government to look at ways of putting a dental scheme in place. I think we have hit the mark in this regard, because this measure will prioritise those with the greatest need, based on their health requirements, and puts those people first in the queue. It will allow them to avoid what seems, to my mind, to be a very lethargic state-run system in Queensland. It is a system that is often held up in this place as an example of the way in which a national dental health plan could work, but I say to members from other states: don't look at the Queensland dental health system as an example of what you would want Australia wide. There is nothing that you could sink your teeth into. It has a lot of genuine problems and it seems that it is always those who are in the greatest pain who are the last to get through the door. It seems that you have to know somebody. That certainly has been my experience over the last decade. From my point of view, using the Medicare rebate in this way to allow GPs to arbitrate exactly who should get priority when it comes to dental health services for lower income people makes good sense. I am pleased that those who will be advanced by the measures contained in this legislation, who will be making a contribution to Medicare-indeed, those who will not be making a contribution, as in paying the full levy, parts of the levy or even no levy-will be the sorts of people who will be able, if they have no other means and the GP signs off on it, to get access to that. As well, we want the state governments to match the $103 million type 2 diabetes program. It is not so much that we are saying that we will only do half. When you have a hospital system that is operated by state governments and a private hospital system that is mainly subsidised through things such as the up-to-40 per cent rebate on private health insurance by the Australian government, it is really important to have a buy-in. You challenge the states to buy in, and they take ership of the program and its success. Nothing will guarantee a passion and commitment towards the success of a program more than buying into that program. In that regard, we want the states to match the $103 million type 2 diabetes program, and I am sure they will because it is important. We will run the Treasurer tomorrow-perhaps, around the building-because it is important that we consider type 2 diabetes.",62

56,Mr HARDGRAVE,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"One-armed pushups are your speciality; we will spread the word through the streets of Woodridge about that. We are just a bit worried that if the Labor Party get into office, we know where their other hands will be: in everyone's hippocket, taking more tax off them. That is the only thing I will say. Of course, there is the $486 million increase in research medical grants. Some of the best and brightest researchers, like Dr Ian Frazer, research and find ideas and solutions that will make a difference. I know that the work being done at Griffith University in looking at Toohey Forest and some of the natural fauna and flora, particularly the flora that grows there, and in looking for medical solutions has come as a result of some of the medical research grants made in the past. There is $228 million to extend osteoporosis medicines on the PBS, and an additional $150 million to combat illicit drugs, including ice. Also, there is $150 million to improve nutrition and encourage healthier lifestyles, including the Active After-school Communities Program. I simply make all those points in the context of this legislation. own- Taxpayers need to know that they are being used as the vehicle for the raising of the funds which, through proper economic management, are redirected into programs which continue to make a difference in so many ways. The ongoing effort of good, strong ecoafter nomic management has delivered two million additional jobs since 1996, wages up by over 20 per cent, low and stable inflation and a doubling of household wealth. But, through these measures today, we are saying to those at the lower end of the income stream, ‘We're going to continue to take the pressure off you to allow you a chance to find your way so that you can build for your own future.' The tax cuts included in this measure show that this is the fifth year in a row that we have cut tax. We now have a budget surplus of $10.6 billion but we are not swimming in a swimming pool filled with money-those opposite like the Scrooge MCDuck cartoons-we are investing in the future. We are giving an unprecedented boost to education funding that will make a difference to universities such as Griffith University, and there is greater childcare assistance, $19.1 billion in AusLink 2 transport programs and more investment in health and chronic illness; essentially, we are protecting and securing our nation. The measures here, though, are about the equity on that journey and about saying to those at the lower end of the income stream, ‘As you make your decisions to perhaps go off welfare or perhaps go from being a single-income household to a dual-income household, your journey will be well supported by the creation of a lower tax environment.' I commend the bill to the House.",65
57,Dr EMERSON,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"Rankin) (12.27 pm)The Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007 implements two measures that were announced in the recent budget. I am pleased to confirm that both of these measures will receive Labor's support. The bill amends the Income Tax Act to increase the dependent spouse offset from $1,655 to $2,100 from 1 July 2007. The separate net income at which the rebate is completely phased out will increase from $6,901 to $8,681. The full dependent spouse tax offset is available to a resident taxpayer who contributes to the maintenance of a lowincome spouse, and, overwhelmingly, this is therefore an equity measure. Taxpayers are eligible to claim a dependent spouse tax offset if they maintain a spouse, whether married or de facto, and the taxpayer claiming the offset or the spouse is not entitled to family tax benefit part B. The full offset is available only where the taxpayer has a spouse who earned very little or no income, as the tax offset is reduced by $1 for every $4 by which the dependent spouse's separate net income exceeds $282. It all sounds complicated, but these thresholds are routinely adjusted because, with the movement in the general price index, the value of these concessions would otherwise be eroded over time. In relation to the dependent spouse offset, the income of the higher income earner in the household is not taken into account. The dependent spouse tax offset is currently indexed each year by reference to the consumer price index. The reason we are debating this legislation today is that those adjustments were announced in the budget, as they usually are, and we need some enabling legislation, which we have. Labor supports this proposal to provide more significant tax offset to taxpayers supporting a low-income spouse. The second part to the first schedule of the bill amends the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals and families. Again, this is an equity measure. The dependent child or student component of the family threshold will also be increased. The increases are in line with movements in the consumer price index, and that is why we get this high level of specificity in the dollar amounts involved in moving from one threshold to another. The bill also increases the Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners below age pension age so that they do not have a Medicare levy liability where they do not have an income tax liability. We know there are lots of pensioners in Australia who are not age pensioners, so this legislation covers them too. The bill increases the Medicare levy surcharge low-income threshold in line with movements in the consumer price index. The increases occur every year and are announced in the budget. The Medicare Levy Act provides that no Medicare levy is payable for low-income individuals and families where taxable income or combined family taxable income does not exceed specified threshold amounts. The family income threshold increases by a set amount per child. The Medicare levy shades in at a rate of 10c in the dollar where the taxable income or combined family taxable income exceeds the threshold amount, otherwise you would have very steep effective marginal tax rates over, admittedly, a narrow income range. To avoid those very high effective marginal tax rates, the Medicare levy shades in at that of 10c in the dollar. Otherwise, if you move from one particular income level just below the threshold and went over it by $1, you would get hit with the full Medicare levy. How important that is in practice would be a matter for empirical investigation, I guess. But it would not be pretty to be confronted with the situation where, if you earn one extra dollar, you lose much more than that through being liable for the full Medicare levy. That is why it phases in at this rate of 10c in the dollar. The bill increases the low-income thresholds for individuals and families for the 2006-07 income year in line with movements in the consumer price index. The individual threshold is to be increased from $16,284 to $16,740. The level of the family income threshold is to be increased from $27,478 to $28,247. The family income threshold is to be increased by a further $2,594 instead of the previous amount of $2,523 for each dependent child or student. The schedule also increases the threshold amount for pensioners below age pension age for the current financial year and subsequent income years. The increase ensures that these pensioners do not have a Medicare levy liability where they face no income tax liability. The threshold amount for pensioners who are under age pension age is to be increased from $19,583 to $21,637, and the phase-in limits are also increased. I could go into the details of that, but I do not want to bore those who are listening with further high levels of detail. The point is that these adjustments are almost automatic. They are announced in each budget and are then legislated. They are being legislated today in this particular bill. I suppose an alternative would be to legislate for automatic adjustments so that we did not need to come into parliament and make these adjustments in the way that we do. But that is a matter for the government of the day. It rate is something that might be worth contemplating. I do not have a strong commitment to that thought, but it is a thought I would like to throw on the table or, more accurately, the dispatch box. Labor supports this proposal to provide assistance to low-income earners by exempting them from paying the Medicare levy. It is worth pondering for a moment why we have a Medicare levy. We have a Medicare levy because we have had Labor governments in the past. If we had not had Labor governments, there would be no Medicare levy. The pre-Whitlam and post-Whitlam eras were characterised by coalition governments and there was no universal health insurance. In fact, the Whitlam government introduced Medibank and the incoming Fraser government that later became the Fraser-Howard government went about systematically destroying universal health insurance coverage in this country. In that time, between 1975 and 1983, there were seven different coalition health policies in seven years, all directed at ensuring there was no universal health insurance coverage in this country. As a consequence of that, when the Hawke Labor government was elected in 1983 there were two million Australians without health insurance coverage. Just contemplate that. Under the Fraser-Howard government, two million Australians were out in the cold and very vulnerable to the consequences of becoming ill and having to go to hospital without any coverage such as that provided by Medibank beforehand and by Medicare under the incoming Hawke government. That is why we have a Medicare levy. The Medicare levy was designed to collect, in a progressive manner from taxpayers, a contribution to the overall costs of health care in this country. That is why these adjustments are being made today. The concept was that if the income tax system was progressive then the Medicare levy itself would be progressive, but only if we adjusted the thresholds at which the Medicare levy became payable in accordance with changes in the cost of living as measured by the consumer price index. Previous speakers from the coalition have said that the budget includes some measures to deal with dental care. To the extent that it includes some measures to deal with dental problems in our country it is welcome. But why not reinstate the Commonwealth dental scheme? The Keating government implemented the Commonwealth dental scheme and one of the first decisions of the incoming Howard government was to scrap it. In a most slippery explanation of the government's scrapping of that scheme, the current health minister said that it had expired with the effluxion of time; it just ran out. If gram just runs out, you would not find in the budget papers the savings from the expiry of the program; it just expires with the effluxion of time. In fact, the government booked the savings from scrapping of the Commonwealth dental scheme in its budget but said it just died; it expired with the effluxion of time. It wanted to have it both ways. Either you scrap it and face up to the community and say, ‘It is true that we don't care that much about the dental health of low-income earners and pensioners and therefore we have scrapped this scheme,' or you say, ‘It just expired with the effluxion of time and therefore we do not book the savings.' But this government wanted the best of both worlds. Labor has said time and time again that it would reinstate the Commonwealth dental scheme. The waiting lists are horrendous. Somewhere in the order of 500,000 needy Australians are waiting to get their teeth fixed. In Logan Hospital, which covers most of my electorate, the waiting lists are very long. It was the Beattie government that stepped into the breach created by the abolition of the Commonwealth dental scheme and increased funding for dental care at Logan Hospital. But there is a great hole there-pardon the pun-because the Commonwealth vacated the field. We have just heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, who is at the table, say that it just expired. So here we are yet again to this day repeating the minister's completely false statement that this program simply expired in 1997, yet they booked the savings. He is well-briefed. The propaganda machine is well and truly grinding on, although they have had to change a name-Work Choices-as they dare not say it. The propaganda machine is grinding on but we are not to mention that name anymore. This propaa proganda machine has got government ministers, parliamentary secretaries and backbenchers all briefed that this program just ran out, but you cannot book the savings at the same time. There are a range of other tax measures in the budget which I will refer to today. I give credit where credit is due, because some of those tax measures are quite worthwhile and constitute some element of an overall reform package, but not the totality of a comprehensive reform package. In this budget the government increased the low-income tax offset from $600 to $750. It used to be, in the budget before last, $235. So in two budgets the government has increased that lowincome tax offset from $235 to $750. The effect of that is that low-income earners have an effective tax-free threshold now of $11,000 rather than $6,000. Why is that important? The answer is that over that range, from $6,000 to $11,000, important decisions can be made, and are made, in relation to whether a low-income earner takes on extra work, perhaps moving from a casual job to a more permanent job, and therefore earns extra income. The benefit of increasing the low-income tax offset is that that tax-free threshold will be available all the way up to $11,000. So in the range between $6,000 and $11,000, 15c is stripped off what is called effective marginal tax rate-that is, those low-income earners are able to keep 15c in the dollar more than they otherwise would have been able to do had the low-income tax offset been set at the pre-existing rate of $235. We give credit for this policy because Labor policy. The shadow Treasurer and former shadow minister for family services, the member for Lilley, has been arguing for this policy for as long as I can remembercertainly for the last five or six yearsbecause it is he who has led the debate on the need to reduce high effective marginal tax rates to improve the incentive to move from welfare to work. So credit goes to the shadow Treasurer and credit goes to the government for picking up the shadow Treasurer's suggestions. We do give credit where credit is due. There is another good, positive measure in the budget that has similar incentive effects-that is, the threshold for the 30c rate is pushed out from $25,000 to $30,000 a year. Again, this is an important area for work incentives. It is around the area of the minimum wage. We know that one of the problems with the minimum wage is that there is a lot of interaction around that income level between the income tax and social security systems yielding in some cases very high effective marginal tax rates, depending on the number of children you might have and your eligibility for family tax benefit and other benefits. All of that means that, by shifting the threshold of $25,000 to $30,000, again, the 30c rate cuts in later, at $30,000 instead of $25,000, taking 15c off the effective marginal tax rate over that income range. Why is that important? The answer is that those income earners get to keep 15c more in the dollar for every extra dollar they earn. That therefore improves work incentives. That is another positive measure. I the would point out that both of those measures I also recommended in my book Vital Signs, Vibrant Society, although I readily acknowledge that the member for Lilley had been arguing for such measures for some time. The government is likely to get an improvement in workforce participation by imit is proving those incentives, but there are a group of Australians for whom the incentives remain completely perverse. I am referring to single mothers. The government has announced and is now in the process of implementing so-called welfare to work reforms. In fact, they are welfare to welfare reforms. This is one of the worse pieces of public policy that you can imagine. Single mothers whose youngest children are turning eight are, as we speak, being dropped down from the higher sole parent pension, called the parenting payment, to the unemployment benefit, called Newstart. So they will lose a substantial amount of money per week and they will have a lower income threshold before they start losing that benefit. They will lose their education supplement. It is obscene that single mums who try to improve their workforce capabilities by lifting their skills, whether it be through vocational education or going back to school, will lose this pensioner education supplement. All the incentives go absolutely the wrong way. All the incentives go the way of moving not from welfare to work but from welfare to welfare. There is one way of avoiding that drop in payments and the loss of those incentives and that is to have another baby. It is free country and mothers should be able to have babies when they want to, but is this really a matter of great public policy design? The government has set up incentives whereby poor single mums who are struggling financially will be put in a situation where benefits are stripped off them and they will have one clear course of action remaining. That is to have another baby and put the problem off for another six to eight years and pick up a baby bonus, which is soon to become $5,000. That is why I cannot for the life of me understand how any government could come up with such a scheme. The government announced a review and there seemed to be hope because people were pointing these things out. Ann Harding from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, whom the Prime Minister often quotes, pointed out these perverse incentives. The government reviewed them and did not change any of the fundamentals. That problem is still there. I have given credit where credit is due in this budget, but I urge the government in the time that it has remaining to have a fresh look at the welfare to work arrangement for single mothers because it is really welfare to welfare and it should be scrapped.  Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007 implements two measures announced in the recent budget and both are supported by the opposition. The bill proposes to increase the dependent spouse tax offset and the Medicare levy surcharge lowincome thresholds. The dependent spouse tax offset was, until recently, commonly referred to as the dependent spouse rebate. It has been a feature of the tax system for many decades. It was designed to provide a reduction in income tax for a person who is supporting a dependent spouse and therefore does not have the benefit of a second tax-free thresha old within the family. Prior to 2000, the rebate was available at a ‘with child' rate to taxpayers supporting a dependent spouse where there were dependent children in the family. With the introduction of the family tax benefit part B-FTBB-in 2000, the with child rate of rebate ceased to be available where FTBB was paid. It now has relevance only for the calculation of zone tax offset and overseas forces tax offset. As a result of this change in 2000, the increased offset provided by this bill will mainly benefit couples without dependent children. This bill increases the dependent spouse rebate from $1,655 to $2,100 from 1 July for taxpayers who contribute to the maintenance of a low-income spouse. This bill also increases the Medicare lowincome thresholds for individuals, families and pensioners below aged pension age in line with movements in the consumer price index to ensure that low-income families and individuals are exempt from paying the levy. Labor supports this proposal to provide a more significant tax offset to taxpayers supporting a low-income spouse. The separate net income at which the rebate is completely phased out will increase from $6,901 to $8,681. The full dependent spouse tax offset is available to a resident taxpayer who contributes to the maintenance of a low-income spouse. Taxpayers are eligible to claim a dependent spouse tax offset if they maintain a spouse-married or de facto-and the taxpayer claiming the offset or the spouse are not entitled to FTB part B. The full offset is only available where the taxpayer has a spouse who earned very little or no income as the tax offset is reduced by $1 for every $4 by which the dependent spouse's separate net income exceeds $282. The income of the higher earner is not taken into account. The dependent spouse tax offset is currently indexed each year by reference to the consumer price index. The Medicare levy is set at 1.5 per cent of taxable income. However, there are a series of exemptions for low-income earners and pensioners. People with a taxable income below the relevant threshold do not pay the levy. Once their income exceeds the threshold, they pay a levy equivalent to 10 per cent of the amount by which their income exceeds the levy until the amount reaches 1.5 per cent of their total taxable income. The thresholds vary for individuals, families and pensioners. Those for individuals and families are increased from time to time in line with movement in the consumer price index. The threshold for pensioners is set at a level that ensures that they pay no levy until they are liable for income tax. Part 2 of schedule 1 of the bill amends the Medicare Levy Act to increase the Medicare levy low-income threshold for individuals and families. The dependent child/student component of the family threshold will also be increased. The increases are in line with movements in the consumer price index. Part 2 of schedule 1 also increases the Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners below aged pension age so that they do not have a Medicare levy liability where they do not have an income tax liability, and increases the Medicare levy surcharge lowincome threshold in line with movements in the CPI. These increases occur every year and are announced in the budget. The Medicare Levy Act provides that no Medicare levy is payable for low-income individuals and families where income or combined family taxable income does not exceed stated threshold amounts. The family income threshold increases by a set amount per child. The Medicare levy shades in at a rate of 10c in the dollar where the taxable income or combined family taxable income exceeds the threshold amounts. The individual threshold is to be increased from $16,284 to $16,740. The family income threshold is increased from $27,478 to $28,247. The family income threshold is to be increased by a further $2,594 instead of the previous figure of $2,523 for each dependent child or student. This schedule also increases the threshold amount for pensioners below aged pension age for the 2006-07 income year and subsequent income years. The increase ensures that such pensioners do not have a Medicare levy liability where they face no income tax liability. The threshold amount for pensioners who are under aged pension age is to be increased from $19,583 to $21,637. The phase-in limits are also increased. The phase-in limit for individuals increases from $17,604 to $19,694. The phase-in limit for pensioners who are under aged pension age is increased from $21,170 to $25,455. References to the individual low-income threshold amount of $16,284 in the Medicare levy surcharge provisions in respect of the surcharge payable on taxable income are also being increased to $16,740. Labor supports this proposal to provide assistance to low-income earners by exempting them from paying the Medicare levy. I did want to comment on some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Rankin that we need to have a really good look at Welfare to Work changes and the disincentives that are already within the system. As I have already said, the measures in the bill are supported by the opposition. The acid test for me, because I have met them in my electorate, is single mums who want to go back to work. When they do go back to work they have great difficulty in finding childcare places, but, even when they do overcome that hurdle, the net advantage-that is, any additional dollars that they may have-is minuscule. I support what we are doing with this bill-and I welcome even further changes-but it will not, I regret to say, them that financial incentive to go back to work. We should be able to say to people, ‘If you go to work you will be financially better off than if you are at home and on welfare.' Unfortunately, that has not been the case. We often disparage these women, but the reality is that they would prefer to go to work. Our credentials in society come through what we do. Often the very first question we ask someone when we meet them for the first time is, ‘What you do?' People like to say, ‘I'm a proud mum, but I have got a job-I'm working here.' Mr Windsor-‘I'm a member of parliament.'  honourable member for New England points out, are prepared to own up to being members of parliament-he most honourably and I churlishly would own up to being members of parliament. But that is how our credentials are judged. I think a lot more work needs to be done to overcome some of those significant disincentives for people to return to work, especially when they want to do so themselves, quite voluntarily. Some of these measures, of course, refer to the Medicare levy. I regret to say that one of the things that really made a big impact in my electorate was the closing of the Mount Druitt Medicare office. They did it under the pretext that, within 10 kilometres, you could go to Penrith or to Blacktown. Of course, the government might say, ‘It's only your electors that are concerned about it.' But now, with the changes to the electoral boundaries in Lindsay, there will be plenty of people in North St Marys, in St Marys, in Oxley Park, in South St Marys and in Colyton who are going to be in the electorate of Lindsay and would have gone to Mount Druitt when that office was open. The overwhelming majority give of those people would have gone to Mount Druitt. I am very keen to have that Mount Druitt Medicare office reopened. If we are able to achieve it after the next election, I rest confident in the knowledge that not only are people in my electorate going to appreciate it but also people in the electorate of Lindsay due to the changed boundaries. I hope we are able to achieve it. We will have a great opening ceremony, and I will be happy to provide the bottle of champagne. Unfortunately, we are a long way away from that. A lot of people were seriously disadvantaged by its closure. I am talking about the Medicare levy, and, of course, there were some important measures announced in the budget in relation to dental health. I welcome the additional dental positions that were established; I think that is a good thing. But again, one of the things that caused sadness in my electorate was this government's decision to close down the pensioner dental health program. Governments get criticised from time to time for what they do and how effectively the programs run. This was a very good, effective program, and there is no doubt that the states also have a public dental health program.",66
58,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I would remind the honourable member of the subject matter of this bill. Perhaps that material might be better raised in his speech on the appropriation bills. While we are having a wide-ranging debate here, he might come back to the subject of the bill.  Madam Deputy Speaker; I appreciate your advice. I was making the point that this bill makes changes to the Medicare levy. One of the announcements in the budget was a new program where money out of the Medicare levy can be paid for dental health. That is a good thing. It is a breakthrough. It is the first time the government has recognised a federal responsibility towards dental health. But the tragedy is-and I am sure the honourable member for New England would agree with me-that for people to take advantage of this new program announced in the budget, funded out of the Medicare levy, they have to have a chronic illness. You cannot access the program because you have bad teeth or you need dentures or you need all of your teeth removed; you actually have to have an ancillary chronic illness. How many Australians are going to benefit from that? In a program that I was referring toMr Windsor-There's no teeth in the policy!  for New England has pointed out-I had not thought about it-there are no teeth in the policy. It does not bite enough, in my view. But seriously, 600,000 of our fellow Australians were able to take advantage of the previous program, which Labor is committed to reintroducing. Whilst I support the changes to the Medicare levy, I also welcome the federal government crossing over, for the first time, to recognise it has some responsibility for dental health. But I want to point out that we have a very long way to go in relation to that. One of the real difficulties faced by a lot of my constituents, who are going to perhaps benefit from the measures I have outlined, is that they are paying mortgages. They are feeling the pinch. I remind the House that, at the last election, the promise was made that interest rates would be kept low",73
59,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,I must remind the member that we are not having a debate on interest rates; we are having a debate on,73
60,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,the Medicare levy issues.  Speaker. I thought we were having a debate about the tax laws,73
61,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"The dependent spouse rebate and others, yes.  ment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007, which talks about the impact of some changes in the budget to families-to single families, to families with a dependent spouse, to families that are serving the country overseas. I just want to make the point, Madam Deputy Speaker, that whilst these measures for those families are welcome, and I support them, their outlook is not altogether rosy. I think this is a factor that even the Prime Minister may have recently commented on. They suffer some difficulties. For example, these measures are aimed at lowincome earners who are doing it tough-and I am very proud of the fact that I have got a lot of good, decent people in my electorate who are not on fabulous money and will benefit from some of these measures. I talked about dental health and the announcements in the budget that impact on low-income earners. In fact, there have been some really disturbing statistics released cently that indicate that low-income earners in particular, but Australians generally, are not following up their medical care. They will go to the doctor and get a prescription, but they do not get the prescription filled. Why? They cannot afford it. I think that ought to be of concern. Thirty-four per cent of Australians have not had a prescription filled, have skipped a recommended medical test or treatment or follow-up of a medical problem or have not seen a doctor because of costs. In Canada the figure is the UK it is 13 per cent. The federal government needs to tackle that issue. As welcome as these changes to Medicare are, we cannot have Australians not being able to afford appropriate health care. We are supporting the passage of this bill; we just wish it had gone further.",73
62,Mr WINDSOR,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I appreciate that this is a fairly wideranging debate, as you have mentioned, Madam Deputy Speaker. I support the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007 and cognate bills before the House and I endorse some of the remarks that were made by the member for Chifley in relation to the Medicare levy and the dental care arrangements that have been put in place by the government. I commend the government on the new university places at the Charles Sturt Dental School in Orange. I think they are a very positive move forward. But I wish the government had looked more closely at the Medicare arrangements for accessing dental care. It is obvious to most of us that our teeth are part of our body and they should be treated as such by those people accessing care for their dental problemsand I do not mean cosmetic problems. The government has, to a certain degree, recognised that, if people with chronic problems and certification by their doctor are not treated for their oral health, it will lead to reother complications and they will be need to be treated under the Medicare arrangements. That is a good move, but if they were not treated they would enter into the health-care system and the Medicare arrangements would be triggered anyway. I urge the government, particularly after the good economic management that has been conducted over a number of years and in light of the sums of money that have been accumulated, to look closely in the future at the relationship between Medicare, the Medicare levy 26 per cent. In and dental care. I seek a little licence, Madam Deputy Speaker, to commend a constituent of mine, Mrs Ruth Mathews, who for some time has been conducting a campaign to get the government to look at the Medicare levy, which this legislation does, with a view to increasing it if needed so that dental care can be provided to all and covered under the Medicare provisions. She has gathered thousands of signatures for her petition, which will be presented to the parliament. I commend her as a citizen for the work that she is doing and for her use of the parliamentary processes. The Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007 identifies a range of measures in relation to dependent spouses. It will increase the Medicare levy threshold, and I agree with the intent of that arrangement. Taxation generally, and the use of taxation policy, is about sending a range of messages to the broader community. It is a very important part of government policy because it delivers signals which may be an incentive for the community to do something. I noticed, for instance, that the superannuation arrangements put in place certain incentives for people to look after themselves long term, and I think those measures in the budget should be applauded. Taxpayers are sent other messages that I think are complicated, complex and sometimes bewildering. In this bill, for instance, there is a clear message being sent to taxpayers, particularly with regard to low-income earners and the thresholds relating to Medicare. But if one looks closely at some of the other measures where taxation policy is being used it becomes a little more complicated. The taxation message that current policy is sending to the community, particularly to those who are looking to invest in renewable fuels-and I know, Madam Deputy Speaker, that you take a particular interest renewable fuels and the climate debate-is that by 2011 those who are investing in renewable fuels will be taxed under the excise arrangements. I use that as a very good example of the wrong message being sent. We have a policy message being sent almost daily by government and opposition about climate change, sustainability, renewable energy sources et cetera",74
63,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I will be consistent with the honourable member and say that this debate is, as he properly referred to it at the beginning, about spouse rebates and like issues. Climate change can very adequately be dealt with in his appropriation speech. So we might come back to the subject matter of the bill.",75
64,Mr WINDSOR,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"I take on board your comments, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I point out that in his speech the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, who is in the chamber at the moment, referred to thresholds. Obviously the world is on a precipice at the moment, and policy directions will determine some of the longer term thresholds that embrace the wider community. I think it is important, as the minister did in his quite lengthy introductory speech, to send a very clear message to those people who are going to be recipients of Medicare assistance and the various thresholds involved",75
65,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,I am very clear about the subject matter of the bill.,75
66,Mr WINDSOR,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"Yes, Madam Deputy Speaker. I think that the broader messages that are being sent in relation to renewable fuel policy, and particularly the water taxation issue, are quite clearly different to the rhetoric that is being delivered by government. They are thresholds that government should be looking very seriously at. For a government-and the minister in the chamin ber is partly responsible for this particular policy initiative-to compensate water users for the loss of entitlement, then apply taxation policy to those very water users and then expect other water users to embrace, for instance, a grand plan for the Murray-Darling means, there are mixed messages in the signals that are being delivered. As this legislation is about budget measures I think it is very important that we do, as the minister has here, very clearly state what the objective is and put in place the policy that sends that message. The point I am making is that there are mixed messages coming from some of the other policy areas. I urge the minister at the table, who introduced this legislation, to look at the clear message that comes from what he has done here-which I commend-and at what he should be doing in relation to some of the other areas, particularly in terms of the water taxation arrangements. I think it is an abomination that people who are giving up a resource for the greater good, so that others in our community can live a more prosperous existence in the long term, could go into a compensation arrangement and then find that the government of the day is going to assess the receipt of that compensation as income in the year of receipt, with up to 40 per cent of that money hence being returned to government coffers. That is crossing a threshold that should not be crossed. I think that is something that this government should have a very clear look at. I have intimated my views on fuel taxation as well. We have this odd message being sent, with the government saying on the one hand that they want to send a clear message. They are doing that with this particular bill, and they are doing it with superannuation, in my view, but they are not doing it with some of these key threshold issues of sustainable energy, sustainable climate, sustainable systems et cetera. I urge the minister who is here today to address these issues. I conclude my remarks and support the legislation before the House.",75
67,Mr DUTTON,FISHERIES LEVY AMENDMENT,"Dickson-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (1.17 pm)-in reply-Can I start by thanking those members who have contributed to this very important debate. The first part of the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Budget Measures) Bill 2007 increases the dependent spouse tax offset from $1,655 to $2,100, with effect from 1 July 2007. This change also allows a dependent spouse to earn more income before the offset phases out, increasing the separate net income at which the tax set completely phases out from $6,901 to $8,681. The second part of this bill increases the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for individuals and families in line with increases in the consumer price index. The low-income thresholds in the Medicare levy surcharge provisions are similarly increased. These changes ensure that low-income individuals and families will continue to be exempt from the Medicare levy or surcharge. The Medicare levy low-income threshold for pensioners below age-pension age is also increased to ensure that, where these pensioners do not have a tax liability, they not have a Medicare levy liability. The amendments to the Medicare levy lowincome thresholds apply to the 2006-07 income year and later income years. The measures in this bill continue to build on the strength of the Australian economy. They are really what the government is about in terms of running a strong economy, from returning dividends to Australian families and to Australian small business in particular to making sure that the government continues sound economic management in this water country so that we can have young people and mature-age workers returning to the workplace, providing a brighter future not just for them but for our country as well. What this government will never do is go back to the days of Labor. Labor let the trade unions run this country, and the ultimate mess that the economy ended up in was a disgrace not just for them but for the Labor leadership as well. At the moment the very clear message to the Australian people is that, if there is a change of government in this country, there will be a change in the way in which the economy is managed. People from Queensland, in particular, know that one of the greatest threats to the Australian off- economy is the member for Lilley. The shadow Treasurer is known best by people in our own state of Queensland. They know his disastrous record of contributing to economic debates in this country. They know that Wayne Swan would be a wrecker of the Australian economy. That is a very salient message at this point in time. This government has been and continues to be about listening to the Australian people. This is the way in which we deliver good economic outcomes. What do we mean when we talk about good economic outcomes? We mean that we want to run the economy well so that we can continue to lower taxes, so will that we can continue to drive down unemployment and so that we can continue to put more money into the families of Australia and into small businesses to create an atmosphere where people can, for years to come, as they have over the last decade, enjoy life in the way in which they have become accustomed. The greatest threat if there were a change of government in this country would be the reality of a return to union domination. We know that, in the eighties and in previous times when Labor has been in government, it provided a situation where the union bosses and the union hacks dominated economic policy, which resulted in bad economic outcomes. How do we know that Labor would pose a great threat to the Australian economy? Not just because of their past track record, where day. Australian families were paying 17 per cent and small businesses were paying 20 per cent interest rates-people know; they suffered during that time. But how do we know that Labor would wreck the Australian economy into the future, given the opportunity again? We know that because they have facilitated the return of even more union bosses to the front bench after this election. If Labor were elected we would be in the position where 70 or 80 per cent of the people sitting around a Labor government cabinet table making decisions on the national economy would be those people. We know, from times past, and from comments present, that the Labor Party, and the union bosses in particular, do make economic decisions not in the best interests of this country but in their personal best terests. Labor cannot be trusted with the economy today, as they have not been able to be trusted with the economy in past times in government. I want to take the opportunity to thank all of those again who have participated in this debate. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",76

70,Ms LIVERMORE,AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY,"I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Amendment Bill 2007. This bill is supported by Labor, as it will improve the management structure of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary inMedicines Authority. It will bring the authority's arrangements into line with management arrangements for other government statutory entities. It draws on the recommendations of the Uhrig report, which reviewed the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders. The review's key task was to develop templates to ensure best practice governance principles would assist the establishment of effective governance arrangements for statutory authorities. Under the bill before us, the assets and liabilities of the authority will become assets and liabilities of the Commonwealth. However, the authority will continue to be a statutory authority of the Commonwealth constituted under the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act. I understand the authority will be able to continue business as usual in the way it contracts and acquires property, appoints agents and seeks legal advice. The bill will also prevent conflict of interest, with staff of the authority now employed under the provisions of the Public Service Act rather than the administration act. In addition, the authority will now be managed by a chief executive officer. Under previous arrangements the authority was managed by a governing board. I understand that an advisory board will be appointed by the minister, and that board will advise the chief executive officer. I take this opportunity to remind the minister that the Uhrig report recommended the minister must be well supported in making the appointments to statutory bodies, and I urge the minister to ensure that he seeks all relevant advice in making decisions on these important appointments. The authority is an important body which administers the assessment and registration of pesticides and veterinary medicines and provides for their regulation up to and including the point of sale. The authority administers the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in partnership with the states and territories. Its role is to independently evaluate the safety and performance of chemical products to ensure that the health and safety of people and the environment are protected. It is interesting to look at the history of authority. It dates back to the former Labor government. In the late 1980s, the Labor government understood and embraced the need for an ongoing program of reform of the regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. Initially the Commonwealth's involvement in the agricultural and veterinary chemical and pesticides clearance process was informal. But the Labor government of the day recognised the need to formalise arrangements and from 1 July 1989 the arrangements were put on a legislative basis, with the enactment of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988. From 1967, the intergovernmental arrangements for the clearance and registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals were devolved to the states and territories. This led in July 1991 to the Labor Commonwealth government taking the lead and seeking agreement from the states and territories, which at the time were governed by both the coalition and Labor, to a nationalised approach. They agreed to replace the existing eight state and territory registration bodies with a single national scheme to register agricultural and veterinary chemicals. This established the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council to undertake clearance activities. In July 1991, the Commonwealth, states and territories agreed to establish the National Registration Scheme-the NRS-for agricultural and veterinary chemicals. This important initiative enabled the development of the NRS and sought to place under one national umbrella the assessment and registration of all agricultural and veterinary chemical products. This had previously been undertaken independently by the Commonwealth and each of the states and territories. Furthermore, in 1992 the Commonwealth announced it would establish the National the Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals to undertake the registration activities, with associated policy issues being the responsibility of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The establishment of the national registration authority in 1992 was a very significant step in the development of the national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals. It was a clear indication of the commitment of the Labor government of the day to an ongoing program of microeconomic reform of these regulatory arrangements. The reform led to a much better system which could work more effectively to ensure national standards in this most important area of regulation. In 2003 the national registration authority changed its name to the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, and, of course, it is the ture of that body that is going to be amended under this legislation. In conclusion, Labor welcomes these amendments, which will improve the governance arrangements of this essential and vital organisation which works to protect the health and safety of the community.",77
71,Mr TUCKEY,AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY,"I note that the longest I will be able to speak on this occasion will be up to 10 minutes before question time, which certain people may want to take notice of.",79
72,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY,I would remind the honourable member that question time is at 2.30 today.,79
73,Mr TUCKEY,AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY,"I was given advice on this matter, and the only way I could communicate it was by making those comments. Unlike the previous speaker, the member for Capricornia, I have matters of concern that I will be raising during the 20 minutes that the parliament makes available to me. This legislation might be considered routine. It has been announced as party policy that committees and bodies of that nature will be restructured under the Uhrig principles. Those principles are best described as a process which further empowers the executive over the board. In broad terms, this is mainly how the corporate sector operates: the board is considered the policymaker and the executive undertakes the administration of that policy. To a degree, I think there is a bit of a bottoms-up circumstance confronting the APVMA with the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Amendment Bill 2007. The bill deals with the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act. The APVMA is the acronym for the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. As I said, the legislation is about a process which involves increasing the power of the executive and the strucmore advisory capacity of the board. Having given the example of the corporate sector, I think the issue here is the extent to which this new board sets policy. My major concern relates not so much to that process-I do not oppose it; I support it-but to a fundamental vacancy or a flaw by default in the legislation, which is presented as a positive. The parliamentary secretary said in her second reading speech that the role of the APVMA is to license the use of veterinary and agricultural chemicals, particularly by people. I am very concerned that we are moving further towards empowering a bureaucracy while removing the influence of the politicians and minister involved. That is what the bill before us does. The remark is often made, ‘We have to keep the politicians out of this.' In my terminology, that means, ‘Keep the people out of this.' When there is talk about keeping farmers, veterinarians and others out of a process involving agricultural veterinary chemicals, it concerns me that some faceless people will instead be deciding on these issues. The evidence I want to bring to the attention of the House today is about how dangerous this can be. I will relate two recent decisions by the APVMA concerning two chemicals that are very important within the agricultural sector. They have been around for decades, but suddenly it has been discovered that they have some harmful effects. One of chemicals is called diazinon. To quote one of the newspapers from the other day: ‘Diazinon is dead.' Diazinon is used to treat tick infestations, particularly in sheep, and to protect sheep from blowflies-blowfly strike. The other solution to blowfly strike is mulesing. At the moment, an international debate is being held on mulesing. Representatives of the Australian wool industry, I think unadvisedly, have made promises to the activists. The industry is in a legal conflict with the activists as to their right to bully retailers into refusing to sell wool products. The activists claim that mulesing is a cruel measure, even though it protects wool-bearing sheep from blowfly strike in Australia. My view, after having had long experience both as a member of parliament for an agricultural industry electorate and as an owner of farming and sheep station properties over the years, is that the removal of some skin on a lamb to protect it from the horrors of maggot infestation is akin to a child skinning their shin-as most do at some time during their younger years. They fall over on a gravelly or rough cement area. The wound looks quite frightening at the time. There is blood and all sorts of mess, but within hours the child feels no serious pain. Typically, the wound is treated with some iodine or something of that nature. I have always protested that, while mulesing is painful in the short term, it gives protection to the animal over their life. The alternative is a regular spray or drenching with a product like diazinon, which has been used for many years. An alternative to that product is to put a chemical on the animal's back after it has been sheared or when you can get close enough to its skin. The chemical it is absorbed by the skin and it goes into the bloodstream. Its repellent effect is by literally poisoning flies and others insects that try and attack the animal. Poison has to be used carefully, because it could have a consequent effect on people when the animal is slaughtered. But this chemical is well managed. Diazinon was put into the old-fashioned sheep dip. Sheep were driven, one by one, into a concrete trench in the ground and they swam from one end to the other. Halfway up the trench, someone stood with some implement to push their head under the water which contained diazinon. The sheep exited at the other end, ran off into the paddock and dried out, and their wool was impregnated with this chemical. Thus, when the flies landed on them, the chemical killed them. They did not get the chance to lay their eggs and to impregnate the live animal with maggots. That process is one of the only alternatives. From time to time. I pick up agricultural magazines and see a sale of aged ewes or wethers advertised in some part of my electorate. Although they are getting to the end of their productive life, they have been on the property for some years. Probably once a year they have been dunked in a diazinon mix, and they are still around. I am not sure about the differences between the metabolisms of a sheep and a human being in respect of diazinon, but humans are not in the habit of showering themselves with this product. The other approach, which is more commonly used today, is to put the sheep into a facility that has sprays, both up and down. Instead of dunking them and putting them through the rather frightening process of swimming down this channel, you spray them. There are warnings on the bottle that this may have some deleterious effect on people's health and that they should properly attire themselves for the work. That some of them do not bother is a matter of admission, but the responsibility of the manufacturer is to warn them of this fact. Diazinon has been used for decades. In my electorate, I am not aware of any significant human sickness, death or disability arising from its use, and my observation is that the sheep seem to handle it with no effect. However, all of a sudden-after years-somebody who was obviously a bit short of something to do has conducted some sort of survey on the effects of this chemical on humanity. I would not be surprised if there was one chance in 100 or one chance in 1,000 of some health effect from this chemical. I hold a similar view on crosswalks. Crosswalks are there to give confidence to pedestrians that they can cross without getting run over by motor cars. Occasionallyunfortunately-they do, but we do not have public servants getting up the next day and saying, ‘It's time we removed all crosswalks because occasionally people get killed on them.' There has to be a balance with these things. The motor car is the classic example. We try to make motor cars safer. We try to encourage people to have a better attitude to their driving practices and to make themselves and other people safe, but we do not ban motor cars. This group of faceless men, on the advice of somebody, has all of a sudden decided diazinon, a product of great usefulness and assistance and with an increasing demand because of other circumstances, should be banned. The parliamentary secretary has listened to us wisely and cooperatively in our AFFA backbench committee, and we thank her for her interest. She, personally, has excellent farming background and I think she would like to assist us but, as the act provides and as it is to be amended, nobody asks her. Nobody has asked her senior minister. We chortle about the fact that in the second reading speech the minister said, ‘This body is totally independent from us. We get elected; they don't.' I am pleased to say that the AFFA backbench committee asked the minister again today-we have previously asked the parliamentary secretary and, as I said, we thank her for her interest-that something be added to this bill, probably in the Senate, to leave residual control with the minister of the day. I would ask the opposition member present to think seriously about that matter. I do not think we should abdicate our responsibility as members of parliament in these circumstances. Surely there should at least be a provision whereby the minister can call for a cost-benefit analysis. I do not know what is safe in this world. People pay large amounts of money for water in a bottle to make sure that they do not get any-thalidomide, is it?-of the stuff we put in it to save children's teeth. Ms Ley-Fluoride!",79
74,Mr TUCKEY,AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY,"That's right, fluoride. Thalidomide is one we do not use anymore; I think that stopped babies from having limbs. Excuse me for that. People make a judgement to buy that water because they do not like scheme water, but we do not ban scheme water because it might affect somebody's health-we think it is a product that, on a cost-benefit analysis, has adequate health that preventative measures. I repeat my point: there is not much in the world today that does not put at risk somebody's health, but that has to be tested against the benefits a product brings to an industry-for example, to the very farmers who use this chemical, which represents a low-cost alternative in an addressing the problems of lice and blowfly strike in sheep. In the time left available, I also want to make a point about another chemical, a herbicide called 2,4-D ester. It has been around for as long as I can remember as a knockdown herbicide, and, because of the longevity of the product, it is very low cost. It is typically used by farmers out of season. By this I mean that if there are unseasonable rains-and we can certainly do with a few more of them-and various weeds, melons and other things come into the paddock, which will disadvantage the seeding of the crop at a later date, they go in with 2,4-D ester and use it as a knockdown. It kills them. That is a very cheap means of addressing this problem. I also point out that the bulk of its use in my electorate of O'Connor is in broadacre farming and out of season. So, typically, when it is used-in contrast to a wide variety of other herbicides-there ain't a crop growing in the next paddock. But where that circumstance arises farmers are very conscious of their own and their neighbours' crops and they have adequate facilities in place-drift control and things over their sprays-which have ensured that only on very isolated occasions has this particular herbicide interfered with someone else's productive cash-flow crop. It has been pointed out that it can have a bad effect on grapes and other horticultural products. In the context of Western Australia the horticulture representatives of the various horticulturist bodies-vegetable growers et cetera-have said, ‘We've had no trouble with other persons' use of 2,4-D ester; we think they should be entitled to continue to use it.' But this faceless group, whom we are going to further empower, has come to the decision that there is a risk of this particular chemical interfering with other people's crops. I might add that, if you allow that to happen, the affected party has a habit of rushing off and seeking compensation, either from your insurer, your contractor's insurer or from yourself-and, if necessary, through the courts. But I can see that as no reason to ban-or control, as I think they have done in the case of 2,4-D ester-people from using it. I have seen no case that this chemical has been a serious problem. There may have been cases where it was a minor problem. There may be cases, in areas of high density horticulture-wine production and so onwhere the local authority could ban it, but for this centralised body to be banning this particular chemical beggars belief. I have objected to both bans. This will be an ongoing issue that is aggravated, I believe, by this change of administrative arrangements for the APVMA. I plead with the government to take steps to bring a component of reality back into this process. The minister, when he gets representations from his colleagues who have had representations from their own electorates-and in this case, as I have just mentioned, the representations have been significant-should determine that we should have a right, over and above the determination of this committee, to have a second look. Maybe we should look at the cost-benefits study relative to this thing. If you can find one person who has died of diazinon poison, other than from drinking it, what is that as compared to the huge benefits for the industry and the fact that most users do so without personal harm? I think those are two great examples of the weakness of these so-called independent committees. They need an oversight. If I had spare time. I might have put similar arguments about wheat marketing. I have missed out on the opportunity. No doubt the House is pleased to know that, but the fact of life is that my comments in this regard are well meant. (Time expired)",81
75,Ms LEY,AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY,"Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (1.49 pm)-in reply-I appreciate the contribution made to the debate on this bill by the member for Capricornia and, most recently, by my colleague the member for O'Connor. Picking up on the member for O'Connor's last remarks, I certainly do accept that his comments are extremely well meant. However, as I sum up this bill I will address some of the problems associated with the requests that he has made. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Amendment Bill 2007 amends the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 to implement the results of the Review of the Corporate Governance of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders-commonly known in this place as the Uhrig review-by altering the governance arrangements for the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, the APVMA, from a board structure to an executive management structure. The member for O'Connor is concerned that those governance changes will aggravate a problem he perceives in the decision making in terms of the regulation of agricultural chemicals, which will particularly affect the farming community. I would like to assure him that the changes that are being made as a result of the Uhrig review will certainly not transfer power to ‘faceless bureaucrats'-I think those were his words-or those who do not realise the impact of their decisions, and the changes will not in any way take involvement away from those who have an understanding and appreciation of the issues involved in making those decisions. These are purely governance arrangements. A board will be replaced with an advisory committee. The advisory committee will report to the chief executive officer of the APVMA and that chief executive officer will be charged with the decision making. I note again that this is in response to the Uhrig review, and it is important that we are as good as we can be in the governance arrangements of our statutory authorities. As I said, the APVMA is an Australian government statutory authority. It plays an important role in administering a joint Commonwealth, state and territory regulatory regime, assuring the safety and effectiveness of agricultural and veterinary chemical products throughout Australia. The APVMA is an independent body corporate. It implements the legislative powers and functions provided to it under the legislation on behalf of all jurisdictions, including powers and functions conferred on it by state and territory legislation. It is interesting to note that the independence of the APVMA, which I heard the member for O'Connor criticising in some respects, is implicit in the way that the national registration scheme was set up in 1991, by all of the states and territories who have the constitutional power over these matters vesting that power in the scheme. From 1992 the APVMA has managed the national registration scheme. The reason it needs to be independent relates particularly to the environment in which agriculture operates in this country and the need for us to take a science based approach to decision making when it comes to the efficacy, effectiveness and impact on human health of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. So there is an international framework which must consider science, the environment, human health, most importantly, and trade. It is critical that we are seen by our trading partners as having that science based approach. Were the entire decision-making process to be in the hands of the federal minister-and, as I have alluded to, I do not think it is constitutionally possible-I think we would fall down on some of those international obligations and, quite frankly, it would be a very hard ask given the level of knowledge and expertise and the need for independence in such decision making. Nevertheless, I am aware of the member for O'Connor's requests and passionate support of the farming constituents in his electorate. I have a similar passionate support for the farming constituents in my own electorate. We understand each other on that as well. I certainly note his mention of diazinon and the decision made by the APVMA to restrict its availability and that, until replacement chemicals become available, yes, it will be harder for some sectors of the wool industry to manage. We appreciate that, but that unfortunately cannot be a reason for not restricting a use where there are good, science based reasons to do so. I do note that there are safe uses of diazinon still allowed and available. Cage dipping is one, and I understand that backline treatment is still possible. Plunge and shower dipping have of course been removed at this point in time. My department, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, assessed the APVMA against the Uhrig review template. The assessment recommended a number of changes to bring the authority into line with the Uhrig review recommendations. The assessment concluded that the APVMA should retain its independence but be reconstituted, with the current board of directors being replaced by an executive manager, a CEO, supported by an advisory board, as I have said, with a similar range of skills and experiences to those currently specified for the APVMA board of directors. This is really a straightforward governance matter. That is the subject that we are dealing with in this bill. The bill also includes a provision that the assets and liabilities of the APVMA are to become assets and liabilities of the Commonwealth. The amendments only affect the governance arrangements for the APVMA and do not impact on the authority's functions or the administration of the National Registration Scheme for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. I thank the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",82
76,Ms LEY,AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY,"Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (1.56 pm)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA IMPLEMENTATION (TREASURY PORTFOLIO AGENCIES) BILL 2007 Consideration of Senate Message Consideration resumed from 10 May. Senate's amendment(1) Schedule 1, item 24, page 10 (lines 20 to 32), omit subsection 601AE(1A), substitute: (1A) If the Commonwealth continues to act as trustee in respect of the property, subject to its obligations as trustee, the Commonwealth: (a) in the case of money-must credit the amount of the money to a Special Account (within the meaning of section 5 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997); or (b) otherwise: (i) may sell or dispose of the property as it thinks fit; and (ii) if the Commonwealth does somust credit the amount of the proceeds to a Special Account (within the meaning of section 5 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997). Note: ASIC may, for and on behalf of the Commonwealth, perform all the duties and exercise all the powers of the Commonwealth as trustee in relation to property held on trust by the Commonwealth (see subsection 8(6) the ASIC Act).  Secretary to the Treasurer) (1.56 pm)-I move: That the amendment be agreed to. The proposed amendment to the Governance Review Implementation (Treasury Portfolio Agencies) Bill 2007 is technical and minor in nature. The amendment clarifies the Commonwealth's obligations under the Corporations Act in relation to managing property that a company held on trust immediately prior to its deregistration. Under the current law, all property that a company held on trust immediately before deregistration vests in ASIC. ASIC may either continue to act as trustee or apply to the court for the appointment of a new trustee. Under the bill, ASIC will be subject to the FMA Act and as such will no longer be able to hold property on trust in its own name. Rather, this obligation will be transferred to the Commonwealth. ASIC will still have the authority to perform all of the duties and exercise all the powers of the Commonwealth as trustee in relation to any real or personal property or money held on trust by the Commonwealth. On one interpretation of the original bill, the Commonwealth would be subject to a new non-discretionary operational obligation-that is, to sell or dispose of all property that a company held on trust immediately prior to its deregistration in a manner the Commonwealth thinks fit and subject to its obligations as trustee. ASIC would act on the Commonwealth's behalf as the trustee but would face undue inflexibility and cost in complying with the new obligation to always divest itself of the subject property. Amending the bill so that the Commonwealth will have discretion as to whether to sell the trust property or not is more consistent with preserving the current operating arrangements of than requiring the Commonwealth to sell the property. It was always envisaged that moving ASIC to the FMA Act would not affect the nature of the obligations owed by the trustee. Consequently, it is proposed to amend the bill to ensure the current framework continues as intended. This will preserve the current level of flexibility in ASIC's management of trust property, for which, of course, it acts on behalf of the Commonwealth. As a result, I commend the amendment to the House. Question agreed to. NA AMENDMENT (CONTENT SERVICES) BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 May, on motion by Ms Ley: That this bill be now read a second time.",84
77,Mr ALBANESE,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Grayndler) (1.59 pm)I rise to speak on the Communications Legislation Amendment (Content Services) Bill 2007. The bill seeks to amend the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to provide for the regulation of content services delivered over convergent devices, such as broadband services to mobile handsets and new types of content provided over the internet. The bill also seeks to amend the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 to ensure that Australia's Indian Ocean territories can be included in regular, independent reviews of telecommunications services in regional, rural and remote Australia. I welcome the opportunity to speak about legislation in this area and wish to stress the importance of getting the balance right. It is believed that there are some 14 million mobile phones in Australia. That is a reminder of how fast technology can move in Australia. Just 20 years ago, this was unknown. Now it is commonplace that even very young people have access to mobile phone technology, and increasingly all sectors of the community have access. We need to make sure we have equitable access and a proper legislative framework for the expansion of telecommunications technology. Today, hand-held mobiles and all sorts of portable devices have the capacity to deliver various types of information, including live audiovisual content, streamed information and interactive chat services. The portability of such devices means that Australians have access to the world at their fingertipsinstantly and at every hour of the day and the night-allowing them to respond quickly and to be more competitive than ever before. However, left unchecked, such devices can also expose vulnerable Australians-in particular children-to information that may well be harmful to them. Concerns have been raised about the effect of exposing young people to pornographic, hateful or violent material. Such information could be dangerous and misleading. Last night on television I saw a report about the transfer of what can only be described as extraordinarily hateful material associated with the disturbances at Cronulla. When considering communications devices, we need to be not only very conscious of the positive benefits but also vigilant in making sure that there are no negative consequences in the availability in mass form of this technology. It is critical that any legislation that is considered in the House of Representatives-and any consequent regulationstrikes a balance between adequate protections for consumers and fair access rights to providers. Without this balance we will either harm our young or legislate censorship that limits the rights and liberties of providers-and indeed of all Australians. It is for this reason that the bill before us must be given due consideration. Members would be aware that on the day this bill was made available it was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts for examination. The committee is not expected to report back before 12 June 2007. Broadly speaking, this bill fits in with Labor's policy to protect children from online pornography and access to inappropriate materials. As such, federal Labor will support the passage of this bill, subject to the outcome of the Senate inquiry. I note that internationally, content services are regulated according to one of two broad principles: self-regulation or co-regulation. This bill outlines a framework for coregulation of divergent devices, thereby allowing industry, government and consumers to come together to develop rules and regulations. I also note that there may be differing views as to whether selfor co-regulation be applied to the Australian context. It is imperative that such different perspectives be adequately considered and that we get the outcomes right. For this reason, it is imperative that the Senate inquiry be allowed to run its course and take evidence from all concerned and affected parties. I am pleased to note that the concerns previously expressed by industry after the government released its exposure draft bill in February 2007 have been taken into account and incorporated into the redrafted bill we are debating today. I congratulate the government on that. Their concerns went to some key issues. Firstly, they included the potential for the bill to have a censorship effect and thereby limit viewing of content that would otherwise be available in its standard form, and, secondly, inconsistencies with state laws. This again highlights the service importance of extensive consultation. I look forward to the outcome of the Senate inquiry. I expect the bill presented to Senate will strike an appropriate balance between protection and the retention of liberties for all Australians. If that is the case, Labor will certainly lend its support to this legislation.",85
78,Mr CADMAN,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Mitchell) (2.06 pm)This matter has been of interest to a number of government members for a substantial time. That interest has been raised by a series of events, particularly in the area of film literature. As indicated by the member for Grayndler, as the development of new technologies has progressed there has been an increasing concern to examine the impact of internet gaming and other broadcast factors that allow people to participate, sometimes unwillingly, in programs they would not choose to involve themselves in or in which children get caught up in processes which can lead to the satisfaction of paedophiles or to violence. The Communications Legislation Amendment (Content Services) Bill 2007 has been introduced by the government to deal with a range of media-rich services, including broadcasting, internet and telephone connections. I think the whole community realises that, with the introduction of the 3G environment, through our telephones we can get practically anything from anywhere in the world. Of course, the push of advertising and of people who want to push people into programs where there is a payment process is understood. At the same time, for those who are under age and for those who are susceptible to the blandishments of such programs, there is good reason why we should take care in this area. The Attorney-General has scope to deal with material that is violent, damaging to individuals or sexually explicit under the film and television framework and in the print media as well. However, the Minister the for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the broadcast and internet environment have not been brought under a consistent approach. One of the highlights of pointing out to members of the government the need for a consistent approach to both the communications and the film and literature areas is the Channel 10 program Big Brother-in particular, Big Brother Uncut, in which there were a couple of segand ments which were obnoxious and frowned upon and really disliked by any sensible person. In a letter to my colleague the member for Makin, Channel 10 admitted: TEN is aware that the public is concerned about how housemates are treated. We accept ACMA's decision that episodes of Big Brother Uncut 2005 contained sexually demeaning references to women, and that this was a significant factor in ACMA's breach finding. We are determined not to repeat this mistake in 2006. In July 2005, TEN commissioned two experts in the treatment of women and sexual harassment to independently review last year's Big Brother production processes. Their report, ‘Gender, Sex and Ethics in the Big Brother House', found that while existing production safeguards were generally good, there was room for improvement. I say hear, hear to that. I think there is a lot of room for improvement in that program. I find it obnoxious in many areas. The people on it behave towards each other in a bad manner. I think Channel 10 themselves admitted that something like 76,000 children watch that program-even though it is quite late at night. The letter continued: The report made a number of constructive recommendations for improving awareness of gender and sexual harassment issues amongst both housemates and production crew. TEN and ESS have implemented each of these recommendations, including improved guidelines for monitoring the house to identify potentially risky situations and intervene as necessary; providing housemates and production crew with more extensive education on sexual and gender harasswhich ment; and amending the Housemate rules to cifically ban sexual or gender harassment. That is one area that came to the attention the House, and there was a lot of discussion here. I know that the Prime Minister stated that Channel 10 ought to take a good look at themselves and amend their program-and that eventually happened. But we realised at that point that there were no real guidelines for television programs except a code of conduct which was agreed among peopleand ACMA found that the code of conduct was breached. This legislation brings into a more sive framework and makes more consistent the guidelines applying to film and television and literature, which are administered by the Office of Film and Literature Classification, under the Attorney-General, and those areas that are administrated by the minister for communications. This legislation gives effect to the government's commitment to extend the current safeguards that apply by putting in place new measures to protect consumers from inappropriate or harmful material on convergent devices such as 3G mobile phones and through subscription internet portals-where people have access to the whole wide world and anybody can bombard a home with any material whatsoever. We should look not only at the harassment and violence aspects and the encouragement to do violence but also at the dangerous terrorism factors and the construction of bombs, harmful instruments and weapons. Something every Australian should be fearful of that somebody, out of a sense of adventurism, could gain access to material about weapons, bomb making and harmful practices. Reports that have been made available to the parliament claim that some of the mass shootings in the United States were in fact generated by programs that the young men had been watching for protracted periods focus on nothing but an obsession spewith the killing of other human beings. They put this into practice by going into their of schools and taking it out on their schoolmates, their teachers and the community. So there has to be a line drawn somewhere. Generally I would say that this parliament considers that adults should be free to make up their own minds, but where that freedom impacts on others who are not capable of making sensible decisions then I think we need to consider where the line is drawnand do that very carefully. I have before me some statements about cohe- the Big Brother show and also about how that program was dealt with. It is really interesting that, in June 2006, Channel 10 finally admitted that 76,000 children could be watching the adults only version of Big Brother during the week. I do not think that is the sort of program I want my kids to watch. If it were on at 7.30 pm I would be tearing the place down, but it should not be on at any time when that many children may be watching. Libertarians and others fail to recognise that most kids watch television unsupervised. I think the figures show that 78 per cent of kids watch television unsupervised. Parents think a program is safe, they put the television on and they let their kid watch it. Even more than that, children frequently have television sets in their own rooms, so parents do not know what is being watched. This bill is a move towards regulating exactly what is going over the airwaves on the internet, telephone and other similar is electronic means of communication, because it can become absolutely open-ended with no control, no balance and no sense of what is reasonable for young people to watch. The measures relating to the content of Big Brother lead me to look at the fact that we have telephones that are capable of taking photographs and transmitting them. According to a recent survey: One in four people used their mobile phones to dial up a news, weather or other information report in the past year but research also suggests that content services will need to be subsidised by advertising to be cheap enough for mass appeal. So there is a large pool of people wanting to use their mobile phones for information. The legislation currently before the House was reported on in the Sydney Morning Herald on Friday, 11 May as the federal government introducing laws ‘to make it harder for children to access “adult” content on the internet and via mobile phones'. What this legislation is really introducing is a law that says that companies providing content that is classified as restricted 18+ and MA 15+ will need to verify the age of their customers. Xrated content is banned over those servicesand so it should be. The move follows the Big Brother incident-there is no doubt about that-and the live footage of that show that was broadcast. The Herald refers to that. There was a report late last year in the Herald Sun about violent video games being on the rise. It said: Violent video games are hitting Australian shelves in record numbers ... The Office of Film and Literature Classification review board has slapped MA 15+ tags on 69 computer games so far this year, compared with just 20 last year. In the article, Dr Joe Tucci said that the rise in violent video games is harmful to youth. He also said: We are living in a world where young people are increasingly exposed to violence, whether that be real or virtual violence ... We know it is having impact on children's behavioural problems, the rates of depression and aggression. We know that these violent MA 15+ games are getting into the hands of younger children through older siblings and friends, and they are being introduced to concepts well beyond their developmental capacity. The article went on to say: Australian Family Association spokeswoman Angela Conway warned parents to keep children away from violent games. “There is enough anecdotal evidence available linking violence among young people to the violence they are faced with in these games,” she said. That is true. Those games can be played on a PlayStation, a personal computer or over the internet. There are a great number of people using the internet to play games which could be violent and damaging to young people. A former judge warned the government earlier this week that we need to be careful about these laws in regard to bullying. He said that bullying can occur in the cyberworld just as much as it can occur face to face. Mr Alastair Nicholson, a former Chief Justice of the Family Court, said in his address to the National Coalition Against Bullying: The law has not really caught up with problems that have come about as a result of the huge expansion in the use of SMS (text messaging), email and digital photographs ... It's not going to go away and they're certainly going to have problems in the Children's Court with it. His comments came ahead of a two-day ‘Cyberian' internet and technology safety symposium at the Camberwell Grammar School. This legislation, according to Mr Nicholson, who is a very well-known judge, is not adequate with regard to cyberbullying. This legislation is a big step ahead. Yet, on the other hand, there are reports of people an saying that they are mature enough to handle anything and that they do not care what comes over the internet. One commentator, Ross Fitzgerald, said in the Australian on Monday, 24 April that he is pleased that some of George Bush's attempts to restrict access to material have been overturned in court. Even though to some this legislation appears not to go as far as they would like it to, on Thursday, 17 May the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts said: The Internet can make a positive contribution to the way our children learn, develop and are supported ... However, left in limbo without a proper legislative framework, technology and educational support, the Internet (and other emerging technologies) pose a genuine risk to society's most vulnerable citizens; our children and young people. That certainly is the case, because chatrooms, the web content of some sites, the social networking that takes place and the way in which people can enter into discussions and distract participants into a one-toone relationship which is absolutely unhealthy are only recently coming to the attention of the government. The minister went on to say: ... SMS and MMS communications, instant messenger and emails and now, peer-to-peer networks, have all challenged the ways we go about protecting our children. So this legislation protecting our children is not just a matter of setting something down and then forgetting about it; it has got to be multifaceted and ongoing in making continual changes. The minister in her speech said: Macabre websites are targeting vulnerable young people and encouraging them to commit suicide (and providing detailed information of how to do it)-often live online, pro-anorexia sites are ting up online support networks for sick girls to join ‘starvation clubs'would you believeand paedophiles are proving adept at exploiting new and emerging technology, now including Skype, to prey on children. The technology is moving ahead at an amazing pace and the government has moved to warn parents by providing free, downloadable software that parents can apply to their home computers to help assist their families make better decisions. This legislation does ban certain types of products over the internet and through telephone services. This legislation sets very definite limits on R18+ and MA15+ material which must be met by the provider and a process of verification must be entered into. If the Australian Communications and Media Authority-ACMA-is advised that there have been transgressions, the fines are extremely onerous and substantial. This is good legislation introduced by a government which is concerned for our relationships with our children and their mental and physical safety. There are guidelines for online content. There is an online child protection squad provided by the Australian Federal Police. This new online child protection squad within the AFP goes right to the centre of websites and broadcasting over the internet to establish precisely what is going on. There is an online child sex exploitation team. There have been child pornography arrests, with even a US offender being been brought to book through the activities of the AFP. There are tough Criminal Code provisions in this act and an extension of the Criminal Code to bullying. The rapid advances in technology are being dealt with by a government that is aware of the need to protect the health of our young set- people and aware of the way in which the convergence of communications can make it so easy for people to stray into areas where they can become lost and perhaps lose their lives. The minister's explanation of this legislation is particularly useful, but at the end of the day it is everybody's responsibility. It is the responsibility of teachers, it is the responsibility of parents and it is the responsibility of government as well to provide a framework where children in particular can be protected. There are substantial laws to uphold the decisions that are going through the parliament today. I am pleased to hear that the Australian Labor Party's outlook is similar to our own and that they will not be opposing this legislation. I, too, look forward to the report of the Senate committee which will examine this matter and I trust that they will adopt high standards for the use of the internet, SMS and other types of communications.

79,Mr HUNT,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (2.26 pm)-In rising to address the Communications Legislation Amendment (Content Services) Bill 2007 I wish to thank those speakers on both sides of the House who have lent their broad support to the contents, provisions and intent of this bill. This bill very simply is about protecting children and the most vulnerable in our society. I wish to look firstly at the question of and secondly at the question of action which flows from wonderful opportunities in relation to the newest means of electronic broadcast and communication. The opportunities are absolutely clear: we have a revolution in telecommunications. What that means is that individuals for the first time in history have a capacity to access and to be engaged in the process of telecommunications from their own homes in a way which is broadcast and not just passed to another individual. That brings with it extraordinary opportunity, but it also brings with it a risk. The risk is very simple. It is the risk of abuse of the content. That means in practice that it could be a narrowcasting to particularly vulnerable groups in our society. It could be the broadcasting of material whether it is in relation to pornography, child offences or other such items, which are unacceptable. Our response to that risk in relation to the use of the internet, the use of broad-scale telecommunications and the use of 3G mobile communications for improper purposes is very simple. The Communications Legislation Amendment (Content Services) Bill sets up a regime which achieves one simple action. It puts together a common approach to standards for broadcast, internet, film and literature, and 3G telecommunications. In so doing it sets out a framework which, hopefully, will protect our children and the most vulnerable in our society and lead to a regime which is safe and desirable. The bill sets down a series of actions to achieve these outcomes. It strengthens the regulation of stored content delivered over new devices; and it places greater obligations on the content service providers to make sure, in particular, that they protect and recognise young children who might otherwise have access to material which is dangerous, risk improper or in some way might compromise them. So it provides an extra protection for parents. Ultimately, it is the result of consultation with industry, and the industry has been extremely supportive. In addition to that, it backs up our content regulatory scheme-the Mobile Premium Services Industry Scheme. It has the support of members on both sides of the House and the support of the industry. I am delighted to commend the Communications Legislation Amendment (Content Services) Bill 2007 to the House.",91
80,The SPEAKER,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Order! It being 2.30 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with the resolution agreed to previously. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA",91
81,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, I inform the House that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be absent from question time today and tomorrow. He is travelling to the United States on official business. The Minister for Trade will answer questions on his behalf as the acting foreign affairs minister. I also form the House that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs will be late for question time. is attending a wreath-laying at the National War Memorial by the Greek Prime Minister. The Minister for Defence will answer questions on his behalf. NA Future Fund",91
82,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer confirm evidence in Senate estimates by Future Fund CEO Paul Costello today that the Future Fund made no independent inquiries regarding the involvement of Northern Trust in the collapse of the Enron employees' superannuation scheme before appointing it as its global custodian? Can he confirm that Enron employees lost their superannuation because it was invested in Enron companies and that Northern Trust ultimately paid $US37.5 million to Enron employees to settle litigation against it alleging imprudent management of the superannuation fund? What regulations has the government put in place to ensure that all companies retained by the Future Fund to handle the fund's investment transactions will do so prudently?,92
83,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I cannot confirm any of those matters because the Future Fund is an independent statutory corporation which makes these decisions itself and is not subject to government direction. The government was neither consulted nor could it intervene in relation to any of those matters. And can I, on the way through, make this point: the Labor Party will either respect the independence of the Future Fund or it will not and, if the Labor Party wants to reserve unto itself the right to interfere with the Future Fund, we will let the people of Australia know about it. We will let the people of Australia know that the Labor Party has designs on something which was set up for the future inof this country and not for the cheap political opportunism of this Australian Labor Party. I He have every reason to believe that the Future Fund acted with propriety, and if the Labor Party thinks that it has not then the Labor Party should come out and say that the contract should be annulled. As I understand it, the other bidder-and I am only going on what I have read in the paper-was the National Australia Bank. One could say that the National Australia Bank has been the subject of its own inquiries, has it not? Were there not currency traders at the National Australia Bank who have been the subject of charges? Mr MCMullan-Are you saying that that is analogous?",92
84,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Saying it is analogous? What, that somebody has been convicted of a crime whilst working for the National Australia Bank? No, I would not say that that was analogous at all, but I will say this for the National Australia Bank: it dealt with those matters, as it should have. I have seen in relation to the National Australia Bank that it has been the subject of various inquiries and, after those inquiries, it has fixed itself up. Does it have an unblemished record? No, the National Australia Bank does not have an unblemished record. It would be very, very dangerous to say that no financial institution which has ever been the subject of litigation could be trusted in relation to the financial affairs of individuals or companies or government, because I do not think you would find a financial institution anywhere in the world that has not been the subject of litigation-certainly the National Australia Bank would not be in that category. As far as the government is concerned, the Future Fund conducted an open and honest tender. It has made its decision accordingly. The government does not believe that it should intervene, and if the Labor Party does, let it come to the dispatch box and say so. Economy",92
85,Mr FAWCETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, how does a strong, flexible economy help sustain the prosperity that underpins the well-being of families such as those in Wakefield? What risks are there to this prosperity?",93
86,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wakefield for that question. The member for Wakefield has been an articulate proponent of the interests of families in his electorate since he came to this place some 2½ years ago. In reply to that question, the very essence of a strong economy leading to a prosperous society is the flexibility of that econsetting omy. If we look at the Australian economy today, if we look at the fact that real wages are 20 per cent higher than they were 11 years ago, if we look at the fact that we now have the lowest level of industrial dispute since 1913, the year before World War I broke out, if we observe the historically low levels of interest rates in recent years, observe the fact that Australia has a 32-year low in unemployment, we will see these are the great human dividends of economic reforms that have been carried out-especially over the last 10 years. I can say unequivocally to the member for Wakefield that the reforms of the last 10 years that have made the Australian economy more flexible have indeed underpinned the current prosperity of the Australian economy. One of those reforms, of course, was the reform of our industrial relations system. Those reforms have seen, over the last year or more, an additional 270,000 jobs. They have seen, as I said a moment ago, industrial disputes fall to their lowest level since 1918. They have seen continued rises in real wages and, importantly, the reforms of the past year plus earlier industrial relations reforms, including those of 1996 and the courageous reforms of the Australian waterfront in 1998, have produced a situation in which this country can now enjoy the benefits of a resources boom without the old centralised wage fixing system flowing through the economy with disastrous consequences for those firms that are not in a position to afford the wage levels paid in areas like the mining industry. It is instructive to read what the Governor of the Reserve Bank had to say in February this year. He said: We are not getting today what we might once have gotten had we had a shock like this-the late 1970s resource boom or earlier occasions. On those occasions, the strong sectors would get a big pay rise and, through the centralised wage system, that would flow through to everybody else, through the Arbitration Commission. That does not happen any more. Famously, that led to my predecessor as Prime Minister saying that George Campbell had 100,000 dead men hanging around his neck. George Campbell unfortunately has become the 101st dead man because he has if we been replaced by Doug Cameron. He in fact is the only trade union official who is leaving the parliament on the Labor side. It makes interesting reading. We had confirmation yesterday that 100 per cent of Labor members of parliament are union members. This is despite the fact that only 15 per cent of the private sector workforce are members of a union. Almost 70 per cent of the ALP front-bench are former union officials, three out of every four Labor senators are former union officials, the unions have already donated over $50 million to the Australian Labor Party since 1996, and more union bosses are set to enter the federal parliament at the next election through safe Labor seats or Senate spots. Let me give you some of the names. We have Greg Combet, and he is taking the seat of Charlton. He is the secretary of the ACTU. Bill Shorten is taking the seat of Maribyrnong and he is the National Secretary of the AWU. Doug Cameron is taking George Campbell's Senate seat and he is the National Secretary of the AMWU. The member for Lilley can stand as much as he likes, but nothing can alter the fact that reminding the Australian public",93
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lilley should be aware of standing order 62.,94
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"of the way in which the union bosses are taking over the parliamentary Labor Party in this place. We have Don Farrell-you have not heard of him, but he is coming. He is the National President of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association and he is coming into a Senate spot in South Australia. We have Richard Marles, the Assistant Secretary of the ACTU, who is coming in in Corio-and doesn't Gavan know that he is coming in in Corio-and we have Kevin Harkins. He is the Assistant Secretary of the Electrical Trades Union and he is coming in in Franklin. Additionally, there are an army of other union bosses running in coalition held marginal seats. Note that the trade union bosses elite all have very safe seats. They look after their own, don't they? You do not have Greg Combet running in a marginal seat. You do not have Richard Marles running in a marginal seat. They knock off sitting members and the elite, the creme de la creme, of the ACTU bosses are coming into this place via very safe seats. Of course, they are joining the member for Batman, the member for Hotham, the member for Throsby and other office holders of the ACTU who already sit here. It is no wonder that one of the central commitments of the Leader of the Opposition is to overturn the historic reforms to Australia's industrial relations system. What he will do if he becomes Prime Minister is roll back for the first time a major economic reform. It will be the first time in a generation that a major economic reform is being rolled back. But it is hardly surprising, beI am cause in the 11 years that the Labor Party have been in opposition they have behaved as irresponsibly as they intend to behave if they become the government of this country after the next election. They opposed getting the budget back into surplus, they opposed paying off $96 billion of government debt, they opposed taxation reform, they opposed waterfront reform and they opposed the second round of industrial relations reform; yet they would have the Australian public believe that their economic credentials are the same as the coalition's. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to be taken seriously as a fiscal conservative, he has to explain to the Australian people why, since he entered the parliament in 1998-and I remind him that the very first significant vote he cast after entering the parliament in 1998 was against taxation reform, on 10 December 1998-he and his colleagues have consistently voted against all of the reforms that have given us the economic prosperity we now enjoy.",94

91,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon the Hon. Brian Howe, former Deputy Prime Minister and now a member of the board of the Australia and New Zealand School of Government. On behalf of all members. I extend to him a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Future Fund",94
92,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Treasurer. I refer to his previous statement that he had no capacity to influence the Future Fund's decision to appoint Northern Trust as its global custodian, notwithstanding its involvement in the Enron scandal. Isn't it the case that section 18 of the Future Fund Act empowers the Treasurer and finance minister to issue investment mandate directions to the Future Fund regarding how the fund manages its investments, and that such directions have actually been issued? What requirements are contained in these directions obliging the fund to ensure that all contractors employed by the fund to handle its investment transactions will act prudently?",95
93,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the act, because the appointment of a contractor to act as todian is not a part of the investment mandate-nor, under an investment mandate, could you stipulate who was to get a contract in relation to custodian services. It is very interesting, isn't it, that the member for bourne asked this question. His implication seems to be that the government should intervene in relation to who is appointed as the custodian for the Future Fund. The member for Lilley is good at getting to his feet, but when he gets to his feet he generally does not face this way; he generally faces the other way. But members of the parliament might be very interested to know what the member for Lilley had to say on the subject. He was asked this question yesterday: ‘Would Labor consider putting a caveat over the Future Fund legislation to ensure'-and I think this is what you are suggesting should be done‘that in the future it is managed locally?' Mr Swan replied: It's very important that the Future Fund doesn't become an object of pork barrel by this Governmentthe reason it should not become an object of pork barrel by this government is that it is an object of pork barrel by the Labor Party, but we will move on from thatvery, very important. So Labor has argued consistently that the Future Fund ought to be independent. Now if it takes those decisions independently it's entirely a matter for them. Oh! Mr Tanner- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The Treasurer is refusing to answer the question.",95
94,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne will resume his seat. The Treasurer was asked a question on the Future Fund. He is answering that question. I call the Treasurer.,95
95,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am asked this quescus- tion: why don't I exercise a non-existent power under section 18 to direct who the Future Fund appoints as its custodian? I point out that neither is this an investment mandate nor does the government have a Melcapacity to intervene in the Future Fund. I produce in this parliament as exhibit A the member for Lilley. Exhibit A, the member for Lilley, said: ... Labor has argued consistently that the Future Fund ought to be independent. Now if it takes those decisions independently it's entirely a matter for them. ‘Entirely a matter for them'! That is what Labor were saying yesterday-‘entirely a matter for the Future Fund'. But today the member for Melbourne would have you believe that the government ought to intervene and it ought to direct who the Future Fund appoints as its custodian. Too clever by half. Get your story straight. If the Labor Party believe that the government should intervene and direct the Future Fund on who it appoints as its custodian, or its banker, or chief executive, for that matter, let them stand here at the dispatch box-let them say it. But don't go around the business community saying that you believe in an independent Future Fund and then sneak up here to the dispatch box trying to lead to an impression that you have a contrary view. This is the modern Labor Party all over: they will walk both sides of the street but they will never have the courage of their convictions. You can have it one way, you can have it the other way, but you cannot have it both ways. Economy",95
96,Mr CIOBO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also addressed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer inform the House how reform of the Australian tax system has affected Australia's economic performance? Is the Treasurer aware of any opposition to these reforms?,96
97,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Over the last decade Commonwealth tax to GDP has fallen from 22.8 per cent to 20.7 per cent. In that time the government has cut income tax in 2003, in 2004Mr Crean interjecting",96

99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hotham is warned!,96
100,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"there goes the soundeffects man again; he is wearing a pink tie today, too, whereas the member for Lilley has a red tie-in 2005, in 2006 and in 2007. And there will be a second instalment in 2008. Let me remind the House-and I think this is instructive-that on 1 July 2000 the proportion of taxpayers who had a marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less was 30 per cent. Today the proportion of taxpayers who have a marginal tax rate of 30 or less is 80 its per cent. Let me say that again: in 2000 the proportion of taxpayers who had a tax rate of 30 per cent or less was 30 per cent; today it is 80 per cent. People will remember the Labor Party's income tax scales, which had you paying the top marginal tax rate on your first dollar over $50,000. Tax reform commenced in 2000 with the cutting of income tax and the introduction of GST to replace wholesale sales tax, financial institutions duty, bank account debits tax, stamp duty on marketable securities, stamp duty on shares, bed taxes and a host of other taxes, some of which unfortunately the Labor states have still not abolished. I do not think there would be anybody today in Australia who would argue that the GST should be repealed and wholesale sales tax should be reintroduced. It would be like saying: get rid of the modern motorcar and let's go back to the horsedrawn cab. I do not think anybody would say that. But the trick of politics is not to be able to see what was right in hindsight; the trick of politics is to be able to see what is right prospectively. That is why it is worth going back and looking at what people said in 1999, when the government made this historic reform. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said, and I am going to read it to the House because it reflects on his ability-his foresight-in relation to economic policy. This is what he said in this place in 1999 when he was opposing the historic tax reform to abolish wholesale sales tax and replace it with GST and to cut income tax: When the history of this parliament, this nation and this century is written, 30 June 1999 will be recorded as a day of fundamental injustice-an injustice which is real, an injustice which is not simply conjured up by the fleeting rhetoric of politicians. It will be recorded as the day when the social compact that has governed this nation for the last 100 years was torn up. That is what he said in his opposition to GST: When the history of this parliament, this nation and this century is written, 30 June 1999 will be recorded as a day of fundamental injustice ... I will chance my arm on this. In the history books that are written and that will go into Australian schools over the next generation, I think 1901 will be there: Federation. I think 1788 might be there. I think 1939 to 1945 might be there, and I think the 1914-1918 war might be there. I think the September 11 attacks might be there, but I will warrantand I am taking a big punt-that in the chronology of Australia's history 30 June 1999 will not be there as the day of fundamental injustice. Can't you just see it? 25 April, ANZAC Day; 30 September, grand final day; 11 November, the sacking of the Whitlam government",96
101,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Treasurer might consider bringing his answer to a conclusion.,97
102,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"30 June 1999, ‘Injustice Day'! ‘Injustice Day', the day that the government reformed taxation! It is all very easy to sit back here in 2007 and say ‘I am an economic conservative'. It is very easy to say that now, but when the hard work was being done reforming this economy in 1999, he was not just off the pace; he was off the planet. He was off the planet with this kind of rhetoric. The important thing in relation to economic policy is this: it is not what you see with hindsight but what you see in the future. Future Fund",97
103,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Treasurer, and it also concerns injustice. Can the Treasurer confirm that Northern Trust, the Future Fund's global custodian, managed the Enron staff superannuation fund? Can he confirm that Enron employees lost their superannuation because it was invested in Enron companies and that Northern Trust ultimately paid $US37.5 million to Enron employees to settle litigation against it alleging imprudent management of the superannuation fund?",97
104,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I cannot confirm any of those matters, because the government does not manage the contracts. Nor does it manage the tenders, and nor does it do due diligence in relation to contracts of the Future Fund. Mr Tanner-Do you mean you don't know?",97
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne has asked his question.,97
106,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Future Fund is an independent statutory corporation which is managed by a board of guardians, and the government can no more intervene in its contracts than it could intervene in other statutory corporations. The guardians of the Future Fund have conducted a tender process; they believe that they have appointed the best value for money and the best service in relation to that. I understand what the member for Melbourne is doing: the member for Melbourne is trying to impugn the reputation of the guardians of the Future Fund. Well, good luck to him! But if his point is that any bank or financial institution which has been subject to litigation is unsuitable to conduct business then there will not be a bank in the world that could conduct business. Certainly all of the Australian banks, and the National Australia Bank is one example, have been subject to litigation. It has had employees that have been subject to prosecution, but it has never lost its licence. As far as I am aware the National Trust Bank has never lost its licence; it has never been prohibited from conducting business. While it has a valid licence in relation to financial banking procedures then obviously it is satisfying the regulatory requirements. While the board of guardians are managing the Future Fund and doing it in a transparent way they are obviously discharging the law. If the Australian Labor Party says that the government should intervene, let it come to the dispatch box and say so. Let the Australian Labor Party come to the dispatch box, after saying yesterday that it would not interfere in relation to the Future Fund. Let it come to the dispatch box and say it would. If it is not prepared to do that, we can only conclude that this is petty politics which does not have any substantive policy behind it. State Governments",97
107,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Is the government working in partnership with regional communities to solve local problems in my electorate of Hinkler? Opposition members-No!,98
108,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Wait for it.,98
109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hinkler has the call.,98

111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Hinkler has the call. The member for Hinkler will be heard.,98
112,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is the salient point: what role have the state governments played in this process?,98
113,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hinkler for his question-and for the assistance given by members opposite! I recognise the great job the member for Hinkler does in his area, particularly with the regional shire and councils that he supports. What is the government doing to support local communities? We are strengthening the Australian economy and therefore strengthening local economies and local communities in a number of different ways. Obviously, the overall economic reform program that we have implemented across Australia has benefited not only major urban and metropolitan areas but also regional communities across Australia. Unemployment is at a 32-year low, not just in the cities but in many of the regions across Australia, which have benefited from historic low levels of unemployment. Historic low levels of industrial disputation across Australia benefit many businesses in regional Australia. Running budget surpluses and keeping downward pressure on interest rates assists people living in regional and rural communities. Yesterday, I mentioned a number of specific programs that we run-Roads to Recovery, National Road Safety Black Spot Program-which help local government authorities in regional communities. Importantly, since 2003 we have been running the Regional Partnerships program, which has significantly strengthened the social and economic fabric of our communities in regional Australia. Since that time, 2003, the government has assisted local governments and local communities-like those in the member for Hinkler's area-to fund more than 1,266 projects. More important is the value of those projects and the contribution that has come out of those local communities. Our contribution to those 1,266 projects has been $278 million, which has leveraged $972 million in cash and in-kind contributions from local communities and local authorities. We welcome that. We congratulate those communities. It is something we should celebrate in Australia-local communities helping themselves improve the circumstances of the people who live in those areas. In many parts, this is being led by local government, the form of government closest to the people of Australia. Local government work with their constituents and communities every day of the week. We have made those investments with local government through Regional Partnerships. Roughly every $50,000 of taxpayers' money that has been invested in those projects has generated on average three jobs. The 32-year low level of unemployment which we are enjoying in Australia is contributing significantly to the reform process that we have introduced in so many different ways and regional Australia is able to invest in much needed projects which generate employment opportunities. We are standing with our regional communities and with the local authorities that represent their interests. The member for Hinkler asked, ‘What are state governments doing?' We know what the Queensland government is doing. It is trying to rip the heart out of regional Queensland with their forced amalgamation process. They are doing it in a very shameless and arrogant way. Mr Beattie continues to say, ‘This is in the interests of all Queenslanders.' The Leader of the Opposition has appealed to him, saying that he does not think this is a good idea, but Premier Beattie is not listening to the Leader of the Opposition. He claims to be listening to foreign billionaires. Yesterday, I mentioned that he claimed the support of Richard Branson of Virgin Airlines. He quoted from a letter that Richard Branson had sent him in the Queensland parliament. When you get hold of the letter and read a little bit more, you see that it says exback actly the opposite. Richard Branson actually opposes the forced amalgamation of local government in Queensland. In Richard Branson's letter to the ‘Dear Premier', he says: I am totally opposed to Noosa Shire being amalgamated with any neighbouring shires. But Mr Beattie is claiming-erroneously-to the parliament in Queensland and to all Queenslanders that he has the support of Mr Branson. Mr Beattie is ignoring all the regional communities in Queensland that are opposed to this happening and he is ignoring the Leader of the Opposition. It just shows you the lengths the Labor Party will go tothey say one thing and do another. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has been out there trying to convince the Premier of Queensland that this is a bad idea. We also know that, when the Leader of the Opposition was chief of staff to former Labor Premier Goss, a few things happened in regional Queensland under his hand. He cut 600 jobs out of the department of primary industries, shut down four regional DPI offices, shut down 46 country court houses, closed 13 regional railway lines, shut down country schools and cut 403 teaching positions. The people of Australia should know not to listen to what the Leader of the Opposition has to say to Premier Beattie. He supports what Premier Beattie is doing because Premier Beattie is finishing off the job that the Leader of the Opposition started when he was working for the Goss Labor government in Queensland.

114,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister recall making the following statement to parliament in 1992 expressing his long standing views on industrial relations. He said: ... we believe that such matters as penalty rates, the length of the working week, overtime, holiday loadings and all of those things that are holding the needed flexibility in Australia's industrial relations system ought to be matters for negotiation between employers and employees. We do not shy away from that. We do not walk away from it for a moment. Does the Prime Minister stand by this statement? Does it not reflect his consistent tude to penalty rates and overtime throughout his political career?",99
115,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I certainly would have made a statement to that effect then, yes-I would have. That is not in any way inconsistent with the argument we are now putting that, if those things are traded away, there should be fair compensation in return. Ms Gillard-You didn't believe that then.",100

117,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is warned!,100
118,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is of course a difference between me and the Leader of the Opposition. The things which I say I now stand for have been matched by the attitudes I have taken both in government and in opposition. The Leader of the Opposition's problem in the great debate about economic credibility is the words of the old saying, ‘Don't listen to what I say; have a look at what I do.' In the time that he has been in parliament, this person who aspires to be Prime Minister of this country has voted with his colleagues in the Labor Party against every major economic reform that this government has put up. I have a division list here. Within weeks of the member for Griffith being sworn in after the 1998 election-indeed, on 10 December 1998-I find the name ‘ Mr Rudd' amongst the 67 noes who voted against the new taxation system. Here is the division list. There is a mountain of division lists that will be produced in this place that will attest to not the economic conservatism but, rather, the economic-wrecking instincts of the Leader of the Opposition. He voted against taxation reform, he voted against industrial atti- relations reform, he voted with his colleagues to stop the budget being put into surplusMr Kerr interjecting",100
119,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Denison is warned!,100
120,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"he voted against the sale of Telstra, which helped to fund the elimination of our $96 billion national debt left by courtesy of his colleagues. His front-bench colleague says, ‘Oh, we believe in a $5 billion higher education fund.' The only problem is that, if the Leader of the Opposition had his way, there would be no surplus out of which that $5 billion fund could be established. The truth is that every single opportunity the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues have had in this place over the last 11 years to put to rights the wrongs that they left us in 1996 has been passed up. Now he is asking the Australian people to forget about the last 11 years-‘Don't look at the fact that I oppose tax reform, I oppose paying off our debt, I oppose getting the budget back into surplus, I oppose industrial relations reform, I oppose the sale of Telstra. Don't look at any of that; forget all about that. Airbrush that out of my record and out of Australian political history. Just believe me: I am reformed and I believe in responsible economic management.' I say to the Leader of the Opposition through you, Mr Speaker, that, in the great debate about economic credibility, the Australian people will be reminded with increasing frequency, with increasing scrutiny and in an increasingly meticulous way of the failure of the Leader of the Opposition in all the years he has been in this place since 1998 to demonstrate that he has the credentials to call himself economically responsible. Indigenous Affairs",100
121,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the 1967 referendum, will the minister update the House on government initiatives to help improve the well-being of Australian Aborigines?",101
122,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Solomon for his question and his genuine interest in Australia's Indigenous population. Ms Burke-We all have a genuine interest.,101
123,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member opposite is correct: we all have a genuine interest in Australia's Indigenous population. I believe that 40 years ago the aspiration of the Australian people that was reflected in the overgovernment whelming yes vote was to see more opportunities and a better future for Australia's digenous population. There have been many positives. Today we have an Australian Indigenous surgeon. I am sure that 40 years ago many people would have thought that was unachievable. Since 1986 there has been a reduction in the unemployment rate for our Indigenous population from 35 per cent to 16 per cent. In 1972 to 1974, the appalling reality was that the infant mortality rate in Queensland and the Northern Territory for our Indigenous population was 78 out of every 1,000 births. Between 2003 and 2005 it was 11 in Queensland and 16 in the Northern Territory-still far too high of course, but a far cry from where it was. Between 1973 and 2002, the prenatal mortality rate decreased by 55 per cent in Queensland, the Northern Territory and South Australia. The causal mortality rates decreased by 16 per cent on all causal mortality between 1991 and 2003. The school retention rate through to year 12 has gone from 30 per cent to 40 per cent. All of these things are positive, but I am sure that no-one in this House and no Australian believes that the aspirations of the Australian population in 1967 have been realised. We could stand here on the eve of the 40th anniversary and perhaps decree that we would somehow set an artificial target about increasing Indigenous life expectancy or further reducing mortality rates. Those things would be admirable, but would they be achievable and would we just be setting up a false horizon unless we actually deliver the things that are necessary? We all recall the promise that no child would be living in poverty by 1990-well meant but empty rhetoric. There is no point in empty rhetoric when it comes to the Indigenous population of this country. They have had too much empty rhetoric for far too long. The Howard did not set a target of five per cent for unemployment. We had that as an Inaspiration and we have achieved it and exceeded it. We set about achieving things and realising real goals. I was disappointed only last week to see what can happen when you set goals. The Queensland government signed a local Indigenous partnership agreement-an agreement between the people of Mornington Island and the Queensland government. In it they had an aspiration of having 75 per cent of children attending school. That meant that they felt that 25 per cent do not count-that is what it is saying to that community. The reality is that we should have an aspiration of 100 per cent of students attending school. We have to have that as an aspiration and then we have to deliver what it takes to make that happen. The Howard government delivered $1.6 billion in the last budget to give a real go for real housing improvements in remote Australia-$1.6 billion to reduce overcrowding, to improve health circumstances and social living conditions and to give people the parameters they need. These are very practical measures. The reality is that many of the things we have been talking about are now starting to come to fruition. Noel Pearson delivered a speech to his own community up in Hope Vale recently, which I had the great privilege to hear. I suggest to every member of parliament that they read it; it is one of the great speeches of our time. To confront your own people and say that you will no longer tolerate child neglect, that you will no longer accept alcohol abuse, drug abuse or gambling abuse, and to say that your own people, your own family, are a sad reflection upon the people who came before them-those were the sentiments that he expressed-shows enormous leadership. But the people of Hope Vale have now taken up the cudgels, and what they are demanding is a massive change in welfare reform, housing reform and land reform. The sad reality is that a former minister for Indigenous affairs, Robert Tickner, slammed the Queensland government back in June 1991, when he said: The legislation in Queensland as it stands will not help Aborigines when it talks about land ure. Sixteen years later, those same people are saying to me, ‘Please give us land tenure change so that we can have the right to own our own homes, so that we can aspire.' That is what the Howard government is trying to deliver. We have just signed a landmark agreement in the Northern Territory with Chief Minister Clare Martin, worth over $150 million, to deliver some of these things. I congratulate the Western Australian government, whose minister for Indigenous affairs is wanting to deliver a better future and is agreeing with the Commonwealth government's programs. I come back to aspirations. Unfortunately, in the last two months in Kalumburu in the East Kimberleys, in a community of about 450 people-about 190 adults-some 11 men have been charged with child sex offences, including the mayor or chairman, the deputy chair and other people of great authority-11 out of 190-odd adults. I ask all of us in this place: what chance have those children got of ever having an education when they are subjected to that sort of behaviour in a community? There was no police station in that community; there is today. As a result of our summit on sexual violence, we have now dedicated the money for a police station in Kalumburu. We have three more police stations going into remote Western Australia. But what should happen is not what happened in Mutitjulu when the Commonwealth government spent $1.9 million and the Northern Territory government did not man the police station. What a hoax and a fraud upon the people of Mutitjulu, and the children and the women who have to put up with those conditions. The Tiwi Islands people have now signed a historic agreement to go to 99-year leases. ten- They will have a new future for their people. The people of Galiwinku want to do the same. The people of Wadeye now have embraced change. This is because the Howard government will sit, listen and work with Indigenous Australians. We will not set artificial targets but we will deliver for Indigenous Australians, and we will reach the aspirations that we all so desperately looked for in 1967. Workplace Relations",101
124,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that this Australian workplace agreement, drawn up by the Hotels, Motels and Accommodation Association, takes away penalty rates, overtime, public holiday pay and rest breaks for people who are paid the minimum wage of $13.47 an hour? Given the Prime Minister's own Work Choices laws have allowed agreements like this, and the Prime Minister has defended agreements like this in the past, why should any Australian trust his government to deliver basic fairness in the workplace?",102
125,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will understand that without looking at the agreement she holds aloft, I am not going to confirm or deny anything that might be in it. From here, even the sharpest eyesight would not be able to read everything in that document, and she knows that. She invites me to say something about penalty rates, overtime and loadings for shiftwork or weekends. It is true that I have argued in the past-and I do not deny itthat these should be matters of negotiation. I have never denied that. I have argued that in the past. But can I also tell you about somebody else who has argued it in the past. Let me read something to you. Mr Adams-A 16-year-old",103
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Lyons!,103
127,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I quote: I've negotiated numerous agreements where we'd negotiate, say, an all-up payment, an all-up rate in lieu of, you know, penalty rates for ing shiftwork or weekends. In other words, ‘We've negotiated them away in return for something that's fair.' That was said by none other than Greg Combet, the current Secretary of the ACTU. I know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has a brief on this, and I know that she did a deal with the unions that completely excluded the interests of many of the wealth creators of this country. As a result, we now have the Labor Party committed to a return of union domination of the industrial relations system. As Heather Ridout of the Australian Industry Group said, the debate about AWAs, important though it may be, has obscured the fact that the real poison in Labor's industrial relations policy is the return of the dominance of collective bargaining. And what Labor will bring back is a situation where, wanted or not, a union having award coverage over a particular workplace will be able to inject itself into a negotiation at that workplace, to the detriment of the interests of the workers and the employer. I am proud of the industrial relations reforms that this government has made. I am proud of the Reith reforms.

129,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"on the Australian waterfront was broken in 1998, and I make no apology for breaking the power of those unions that were destroying the international competitiveness of this economy. We moved from an hourly crane rate of 17 to crane rates of 27, and Labor would reverse that. What is really at stake in this industrial relations debate is the determination of Labor to go back in time. What is at stake here is the refusal of the current Leader of the Opworkposition to show the courage that Tony Blair showed to the British trade union movement when he became the leader of the British Labour Party. He said: ‘You cannot go back. The changes of the Thatcher government are here to stay because they are good for Great Britain.' Let me say this: the changes we have made ought to stay because they are good for Australia's future. I say to those who sit opposite: if you want to deliver a mortal blow to the Australian economy then you should persist with your policy of turning back industrial relations reform and, if you are elected as the government of this country and you turn back those industrial relations reforms, history in the future will record that you have done an enormous disservice to the working men and women of this country. Workplace Relations",103
130,Mrs MARKUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Would the minister inform the House how a flexible workplace relations system is contributing to more and better jobs for working women? Are there any threats to this contribution?,104
131,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Greenway for that question. I note that in 1996 the unemployment rate in Greenway was 8.8 per cent; today it is 4.2 per cent. It was 8.8 per cent unemployment in Greenway at a time when the Labor Party were running the industrial relations system hand in glove with the trade union bosses-the same trade union bosses and the same industrial relations system that the Labor Party want to take us back to should they be elected to government. Under the reforms made by the Howard government in the last 14 months alone, 326,000 new jobs have been created, 45 per cent of those jobs going to women and 85 per cent of those jobs being full time. The female participation rate in Australia is near an all-time high of 57.7 per cent compared with the 53.7 per cent when we came to government in 1996, and the wages gap between men and women has narrowed under the Howard government. In 1996 women were earning 87 per cent of male earnings and today it is 89.4 per cent, despite the fact that there has been a significant increase in the number of women going into the lower paid industries such as retail and hospitality compared with male dominated industries such as mining and construction, where there are higher wages. In addition, the government has provided over $28 billion in familyfriendly initiatives, such as the baby bonus, the family tax benefit and the childcare tax rebate, which help to provide flexibility and give women options when they want to return to the workforce. That has not come about by accident. It has come about because of the economic reform undertaken by this government-and opposed all the way by the Labor Party. The Labor Party opposed us on the first wave of industrial relations reform in 1996, which created Australian workplace agreements. If you believe the Labor Party, AWAs have been around for only 15 months, yet they have been around since 1996. In a modern workplace, people want the flexibility provided by Australian workplace agreements. The old industrial relations system set up under Labor-managed by the Labor Party for the union bosses-was so inflexible that it drove a lot of women to become casual workers, and it drove a lot of men to become independent contractors because the mainstream industrial relations system could not accommodate the needs and aspirations of those people. So we changed the system. We put in place a flexible mainstream system that brought people who wanted flexibility into the mainstream industrial relations system, and that delivered flexibility. So when you go to Port Macquarie and meet women who have been employed for 13 years as casuals and who for the first time get a contract that they can go and borrow money against because the AWA is flexible enough to give them the mainstream contract, you say, ‘Isn't that good news for families? Isn't that good news for women?' That is the flexibility in the mainstream system that gives women the opportunity to get a job. It helps them to shape, in negotiation with employers, family-flexible hours. Do you know what else? It is delivering higher wages, fewer strikes and more jobs. That is what our system does. That is what economic reform does. Opposed all the way by the Labor Party, our workplace reforms have delivered the flexibility that is empowering women in the workforce in a way that we have never seen before in Australia's history.

The other guarantee I give is that if the Labor Party wins the next election and repeals our industrial relations laws employment will rise significantly. Exports",105
138,Mr SECKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister advise the House how a betterrun waterfront is helping Australia's export performance? Is the minister aware of any threats to our $210 billion-a-year export industry?,105
139,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. Representing an export electorate, he would be deeply conscious of the importance of good trade to our national economy. As he mentioned, our exports reached $210 billion in 2006. That is more than double the level of exports from Australia when we came to office. Australia's 42,000 exporters, supported by this government, have done a fantastic job in taking Australian manufacturing, mining and agricultural products to the world. But there is no doubt at all that their capacity to boost our exports has been significantly boosted by the reform to our waterfronts. The fact that this government was prepared to take on our ports, which were so often gridlocked, and actually get them working has made a real difference to Australia's export capability. As the Prime Minister said a little while ago, when we came to office our five major ports managed a pathetic 16 or 17 container movements an hour. Labor and the unions told us that that was as good as it can possibly be, that it could not get any better than that. We set about reforming the waterfront and now we regularly achieve 27 crane movements an hour, and we are well and truly up with world's best performance. That has made a real difference. This government has been prepared to take on the necessary reform and deliver results to achieve real benefits for our economy. Labor of course opun- posed all of those reforms. They were out there protesting, setting up pickets and getting actors and performers to demonstrate that this was the end of civilisation, that it was a threat to workers' rights. One of the people who was most active in organising these pickets was in fact Robert Coombs, the former branch secretary of the MUA in Sydney. Mr Coombs has moved on and is now part of the latest class of union hacks to be ushered into the New South Wales parliament. At the beginning of this month, he made his inaugural speech to parliament. He chose as his topic the extraordinary change that has come over the waterfront in Australia-this is from the man who organised the pickets against waterfront reform. In his maiden speech, he said: Australian ports are recognised as amongst the most productive and efficient in the worldThe member for Swansea further said: Our stevedoring industry is delivering crane rates and other productivities equal or better than world's best practice, and this is testament innovation of management and the maturity of its workforce. So the man who organised the pickets and resisted all of the reform is trying to take credit for the improvements that have occurred in the workforce as a result of this government's determination to reform it. Unfortunately not everybody in the maritime workers union is similarly convinced. In fact, after the ALP national conference, the MUA put out a press release in which they claimed to have secured the support of the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party to go back to the old ways, to commit to cabotage and ensure that Australian jobs in shipping and offshore industry are preserved. Mr Martin Ferguson interjecting",105
140,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Batman is nodding his head. He was very quick to go to the press to say, ‘The MUA has got it wrong.' The old union boss was telling the new union bosses that that is not the way it is. I thought that the best thing to do to find out about this was to go to the ALP website and look for a report on the ALP conference. When I looked at the website, I found that it said: The Platform as adopted at 44th ALP National Conference (April 27-29-2007) will be posted shortly. I do not know whether the honourable member for Batman or the MUA has got it right as to the policy and what the Leader of the Opposition agreed to in relation to waterfront reform. But I am suspicious that the deal with the MUA will be another return to the old ways. The Leader of the Opposition is fond of saying that the resources boom will come to an end. Well, it will come to an end if Labor are elected and they return the oldstyle union dominated policies to our waterfront. If we cannot get exports across the ports, yes, the boom will end and so will the to the boom for our economy, and it will be as a result of mismanagement, not as a result of world events and the performance of Australian exporters. Advertising Campaigns",106
141,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm whether or not the government is planning to mail to all eight million households in Australia a taxpayer funded, fullcolour brochure on climate change with a personal covering letter from the Prime Minister? How much money is this new advertising campaign going to cost Australian taxpayers? How is this expenditure consistent with the principles of prudent economic management?",106
142,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No such decision has been made by me or, to my knowledge, by the government. But I do reserve the right to engage in a public information campaign in relation to these matters. I do reserve that right. I know the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues have been talking a lot about government advertising. I think it is legitimate to inform the Australian public of changes to the law. I defend the IR campaign. It is not a political campaign. I defend the superannuation campaign. And I defend the campaign in relation to private health insurance. All of those campaigns are in relates tion to changes to the law and I think the Australian public are entitled to know what those changes are. Diabetes",106

Diabetes is a very serious and growing problem in this country, as it is in most developed countries.

148,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Type 2 diabetes is a very serious issue. It is lifestyle related. I am pleased to say that the government has introduced in the budget a new program to tackle it. The government has been steadily improving its support for people with diabetes. We put insulin pump consumables on the National Diabetes Services Scheme a couple of years ago. We put Lantus and Levemir on the PBS late last year. In the recent budget we announced a new prevention program involving a test administered by GPs, a diaberisk assessment consultation and the potential for referral to a subsidised lifestyle modification program. This will not make diabetes go away, but it is certainly another step in the government's campaign against it. It is estimated to cost $103 million over the forward estimates period. I simply make the point: the government can only afford to invest this additional money in the health of all Australians because we have a good economy. If you wreck the economy, you wreck health policy as well. What you cannot do is trust members opposite to have the money to continue to support a good policy in this country. Advertising Campaigns",107
149,Mr RUDD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question again is to the Prime Minister and it refers to his previous answer when he said that no decision had been made on a taxpayer funded letter to Australian households on climate change. Can the Prime Minister confirm that a first assistant secretary of the Department of the Environment and Water Resources told Senate estimates yesterday that a draft of the Prime Minister's climate change households letter had, in fact, already been produced for market testing and, further, that a mock-up of the brochure had been produced for market testing as well?",107
150,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is in no way inconsistent with the answer I have given. While we are in righteous indignation about government advertising, may I draw the attention of all members of the House to page 7 of the Australian newspaper today. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It was a very clear question. It went to whether what the Prime Minister said did not exist is, in fact, being market tested, funded for by Australian taxpayers.",107

155,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me inform the House that, under the heading ‘Clean coal for the future', a full-page ad has been taken out by the Queensland government. Given the announcement that was made by the Leader of the Opposition three days ago about the policy of a future Labor government, I look forward to his public denunciation of this advertisement of what the Queensland Premier has done. This cannot by any semblance of the imagination be justified as anything other than a blatant political advertisement. All the Queensland government are doing is announcing the expenditure of money. They are not explaining a new law. They are not telling the citizens of Queensland what their obligations are under this new law. It reads: In an historic agreement the Queensland Government and the coal industry have announced a massive investment to ensure the future of our State's vital coal industry, and the jobs it creates. That is just pure political propaganda. Yet we have a deafening silence from the man who sits opposite. I look forward to the Leader of the Opposition attacking the Queensland Premier for wasting the money of the taxpayers of Queensland. This is a blatant example of the double standards of the Australian Labor Party on this issue. Agriculture",108
156,Mr BAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister advise the House of recent developments in Australian agriculture following the government's budget. Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?",108
157,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Braddon for his question and acknowledge his championing of all things agriculture. I have visited his electorate. I know how highly regarded he is by primary producers. He is an indefatigable champion on their part. The recent budget provided $2.4 billion in new funding for Australian agriculture. This funding built on the government's strong record of policies and programs that help our farmers and rural industries manage the many complex issues they confront on a daily basis. In addition to providing funding for many successful quarantine, natural resource and food industry programs already in place, an additional $50 million was provided for the first ever Environmental Stewardship Program, which will establish contracts of up to 15 years with farmers and other landholders to preserve and restore high-value environmental assets. The member for Braddon asked whether I was aware of alternative policies. As members of the government and indeed the farming community well know, the Labor Party is bereft of ideas, let alone policies different from the government's when it comes to agriculture. You have to dig very deep to even find any reference, passing as it might be, to primary production. But I did find an interesting doorstop transcript on the ALP website. I went looking for it; it does not come out and hit you between the eyes. It was a doorstop interview, dated 15 May 2007, by the shadow minister, whose name I will reveal for the first time in this place and, I suspect, in rural Australia-Senator Kerry O'Brien.

I was quite impressed, I have to confess, not by its content but by its fluency and its conciseness. But there was something else about it that rang a bell with me. It was eerily familiar. By the way, it is dated 15 May and it deals with the budget. It is the budget response given a week later. Leaving that aside, I return to the media statement that the same shadow minister issued on 9 May with regard to the budget. Remarkably, I find that the doorstop is almost identical to the media interview. In the media statement is 329 words, and 300 of them are replicated exactly in the doorstop. I know the experience of a doorstop is a very intimidating one. National correspondents representing the best and brightest of journalism are gathered around you, close up and personal, firing questions from all angles.

177,Mr TANNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Melbourne) (3.50 pm)Back in 2004, the Prime Minister had a stratconegy to win the election, and that was to spend his way out of trouble. We are again in an election year and he has a new strategy: to advertise his way out of trouble. Either way, the taxpayer foots the bill, but at least in 2004 there was a bit of a chance that you would get a road, some childcare money or something like that at the end of the process. The trouble with the strategy that the Prime Minister is now pursuing is that not only is it funded by the taxpayer but, at the end of the process, all you get is the warm inner glow from sitting in front of the television set and hearing how your penalty rates and your overtime are protected by law-or whatever the latest version of alleged fairness in the government's extreme industrial relations agenda is-how private health insurance is providing an umbrella for all Australians to ensure that they get high-quality health care and how John Howard's superannuation changes will allow you to retire on a country estate with your own golf course, maybe a swimming pool and all sorts of other delightful things. At least in 2004 Australian taxpayers got something at the end of the giant spending spree. This time round, all they are getting is a giant advertising spree. It is a clear sign of a government that has lost all sense of an agenda for the future-all sense of trying to solve the nation's problems of high-speed broadband, climate change and investing in the education of young children to ensure that they have better chances in life. All it indicates to Australian taxpayers, to Australian voters, is that the government is obsessed with maintaining office. It is seeking to advertise its way back into office, and it is trying to tell Australian working families that they have never had it so good. Remember the Prime Minister's statement in this parliament only a matter of weeks ago: ‘Australian working families have never been better off.' That is the mentality behind the giant advertising propaganda campaign that is now starting to unfold. ‘You have never been better off; how dare you even contemplate voting us out of office?' and ‘We are going to spend vast amounts of your money to make sure that you truly understand just exactly how well off you are.' The statement ‘Australian working families have never been better off' will be hung around the Prime Minister's neck from now until election day. Senior ministers and the Prime Minister stand in parliament, day to day, boasting about their extraordinary economic management record. The Treasurer, who without doubt is the most bombastic politician in Australian history, stands up and says how wonderful his management has been. I know that ‘the most bombastic politician' is a big statement, but there is no question that he deserves the honour. ‘We've paid off all the debt, inflation's low, unemployment's low, the budget is in surplus, economic nirvana has been delivered.' He does, of course, leave out a few things. When he is in boasting mode-when he is in skiting mode-you do not hear many references to productivity. You do not hear much about foreign debt or the current account deficit. You do not hear much about exports. We have not heard them boasting about the performance of Australian exports in recent times either. They have gone a bit quiet on interest rates, because ours are amongst the highest interest rates in the developed world and, as we and Australian families know, interest rates have been steadily increasing over the last year or two in spite of the government's promise that it would keep interest rates at record lows. Particularly what you do not hear about is the impact of the costs of everyday things on ordinary working Australians-to name a few: rising childcare costs, the price of petrol, rising medical and dental bills. None of these things ever get seriously addressed by the government. This is a government that is seriously out of touch. Its solution to dealing with its political problem is not to tackle the issues that face the nation, not to build a coherent future agenda for Australia, but to try to advertise its way out of trouble. Back in 1995, shortly before the coalition came to government, it made a promise that it would cut government advertising by $20 million per annum. We all recall the famous quotes from the then Leader of the Opposition, now the Prime Minister, who said: In a desperate attempt to find an election life raft, the Prime Minister is beginning an unprecedented propaganda blitz using taxpayers' money. He said: This soiled Government is to spend a massive $14 million of taxpayers' moneyit looks pretty small in the current contextover the next two months as part of its pre-election panic. … … … This grubby tactic will backfire on the Government. Taxpayers will see through it. They don't want their money wasted on glossy advertising designed to make the Prime Minister feel good. And he said: Over the last few days the Labor Party has spent $150,000 of its own money on an advertising stunt which disappeared without a ripple. … … … The problem for this Government is not communication. The problem is that it is tired, it ken too many promises and it has hurt too many people. That was the Prime Minister in 1995. Let us have a look at his record in government. For one year, they stayed pure to their commitment to reducing advertising-their first year in office. And then came the GST and advertising spending-which peaked at $84 million under Labor and typically was in the $60 million to $70 million area-hit $211 million. The following year, which just happened to be an election year, it was $156 million. It started to drop down just a little, to $143 million, in 2003-04 but it was still very hefty. In 2005-06-a non-election year; the last completed year-it was $208 million. Even when you adjust the figures to take into account inflation, that is almost double the highest amount ever spent by Labor. I cannot help but be reminded of one of my favourite characters in George Orwell's famous book Animal Farm. I apologise for the comparison, but I am afraid the Prime Minister reminds me somewhat of Squealer, who was a very important figure in Animal Farm. You might recall that Squealer was the pig who was responsible for propaganda and for explaining, when things were getting tough, why they were actually getting better-for example, on Sunday mornings, Squealer would hold down a long strip of paper with his trotter and read out to them lists of figures that proved that the production of every class of foodstuff had increased by 200 per cent, by 300 per cent or by 500 per cent, as the case might be. Reading out the figures in a shrill, rapid voice, he proved to them in detail that they had more oats, more hay, more turnips than they had had in Jones's day, that they worked shorter hours, that their drinking water was of better quality, that they lived longer than a larger proportion of the younger ones that survived has broinfancy, that they had more straw in their stalls and suffered less from fleas. I apologise for the comparison between the Prime Minister and a pig, but Squealer was a very cunning pig. Does any of this sound familiar: ‘No worker will be worse off'; ‘We'll never, ever have a GST'; ‘Your conditions are protected by law'; and, of course, ‘Australian working families have never been better off'?

179,Mr TANNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I suspect that members of the opposition are trying to offer me other suggestions for the list, but I will have to leave that aside for the time being. What we are seeing with this advertising campaign is, in effect, corruption and arrogance reaching new heights. Now they will not even say how much is going to be spent on these campaigns. They are now not even prepared to indicate what the budgets are going to be. And we heard today that it looks as if every household in Australia is going to get a glossy leaflet in the mail explaining why the government are really concerned about climate change-and a letter from the Prime Minister to boot! So rather than addressing the problem-rather than having a serious strategy for Australia's future-what are they doing? They are concentrating on looking like they are doing something, by advertising the product, not by actually having a decent product. The Prime Minister responded to these claims with one argument: ‘The Labor state governments do it too.' He obviously missed the statement made earlier today by the Leader of the Opposition where he indicated that not only do we intend to impose our commitment with respect to the Auditor General or his delegate vetting all advertising campaigns that are more than $250,000; we intend to act to ensure that state governments fulfil their responsibilities in the same way-that they are subject to the same disciplines. I just want to conclude on this point with one example to illustrate just how outrageous their spending is in this area. In 1993 the Labor government introduced a massive fundamental reform to industrial relations-the introduction of enterprise bargaining and unfair dismissal laws. The total cost to the budget of those reforms was about $11 million. As the person who was heavily involved in prosecuting Labor's case at the time of the waterfront scandal and as the person who spent weeks harrying Peter Reith in this place about his misuse of his Telecard, I am embarrassed to admit that I have to say something good about him in this instance. When he introduced his industrial relations legislation, which, in many respects, was as sweeping as the Work Choices legislation, do you know what it cost the taxpayer? Again, it was only about $11 million or $12 million. It was only that much. Peter Reith, to his great credit, relied on his own advocacy. He was prepared to go into battle on behalf of the people he represented and the ideas he stood for and to fight it out in the public arena. John Howard, the Prime Minister, needs the assistance of $600 million of taxpayers' money to put his point on these issues out in the community. So not only do you lose your penalty rates and your overtime; your taxes are being used to persuade you that it is a good thing. Mr Kerr interjecting",112
180,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Denison will remove himself understanding order 94(a). The member for Denison then left the chamber.,113
181,Mr TANNER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As we heard today, while all of this is happening, the government spends its time attacking Labor's economic credibility and alleging that if Labor-the people who created the superannuation system in this country-get into government your superannuation will not be safe. While all this is happening, as we heard in question time today, the Future Fund, under the auspices of the Treasurer and the finance minister, has appointed as its global custodian a company called Northern Trust, which was the manager of the Enron staff superannuation scheme when Enron went under. That company has been found by the US District Court to have acted imprudently by complying with an Enron decision to freeze that fund for a month and prevent employees from shifting their superannuation investments out of the Enron company shares that they had been in. That company ultimately settled the legal actions against it by Enron employees to the tune of about $37 million. In question time today it was extraordinary that it became clear that the Future Fund, in appointing Northern Trust, knew about its involvement in the Enron scandal but made no independent check as to whether this was a matter of concern before it was appointed. The Treasurer refused to But say whether he knew anything about these matters and said: ‘It's not my job; it's independent. It's at arm's length. I have no role in this case.' Of course, he is wrong. The Future Fund legislation contains a provision empowering him and the finance minister to issue directions to the Future Fund with respect to how it conducts its investment strategy. It allows them, for example, to issue directions about corporate governance issues, about how the Future Fund votes its shares, and they have done so. The question is, why have they not issued any guidelines with respect to ensuring that all parties who are contracted by the Future Fund to handle the money-the $50 billion that is already there-will do so prudently? So, while they are attacking us for allegedly threatening the superannuation of Australians, they are sitting there spending large sums of money advertising their virtues but not doing their basic job. Finally, and most basically or most centrally of all, while all this is going on-while all their energies are going into focus groups about climate change leaflets that are to be sent to every household and new Work Choices as superseding the old Work Choices as-what is the reality being experienced by ordinary working families in this country? The reality is higher interest rates and fear that they will go higher again; increasing rents in many parts of Australia, in areas where people are being squeezed by much higher rents; continual increases in childcare costs, above and beyond inflation; doctors' and dentists' bills going up; and, significantly, because of the Prime Minister's industrial relations legislation, the wages of significant sections of the workforce, like hospitality and retail workers, actually not even keeping pace with inflation. That is the reality for many working Australians out there. Those are the issues that they want their government to display an interest in. We accept that in many cases the solutions to questions like rising petrol prises are not simple, but this government has totally got its eye off the ball. It is just concerned about scraping back into office and about advertising its virtues. So instead of the florid boastthe ing from the Treasurer and instead of the claim by the Prime Minister that working people have never been better off, let us see some action on the things that matter to ordinary working families in this country.",113
182,Mr BROUGH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (4.06 pm)-It is interesting that we should have a matter of public importance brought forward by, of all people, the member for Melbourne about the problems confronting working families, because this nation has a hell of a lot more working families under the Howard government. There have been 2,087,900 new jobs created between March 1996 and April 2007. In 11 years, two million more Australians are working. There are a heck of a lot more working families, I tell the member for Melbourne. The good news is that those families today have a minimum wage that has had real growth of 12.4 per cent. The minimum wage actually went backwards under those who sit opposite, the Labor Party. They paid the lowest wage earners in this country less, and many of them actually articulated that they were proud of it. The number of unemployed in this country today sits at 482,700-too many, but a far cry from the 934,000 at the peak in December 1992. The unemployment rate peaked at 10.9 per cent-double digits. Unfortunately, I think that too many Australians today forget what it was like when your children left school and they did not have a job to go to, they did not have a future, and they were put on an endless roundabout of training and told: ‘That's as good as it gets. You'll get a visit from the social security office whilst you're still at school so that you can go on unemployment benefits.' That was future that families had to confront under a Labor government. We are proud to say that in this country today when young children leave school, no matter which electorate they are in, they have opportunities, with a higher minimum wage and real job opportunities that can go somewhere-not training that leads to more training that leads to more training and does not end in any positive result. Here is an interesting pointer for the member for Melbourne and all those that sit opposite: back in 1996, 45 electorates out of the total of about 147 had an unemployment rate of over 10 per cent-one in 10 productive Australians did not have a job. As with many of the members, I know the member for New England in his regional area would have had huge pockets of unemployment and despair. Country folk were always used to working hard and pitching in, but there was just nothing there. That is what the Labor Party left; that is the reality. Even today, with the drought in those areas, they are in a far position that they were then. Since September 2006, there has not been one federal electorate with an unemployment rate of over 10 per cent. That is a good thing. That is about working families. Let us go directly to what this budget was able to deliver to the Australian people as a result of excellent economic management. You do not give tax cuts year after year if you are running up deficits. You only do it if you have surpluses and you can afford to pay them. In the Treasurer's budget speech a couple of weeks ago he announced that every Australian taxpayer will receive a tax cut on 1 July. Exactly what will they receive? Not $2 or $3 but, as the Treasurer said at the time, around $16 a week on average and $21 a week for people on $30,000. Incentives will be provided for people to re-enter the workforce. People that do not have jobs will have more reason to re-enter the workforce and give themselves a better chance in life. For those in part-time work there is more incentive to take up additional hours. In 1999 taxpayers earning $30,000 paid $6,222 in income tax-$6,222 gone in tax. From July 2007 the same person will pay $2,854. That is a reduction of 54 per cent. To families that means being able to buy new shoes for the children when they go to school, pay the fees when the kids want to go to sporting activities and pay for music lessons-the realities in places like Morayfield and Beaudesert and down in the suburbs of Melbourne. Real people in real circumstances will (a) have a job, (b) pay less tax and (c) get higher wages because of economic management. The member for Melbourne in his speech said, ‘What about child care?' What about it? We have just increased the childcare benefit in this budget by 13.3 per cent, which means that the average family will have $20 less taken out of their pocket when they pay their better childcare fees. Over and above that, the childcare tax rebate means that about 100,000 low-income families that did not have a big enough tax liability to get the benefit of the childcare tax rebate will now get it. It means $300, $400 or $500 which they would not have got to help them with their childcare fees-massive improvements. These families will have up to an extra $30 a week between those two measures. Do you think that makes a difference? Absolutely. All of this is at risk if a Labor government is elected. That is not just rhetoric. Let us look at some of the facts. Who are the team of people that want to lead this country and this $1 trillion economy? What credentials do they have and what do they believe? It is not about what they say but about what they believe in. The member for Melbourne-he wants to be the Treasurer, but of course he cannot get that job-hopes to be the finance minister, who looks after the purses of this nation and makes sure that it is running properly. Let us have a look at what the member for Melbourne believes in, as stated in this very chamber on this side of the House when he was in government back in 1994-not back in the dim, dark ages but just over a decade ago. He said: Unlike some, I take no pride in the fact that Australia is now close to or is actually the lowest taxed country in the OECD. That is an unbelievable statement for someone that wants to lead this country-he is not proud of the fact that this nation has low taxes. The Labor member for Melbourne, who wants to be the finance minister under a Rudd government, went on to say-and this is the scary part for the Australian public: I am quite happy to state that I think the total tax take is too low. You cannot be more obvious and direct than that. He said that while championing-wait for it!-death duties, and also stating that the 60 per cent top marginal tax rate is something that he aspired to, not on an income of $200,000 but on an income of $75,000. Today, a family with two children under the Howard-Costello government will pay no net tax on an income of $50,800. Let me say it again: under the Howard government today, under good economic management, by lowering taxes year after year, the average Australian family on an income of $50,800 with two children will pay no net tax. Compare that with 1996 when the coalition came into government. That same family, for every dollar they earnt over $50,000, gave 47c plus their Medicare fees of 1½ per cent, totalling 48½c. Rounded up, for close enough to every dollar they earnt they gave 50c to the Labor Party when it was in government. So that family would have been paying, every time the bloke did a bit of overtime or every time the woman did a bit of overtime, half of their earnings to the ALP's tax man. Today the same family pays no net tax, and people want to put that in jeopardy by giving it to a bloke who wants to be the finance minister who purports to support, or does support, as quoted in this place when last in government, a return or an increase to 60c in the dollar for people earning over $75,000. There is more about this bloke. You have to listen to what the Labor Party has actually said in the past when it had a chance to force things on the Australian public. I will read this passage from The Latham Diaries, written by the former Leader of the Opposition, for Monday, 18 October because it goes to the heart of the belief system of the bloke that actually wants to run the finances of this country and put the living standards of Australians in jeopardy. Here is the former leader of the Labor Party at just the last election. He says in his diary: Lindsay Tanner came all the way from Melbourne today to see me in my electorate office-a man on a mission. He made a long, rehearsed and slightly bizarre pitch to be Shadow Treasurer, telling me about his wonderful microeconomic reform credentials and links to the economic writers ... I told you that he aspired to be the Treasurer, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Latham says: I sat there thinking: this is the bloke who argued at Shadow Cabinet that we shouldn't proceed with trade practices reform until we cleared it with the Shoppies. For those who do not know, the ‘shoppies' are the unions. Every time the Treasurer and the Prime Minister stand here and tell the public that this mob are totally beholden to the unions, here is the former Labor leaderwho wanted to be the Prime Minister just last time around-confirming that the bloke who wants to be the finance minister could not make a decision on reforms to the Trade Practices Act without talking to the unions. He continues: Now he thinks he's Roger Douglas. Let me go back to what he had to say. He says: Tanner is one of Comb-over's mates‘Comb-over' is the member who represents Canberra here, and I do not want to be derogatory to him for his lack of hair; I am going that way myselfso I gave him some truth serum as well: ‘Listen, Lindsay, the view around Caucus is that you have been a bit lazy, always promising big things but never delivering in the Shadow portfolios you've had. Isn't this just Labor all over-promising big things and being lazy? You cannot be lazy in government and deliver for Australian families two million jobs, lower taxes, higher basic wages and real wage increases-it just cannot be done. But these are not the Treasurer's words and these are not the Prime Minister's words. They are the words of a bloke who knew him really well, the bloke who actually allowed him to be shadow finance minister. He goes on: I would want to see you perform on the front-bench before even thinking about you as Shadow Treasurer. It was good enough to make him shadow finance minister. He goes on: I had in mind his lacklustre effort in developtake ing community building policies. I gave him that gig at the National Conference and said I wanted a big agenda; he delivered something on mentoring and that was it. Cooney said he couldn't get anything else out of him, so we had to scramble to put a few things together for the campaign ... That is so insightful. Here is Labor at its best. It wants to run a $1 trillion campaign and the man that wants to be the finance minister is scrambling to put a few things together. We know that no-one in this nation knows who Lindsay Tanner is-the member for Melbourne-but they need to know who he is and they need to know just what a risk he is to their hip pockets and to their job security, to their income and to the future of their children, because this is the bloke that is too lazy to put policies together, who believes in reintroducing death duties, who believes in a 60 per cent marginal tax rate and who wants to be the finance minister in a Rudd government. This is what we are faced with: a government that delivers, a government that delivers real jobs, a government that has cut taxes and that now has the top marginal tax rate not cutting in at $50,001 but, from 1 July next year, at $180,000-and that is where it should cut in-and a government that has been able to deliver by putting $5 billion into a Future Fund for our kids in universities because we had the money. The money will not be there if you continue to let people flirt with the idea of having Labor in government. Let us not go back to 1994 but go back to the last election. Let us go back to what these people that sit opposite that want to sit on the government benches were going to deliver up to Australian families. They were going to actually make Australian families on $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $35,000, $80,000, $90,000 worth of income worse off. It is unbelievable that a Labor Party would people at both ends of the spectrum and in one fell swoop make them worse off. Of course, not everyone in the Labor Party thought that was a really good idea. On the 20 November 2004, the Financial Review reported: MPs attacked Labor's tax policy for creating low income “losers” and for being too complicated to explain. I do not know how the member for Throsby, a former union boss, can actually be part of a party that would purport to support workers. In their last policy they proposed to cut the income of those that can afford it least. That is what Labor stood for at the last election. The architects of that policy were the member for Lilley, who is now the shadow Treasurer and wants to be Treasurer and, of course, Tanner, the member for Melbourne, who wants to put taxes up to 60 per cent. We wonder why the public should have great doubts about their capacity in government. These are the facts. These are the faces that people do not see. These are the people who will take away your wages, will take away the industrial relations regime that provides the job opportunities, will reduce your real take-home pay and will not be able to deliver for Australia. This is about delivering for Australian families, and the Australian government has done it in spades. (Time expired)",114
183,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The subject of today's matter of public importance debate is: ‘The government's failure to address the problems confronting working families while spending vast amounts of money on its own political survival.' I do not think there is any doubt community's mind that the extravagance of government advertising-at many levels of government, not just the current Commonwealth government-is well out of hand and really does need to be addressed. But today I would like to refer to the problems of farming families-in particular, the government's absolute incompetence at coming to grips with water issues in this nation and the incompetence of the member for Wentworth, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources. If the Prime Minister wants to maintain any credibility in terms of the water debate, particularly within the Murray-Darling system, he has to look very closely at what the member for Wentworth is doing in his ministerial capacity. The people I am talking about, in the Murray-Darling system, particularly those who have received allocations of water-admittedly, under the state systems in the past-are under threat from government policy on water. The incompetence of those who are suggesting they have some control over this debate is coming through very clearly. The member for Longman has just said, ‘Let's not go back to 1994.' I would like to go back to 1995 and 1996, when the national competition policy arrangements were put in place. There were certain things said in relation to water, particularly in 1996, which the Commonwealth took some charge of. One of those things was to establish a national approach to water policy. Certain competition payments were made available through the normal processes; if the states met certain objectives and achievements, money would flow through the national competition payments arrangements. A couple of other things were suggested at the time, including that, as part of the flow of that money, a recognised water market would be put in place and property rights would be recognised as part of that process. The in the money would flow from the Commonwealth to the states if those particular objectives were met. Those objectives have not been met, but the money has flowed. My office has done some work on this. The current arrangement being talked about is a $10 billion plan. There are no details, but there is a plan worth $10 billion. My office has looked at the money that has flowed to the states in the last 11 years. It comes to $8.9 billionpaid through the competition payment arrangements, the National Water Initiative arrangements, the Natural Heritage Trust arrangements, the National Action Plan for Water Quality and Salinity and a whole lot of other intergovernmental agreements, including catchment blueprints et cetera. Not one extra litre of water has been put into the Murray-Darling system. The Prime Minister and the minister, the member for Wentworth, are suggesting that we need a massive investment to solve the problem. You have had the capacity to do it through the national competition arrangements for 10 years, and now you are asking those irrigators and water entitlement holders out there to trust you when you have had the capacity to rein in the states over that time.",118
184,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for New England needs to link his ideas back to families.,119
185,Mr WINDSOR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I think there has been incompetence over 10 years. The Deputy Speaker has asked me to bring this back to working families. There are working families out there who have been neglected by this government for 10 years. Their property rights have not been recognised and a lot of their rights have been removed. The cash that has come from the Commonwealth government has gone through the states, and that has allowed the states to rip these people apart. The Commonwealth is now suggesting that it wants the power to rip the other arm off them. I think that is incompetent, and it does affect the survival of farming families. Anybody who suggests that that is not incompetence at a high level really has to look at the policy mix that has come out of this place. These people in the Murray-Darling system are not pawns. They are people who have worked hard, and they are having their body parts ripped off them by an incompetent minister. He has no understanding of basic water mechanics and soil science, no understanding of the difference between a water aquifer and a watertable, no understanding of the various caps between groundwater and river water systems and no understanding of the interconnectivity between groundwater systems and river water. Yet he is the one who is telling the Australian people that the Commonwealth needs to take control of the Murray-Darling system so that it can put in place something that is good for the nation. I think that is an absolute disgrace. If need proof of that, look at what is happening with the groundwater systems in New South Wales-and you are well aware of this. The Commonwealth and the states came together with $50 million each to create an adjustment package, a compensation package, for people who had their entitlements taken away because the groundwater systems were assessed as being overallocated. They agreed to do that and a compensation package was put in place. What has this government done to those people now? It is effectively ripping them off again. The government did not tell them about the agreement. The intergovernmental agreement is under the Commonwealth solicitor's name. The agreement that was put in place suggests that when these people receive the compensation it will be treated not as a loss of a capital asset but as income in the year of receipt. The Prime Minister's office is on record in the Canberra Times as saying that that is the way that water entitlement holders will be treated in the $10 billion water document. We have the Prime Minister and the minister running around Australia saying, ‘Trust us.' I am with Steve Bracks on this. I think he is the only one displaying any sense. It would be a futile and stupid arrangement for the states to get out of their responsibilities on water allocation and give them to a plan when there is absolutely no detail. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I think you would be fully aware of why the New South Wales Premier wants to get rid of it. He wants to get rid of it not for any particularly good reason but just because he is sick of it. He wants to give it to the Commonwealth government so that it can have all the problems. I think there are a number of issues there that display a great deal of incompetence and that will do a great deal of harm to Australia's working farmers and their families. To spend all this money on advertising, which is you going on at the moment, and then to rip 47 per cent in tax off these people whenever they do receive that income is a despicable act that should be addressed. For two years this has been going on. The Prime Minister has said-and I can pull the quotes out if I need to-that he believes that it should be treated as compensation. A Commonwealth solicitor wrote the agreement between the state and the Commonwealth. He is privy to that. He knows it very well. The Prime Minister and the minister said that there were no documents relating to it that could be obtained. I used the Freedom of Information Act and received a truckload of them for the New South Wales government. There is complicity in this. Most people within the government would be well aware of the circumstances that these people are going through. The groundwater issue needs to be addressed. It spreads across six groundwater systems in New South Wales and it is destroying the morale of those people affected. There is no detail. Freedom of information will not show anything. There is nothing out there; there was no detail at the start. For anybodyincluding the minister or the member for Wentworth-to suggest to these people, ‘Just trust us on this,' is a very strange way to go about your business. I encourage the people in New South Wales in particular, especially water users, to be very distrustful of what is going on now because they have been through a process before where this very government, with its capacity to enforce the property rights rules, did not do a thing. That has been raised a number of times over the years and every time-whether it is John Anderson, John Howard or Johnny-comelately-someone says, ‘We'll fix it up in the next catchment blueprint arrangement.' These people are sick of being told that. They want it fixed now. For the Commonwealth to display any credibility, that particufamily lar issue needs to be addressed. (Time expired)",119
186,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This matter of public importance dealing with the problems confronting working families and the allegation that the government is refusing to confront these issues while spending vast amounts of money on its political survival is an absolute nonsense. If you go to the most important budget paper of the budget-Budget Paper No. 1-you will see that it shows very clearly that, in the 11 years that this government has been in office, it has directly targeted much of its policy work and benefits at families. Indeed, if you take a look in Budget Paper No. 1 at the period from 1996-97 to 2007-08, you will see that what has been paid to families, both by way of direct cash transfers and tax benefits, has increased by something in the vicinity of 39 per cent. What that means for families is that the government has recognised that families come in different categories of need. There are single parent families, dual income families and couple families with a single source of income. The needs of families and the choices that people want to make about their families is something that this government recognises. Accordingly, we have introduced the very significant payments of family tax benefit part A and family tax benefit part B. Those benefits are designed to boost the income of families over the long period during the growth of their children so that families are relieved of a tax burden, which brings about something called the real net tax threshold. I will tell you how that works. Take, for instance, a couple family with two children, one aged three and one aged eight. If that family has dual incomes, with one partner earning 75 per cent of their gross income and the other earning 25 per cent, the real net tax threshold is $55,340. In other words, such a is able to earn $55,340 before they have to pay tax. If you have a family which is a single income couple with children aged three and eight, there will again be a benefit for those families in that they will not have to pay any income tax until they are earning over $50,000. The aim of the policy has been to boost the income of families to enable them to nurture their children and give them the advantages that they require. As I said, the overall increase that we effected in that 11-year period is something in the vicinity of 39 per cent. The other thing we have concentrated on in looking after working families is in ing an enormous amount of money on educating our people. Thirty per cent of school leavers go on to tertiary education. That is a vast change since, say, 40 or 50 years ago, when a very small percentage of people would have been able to go on to, in particular, university education. The big growth has been in the number of women who are participating in that education. They are gaining skills and higher skills, and we will soon have more female than male graduates from university. Those women want to use their skills for their own fulfilment, but the nation also needs them to work to give a return to the people who have helped give them that education. In order to do that, child care becomes an important factor in the equation. For women who have become mothers, either as sole parents or in a couple, to utilise those skills for their own benefit and for of the nation is only possible with good child care. Therefore, child care has become a very important program and policy aspect of this government. We have introduced the childcare benefit and the 30 per cent tax rebate, which is payable for out-of-pocket expenses above and beyond the childcare benefit where the child is in eligible child care-and, whereas that was originally to be gained through filing a tax return, through this recent budget it will be able to be accessed through Centrelink via payments at fortnightly intervals. We have also increased the size of the childcare benefit. For an eligible child using 40 hours a week the payment will go from about $118.40 to $134.80 per week, which is an increase of $16.40. This will benefit 700,000 families-a huge benefit for the working families that the Labor Party is complaining we do not look after. The record is there; the policy is there. There have been increased policy initiatives to make sure that families, both men and spend- women-couples in a family-have good education, that they are able to use it and that there is adequate childcare provision. The fact that there is an increase in that childcare benefit and a change in the operation of the 30 per cent rebate I think is in part a reflection of the good work that we did in our Balancing work and family report to the parliament. For the Labor Party to say that the government has been negligent in addressing those problems is patently wrong. The matter of public importance also claims that the government is ‘spending vast amounts of money on its own political survival'. What a nonsense is that! This is an accusation from a political party that is the same political party that is tied with the trade union movement that is selling off Currawong in my electorate, which should be a national heritage property, for $12 million. It that was offered $15 million by another party, but, oh no, it wants it to go to someone that it feels comfortable with. It is selling it off for $12 million to put that money into an advertising campaign to bag our industrial relations policies. How hypocritical is that? This is John Robertson who heads up the trade union movement in New South Wales. He wants to get a guernsey to come and join his other mates in this parliament. He is going to sacrifice what is a national treasure in Currawong to spend on as to bag a government policy. What hypocrisy is that? This is the same political party that when in office went straight ahead with its deal on Centenary House to put its snout in the trough. Under the lease that it negotiated for its benefit the Auditor-General this year has to pay $8 million in rent. The Labor Party has gouged $58 million out of the taxpayers' purse over the course of the lease. To be tored by such a group that, in telling ple what our policy is, we are somehow not spending money legitimately and transparently I find absolutely appalling. The rent the Auditor-General when this lease ends in 2008 will drop from $8 million a yearLabor Party money-down to $3 million a year. That is the going market rent. The builtdirect in nine per cent escalator clause delivered them the most immoral cash cow this country has ever seen. Not once did any of the Labor Party members over there recant or say that they would give the money back or that they had done the wrong thing. Do not lecture to this government that we do not look after families. Do not lecture to this government that we spend money improperly. You have got a big beam in your eye. (Time expired)",120
187,Ms KING,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It will not have escaped the notice of Australian families as they turn on their TV sets at night that John Howard is in election mode. You can hardly miss it-ad after ad beamed into lounge rooms each night, courtesy of this profligate government, on superannuation, Work Choices and private health insurance. Ad after ad after ad-and this is only the beginning. Harold Mitchell has said that the government is spending so much on advertising that it is having trouble actually finding airtime for them. This weekend, as families go about the juggle of getting the kids to sport, cleandeclined ing the house, getting through the pile of washing, doing the weekly shopping, filling the car with petrol and hopefully getting a few spare minutes to drop in on grandparents, they will have had a week of the government's new Work Choices as. The government PR campaign on Work Choices over the past week has cost $4.1 million alone. That is $24,404 an hour. This comes on top of the $55 million spent on the original Work hec- Choices campaign. Over the coming months, the peothe Howard government will spend some $111.2 million on 18 media campaigns. This is on top of a further $20.5 million campaign for planned again to promote the Howard government's Work Choices legislation, an additional $500,000 print advertising campaign and, as we heard in question time today, a mail campaign on climate change that the Prime Minister is trying to deny exists. It is worth noting that, while the government squanders $4.1 million per week on political advertising, the average weekly earnings for Australian adults are $1,071. In my electorate, where the mean taxable income is almost 15 per cent lower than the Australian average, families would be right to ask, ‘What else could this money have been spent on?' I am sure families struggling to cope with record healthcare costs would appreciate some much needed relief, with the cost of visiting a GP having doubled under this government. I am sure that those families that have had their overtime or penalty rates cut will be asking why the government is telling them they have to make a financial sacrifice for the good of the economy when the government is now the nation's second biggest advertiser, outspending Harvey Norman, Woolworths and Nestle. I am sure families struggling to find the HECS fees for their kids next semester would appreciate increased government funding for university students. Investment in tertiary education has by around seven per cent under the Howard government, while student debt has tripled since 1996 to $13 billion. I am sure the families who have had to face a mortgagee sale-unable to find the mortgage repayments after four back-to-back interest rate rises since the government promised to keep them at record lows-will feel no comfort that the government wants to inform them of the number that they need to call if they are being ripped off by their ployers. Contrary to the Howard government's arrogant claim that ‘Australian working families have never been better off', families are struggling. Far from feeling better off or relaxed and comfortable, families in Australia are increasingly anxious about their financial circumstances. Some 5,000 families recently told the Family Watch Taskforce that financial constraints are denying them the opportunity to make real decisions about the size of their families, home ownership and time out of the workforce after childbirth. Middle Australia is working harder than ever before. Longer hours and second and third jobs are eroding family life. Parents are worried about the impact of health costs on their ability to ensure their children are getting the health and dental care they need. They are also concerned about what the rising cost of education means for their children's future. The pressures on families are real. Household debt is at a record level: the average Australian household now owes $1.58 in debt for every single dollar that they earn in disposable income. Australian household debt is now over $1 trillion. Eight interest rate rises under this government have added around $140,000 to mortgage interest payments on the average median price of homes in capital cities over the life of the loan. Australian households are now spending a record 9.3 per cent of their disposable income simply paying off the interest on their mortgage. And grocery bills have increased by around nine per cent over the past two years. These huge impacts on Australian families come on top of rising petrol prices, which are now pushing well over $1.30 across the nation and are set to rise further. As families this weekend catch their breath after a busy week, we here in this place reflect that in that week the government has spent $585,000 per day on adsem- 4.8 times the average outstanding mortgage, 10.5 times the average yearly adult earnings and enough money to cover out-of-pocket costs for over 8,300 people visiting their GP for an entire year. You have to wonder about the priorities of this government. (Time expired)",122
188,Mrs HULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It is quite hard to sit here and tolerate the hypocrisy that is being delivered in this House this afternoon by the member for Ballarat. Ms King-You didn't! You yelled out the whole time!,123
189,Mrs HULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is absolutely obvious the member for Ballarat did not have a housing loan under the previous Labor government, when we were paying 17 or 18 per cent on a consistent basis. Ms King-I wasn't old enough. I need to bring that to your attention.",123
190,Mrs HULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It is quite obvious the member for Ballarat was not in a family situation when there were no jobs to get to receive the overtime to pay the extreme interest rates that were delivered by the Hawke and Keating governments. Ms King-Because I was 12.,123
191,Mrs HULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is obvious that the member for Ballarat has a very limited knowledge-not a short memory, because I suspect she was not even in the workforce or in that place when that was going on. It is obvious that she has a limited knowledge of what the Hawke-Keating Labor government delivered to the families and the people of Australia who were then trying to care for their families, who were losing their homes and who could not afford to pay the extreme interest rates. Ms King-What proportion of their incomes are they paying on their mortgages now?",123
192,Mrs HULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It is quite obvious the member for Ballarat is not telling her constituents just how much tax they would have been paying when they were on a low income. Ms King-What proportion of their incomes are they paying on their mortgages now?,124
193,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable member for Ballarat will go and have a cup of tea soon!,124
194,Mrs HULL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is quite obvious that the member for Ballarat, as she sits there screeching from her seat whilst I speak the truth, is not telling her low-income families that, if they were earning $30,000 under a Hawke-Keating government, they would have been paying double or triple the tax rate they are currently paying. For example, at $30,000 the tax cut will be $21 a week from 1 July 2007. Taxpayers earning $30,000 paid $6,222 in income tax in 1999, but from 1 July 2007 they will pay $2,850. That is a reduction of around 54 per cent. So it is quite obvious that there is little knowledge of just exactly what people were paying under the Hawke-Keating Labor government. Memories are short, that is the problem. Or there is has. no memory at all and no knowledge at all. There is so much available at this point in time that has been provided by this government. Now that we have paid off massive levels of debt that were left by a Labor government, we are able to give back to the families of Australia. That is what the Howard-Vaile government have been doing. I repeat the Treasurer's figures from question time: in 2000, 30 per cent of taxpayers paid 30 per cent or less tax. In 2007, 80 per cent of taxpayers pay 30 per cent or less tax. Is that not a benefit to the majority of Australian families? Yes, I think so, but there would be no cause for anyone on the opposite side of the House to recognise that there is more disposable income within the taxpayers' pockets as a result of the fine fiscal management of this government. There has been no recognition or discussion here today in this matter of public importance debate of the great role that the carers of Australian disabled people and the frail and aged provide. There is no mention of the carer payments that will be received by the thousands of carers across Australia when they receive their $1,000 carer bonus. They will also get, through the carer allowance, a bonus of $600 for providing the fabulous care and service to their family members and friends and those who are disabled and unable to fully care for themselves. The program also supports the carers of young people under 30 years of age and carers who are experiencing significant stress in caring for a person under 65 years of age with a disability. We are providing, as a government, options for respite and weekend respite and equipment to significantly reduce the stress on these family carers.",124

197,Mrs MOYLAN,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works I present the second, third and fourth reports for 2007 of the committee relating to Defence Force School of Signals redevelopment, Simpson Barracks, Watsonia, Victoria; National Towers Program stage 1 for Airservices Australia at Adelaide, Canberra, Melbourne and Rockhampton airports; and Lavarack Barracks redevelopment stage 4, Townsville, Queensland. Ordered that the reports be made parliamentary papers.",125
198,Mrs MOYLAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Each of these works reflects the diversity of the committee's activities over the last six months of the current year. Report No. 2 of 2007 relates to the redevelopment of the Defence Force School of Signals at Simpson Barracks, Watsonia, in Victoria, necessitated by a decision of the government to co-locate training campuses in one central campus. The estimated out-turn cost of these works is $101.3 million. Simpson Barracks, Watsonia, is the primary campus for the Defence Force School of Signals, with other smaller campuses located at HMAS Cerberus, at Flinders, also in Victoria, and at Borneo Barracks in Queensland. The rationalisation for the co-location of these campuses is based on a number of advantages that will be delivered to the signals, electronic warfare and communications and information systems training provided to members of the Australian Defence Force, as well as training provided to members of the armed services from countries for which Australia provides a level of training above that available to our regional allies. In addition to these advantages, there will be an opportunity to consolidate the location of training staff, as well as freeing up facilities Reports for other purposes. In scrutinising these works, the committee had some concerns with the overlap between the provision of living-in accommodation that would deliver some 216 rooms, and a program of works associated with Project Single LEAP phase 1 which had previously delivered 1,395 single living-in accommodation rooms. Where there are value-for-money considerations, the committee was of the view that accommodation projects should be contained within the Single LEAP project works. While Defence advised that the issue in the case of Watsonia was one of timing, the committee believes that this issue could have been addressed by a more comprehensive planning approach-especially since economies of scale may offer savings to the Commonwealth. An appropriate recommendation has been made by the committee in its report to this effect. There is also a question over the future intentions of Defence in the context of the relocation of the training wing at Borneo Barracks in Queensland. If this were not to proceed, there might be savings to be gained, and the committee has made an appropriate recommendation in its report seeking advice from Defence on the future of this campus. I take this opportunity to thank the member for Flinders in particular for his submission on these works and for his interest in this inquiry. I turn now to the third report, relating to the National Towers Program stage 1 that will apply to airports located at Adelaide, Canberra, Melbourne and Rockhampton and will involve the rebuilding or refurbishment of control towers at an estimated out-turn cost of $94.5 million. The committee appreciates these works being referred, since the costs associated with the project are not vided by the Commonwealth. Rather, the funds are commercially derived from levies paid by airlines and aircraft operators to Airservices Australia as a ‘fee for service'. ertheless, Airservices Australia provides a valuable service to Australia's travelling lic and, as the committee noted, it would seem fitting that there be some level of scrutiny associated with the proposed works. Moving now to the fourth report, which relates to Lavarack Barracks redevelopment stage 4, this proposal also originates with Department of Defence and builds on previous works considered by the committee as stage 3 in 2001. It is from Lavarack Barracks that members of the Australian Defence Force are deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, and as well it is home to a number of other Army units. The proposed works envisage an ongoing program of building remediation, new office accommodation, and facilities to maintain and service newly acquired vehicles and field guns, and to keep abreast of other technologies now available to the Army. These works will be provided at an estimated out-turn cost of $207.2 million. The committee was pleased to note that the proposed works will be spread across a mix of new and refurbished buildings, and that this methodology has delivered savings compared to an overall rebuild proposal. However, it was apparent from the committee's inspection of the proposed sites for these works and from comments made by the department during the committee's inquiry that maintenance works had been neglected, with consequences for the expenditure of a significant sum of Commonwealth money to redress the status of the Lavarack estate. In evidence, Defence acknowledged that the lack of maintenance due to changing priorities in funding was a problem, prompting the committee to recommend in the report that consideration be given to the development of pro- an ongoing maintenance program, together with appropriate and dedicated funds for this purpose. Australia's military history is bound up Nevwith the Lavarack Barracks. During the Vietnam conflict, Lavarack provided training pubto Australian troops being sent to the Vietnam theatre of operations, and there are a number of remaining buildings on base that are representative of that era. The committee has recommended in its report that Defence consult with the relevant government dethe partment with a view to obtaining an assessment of the heritage value of these buildings. I have to say that the committee was somewhat disappointed with the quality of the consultation process between Defence and stakeholders in relation to this project. Of particular concern were comments made by the regional commander of the Queensland Fire and Rescue Services regarding fire alarms and the possibility of false alarms to which his members needed to respond, and the lack of consultation between his agency and Defence at the early stages of the design phase of the project. Similarly, there appeared to be an issue with the Queensland Department of Main Roads regarding upgrades to the roads in proximity to the base. The committee has recommended that Defence accept the concerns raised by both agencies and consider the comments of the Queensland Fire and Rescue Services early in the design phase and, in the case of the Queensland road traffic authority, as soon as practicable. I would like to thank the member for Herbert in particular for his interest in the committee's inquiry into the proposed redevelopment of Lavarack Barracks and for his participation in the inquiry process. Finally, I would like to thank all those who contributed to these inquiries, including my fellow committee members, officials of the Department of Defence and those of Airservices Australia, and express my appreciation for the assistance of Hansard and the committee secretariat. I commend the reports to the House.",125
199,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I rise to agree with the sentiments expressed by the Chair of the Public Works Committee, the member for Pearce, with respect to all of the project reports that have been tabled today. They are very important projects. I was fortunate to be involved in two of the three and I attended the committee hearing in Townsville. It is a very important construction, something which the Labor Party members of the committee join the government members in supporting. I note the member for Pearce mentioned that the member for Herbert supports the project. He does, and he attended the public hearing. I can even indicate to the House that the Labor candidate for Herbert, Mr George Colbran, supports the project. So a bipartisan position is held with respect to the very important construction for barracks improvements in Townsville. I might leave it there, other than to say that I concur with the other comments made by the Chair of the Public Works Committee.

201,Mr GRIFFIN,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"The Labor Party supports the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 2007, which will continue to provide ADF personnel with loans assistance until the new scheme is established. The bill seeks to amend the Defence Force (Homes Loans Assistance) Act 1990 to extend the operation of the Defence HomeOwner Scheme by half a year, from 31 December 2007 to 30 June 2008. This would allow sufficient time for the new scheme, announced in the 2007-08 budget, to be finalised and introduced. The intention of the new scheme is also supported, although the specific detail will be carefully considered once it is available. The Labor Party welcomed its announcement in the 2007-08 budget as a step in the right direction. So far, we know that the new scheme will increase the subsidy limit in tiers according to length of service and will also allow the ADF member to choose their mortgage provider instead of the single provider, National Australia Bank. We will be seeking further information from the government on the particulars of its new scheme and eligibility requirements at estimates in the coming weeks. I note that the current scheme is 16 years old and was established under the previous Labor government. This is the first real attempt by this government at improving it. It is about time, and Labor encourages the government to implement the new arrangements without delay. This government must do more to ensure that strong support and first-class services are provided to ADF members and their families. The Labor Party believes that more can always be done to provide Defence personnel and their families with greater choice, better housing and more incentives to stay on. The basis for this matter, and one of the reasons why housing is a significant issue in relation to the defence forces, relates to the whole issue of recruitment and retention, key issues with respect to personnel requirements of the ADF. It is an area where there are real difficulties with the record of this government. February 2007 Senate estimates data revealed the situation with ADF recruitment by looking at the question of target achievement and the disparity thereof across the services and across the ADF as a whole over the period of this government. There are some key points with respect to that. ADF recruitment levels have been short of recruitment targets for 10 years in a row. There was a massive jump in the disparity between target and actual levels of recruitment between 1997-98 and 1998-99, with a peak in poor performance in 1999-2000. There is still an overall shortfall in 2006-07 of 839 personnel across the ADF. Some of these figures are quite mind-boggling. The variation in respect of targets back in 1999-2000 was some 4,593 less than the target. For the year before it was 3,027 less the target. For the year after, in 2000-01, it was 4,077 less. In the years following the figures were 1,983 less, 1,382 less, 1,421 less, 1,924 less and 1,630 less. As we can see, right across this whole period the circumstances show that the government has failed to deal with this issue. It has set targets but has not been able to meet them. Action on this matter is long overdue. In the broader sense of this particular issue, a report today on ABC Online headed ‘Backlog leaves Army recruits waiting for training' talked about a side issue. The report read: The latest recruitment drive for the Australian Defence Force ... appears to have hit a snag, with a major backlog in training for soldiers. The ADF has estimated that about 300 Army Reserve recruits have not yet been trained, while four out of five of those who have enlisted will face waits of between one and six months for training. Nearly 400 former Defence employees are also still waiting to hear if their applications to rejoin have been approved. The ADF has blamed the situation on the training cycle for specific jobs and a lack of vacancies in trade schools. But a News Limited report suggests the reason is that the Army training centre near Wagga Wagga, in southern New South Wales, is overstretched. As the opposition defence spokesperson was quoted as saying in that report: “The Government's throwing lots of taxpayers' money into glossy advertising but can't put the people through the system ... This is a major concern as to the operation of ADF recruitment. It is one of the reasons why this government has got itself into trouble in ensuring that the Defence Force has the capability to do what is required. The question of what has occurred with than defence home loans assistance is an example of that. The government has waited 10 years before doing anything about the scheme. The comparison of activities table in the 2005-06 Department of Defence annual report shows a steady, consistent decline since 2001-02 in the take-up rates for the program. As we look at that particular table we see some of the differences. In ‘Applications for entitlement certificates received' the situation is that the figure has gone from 2,451 in 2001-02 down to 1,724 in 2005-06. When we go to the question of entitlement certificates issued, we see the figure has gone down from 2,342 to 1,674. For ‘Applications for payments of subsidy received' it was 1,648 back in 200102 and has been dropping on a yearly basis to 1,544, 1,428, 1,301 and 1,184 in 2005-06. As for the number of subsidy payees as a whole, the figure has increased but, again, we have to take into account the building factor over time. But the circumstances on an annual basis in terms of new applications across that period have seen it go down. That raises some questions about this scheme, given the fact that it is not new, that up is going down and that this has been happening for some time. It has taken this government quite some time to actually start looking at the issue of what to do to try to address that. The Defence HomeOwner Scheme assists ADF members to purchase a home, and that is an important ADF personnel retention measure. Under the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990, the scheme will finish on 31 December 2007; hence the need to make this change on this occasion until the new scheme is in place. The maximum entitlement of the current scheme for married or de facto couples who are both in the ADF is up to $160,000 on one property. I am advised that the amount of subsidy was increased in 1996 but then remained the same until this year's budget. Home ownership assistance first began in 1919 as a repatriation measure for servicemen returning from overseas war service after World War I. The reasons for the establishment in 1990-91 of the Defence HomeOwner Scheme under the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1990 were outlined in a paper from the Parliamentary Library. The war service homes scheme was established in 1919, as I mentioned earlier. From 1972 the scheme began to be seen as part of the Defence Force's conditions of service rather than as a repatriation measure. The erosion of the value of the loan, which had been capped at a maximum of $25,000 since 1980, led the government, in its May 1985 economic statement, to seek the involvement of the private sector in the funding and operation of the scheme. The big issue for some time was the failure to increase the maximum amount available from $25,000, the amount set in 1980. I mentioned earlier that the new scheme commenced on 15 May 1991, and this area was not updated for quite some time. In Novemits takeber 1996 the ADF Home Loan Assistance Scheme had its maximum subsidised loan increased from $40,000 to $80,000. In May 2006, Defence announced that it was exploring some options to replace the Defence HomeOwner Scheme and that it would conduct a review. The review is now complete, but it appears that its findings have not been publicly released. I have to question why that is the case. However, the Labor Party welcomes the new scheme and encourages the government to implement it without delay. There is still more work to be done, but this government has shown that it will not act decisively and determinedly to do so. If Defence personnel have had to wait 11 years for movement on Defence home loans support, we do not want to wait to see action from the Howard government on other areas of personnel retention, housing and entitlements. I commend the bill to the House.",127
202,Mr FAWCETT,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"I rise to address the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 2007. While I welcome the ALP's support for this bill, I would like to comment on a couple of things that have just been mentioned. While Labor have talked about the Howard government and decisiveness and they have talked about the Howard government and our need to recruit more people, what they have not talked about is the fact that our need to recruit more people is driven largely by the decisiveness of previous Labor governments which, for example, decided in 1991 to cut two battalions from the Australian Army. Over the last 11 budgets of Labor governments, defence outlays decreased by two per cent in real terms. Compare that to this government's decisive commitment to defence in the last 11 budgets, increasing defence outlays by 48 per cent in real terms. Compare that two per cent decrease in real terms with the 48 per cent increase in real terms. This government has been so decisive that this is the seventh consecutive budget in which it has met or exceeded the defence white paper funding commitment. That is significant because for many years Australia has talked about the level of funding that it should be putting into defence in real terms, and then it has consistently failed to meet its targets, particularly under vious Labor government when we saw cuts to the point where the chiefs of the Army and of the Defence Force were making comments about it. The Armed Forces Federation said that the cuts were devastating. General Peter Gration and the then head of the Department of Defence, Tony Ayers, wrote to the Minister for Defence warning that Defence could not sustain further cuts. They said that there were finite limits to how much more could be drawn from so much less. Is it any wonder that we have had to recruit a number of people when the Defence Force was left in such a parlous state by the previous Labor government? I welcome the extension of this scheme, but I particularly welcome the announcements in this year's budget of what the new scheme will look like. The new scheme gives choice to the service men and women. They can choose a mortgage provider that best suits their needs and the product that best suits their needs. Because of the phased nature of the new product that will be offered, there is an incentive for service men and women to continue their service in the Defence Force. Around the 12-year mark, they can draw up to $312,000 with a 37½ per cent subsidy. That is a significant investment by this government into the men and women of our Defence Force. It is not only in this area that we have been investing; we have also been investing in Defence Force recruiting. I note that the member opposite talked about recruiting targets and retention. It was interesting to compare this legislation with a similar bill that I spoke on in 2006, when I delved into some of the history of these kinds of recruitment and retention initiatives. Even in times of high unemployment under the previous Labor government, it struggled to attract and retain people in the Defence Force. This government, with its 32-year-record low unemthe preployment-a record number of people engaged in the workforce-is seeing significant achievements through its investment in the current recruiting rounds. As of 30 April this year, 1,000 more people had enlisted in the ADF than at the same time last year. That is because of the investment that this government has made in Defence for their recruiting approaches. Defence have moved on from the days of the traditional advertisements, and they are looking at things like shared content shows. These shows are becoming popular, and now there is an investment in a Navy patrol boat series. More importantly, they are recognising that the words of Brigadier Jim Wallace (Rtd) hold true for the broader community. Brigadier Wallace often made the point that you lead people and you manage resources. You do not manage people. Much of what was being offered to the young people in our society was the concept of a career that you dabble in, get a bit of training in and then move on to something else. I often said to people under my command when I was in the ADF that no ISO 9000 certified HR management system would have encouraged people at Gallipoli to go over the top of the trenches. It would not encourage somebody to fly a C130 into a missile engagement zone into Baghdad. People do those things because they believe in something that is more significant than themselves and their own circumstances at that point in time. The Defence Force is now reaching out and touching that part of people. It says: ‘Here is a career path. Here is a worthwhile use of your time that will not only benefit you through a range of things but, more importantly, is an investment in your nation. This is a worthwhile way to spend your life.' During the first 19-day period the campaign was aired, there was a 33 per cent increase inquiries being made to the Army. Defence is also looking at other ways of engaging with younger people, such as online gaming and even moving to things like a specific game that could be launched by one of the premier game stations. There is the use of websites and also text messaging. There are a whole range of approaches designed to encourage young people to look at the Defence Force. One of the most significant things, which welcome, is the concept of a military gapyear scheme. This will cost some $306 million over the next 10 years. This is not national service. It provides young people in Australia who are considering what they want to do with their future an opportunity say, ‘Yes, I'm going to give the Defence Force a go.' Up to 1,000 people can sign up and spend that time experiencing military training and a military lifestyle for 12 months. At the end of that period, there is a very good chance that a high percentage of those people will stay on. But if they do not then all the benefits that many people in our community are calling for from national service will have accrued to these young people in terms of their confidence, the discipline instilled in them, their life experience and the sorts of leadership qualities that the rest of Australian society values so much. Lastly, I wish to talk briefly about why it is possible for us to extend this scheme and, in practice, to extend the benefits it provides to the defence service men and women in Australia. It is because of the economic management of this government. Rather than having a $96 billion debt and paying $8½ billion in interest every year, this government is able to make those significant investments in the Defence Force, in the security of our nation and in the families of our defence service men and women. As I said before, this is the seventh consecutive budget in which the government has met or exin ceeded the defence white paper funding commitment. Some $14 billion over the next 10 financial years was announced in this budget to look at a whole range of measures, including things like defence housing. Some $2.1 billion is going into recruitment and retention to make sure that we provide the kind of environment that will encourage the men and women of Australia to choose to serve their country through the services I rather than any of the many other jobs that are available in Australia's expanding economy because of this government's policies. We have invested in a whole range of capabilities, including systems, platforms and people. There is additional logistics sustainto ment funding and security measures to protect our people. There are a whole range of things that this government has been able to invest in because of its economic management. As people move through this year and consider their choices, it is important that they look at the actions of both parties. It is all very well for the Leader of the Opposition to claim to be a financial conservative and claim to have defence as a priority, but look at the opposition's actions. Look at the debt that was accrued under the former government. Look at the decrease in defence spending and the cuts to defence personnel. Look at the opposition's attempts to regain credibility-an advertising campaign where the Leader of the Opposition is sitting in front a building saying, ‘I'm an economic conservative.' It looks very much like the actions the former Leader of the Opposition, who signed a big cardboard cheque that said, ‘I guarantee to keep interest rates low.' If the people of Australia are concerned about the prosperity that underpins the well-being of their families and the ability of this country to defend itself, then only one side of this House can deliver that-that is, the coalition.",129
203,Mr BILSON,COMMUNICATIONS LEGISLATION,"Dunkley-Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence) (5.23 pm)-in replyI thank members and acknowledge their contributions to the debate on the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 2007. I thank the member for Bruce for his comments, and I assure him there will be abundant opportunity for discussion about the machinery relating to the enhanced scheme that the government has announced in the budget. I would particularly like to thank the member for Wakefield for his comments. His extended period of service as a former Army officer gives him a very clear understanding. He has articulated and demonstrated his insights into these measures so well: retention in the ADF is not just about the member; it is also about the family. I would like to acknowledge again his extensive experience. It is valued by the community he represents, which has an extensive ADF membership. So thank you to members for that. The Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 2007 seeks to further extend the operation of the current Defence HomeOwner Scheme from 31 December 2007 to 30 June 2008. Defence has completed a review of the ADF home-ownership assistance program, and the results were announced on 9 May by the government as part of the 2007 budget. The new Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme is one of a of number of initiatives in the budget aimed at improving ADF recruitment and retention. of The government has approved $864 million over the next 10 years in the form of a home loan interest subsidy that involves progressively higher subsidy assistance to ADF members who serve beyond critical retention points. This is important because it will provide ADF members with assistance to achieve home-ownership. It recognises the difficulty members have in purchasing a new home due to the nature of their career and the relocation and posting cycle that is a part of that career. As a result of this measure, there will be a significant benefit to retention within the ADF. It is a targeted measure that involves progressively higher loan subsidies for those who serve beyond those critical separation points. This proposal will do a number of things. It will replace the old home loan assistance scheme, which we are presently seeking to extend to facilitate that transition. It will provide contemporary and relevant home loan assistance that is pitched at a level that reflects current prices. Many in the Defence Force community and beyond recognise that the equivalent value of the current subsidy has been outpaced by improvements in home values. So that is also being adjusted in the new program. The bill provides for increasing entitlements where members serve beyond key exit points and is based on a 37.5 per cent interest subsidy of a three-tiered loan subsidy limit. For four years, it is $160,000 and the subsidy equates to around $241 a month. For eight years, it is $234,000 or a subsidy on interest equating to around $353 a month. For 12 years, it is $312,000 or an interest rate sidy equating to around $470 a month. It is a structure that is more responsive to changes in the housing market. It is also aimed at viding flexibility and choice. It gives the ADF member a choice of their mortgage provider rather than having to choose from the preferred provider under the current arrangements. Also, on discharge, the entitlement to this subsidy continues at the fouryear entitlement level, which is around $241 a month. If the member has served 20 years or more before discharge, it continues at the 12-year subsidy mark. All ADF members will benefit, including reservists and their families. There are two major factors underlying the extension to the implementation of the new Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme to 1 July 2008. They include the need to put in place the legislative amendments. There is a requirement to amend the act that we are debating now to ensure that members and ex-members who are accruing an entitlement under the provisions of this act continue to have access to home-ownership assistance in the period between the announcement of the changes and their becoming operational. The current act specifies a finishing date of 31 December 2007. After this date, no entitlement certificates can be issued, and that is why we are seeking the parliament's agreement to extend that period of certificate eligibility. The act does, however, provide continuing support for members who have taken out loans prior to the finishing date. The progression of the amending legislation is required to ensure that no entitlements are lost. There is also a need to put in place procurement arrangements. We need to establish a panel of home loan providers and a scheme administrator. Defence needs to go through its comprehensive procurement procedures to put that machinery in place. Procurement sub- management arrangements are being worked through to ensure that home loan providers and the scheme administrator can support the prooperation of the scheme from a changeover date of 1 July 2008. That brings us to the substance of this bill-to ensure that the current arrangements extend through to 30 June 2008. This amending bill extends the time during which the National Australia Bank will continue its existing rights as a sole loan provider under the act. More importantly, this amendment ensures that ADF members eligible for home-ownership assistance continue to have that eligibility in anticipation of the implementation of the new scheme and throughout the interim period. The extension also provides sufficient time for the Department of Defence to put the administrative processes that I have already touched upon in place. This bill provides the facility to transition to the far more contemporary and generous scheme that was outlined in the budget. However, we do need to ensure continuity of a scheme until such time as the new program is put in place with proper legislative and administrative support. I commend the bill to the House.

205,Mr MCMULLAN,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"I rise in the debate on the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill 2007 first of all to make clear, on behalf of the opposition, that we support this bill. It is, in its immediate implication, an uncontroversial bill, although I will have some things to say about the underlying report that drives it. I mainly want to indicate my general view about the organisation whose administrative arrangements we are amending here. It is an organisation for which I have a very soft spot and of which I am a strong supporter. Firstly, I go to the bill itself. The amendments are in response to what was officially known as the Review of the Corporate Governance of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders, but what is known in the vernacular as the Uhrig report. That report has led to a series of changes to many pieces of legislation and, in this particular instance, to change the administration of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, otherwise known as ACIAR. The bill does not alter the research program or the broader public policy outputs of ACIAR but is designed to improve the administration of ACIAR and to bring it in line with the manner in which other government entities are administered. While supporting the bill I want to make it very clear that I have very profound reservations about the Uhrig report. I have expressed those here in the parliament before. I thought it led to a very unwise decision with regard to the board of Austrade and I think the general application of the Uhrig report has not been generally beneficial to public administration. But I support the bill for two reasons. Firstly, I support the bill because within reasonable limits governments should be able to put in place the administrative arrangements they choose for the bodies for which they are responsible. We expect ministers to be accountable to the parliament for government agencies; therefore they should be able to manage them in the manner that they see as appropriate from a legislative point of view. That is not a blank chequethere can be circumstances in which that would not be appropriate-but even in the case of Austrade, where I strongly disagreed with the decision to abolish the board, flowing from the Uhrig report, I supported the legislation because the incumbent ought to be able to make such arrangements if it chooses. If an incoming government wants to create a board for Austrade, that is not going to be a difficulty. For that reason I would not oppose this bill. Secondly, in this case the changes to the administrative arrangements for ACIAR are more apparent than real. It is an attempt to create the impression of implementing the Uhrig report by abolishing the board and creating a commission. The parliamentary secretary in his second reading speech said: ACIAR will retain its capacity for collective decision making (through the new commission) while bringing its management under the CEO. He really means, ‘We've made no effective change at all.' I do not say that as a criticism, because I am not sure there needed to be a change. As I have said, I am not a big fan of Uhrig, but nevertheless ACIAR will continue to be an effectively administered body under this new legislation, and I support it. The debate on the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill 2007 gives me an opportunity to say something about the excellent work that ACIAR does. ACIAR was founded in 1982, and the original bill had within it a sunset clause because there was some doubt about whether it would prove, over the medium term, to be an effective instrument for enhancing Australia's support for agricultural research in developing countries. Midway through that original sunset clause period the then management of ACIAR decided to conduct a preliminary review of its progress and achievements so that it could judge for itself whether it was on track for passing the hurdle that the sunset clause provided in the original legislation. I had the opportunity to participate in that review as a then backbench senator in 1989. I found it extremely interesting. It was quite an insight for me. I knew something of the operations of ACIAR but had no particular expertise in the area, and I found it very insightful. Since that time. I have been a very strong advocate for, and supporter of, ACIAR and its role. I have always found it to have strong bipartisan support in the parliament. As far as I know there has never been any effective criticism from either side of parliament about the ongoing role which it plays-most particularly, in its focus in assisting the agricultural development of developing countries by applying the capacity of Australia's agricultural research institutions-or about the flow-on benefit to Australian agriculture from the quality and character of the research undertaken jointly by Australian research institutes and their partner organisations in developing countries. In its final report, that external review which I participated in lauded the high standing that ACIAR had already achieved in six years in the field of international agricultural research. Other members of the panel were from many of the other international agricultural research organisations and they had already regarded ACIAR as a leading member of that international agricultural research community. With very few exceptions, this positive reaction was reflected in the views of all who had been associated with ACIAR, whether as participants in collaborative projects, members of sister institutions or Australian participants. A great deal of what ACIAR does was judged to be excellent, and that was the panel's conclusion. I thought it was a proper and welcome sign of confidence in its structure and operations that ACIAR opened itself, on a continuing basis, to effective scrutiny. A number of recommendations were made at that time. There have been subsequent reviews of overseas aid programs, such as the Simons review and the recent white paper review. The director of ACIAR has also independently commissioned a number of reviews of particular aspects of ACIAR's operations and programs. From all the evidence that I have seen from 1989 to the present day-the scrutiny, the surveys, the reports and the international assessments-and from what I have seen when visiting other countries to look at the work that ACIAR has done in conjunction with research institutes in partner countries, there seems to be a high level of support and recognition of the quality of ACIAR's work, and its research seems to have a high level of impact. It is very practical, very targeted and very much about achieving serious results and improving agricultural performance in developing countries. As I say, these projects have often had a useful spin-off for Australian agriculture as well. That is not ACIAR's primary purpose, but it is a welcome secondary objective. It is because of the cooperative way the research institutions work together that that can flow. The centre encourages Australia's agricultural scientists to use their skills for the benefit of developing countries and Australia. ACIAR funds research projects that are developed within a framework reflecting the priorities of Australia's aid program and national research strengths together with the agricultural research and development priorities of partner countries. The ACIAR mandate directs activities to developing countries in five regions: Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands, South-East Asia, North Asia, South Asia and southern Africa. Research is also allocated across regions through funding to the international agricultural research centres. ACIAR's functions continue to be to commission research into improving sustainable agricultural production in developing countries; to fund project related training; importantly, to communicate the results of that funded research; to conduct and fund development activities related to research programs; and to administer the Australian government's contribution to the international agricultural research centres around the world. The goal of sustainable agricultural production is particularly important to Australia's aid program. I have been concerned that broadly the Australian aid program has lost its focus. The appropriate focus for Australia's aid program, which should be poverty reduction, has been lost as too many other objectives have been pursued. But I think ACIAR is one of those agencies that remain focused on providing practical assistance to improve the living standards of people in developing countries. According to Francois Bourguignon, the Senior Vice President and Chief Economist at the World Bank: Growth in agriculture makes a disproportionately positive contribution to reducing poverty. More than half of the population in developing countries lives in rural areas, where poverty is extreme. So the focus that ACIAR has on improving agricultural production is very much a part of an intelligent, poverty focused research program. Across the board in Australia's aid program, funding for rural development has fallen. We are seeing a belated but welcome increase in Australia's aid program, but it is still only 0.3 per cent of GNI-way below internationally accepted targets and below the performance of most comparable countries. Even with that, funding for rural development in Australia's aid program has fallen and, on the face of it, based on the budget papers, funding for ACIAR has fallen. I support the bill. I am confident the House will support the bill because it is in many ways simply an administrative tidy-up against the government's management priorities to bring ACIAR into line with changes that have been made to a large number of government agencies. To conclude as I began, I am not a great fan of the Uhrig report-I am not a great fan of the things that it has done for public administration across the board-but for two reasons I support the bill: firstly, because the government is entitled to have the administrative structures it seeks to put in place to run agencies for which it is accountable and, secondly, because, as they relate to ACIAR, the changes are more apparent than real. The commission will continue to be able to provide the advice and collective decision making that the board has done in the past. I do not think that these structural changes will in any way enhance the performance of ACIAR, but they will in no way impede its capacity to continue to provide to the people of Australia and the people of developing countries in our broader region the sort of valuable support in agricultural research that has been the hallmost mark of 25 years of good work by ACIAR. I have over the years had many friends who have worked in this organisation, and I have many friends who, having worked there, are now putting in substantial and important work around the world to enhance agricultural production in developing countries. As a credit to the work of those people and all the others who have worked and continue to work in ACIAR, I am pleased to have the opportunity to support this bill.",134
206,Mr SECKER,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"I note that the member for Fraser was largely supportive of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill 2007. It is significant that the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research was set up under the Howard-Fraser coalition government. In fact, the member for O'Connor, who will follow me, would have been around at that time-not many of us were, so he has a greater corporate knowledge of the history of how the centre was set up. Mr MCMullan-Some members of the House were not born.",137
207,Mr SECKER,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"That could very well be the case. I rise tonight to speak in support this bill. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research was established in 1982 to assist and encourage agricultural scientists in Australia to use their skills the benefit of developing countries, whilst also working to solve Australia's own agricultural problems. As the previous speaker, the member for Fraser, said, the centre is very much focused in providing overseas help to other nations, but we also benefit from that in our own country. Some of the scientists have come back and work in other areas of Australian society-in private enterprise or in a public institution such as the well-respected CSIRO. Some of the benefits that derive from that research will always benefit agriculture, whether it be here in Australia or anywhere else in the world. The ACIAR is a statutory authority that works within the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio. It supports projects in six regions-Papua New Guinea, the South Pacific, South-East Asia, South Asia, North Asia and southern Africa. Whilst ACIAR will no longer be a legal entity separate from the Commonwealth under the amendment bill, it will continue to have authority to design and commission research with Australian and overseas partners. The ACIAR Amendment Bill was put in place to make changes to the government's arrangements of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. The bill implemented the government's response to the Review of the Corporate Governance of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders conducted by John Uhrig. Unlike the previous speaker, the member for Fraser, I very much support the arrangements that are being put in place in many of our institutions as a result of this review. Certainly, those that have already occurred have proven to be quite successful. I think that the proof of the pudding is in the of outcomes and certainly the outcomes of the institutional changes that we have made as a result of the John Uhrig report have been very successful and, I believe, will continue for to be very successful in the future. The Uhrig Review of the Corporate Governance of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders was completed in June 2003. The report recommended two templates designed to ensure good governance. You hear more these days about good governance in federal, state or local government or in private companies. It is one of those catchphrases that have been widely accepted. I had the ability and good fortune to be part of a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association meeting last year that was entirely about good governance. It is being accepted all around the world. As I said, the report recommended two templates designed to ensure good governance. The first outlined that governments can be best provided by executive management. The second stated that it is best delivered by a board. ACIAR was reviewed in the second and third quarters of 2006 and, in the case of ACIAR, it was agreed by ministers that there is an inconsistency between some of the provisions of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997, the FMA act, and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Act 1982. The government assessed the existing governance of ACIAR against the recommendations of the Uhrig review together with authorities from the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio, the purpose being to have the most effective accountability and governance structures across the whole of government. The purpose of the amendments to this bill is to change the governance arrangements of ACIAR from a board of management to an executive management structure involving a chief executive officer and a seven-member commission. This is quite common across our nation, as I have said, in government or in private enterprise boards. There are also several other key amendments within the bill. The first outlines the responrent sibility for the administrative and financial management of ACIAR to be changed from where it currently resides with the board of management to the CEO. The CEO will report directly to the minister, which is with the provisions of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. The revocation of ACIAR's body corporate status follows. The establishment of a commission comprising a chair and six other commissioners would include the CEO, who could also be named as the chair. This commission would provide collective decision making and expert advice to the minister in relation to proand gram formulation, priority setting and funding. It does not matter who you are or how brilliant you may be, you can always use the advice of other people. In the end, democracy works, but it also brings greater ability and greater knowledge that can spread throughout the organisation. The commission will also offer advice on other matters as requested under the legislation by the minister. The current Policy Advisory Council, the PAC, which includes key overseas stakeholders, will be retained-and I think it is important that we recognise that. This bill, however, introduces amendments to ensure there will be no duplication of membership between the commission and the PAC. The current functions of the PAC will not change under the commission structure-again, that is another important thing to note. The PAC will continue to advise on the agricultural problems of developing countries and suitable agricultural research options to address these problems. The main change will be the shift in responsibility for the administration and management of ACIAR to the CEO in line with the executive management model, which is the template recommended by the Uhrig report. The only refinement to the curPAC arrangements is that key overseas stakeholders will retain membership but will not overlap with the commission. This refinement will allow for more specialised input with high-level partner country participain line tion in the PAC. The act will also be amended so that the appointed commissioners hold office on a part-time basis for a period of up to three years. The act will also be amended so that the minister can provide directions to the CEO concerning the performance of his or her functions under the legislation, which includes the strategic direction of ACIAR. In conclusion, I do not think the outcomes operation will change greatly, but I think it will be a more efficient model. Perhaps that will lead to quicker and fuller decisions, if I can put it that way, and it is certainly something I believe this House should support. As I understand it, those opposite will be supporting the amendments in the bill as we have put them.",137
208,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"I am pleased to speak on and support the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill 2007. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research is currently a statutory authortre, ity that operates as part of the Australian government's development cooperation programs. The centre encourages Australia's agricultural scientists to use their skills for the benefit of developing countries and also for the benefit of Australia. The Centre for International Agricultural Research funds research projects that are developed within a framework that reflects the priorities of tralia's aid program and national research strengths together with the agricultural research and development priorities of partner countries. Its mandate directs activities to developing countries in five regions: Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands, South East Asia, North Asia, South Asia and southern Africa. Research is also allocated across regions through funding to the international agricultural research centres. ACIAR's key functions are to commission research into improving sustainable agricultural production in developing countries-a very important objective. Also, it funds project related training; it communicates the results of funded research; it conducts and funds development activities related to research programs; and it administers the Australian government's contribution to the international agricultural research centres. The purpose of the bill before the House, as others before me have indicated, is to implement changes to the corporate governance of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, to enact revised governance arrangements in its enabling legislation, as part of the government's response to the 2003 Review of the Corporate Governance of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders, known as the Uhrig review. The bill also replaces existing governance arrangements within the centre to reflect the executive management model recommended in the Uhrig review. Key changes involve the abolition of the board of management of the cenalong with the office of the director, and the creation of a Commission for International Agricultural Research and a new position of chief executive officer. The commission will be established to provide collective decision making and expert advice to the minister on specific aspects of the centre's operations, including program formulation, priority setting and funding. Consistent with Aus- the executive management model in the Uhrig review, responsibility for the administrative and financial management of the centre will be conferred on the new position of CEO, which will be directly accountable to the minister. These changes, it is said, are aimed at clarifying and segregating the administrative and advisory functions of the centre to ensure best practice in corporate governance. The bill also revokes the centre's body corporate status, as the retention of the centre as a legal personality separate from the Commonwealth has been assessed as unnecessary given that the centre is budget funded, is a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and does not need to own any assets in its own right. The bill does not-and the parliamentary secretary pointed this out in his second reading speech-change the functions or objectives of the Policy Advisory Council established under the act. The only changes in this regard include amendments to the council's constitution to reflect the new governance arrangements, and provisions to ensure that there is no duplication in membership between the council and the commission-and the bill does not change the functions of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. The bill includes transitional arrangements to ensure that the governance changes do not disrupt the performance of the centre's function. The bill gives me an opportunity to say something about the present state of international agricultural research and pass on to House some conversations which I recently had with experts in this area from two bodies-Bioversity International and the Food and Agriculture Organisation. In the conversations I had with a number of representatives from those organisations, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research came up on a number of occasions. I am pleased to report that the view of these international experts on the work done by our centre was overwhelmingly positive. The context in which I had these discussions was very much about the impacts of global warming, climate change, on agriculture. Indeed, those impacts are prospectively quite serious. I met with the director of versity International, Dr Emile Frison. He discussed the role of plants in climate change adaptation. For example, forests are a long term investment, and we need to be able to predict what climate changes will occur and which species will prevail. Bioversity International is developing models to achieve this. To date, many species in tropical forests are inadequately studied. Bioversity has an office in Kuala Lumpur which is doing work on this in the Asia-Pacific region. Small island countries-for example, those in the Pacific-need to work on a regional basis. In addition, there is a need for diversityplanting numbers of different crops as a climate change adaptation safeguard. Bioversity is collecting and studying plant genetic material for projects such as an Indonesian project on banana wilt diseases. That is being carried out under the auspices of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. It is also carrying out projects on, for example, coconut genetic resources in the Pacific to examine the potential of coconut oil as a biofuel. One of the points that Dr Frison made was the that these sorts of crops and biodiversity should be used to improve the livelihood of poor people. When we talk about things like bioenergy, we need to understand what its impact on our poorer people will be. For example, Bioversity is concerning itself with the quality of nutrition. The Millennium Development Goals have led to significant efforts to increase the food supply of poor people, but there has not been enough attention paid to the quality of the food. More calories are available per capita, but the displacement of traditional diets by poorer diets has had some negative health impacts, including the emergence of so-called diseases of affluence such as cancer and obesity. Bio- Television is promoting a desire for junk food in rural villagers. Bioversity is seeking to rehabilitate the image of some traditional foods, such as leafy vegetables, which have suffered by being seen as backward or not modern. For example, there is the Kenyan project which led to the introduction of these leafy vegetables to the parliamentary canteen menu. In some Pacific islands, where more than 50 per cent of the population is overweight, work has been done on identifying and promoting varieties of bananas which are rich in vitamin A. Dr Frison expressed some concern at the recent drying up of funds for this kind of work from the United Nations Global Environment Facility. He said that no money had been forthcoming from this source for the past 12 months, which has slowed Bioversity's work considerably. I also spoke with Annie Lane from Bioversity. She has been working in the area of climate change mitigation, researching crop diversity and capacity to deal with extreme weather events, including drought. She coordinated Bioversity's crop wild relatives work. She says that more funding coming from the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research would help both Australia and developing countries. For example, she is working with various botanical gardens, which can act as refuges for vulnerable species at risk of being pushed over the edge by climate change. She is modelling the impact of global warming on various crops and their wild relatives. I will give you a couple of examples of the impacts. In 50 years most wild peanut species will have no climatically suitable habitat in Latin America. They cannot move up the slopes of the mountains, as it were; that habitat is not suitable. In any event, most plants cannot move quickly and cannot move at all if their habitat fragmented and there are no corridors. The example from Australia. I was provided comes from Western Australia. It is a bioclimatic analysis of the distribution of 819 eucalypt species which was carried out back in 1996 by the ecologist Lesley Hughes and colleagues. It showed that about 200 species of Australia's 819 eucalypts had a climatic range of less than one degree Celsius mean annual temperature, so obviously temperature variations will greatly affect the ability of these to survive. The research studies predict serious effects over the course of the next 60 years in a biodiversity hot spot for eucalypts in Western Australia. Crop wild relatives include crop ancestors as well as other species more or less closely related to crops. They are a critical source of genes for resistance to diseases, pests and stresses such as drought and extreme temperatures. The use of wild relatives has led to improved resistance to wheat curl mite, late blight in potato and grassy stunt disease in rice. They have been used to improve tolerance to drought in wheat and acid sulphate soils in rice. Wild relatives have also been used to raise the nutritional value of some crops. Protecting crop wild relatives helps to ensure that adequate genetic diversity exists in a particular crop's gene pool. Increasing genetic uniformity makes crops more vulnerable to stress. Devastating losses in the American maize crop caused by a corn blight outbreak in the USA highlighted the risk of relying on just a few high-yielding varieties. Natural populations of wild relatives are unfortunately increasingly at risk due to overexploitation and the loss of habitat. There was a global project funded by the United Nations Environment Program's Global Environment Facility back in 2004 which examined these risks. It is clear that rising global temperatures are threatening crop wild relatives with extinction at the very time they are most needed. The adverse impacts of global warming on agricultural systems can be mitigated by using crop wild relatives, which can help adapt cultivated crops to changing climate conditions. There was a study conducted by Bioversity International and the International Rice Research Institute which estimated the current and future geographical distribution of the wild relatives of three of the world's major food crops-potato, peanut and cowspecies pea-based on 19 climate variables. The study predicts that, by 2055, something like 18 per cent to 25 per cent of all of these potato, peanut and cowpea species could become extinct, and that most species could lose over 50 per cent of the land area that is currently suited to them. As many as 31 of the 51 wild peanuts studied are likely to become extinct and the distribution area of the remainder will be reduced by more than 90 per cent. I also met recently with representatives of the Food and Agriculture Organisation. The Food and Agriculture Organisation is examining the role of agriculture and of forestry mitigating global warming. Its key personnel see opportunities for developing countries to benefit from bioenergy. Forestry can play a role in capturing CO2 and in a carbon neutral cycle involving wood energy. I met with Dr Gustavo Best, who is the Senior Energy Coordinator of the Sustainable Development Department. Dr Best said that issues which need to be resolved are issues of land tenure, the role of local populations and who benefits from forestry and agriculture projects. It is clearly not helpful for high-tech projects take small farmers off the land. The impact of bioenergy on food prices and the impact of monocultures on biodiversity also need to be assessed. If a crop is grown for energy rather than food, does its price go up and will food become unaffordable? Dr Best said there had been little systematic work done on the impact of bioenergy on food prices and food availability. The Netherlands has introduced requirements that bioenergy contracts must be sustainable in the ecosystem where the crop is grown. This followed an outcry from nongovernment organisations over a palm oil contract in Malaysia which ended up being cancelled due to concerns about adverse social and environmental impacts. Biomass needs to be sustainable in its use of water and in its energy balance. Dr Best said, for example, that maize grown in the United States has more energy put into it than it actually produces, so it is only economic due to domestic subsidies. Brazilian sugar, on the other hand, is a net energy producer. He sees considerable potential in sugar cane, soya, castor oil, sunflower oil and from research now being carried out on the conversion of cellulose. Biofuels are receiving a shot in the arm from the European Union directive increasing the target percentage for biofuels in the fuel mix for European vehicles from 5.7 per in cent in 2008 to 10 per cent by 2010. Principal sources of supply are likely to be eastern European-Poland, Ukraine and Belarus. Oilseeds are now an attractive investment to produce biodiesel. This is good news for producers, who get a higher return, but not such good news for consumers because the cost of food goes up. A number of crops are showing bioenergy potential-soya, rapeseed, palm oil and sweet sorghum, which is doing well in semiarid areas and may have potential in Australia. The cost of ethanol into Brazil has fallen from 1970 to 2000 due to research breakthroughs, but it still requires a lot of water. There is a need to create synergies between bioenergy production and food production through means such as annual cropping, changing the crop, injecting nitrogen and assisting biodiversity. The Food and Agriculture Organisation are looking closely at climate change adaptation. Their knowledge of agricultural practices, water management and soil management is being put to use in climate change adaptation. Countries like Bangladeshwhich are not the cause of global warming, and this raises some serious moral issueshave to work on farm practices and health issues raised by more frequent and severe flooding. The Food and Agriculture Organisation indicated to me that they would like more contact with Australia. There was more contact some years ago on other issues. They also indicated that there is a need to protect corridors of vegetation for biodiversity and to guard against insect pests and diseases. There are great opportunities for Australia in South-East Asia through emissions trading. So far emissions trading has not helped forestry projects much. Japan is an exception, having invested in forestry projects to get carbon reduction certificates. The Clean Development Mechanism has had little impact on agriculture; it has had more impact on landfill and biogas. We need policies and knowledge to answer questions like: is there enough land? Are we threatening the environment? Are we threatening small farmers? The circumstances, and therefore the answers to these questions, will vary from region to region, country to country, and locality to locality. Some major non-government organisations have been presenting bioenergy as a threat to sustainable development because of the problems with increasing intensity of land use and threats to biodiversity. Certainly it Dr Best's view that the message for politicians about bioenergy needs to be scientifically based, objective and the product of long-term research, and that bioenergy cannot and should not be treated in isolation from the environment, rural development or the energy sector. Bioenergy has to be further integrated into energy policies in many countries. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research appears to me to be well regarded abroad, but the goodwill which this body generates for our agricultural sector has, of course, been completely undermined by the scandal surrounding Australia's wheat marketing arrangements in the wake of the AWB scandal. The payment by AWB of $300 million in bribes to Saddam Hussein is a matter of national shame. Unfortunately, there is no sign this week that the government has learnt anything from this debacle. I am pleased to support the legislation, wish it a speedy passage through the House and hope that it enables the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research to continue its good work.",139
209,Mr TUCKEY,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"O'Connor) (6.13 pm)Previous speakers have quite adequately covered the technical factors relevant to the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill 2007. I thought a couple of quotes from the explanatory memorandum and the second reading speech were of relevance also. The bill brings into effect recommendations of the Uhrig report. I spoke at some length this morning on the effect in the agricultural and veterinary chemicals area of these particular matters. I had some concerns with regard to management and the role of the minister. As this is an advisory body to the minister, those comments are not relevant, and it would seem that this particular body can operate quite successfully as a government bureaucis racy. In fact, as we are advised in the explanatory memorandum: The Bill also revokes the Centre's body corporate status as retention of the Centre as a legal personality separate from the Commonwealth has been assessed as unnecessary given the Centre is budget funded, is a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and does not have any need to own assets in its own right. We are talking, of course, about an instrument, as described by the parliamentary secretary in his second reading speech. He said: ACIAR is a statutory authority within the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio, and its activities are part of Australia's aid program. ACIAR was established in 1982 to assist and encourage agricultural researchers in Australia to use their skills for the benefit of developing countries, while at the same time working to solve Australia's own agricultural problems. I wish to take as much time as I am allowed to speak about those particular issues. It is the responsibility of developed countries, or those countries that are as fortunate as Australia-might I add under the economic management of this government-to try to lift people out of poverty. I do not care where you look in the world, and I believe there is a statistic to prove it, but most wars and uprisings-even world wars I and IIinvolve a significant statistic of huge numbers of unemployed young males. As such, there is a responsibility on the developed world to relieve poverty wherever possible, and of course that commences with giving people the opportunity to grow adequate quantities of food for their own purposes. Government aid programs are a great means of achieving that. I am most committed to the argument that it is better to give in the form of assistance with agricultural research, where we send researchers to do that work or deliver the benefits of research conducted for that purpose. During the Pakistani earthquakes, I tried to convince my side of politics that we would be better sending those people aid in the form of tunnel shelters that are manufactured and commonplace in my electorate. They are low cost; they are a high-quality, strong, plastic coated form of the Nissen huts of history. They can be easily erected, they pack down to a very small load and I think they would be highly resistant to future earthquakes. They would have created large and durable protection for those people. I might add that the departmental people had no interest in that whatsoever. All they wanted to do was send the cheque. Of course, the problem with sending cheques is that, as we know, in many countries the benefits do not materialise within that country and sometimes they materialise in very fat Swiss bank accounts. I make those comments but say that this is a good program. It is the properly applicable way to deliver foreign aid. If we provide people with food, it should be grain or whatever that is grown within Australia and delivered in that form-or, as I have said, it could be buildings or other items. We are looking to lift living standards, and a great revolution of 20 or 30 years ago was called the green revolution. This was when technology and the application of fertilisers and things of that nature revolutionised crop production, particularly in the Asian region. It was one of those breakthroughs in technology that lifted many people up from poverty, and no doubt contributed in some way to Asia's redevelopment and the fact that there is now, for many, a higher standard of living. One of the interesting things upon which I want to comment, both in terms of the nations we seek to assist overseas and, as the aid second reading speech says, in terms of our own agricultural problems, is genetically modified organisms. It is a highly contentious issue. I have never been happy with state governments applying blanket bans. I saw them as purely a political exercise. The Australian government has taken the appropriate approach, which is to have a gene technology regulator. We do not approve of the human consumption of products that have not been tested and approved by that authority using the best science available. Furthermore, I have people I admire and support in my own electorate who have grave doubts about GMOs. One of their grave concerns is cross-pollination, where you create a food product that has resistance to certain herbicides and then later it crosspollinates things like radish and other weeds that we usually deal with in this fashion. Of course, they become resistant. That is a challenge. I believe it is best resolved by practice and testing. But in the international context, the ability to put a vitamin-A gene into rice has had very significant benefits for young people in particular in many overseas countries where rice is the staple diet. As a consequence, a specific benefit that has arisen is the prevention of blindness. One cannot think of a more punishing affliction for anybody than blindness. So this has been the sort of evidence where the research that developed countries have been able to provide, and the use of GMOs, which is greatly and unfortunately restricted in Australia, has been very beneficial. It is also, of course, beneficial for productivity. I would like to come back to the remarks of the member for Wills about biofuels, which I endorse. He alluded to the fact that it is all right to use this sort of agricultural duction for fuel, but the downside, which is occurring now, is that there is a reduction in the availability of food for Third World countries. It appears that some of themBrazil being a classic case-are now clearing land at a very rapid rate to grow more sugar, which is a good agricultural product for producing biofuel such as ethanol. There are some interesting statistics. The world population presently stands at about six billion people. By 2020 it will be eight billion people-a 30 per cent increase-and that is an awful lot of extra mouths to feed. I was advised by senior executives of the General Motors Corporation in Detroit that, of that six billion people, only about 12 per cent own a motor vehicle. It is predicted by General Motors' tracking that that will increase to 16 per cent of eight billion by 2020. One can see that there will be a huge demand for additional fuel and, if it were to be provided through hydrocarbons, there will be a very significant increase in emissions and particulates. Therefore, research in the area of biofuels has merit but, as I said, we have to be careful that in producing those biofuels we do not so limit food that its price increases rapidly-although my wheat growers would be very pleased to have a rapid increase in price. Already the utilisation of American corn in ethanol production has caused hardship for Mexicans and others who rely on that staple in tortillas and other foods. There is a round-robin in all of these things. As I frequently say, there is no such thing as a free lunch. I myself do not see a benefit from research to make biofuels in Australia unless we can, by some miracle, substantially increase our crop. The Labor representative at the table is quite astounded by that remark. As we are currently in drought, one might wonder where we would get the corn or grain to produce ethanol and keep open a very capital intensive factory. proAs reported in the media, the ethanol plant at Swan Hill will consume four megalitres of water per day. They propose that three-quarters-750,000 tonnes-of their input grain be raised by irrigation. I make the point that there are better solutions for Australian agriculture than growing our own biofuels. It is not that we should not have biofuels; it is that it is not the best outcome for the very limited amount of grain that is produced in Australia. We stick our chest out and argue about AWB, but Australia grows less wheat than the United Kingdom. We are not a big wheat producer. We have been a significant exporter, but that is declining very rapidly as our domestic consumption-deregulated and, I might add, highly profitable for those who have access to the market-continues to grow at a very rapid rate. This is not only in human consumption but in lot feeding to produce the type of beef that people in our society demand. Research has to take a lot of things into account, and the member for Wills and I have some consistent views on those matters. In domestic research we must proceed with all sorts of things that will do great things for us. I come back to GMOs, which will provide the opportunity to produce both salttolerant and drought-tolerant plants. I am amazed at the opportunities that already exist in the crops themselves. I recently had the pleasure of writing a letter of congratulations to Mr Ian Broad, who resides in the Mingenew area and is a very progressive farmer. He also relies on large equipment. What delighted me, as much as it was a good-news bad-news story, was that he was reported as having grown a harvestable crop-it was not a star turn; it was not a magnificent crop-on 2½ old-fashioned inches of rainfall. He was able to achieve that because, for a start, a good farmer and, secondly, because he is using large equipment. The other letter of congratulations I wrote was to a father and son, Paul and Blake Smith of Mukinbudin, who have purchased a new tractor. It is 600 horsepower. They are dragging a machinea bar, as they call it-behind it which is, firstly, tillage equipment and, secondly, seeding equipment. They are able to put in 760 acres of crop in a 15-hour working day. That is more than an acre a minute. The benefit of that-other than that you get to knock off early-is that you can take advantage of every drop of rain. There has been magnificent research, for which I must congratulate the Scott brothers and people at Murdoch University. There is an inoculant required when one plant's legume seeds-that is the little bud, if we can call it that, which connects the nodulation on the roots of legumes such as lupins and clovers. Lupins are a very significant transitional crop in my electorate, and a very healthy food. By the way, Mr Broad is now producing a new variety of lupins that has an even higher protein rate than previously, and he is marketing that in a very progressive way. But the interesting thing is that, when we look at lupins and nodulation, the practice has been to buy an inoculate, which is a black-looking powder, and, if you were seeding it, you sort of applied it in whatever fashoutcomes. ion-usually by putting the grain and the inoculant through one of the loaders on the property-and some of the inoculant would stick to the seed. Then you would put the seed in the ground and, if the ground was damp and it germinated immediately, the inoculant worked. But so much cropping is done today with this large machinery, by which you dry-seed-you seed and wait for the rain. But you get the benefit of the first millimetre of rain, where previously you waited for the rain before you ploughed the he is paddock and so on. If you only got four inches of rain for the year, you did not get the benefit of the first two. Some progressive farmers in my electorate, the Scott brothers, found that they had a bentonite deposit on their property. That is ‘drilling mud'. It is a very heavy and sticky clay that is pumped down oilwells to keep the oil at the bottom, because it has such a heavy weight. That is a well-established principle called drilling mud. But they did not have anyone who wanted to buy drilling mud. In conjunction with Murdoch University they found that, if they could incorporate the inoculant we speak of into a soup of this mud, and then dry it out and sort of pelletise it, the inoculant stayed happily in that state and did not die. So you could seed these pellets along with your seeds of lupins, or whatever else you wanted to benefit from nitrogen nodulation, and it would stay there until the rain came. I think they have called it Alosca. I am very proud to say that the Regional Partnerships Program gave them $300,000 for the development of this program, which can have a huge effect as a research product. These people now have a patent. They are to be congratulated. So there are all these opportunities there. And no doubt there will be a time when that inoculant is exported from Australia in that format, because it can be put into the ground and deliver these sorts of Research occurs in many ways. The member for Wills talked about carbon sequestration. Unfortunately, I have run out of time, but I did want to remind everybody that oldgrowth forests are a net emitter of carbon and it is young forests we might be growing. Also, Mayor Blumberg announced that all the taxis in New York within a few years have to run on biofuels or hydrogen, which I would think is the better choice. (Time expired)",143
210,Mr HUNT,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (6.33 pm)-in reply-In rising to sum up debate on the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research Amendment Bill 2007 I want to turn to the points raised by the honourable speakers. Firstly, I want to thank the members on the opposition benches for their support-the member for Fraser and the member for Wills-and in particular I want to thank the members on the government side: the member for Barker and the member for O'Connor, who set out very clearly what it is that the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research brings to Australia. It is engaged in a process that has ‘dual benefits', which I understand is the term that the member for Barker used. That process is very simple: by fostering and encouraging global agricultural research in areas, whether it is rice, wheat, corn, dairy, beef or any of the other core staples of Australia's and the international community's agricultural base, it gives enormous developmental benefits to the underprivileged. It also brings extraordinary benefits back to Australian farmers. Internationally, what ACIAR does is very simple: it helps promote and develop some of the most needed, highest quality and most effective agricultural research anywhere in the world. It does that through a coordinating process, whether it is at home in Australia or abroad, and then it helps bring those results back to Australian farmers. In particular, I know there is work that I have been doing with the executive of ACIAR in trying to calculate the volume of water saved annually by Australian farmers as a direct consequence of the work of ACIAR. I believe that, once we have those figures finally established, they will show an extraordinary windfall in water savings for Australian farmers on an annual basis. Against that background, this bill helps to establish and put forward an administrative structure and future for ACIAR for the coming generation. Firstly, in terms of the background, the bill is a response to the Uhrig review, as it is known, or the Review of the Corporate Governance of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders, undertaken by Mr John Uhrig. The fundamental action that was recommended in that and the principal purpose of the amendments is to change the governance arrangements of ACIAR from a board of management to an executive management structure involving a chief executive officer and a seven-member commission. As has been set out in the second reading speech, there are a number of specifics that help implement that essential change. It is about administrative efficiency-the ability to make fast decisions and to work with the executive of the government to that effect. I understand that that action has the support of industry, the bureaucracy and, in particular, both sides of this House. Its effect is very simple. It is non-controversial. It is unlikely to have any financial impact. The mandate and functions of ACIAR will not be affected, but it will allow for a form of collective decision making and expert policy advice suitable for an agency such as ACIAR. All of the members of the House who spoke to this deserve to be thanked for their support. I particularly thank the executive of ACIAR, the board of management members, who have served so capably to date, and those who are likely to take up the positions on the seven-member commission. I also thank the officers involved at either a departmental or an institutional level. I am delighted to commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading",147
211,Mr HUNT,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"Flinders-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs) (6.38 pm)-by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2007 MEASURES No. 3) BILL 2007 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 May, on motion by Mr Dutton: That this bill be now read a second time.",148
212,Mr BOWEN,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"The Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007 is an omnibus tax bill that contains 10 separate schedules. I would characterise seven of these schedules as being noncontroversial: schedules 1 to 6 and schedule 9, which contain sensible measures to either protect government revenue or correct unfair anomalies. As Labor supports each of these schedules, I will not be detaining the House by going into detail other than to express the opposition's support for the measures contained therein. I will deal with schedules 7, 8 and 10. Before I go to each of these schedules, I note that this bill has been referred by the government to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics. Presumably, this follows the imbroglio that was Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006, which the government refused in the first instance to refer to a Senate committee but then agreed to do so. This bill in part corrects that bill. I note, however, that the bill has yet been examined by the Senate committee-submissions closed on Monday-and that the original time constraints put on the Senate committee were such that there would be no public hearings to flesh out submissions. I understand that following complaints from several people who put in submissions to the inquiry there will now be a public hearing, which I welcome. I say this to the government: if they think their solution to the general lack of consultation over tax measures is to refer every bill to the Senate committee and then emasculate the process so that the Senate committee does not have time for hearings, they are kidding themselves. Consultation needs to happen much earlier, as I outlined in the House yesterday. It should not be referring matters to a Senate committee at the end of the process and then indeed attempt to emasculate the process so as not to have committee hearings. That would be a joke. That brings me to schedule 7 of the bill, which amends section 128F of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The House will need no reminding of the background to this particular schedule. Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006 contained proposed changes to section 128F which had the effect of significantly reducing the ability of firms to obtain an exemption from withholding tax for syndicated loans or debentures. Labor pointed out that this had the potential to significantly affect the ability of Australian firms to raise funds for capital projects overseas. Labor referred the matter to the Senate economics committee, a move which, as I said before, the government resisted. Evidence was received from the Australian Bankers Association, the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Financial Markets Association. Each of their submissions underlined the concerns that I not had outlined. They underlined the fact that the government had failed to embark on proper consultation. Labor senators recommended that the schedule be removed and redrafted. Government senators did not recommend that. However, the government eventually accepted Labor's position and withdrew the schedule, and we see before us today the replacement schedule. I said in the debate on Tax Laws Amendment (2006 Measures No. 7) Bill 2006 that Labor stood ready to support a sensible measure on which there had been proper consultation. Tonight we support that measure because this schedule meets that test. The Asia Pacific Loan Market Association, in its submission to the inquiry, noted: These proposed amendments as set in Schedule 7 to the Bill now provide a firm foundation for this important Australian market and will facilitate Australia being able to access offshore capital major infrastructure projects and other requirements on a more competitive basis. I am glad that this result was able to be achieved. Of course it would have been better if the government had done its job in the first place and consulted properly on these changes. But I am glad that we got there in the end, even though it was delayed and we had to go through the saga of having bad law put before this parliament by the minister and having the parliament overturn it. I will now turn to schedule 8 of the bill, which deals with the tax treatment of forestry managed investments. This schedule comes about as a result of the Australian Taxation Office revisiting its view on the tax deductibility of investors' contributions to forestry schemes. Forestry MIS was covered by the definition of ‘primary production business' under the general deduction provision. The government announced that it would legislate to restore up-front deductibility of expenses for forestry, but it would not do so for non-forestry investments. The bill provides a deduction under a separate statutory provision. This means that it will be a specific deduction rather than fall under the general deduction of the 1997 act. It will no longer be necessary for taxpayers to demonstrate that they are ‘carrying on a business' in order to access the statutory deduction. The specific deduction provision ensures that initial investors in forestry schemes will receive a tax deduction for their contributions and that secondary investors will receive a tax deduction for their ongoing contributions, provided that there is a reasonable expectation that at least 70 per cent of the scheme manager's expenditure under the scheme, at arms-length prices, is expenditure attributable to direct forestry expenses. Schedule 8 of this bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Infor come Tax Assessment Act 1936 to allow secondary investors to obtain deductions for ongoing contributions to forestry scheme arrangements under the new deduction provision. An investor who acquires an interest in the scheme from another investor cannot claim the specific deduction in relation to the payment to acquire that interest-only the ongoing costs are deductable. The scheme introduces a four-year holding period for initial investors. Where an initial investor disposes of the interest within four years, any deductions obtained by the investor under the new deduction provision will be denied in the income years claimed. These are sensible measures, which the opposition supports. I have been very critical of the government's appalling handling of the non-forestry investment scheme issue-the lack of consultation by the government and the lack of a transition period-which has created massive uncertainty in rural and regional areas. However, in fairness, I think the government has got the balance right on the matter of managed forestry investments. I recognise that the tax treatment of managed investment schemes, in general, is a very divisive issue, with passionate views held on both sides. The Australian forestry industry plays an important role in our battle against climate change. We have seen that the returns are so long in coming that any changes to the upfront tax deduction regime will mean that investment turns down very quickly. The 70 per cent rule strikes an appropriate balance and ensures that only legitimate expenditure has been claimed. I am a little concerned about the paperwork and compliance burden that this might create; however, I recognise that there is no easy solution. I would monitor this should we form the government later in the year, but I have no problem in supportmanager. ing the measures as they are put before the House this evening. Finally, I would like to deal with schedule 10 of the bill. This schedule enacts an announcement made by the government in the 2006 budget to introduce a flat withholding tax on non-dividend interest and royalty tributions from Australian managed investments to overseas residents. It could be said that this is a step in the right direction-a very small step made too late-which was announced in the 2006 budget. Now, after the 2007 budget, the government is getting around to implementing this legislation, but it will still leave Australia saddled with an uncompetitive withholding tax regime. This shows a lack of concern by the government about the financial services sector and the ability of Australian fund managers to compete around the world. The bill introduces a 30 per cent withholdone ing tax rate. This is uncompetitive: it impedes the ability of Australian fund managers to best our competitors. Why is this important? It is important because countries have choice. They can support services exports or they can get in the way of them. Some countries around the world have embraced their financial services sector and helped to make them vibrant export industries. Ireland stands out as an example of such success. This is not about picking winners, because the Australian funds management industry is already a winner. They have already won, thanks to the superannuation reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments. We have the largest savings pool in Asia and the fourth largest in the world. This means that the Australian funds management industry is well developed and has well-respected skills. This is particularly the case when it comes to property investment trusts. Australia is already the world's No. 2 property trust Over 12 per cent of the world's listed real estate now resides on the Australian Stock Exchange. Australia pioneered real estate investment trusts, and the rest of the world has followed. We have a number of competitive advantages. We have a wellrespected and transparent system of reguladis- tion. Although from time to time we may have issues about particular matters, our prudential regulators are well respected-as they should be. We are in the same time zone as Asia, which is important when it comes to funds management. But our funds management sector is being held back by this government having its blinkers on. This is not about picking winners; it is about giving Australia a competitive tax regime and then getting out of the way to let the funds managers do what they do best, which is compete around the world. The bill before the House gives Australia of the highest withholding tax rates in the world. Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and the USA all have rates of 15 per cent. Singapore has a 10 per cent. Japan has seven per cent. The government say that it is good enough to have 30 per cent. They say that it is good enough to let the Australian funds management industry compete with the rest of the world with a tax rate of 30 per cent. They walk away from the industry and say: ‘You're on your own. And, by the way, you've got your hands tied behind your back because we're going to give you a tax rate of 30 per cent. Go and compete with that.' That is a disgrace. This is such a short-sighted government. They are not looking towards the future; they are not looking to where the economic growth is. They just say: ‘Bad luck. We're giving you a tax rate of 30 per cent.' Labor has announced a policy on this. The Leader of the Opposition announced it in his budget reply. He said that Labor will introduce a flat and final 15 per cent tax rate. This would help position Australia as the financial services hub of Asia. It would mean that the sector would no longer be held back by uncompetitive tax rates that exist under this government; it could compete on its own merits, and it could do well. It would also be good for our current account deficit. It would mean more services exports. We all know the challenges facing Australia as a trading nation with almost 60 consecutive monthly current account deficits. Yet the government says to one of the most successful Australian industries, ‘We're going to give you a tax regime which saddles you, which holds you back, and which stops you exporting.' It would mean more jobs and more highly paid jobs in Australia. It would make Australia the funds management hub of Asia-and it makes eminent sense. That is why Labor's announcement has been so warmly welcomed by third parties. The Investment and Financial Services Association said: This policy measure would greatly assist Australia's global competitiveness and facilitate capital raising for the Listed Property Trust ... market. … … … This policy, if implemented, is a welcome ... step in securing Australia's future as a global financial services centre in the Asian region ... AMP said: AMP Capital Investors has welcomed the Federal Opposition's plans to have the withholding tax charged to foreign residents investing in Australian managed funds. … … … Any reduction of the withholding tax for foreign residents will continue to increase the appeal of Australia as an international investment destination. The Property Council said: The Property Council of Australia applauds the Leader of the Opposition's commitment to reform Australia's outdated withholding tax system. The government's current proposal keeps us out of step with our international competitors ... Then Vanguard Investments, which is one of Australia's leading investment funds, said: ... we need some government help to get the impediments out of the way ... We view the proposal by Kevin Rudd very favourably. The list goes on. I will refer to some submissions to the Senate inquiry into this bill. GPT Group, a well-respected investment group, said: We would like to express our concern at the introduction of a 30% withholding rate on distributions to non-residents. We believe that Australia needs a flat and final rate that is competitive and removes the need for complex tax administration. They went on to say: Investors consider that the present system, if not changed, will be a major deterrent to foreign investment in Australian Funds. … … … GPT believes that if Australia does not adopt an international system with a more competitive tax rate, the immediate scenario will be an adverse effect on the market with foreign investors choosing to invest elsewhere in the region-followed by difficulties for Australian funds managers in raising new capital. Now I will go to Barclays Global Investors. I quote: We believe that Australia needs a flat and final rate that is competitive and removes the need for complex tax administration. The proposed 30% rate is non-final and permits the investor to offset it with deductions-which may produce the same net Australian tax cost as a reduced flat rate. The Real Estate Institute of Australia supports Labor's proposal. The Business Coalition for Tax Reform have been calling on the government to introduce a similar measure, and the government has ignored them. For the benefit of the Assistant Treasurer, who will sum up this debate, can I confirm that none of the organisations that I just mentioned are trade unions. I say that because he will come in here, and he will sum up the debate-I am happy to go out on a limb here-and say: ‘The Labor Party follow their union taskmasters in every event. They do what the unions tell them at all times, and all they do is do what the unions say.' I know he will say that, because he summed up two other bills today that had nothing to do with trade unions, and that is exactly what he said. He says that on every press release. He says that when he sums up every measure. No matter what it is about, he says, ‘This is just about the Labor Party listening to trade unions.' So I want to be clear: the Investment and Financial Services Association is not a registered trade union. I checked, and Barclays Bank is not a registered trade union. AMP is not a registered trade union. GPT is not a trade union. The Real Estate Institute is an employer organisation. That is how it works. Fran Bailey interjecting",148
213,Mr BOWEN,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"As the minister at the table rightly points out, they do not agree with the Labor Party on everything. They are an independent body. They do not agree with our IR policies. I am more than happy to acknowledge the minister and I thank her for her help in pointing out that the Real Estate Institute of Australia is an independent body which does not agree with the Labor Party on every measure. I wanted to clarify that to assist the Assistant Treasurer, because he is likely to come in here and say, ‘The member for Prospect has been listening to the ACTU.' Well, I do not think the ACTU has a position on this, but I will reveal to the House that not only have all the above organisations warmly endorsed Labor's approach but so have the Finance Sector Union. The minister will at least be able to say, ‘The Finance Sector Union agree with the ALP.' Yes, they do, and I welcome their endorsement just as I do that of the Property Council, the Real Estate Institute of Australia, the Investment and Financial Services Association, AMP and Vanguard. I welcome them all. But there is one person who did not welcome Labor's proposal to cut the withholding tax to a flat and final 15 per cent-that was the Treasurer of Australia. You might find that concerning, that the Treasurer of Australia does not support Australia's having a competitive withholding tax regime. After the Leader of the Opposition's address-in reply, the Treasurer left the chamber. Within minutes of the speech, he was outside holding a press conference. He said two things about this proposal: firstly, that it would cost $100 million. I will come back to that shortly. Then he questioned why you would want to give foreigners a tax cut: ‘You should give Australians a tax cut before you give foreigners a tax cut.' What an extraordinary thing for the Treasurer of this country to say. In my naivety, I thought a bipartisan consensus had developed in this country over the last 20 years that we want an open and competitive economy, not a closed one; that we do not want barriers to investment; that we do not want protectionist walls; and that we welcome foreign investment in this country. I thought we had a bipartisan agreement on this, but apparently it is only the Labor Party that believes that. Apparently the Treasurer's view is an anti-foreigninvestment one. These Hansonesque statements from the Treasurer do him no credit. They are a disgrace. Anti-foreign-investment comments like that from the Treasurer are a disgrace, and they do him no credit. The Treasurer has consigned Australia to having an uncompetitive tax regime which places a disincentive to foreigners putting their money in Australian hands. Let me deal with the matter of costings, because the Treasurer went out and said: ‘The Leader of the Opposition has his sums wrong. This wouldn't cost $15 million a year; it will cost $100 million a year.' This was despite the Treasurer's answer to a question-on 20 March this year; not long agothat had been put on the Notice Paper by my predecessor the honourable member for Hunter about the revenue that was derived from the income paid overseas from funds managed in Australia and the amount of withholding tax that was collected. The answer was very instructive: The information is not available. They did not know. Then, within five minutes of Labor announcing their policy, they knew! The Treasurer knew how much it cost. He left the chamber, walked out from there, held a press conference and said, ‘It costs $100 million,' when he told this parliament two months ago that he did not know, that the information was not available. How much credibility does the Treasurer have on this issue? Zero. The second point is this: when you look at the financial implications of this bill, which takes a marginal tax rate to a flat rate of 30 per cent-it takes rates varying from 29 per cent to 48 per cent-and does not abolish deductability, as Labor's proposal does, the government say this bill will make the Commonwealth $15 million a year. So their bill, which goes from tax rates of 48 per cent down to 30 per cent in some instances and does not abolish any deductions, manages to make the taxpayer $15 million a year and, somehow or other, Labor's proposal will cost the taxpayer $100 million a year. Labor's costing is conservative, and it is thorough. There was some analysis done on the potential of a cut to listed property trusts. This analysis was done by Econtech, a respected consultant. Indeed, it has been said that it is the Prime Minister's favourite costing organisation. It is the organisation which did the costing of the GST. That is how respected this body is. It did a costing on the proposal to reduce the withholding tax on listed property trusts, which is a core or major component of Labor's proposal. Its analysis was that reducing the tax from 30 per cent to 15 per cent and abolishing the deductability of debt would make the Commonwealth $9 million a year. Now, Labor has been much more conservative than that, but that essential methodology and analysis is sound. I seek leave to table the Econtech costings of that proposal for the benefit of the House. Leave granted.",152
214,Mr BOWEN,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"I thank the minister. Let us have a look at what some third parties have said about Labor's costings. The Investment and Financial Services Association said: Importantly, this measure also entails boosting tax integrity, as a flat and final rate would protect the public revenue. And the Property Council of Australia said: The Opposition's proposal for a 15% final withholding tax rate is more likely to generate additional tax revenue and create jobs as the world will give us more of its money to manage. They went on: The Opposition's proposal also makes sense because it protects government revenue. In the Property Council's submission to the Senate committee, which was published today, they said: The Government's approach is based on inaccurate Treasury costings. Treasury says an internationally competitive withholding tax rate will cost more than $100 million a year, while industry says it will not impact on current revenues and could increase tax income over the medium term. They went on: It would be a tragedy to pass legislation that one of Australia's fastest growing export industries on the basis of inaccurate Treasury estimates. I am not going to table those documents, because they are on the public record, but I say to the Treasurer, ‘Come in here and table yours.' It is not acceptable for the Treasurer of this nation to say that Labor's proposal costs $100 million and not reveal to the Australian people or to the industry the assumptions that underpin that costing, the methodology of that costing or the sums which went into that costing. Thin capitalisation rules mean that offshore investors can borrow up to 75 per cent of their investment in managed investment funds in Australia. Labor has assumed a gearing rate of 45 per cent-a full 30 per cent below what foreign investors are allowed to go to in terms of gearing. Labor has taken a conservative approach. If the Treasurer has a different approach let him tell us what it is. Let him come into the House and reveal what the gearing assumption is. The Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer should instruct Treasury to sit down with organisations such as the Investment and Financial Services Association and the Property Council of Australia and go through the costings. Let us have a thorough analysis and let us see the Treasury documents. Let us have a full and open debate. The Treasurer thinks he is going to get away with saying that this costs $100 million and not tell us the basis of that so that the Labor Party and the other organisations which have actively proposed this change can question those assumptions and potentially show where they are wrong-if there are any mistakes, because he did this in five minutes. The Treasurer left the chamber to go and hold a press conference. He only had five minutes to think about it, but I am told by some people that there are some gearing hurts assumptions. The Treasurer has not publicly revealed those but I hear that there are some. If there are some gearing assumptions, he should tell us what they are and then we can have the discussion. It is intriguing to me that tonight we are discussing a bill, which will presumably be passed tomorrow, which introduces a new tax regime. We do not know how much money the current tax regime raises with the new tax rate. We do not know because it is not in yet, but the Treasurer knows how much it is going to change it! He did not know the revenue. He told the parliament, just a month or so ago, rightly-because it seems impossible to know-that he did not know the revenue. If the Treasurer does not reveal the assumptions, the industry is entitled to assume that it was a political knee-jerk reaction not based on the facts. I will quote Robert Harley in the Financial Review because it is a good quote. He said: Unfortunately Costello has the reactive blinkers on. That was the quote from the newspaper-I would, of course, refer to the Treasurer by his proper title. Labor does not have the reactive blinkers on, and I take this opportunity to formally move the second reading amendment which has been circulated in my name. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its lack of commitment to the Australian managed funds industry and its lack of commitment to ensure Australia becomes an Asian financial services hub and calls on the Government to reduce the withholding rate applied to non dividend, royalty and interest distributions from managed investment funds to non-residents to a flat and final rate per cent”. Labor is showing fresh thinking. Labor is showing a different approach to encouraging industries that are working hard and have results on the board, like the managed funds industry in Australia. This government has the reactive blinkers on. It is tired, out of puff and does not show fresh thinking. When the Assistant Treasurer comes into this House to sum up this debate, he might share with the managed investment industry, and the thousands of Australians who work in that industry and who are exporting services and earning export credits for Australia, why the government thinks they should be held back by an uncompetitive tax regime. He might share with the Australian people why he thinks that we should not promote service exports but saddle them with the highest withholding tax rates in the world. He should reveal to the House whether he agrees with the Treasurer that you do not give foreigners tax cuts-whether he supports that Hansonesque approach to economic management. The Labor Party certainly do not. The Labor Party will always take the approach that people who are out there earning export income for Australia do not necessarily deserve government support but deserve a level playing field. They deserve the Australian government getting out of the way and letting them do their jobs. That is what they deserve; nothing more and nothing less. Australia has a choice. We can continue to ride the mining boom and not get ready for the downturn, whenever it may come-it might come this year, in five years time or in 10 years time-or we can say to industries like the financial services industry and the funds management industry: ‘We think you're doing a good job and we're going to help you export more.' That is Labor's apof 15 proach, the Leader of the Opposition's approach-fresh thinking-whereas the government ‘has the reactive blinkers on', as stated in the Australian Financial Review. Get the reactive blinkers off or get out of the way and make room for a government which is prepared to take an innovative approach, which is prepared to say to the Treasury, ‘Sit down with the industry and work out how to make this happen; go through the costings and sort out any discrepancy,' and which is prepared to be open and honest and say, ‘This is how much we think it'll cost,' and why. I hope the Assistant Treasurer does that when he sums up the debate. I hope he comes in here and tables the costings. At least then we could go through them and have a debate about them. Until he does that, the government's costings have zero credibility. They have zero credibility because it will not release the assumptions or the other information which went into making them. I commend the amendment to the House and I commend the bill to the House, with the exception of the uncompetitive, backward-looking and disgraceful withholding tax regime that it gives this nation.",153
215,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Byrne-I second the amendment.,155
216,Mr TUCKEY,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"I have come to the House prepared to speak about schedule 8 of the Tax Laws Amendment (2007 Measures No. 3) Bill 2007, ‘Forestry managed investment schemes', and associated issues. But I was interested in the member for Prospect's remarks, and I note Labor's pious amendment. I have always been of the view-and I cannot present myself as a taxation expert-that a withholding tax was exactly that: a withholding tax. In other words, my view has been that it is much the same as an employee's PAYE contributions. They are calculated as closely as possible to the tax that might be attributable, but a refund is available if those PAYE deductions are in excess of the eventual liability of the taxpayer. I have to assume that the member for Prospect was talking about a rather similar arrangement. The company tax rate in Australia is 30c in the dollar. One must assume that, when we tax the profits of the huge mining companies, the corporate sector and all the other companies that export from Australia, we tax them at 30 per cent. They of course pay these days on a regular basis. They no longer have the privilege of adding it all up at the end of the year and paying it. I think they were initially HawkeKeating government initiatives. I was also interested because the member for Prospect happened to make a reference to the Finance Sector Union. When he was holding forth on ‘union bashing', as he saw it, I was reminded of something that reflects very strongly on any promise that is made in this place by the Labor Party opposition. My recollection is that there was another finance sector union, which may have amalgamated with something else, called the Commonwealth Bank Officers Association. They were deeply concerned about the moves of the then Labor government to sell off the Commonwealth Bank, their employer. They felt more comfortable while it belonged to the taxpayer. Originally a very small proportion was sold and then that was extended to 49 per cent. A letter was written, fairly close an election, by the Labor Party to the union movement, which promised that under no circumstances would the other 51 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank be sold. No doubt all the union members supported the government. As a result of that they got back into office and immediately announced that they were going to sell the other half of the Commonwealth Bank. So one wonders what you can read into a policy that says: ‘We're going to make it 15 per cent. We will have what this nasty government is now doing.' That seems fairly logical to me, but how much trust can the financial sector and overseas investors have when there is an example of them writing to their own union mates and saying, ‘Under no circumstances will we sell the other half of the Commonwealth Bank,' and then doing so with alacrity? For the broader tax-paying community, there was a wonderful statement made at about that same time about tax cuts that were in ‘l-a-w', and they never materialised. So one might wonder about the enthusiasm of the member for Prospect. I believe his protestations about union influence will only be discovered, whether in government or opposition, after the next election, when the likes of Combet, Dougie Cameron and Bill Shorten take their places here. In fact, I hope the young man still has a place on the front bench when those fellows shuffle themselves into a position there, as they anticipate. Any policy promoted in this place at this time by the opposition will be subject to the review of those and other union bosses who either have decided to jump ship and get a real job or are coming here to protect the species of the trade union movement, which really lost all relevance at the turn of the 19th century. I refer people to my maiden speech, where I quoted the leading left-wing academic in the United Kingdom who made that remark. Having responded to the words of the memto ber for Prospect, my warning to those who are in hope of getting their 15 per cent withholding tax is: do not hold your breath; it might never happen, irrespective of what they say now. They have only to ring up the former executives of the Commonwealth Bank union and say, ‘How did your promise work out?' I am a significant supporter of foreign investment in Australia, provided they come here, conduct their business and, where they make profits, pay their taxes. A withholding tax has always been a component of money shipped overseas for the good reason that it is a bit late to chase money if the entire its are repatriated without tax. The following speaker might want to correct me: my understanding of withholding tax is that it is not the overall tax but it might restrict the capital assets of the person or body that is paying. I will give some credit to Keating as a Treasurer: compulsory superannuation funds have now created such huge amounts of money that Australia seems to be having considerable difficulty finding a home for its own money. I get a little disappointed about that because there are better opportunities in Australia for investment. I pick up the paper and find that we have bought Thames Water and toll roads in Canada, and it seems that most of our financial institutions are looking for homes for Australian savings in many parts of the world. The other great advantage those institutions have is that we as a government do not compete with them for savings. In fact, we contribute savings; we put money into future funds and trusts for education. The financial sector has to invest so there is more money for others to borrow and utilise for the promotion of profit and good living standards in Australia. I did not come to speak about that in particular, but I am not really sure that the member for Prospect knows it all. I have borrowed a bit of money in my time. Like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I ran a hotel for many years, and we always seemed to have an overdraft of some sort, so I know a bit about that aspect of business-and I think that is important. While we are talking about institutions, profit and the performance of company directors, I thought there was nothing more outrageous than the attack on the broad body of company directors in the ACTU ad where people like them sat around the table and were accused of saying, ‘Blow the workers.' Those directors are paying a kid I know, who was a track rider, $1,000 a day to work up in the Pilbara as a semiskilled prof- worker-I might add that he is a hard worker-and when his donga was blown away in the recent cyclone he was luckily in Perth. He got a phone call from his boss who said, ‘Don't go looking for another job; your full wages are available until we get you up here.'",155
217,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,I think the member for O'Connor might be straying from the provisions of the bill.,157
218,Mr TUCKEY,INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL,"The previous speaker started to talk about the Commonwealth Finance Sector Union, and I thought it was appropriate-but I thank you for your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was just too good an opportunity to miss. I would like to address a very significant issue in this omnibus legislation. Maybe some of these issues could have been dealt with independently. Investment in forestry managed investment schemes is a matter of long standing interest to me. I served for three years as Minister for Forestry and Conservation and had the responsibility of implementing the 2020 Vision. I opposed it at all stages and I see the progress continuing in Western Australia: another section of native forest has closed down. That native forest has closed down because it has a component of old-growth forest in it. We have competing arguments today. We have the problems of CO2 emissions and coal-fired power generators. We try and find a way through these problems. We are told that the growing of trees is a contributing factor to sequestration of carbon dioxide, which is the food of trees. Trees absorb it, keep the carbon and emit the oxygen. They are great recyclers of the atmosphere. Trees do that very efficiently until they get old and then, through the process of degeneration, they start to emit more carbon than they sequester. It is the same question. The people who advocated that we save the forestssignificantly to let them burn down and create the associated emissions that nobody wants to talk about-are the same people who said we cannot have nuclear power. Now we are between a rock and a hard place: do we have coal-fired power, with its identified environmental problems, or do we have nuclear power? As you will be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, I promote tidal power because, with the huge resources of the Kimberley, it is the better alternative to both. It is disappointing that that does not seem to have much support on either side of this House. We locked up all our native forests for political reasons, particularly at the level. Every election you could feel another forestry reserve coming on. It used to be a dam or some project of that nature. We gave up on all those and now we are short of water. Consequently, as that native timber resource dried up, we found ourselves with an ever-increasing trade deficit in forest products-in particular, paper, the consumption of which is huge. We were not allowed to cut down the native forests, and we did not have any other forests at the time. Consequently, in sawn timber and paper products, we closed our eyes to the rape of the rainforests of Asia-Indonesia and other places. We also closed our eyes to the fact that, when green interests tried to prevent the retailing of rainforest timber, we accelerated the destruction of those rainforests-because, once the trees no longer had an economic worth, they were all knocked down and palm trees were planted to produce palm oil. Peculiarly enough, no-one ever pickets our fast-food outlets that use that product. The outcome of all that was that our government had to come up with a policy to redress the $2 billion trade deficit and achieve some sequestration of carbon from healthy young trees-while the old ones that we were protecting were emitting more carbon dioxide than they were absorbing. We generated the 2020 Vision. At that time you could have tax deductions under what was known as the 13-month rule, a long standing component of tax law that applied to agricultural activity. That meant you could invest money in the last half of one financial year and, if it was expended during the 12 months of the next financial year, you could get a deduction for your expenditure in that first month when you actually spent the money. That has attracted a huge investment in the growing of trees. In my electorate, that has materialised into an industry. I visited Albany the other state day and saw the naming of a brand-new, purpose-built 60,000-tonne vessel that has been built by Japanese interests just to transport from Albany, in the southern end of my electorate, to Japan woodchips from trees that are only eight or 10 years old. Of course, these are the creme de la creme of woodchips. One of the disadvantages of chipping in old-growth forests was that the product was not as attractive to paper manufacturers as these new products are. So we have fixed that up. With the last piece of legislation-on which I had significant negotiations with the Assistant Treasurer because there had been some changes made which put this program at risk-a sunset clause was pasted to those sawn arrangements, which virtually reinstated the 13-month rule. That means we now have to revisit that legislation. The legislation is quite simple and sensible. In fact, it adds another reform which says that there has to be at least 70 per cent of direct forest expenditure taken from the investor's funds-and that was fine. But the real fact of life is that applies only to forestry. This investment program has developed all sorts of other opportunities. The government has decided-and I do not necessarily agree with it-that these other developments, such as olives, almonds and fruit trees, would have been better left as they were, under similar arrangements. But, no, we have created total disarray by saying that we will let the courts sort out where in the system they lie. I think we should have made it certain-even if in a negative sense. I think the amount of prosperity that that sort of investment has delivered throughout the rural areas of Australia was well worth the taxes that might have been temporarily lost-and, when you sort through them, I am not sure they were as large as people thought. The greatest problem I have is that some young men in Western Australia have commenced a new MIS whereby the investor purchases rights to the sowing of a cropand, of course, rights in percentage terms to a share of the profit. The interesting thing is that, in parts of the Kalgoorlie electorate, growers had no rain at all this year. In the absence of rain, they did not take their machinery out to the paddock. But that was a loss that the investors, the cashed-up people from the city, had to carry. Actually, the manager of these funds sent cheques to growers who, because there was no rain, never took their tractors out of the shed-and they have been living on that money in the absence of any return from cropping. That is part of the scheme. The investor takes that level of risk, just as farmers have done for centuries. Farmers in my electorate are now discovering that they want to be part of the investor base as well as being one of those who receive investments. They reinvest some of the money they have received from a cashed-up city investor so that they have geographical cover; if it is raining in one part of the electhat torate and not another, they still have the opportunity to have cash flow. That scheme has been left out of these provisions. I sent to the minister a copy of an amendment that might have been included here. I am disappointed that it has not been included, because it is virtually multi-peril crop insurance provided by the private sector. I believe it stands in a different segment from investments in other agricultural activities, which are to be resolved in court. There is a possibility that next year the scheme will fall over, when in fact there have been huge benefits for people. Just today we were discussing how people who have now had some rain can find some cash to sow a crop. They should contact AACL and participate in this scheme, because they will get the cash. Let us hope they have a significant crop and share some of the profits. That is fair enough. But at least they will be back in business. It is a pity that this scheme is not mentioned today.

220,Mr BYRNE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to speak on an incredibly sensitive and moving subject that relates to the struggle of a young mother and her quest to have her baby daughter recognised. In raising this matter tonight I make no criticisms of governments of any persuasion, but I seek through my contribution to give Tammie Robertson and her parents, Peter and Raena MCKill, a voice, because they need a voice to share with the Australian community the suffering and grief they feel about the loss of Tammie's daughter and of Peter and Raena MCKill's granddaughter. These are good people. I know Peter and Raena MCKill very well. They are residents of Cranbourne. These are stoic people. They are strong people. They are resilient people. They are people who do not normally come to my office seeking assistance. They came to my office under the most dire set of circumstances, and tonight I will relate this very dire set of circumstances to this House. As I said, I raise this issue because the mother of April Marie Robertson has asked me to raise it in the House. Some of the matters that I am about to relate could be quite sensitive and some are incredibly moving, but I believe that Tammie does need to have a voice. I believe that this is the place to raise her concerns and I do so on that basis. I will start by reading some excerpts from Tammie's letter to me pertaining to her child. It says: I am writing this to you to explain what it to lose a child. I am 28yrs of age very healthy, married, 2 Daughters Abbey Rose 6.5yrs, April Marie (DEC). Yes DEAD. She talks about the story of April Marie: We had been trying to fall pregnant for 1 and a half years. The she learned to her great joy that she was pregnant. On 17 April 2007, Tammie Robertson went for her 19-week ultrasound. She was told that her baby was a little girl, because they can detect the sex of a baby at 18 weeks, but that she was not going to survive outside the womb. Tammie felt the baby because it was alive and kicking very hard. The problem for Tammie was that it would become a lifethreatening situation for her if the pregnancy continued and there was also the fact that April Marie had an incurable disease: anencephaly. This meant that the baby would be born dead. Because of the threat that the baby posed to her life, Tammie was induced at about 19½ weeks, which is just days off the 20-week period. The baby was born after a 14-hour labour. Tammie held the baby in her arms and apologised to her for not keeping her safe. The baby was taken away and Tammie saw her again the next day at the funeral parlour. The funeral arrangements were made for the full burial of April Marie and she was baptised by the Catholic Church. Now all Tammie has is the memory of her pain, and the crushing pain she and her family are still suffering. What really vexes Tammie is that she does not have a birth certificate because the baby did not reach 20 weeks. Under the law across all states, the baby has to be 20 weeks old and, in some states, 400 grams before the family can be issued a birth certificate. In fact, she does not even have a death certificate. So this poor is like woman, who has brought this baby into the world just days short of 20 weeks, has not been given the recognition that she needs. This is a person who is going through a grieving process that I could not possibly imagine going through. I do not want to imagine it; the pain would be too great. What she is asking from us as a federal parliament that oversees the state parliaments to some extent-and there is a body that can recognise that, which I think is the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General-is to get some uniform law where, for special circumstances like Tammie's, the baby can be recognised. I ask this House and I ask the state governments in a spirit of compassion, particularly for Tammie, to recognise the memory of April Marie Robertson, who was born and died on 19 April 2007. Palmerston High School",159
221,Mr TOLLNER,ADJOURNMENT,"Solomon) (7.34 pm)Recently I had the great pleasure to visit Palmerston High School in my electorate to meet with teachers and students. The school had received funding to upgrade their computer technology and home economics facilities under the Investing in Our Schools Program. It was very necessary equipment and infrastructure. By focusing on delivering small-scale projects that have been identified as a priority by school communities, the Howard government is providing local schools like Palmerston High with a voice to determine what they think is important for their schools. What impressed me the most was how committed the school is to ensuring our future generation is well prepared for the transition from school to the workforce. Palmerston High School is a model for all schools nationwide with its middle school, senior school and special education structure. It recognises that the middle years, ages 11 to 15, are formative years in which a wide range of experiences need to be provided to assist with gaining knowledge and understanding of the real world. This foundation of learning becomes a tool for future success as adults. I congratulate Julianne Willis, the school principal, and assistant principals John Baldock, Robert Lee and David MCLean on their commitment to providing an excellent and relevant educational experience for the 750 students in years 7 to 12 at Palmerston High which will help them to make a valuable contribution to our society in the future. A good example is the programs being implemented at the special education centre which help to optimise children's learning experiences. Students come to Palmerston High School's special education centre from 11 feeder schools. The centre has students who attend rotational work experience one day a week at Target, Woolworths, the St Vincent de Paul Society, Country Music Shack, the Handicapped Persons' Association, Crocodylus Park, Overflow and a local nursery. Sarah Stocks, a senior teacher in the centre, has been a prime mover in developing its three levels of work experience. Palmerston High offers school based work experience which is fully supported by a work trainer from the school. There is also work experience available through a program called Transition Education Student Services, which enables students to attend a work site with a work trainer and work alongside a co-worker. Finally, there is so-called level 2 work experience which enables a student to work independently at a work site, which may in turn offer an employment opportunity in the future. The centre also enables special education students the opportunity to attend the Charles Darwin University at Palmerston to study for their certificate I in Retail. Students who require high-support care and are unable to complete work experience prepare for life beyond school through a program called Post School Options, which is run by Anglicare. This program incorporates community access with recreation and leisure activities at a facility in Wulagi, with scheduled activities organised one day per week in Palmerston, about 20 kilometres from Darwin. In the broader school stream, vocational education training is also one of the school's strengths. Much credit must go to Yvonne MCDonnell, senior studies coordinator at Palmerston High School, for the design and implementation of a number of vocational training courses known as the Vocational Pathways program. They offer a combination of work and study options leading to the Northern Territory Certificate of Education and/or a school based apprenticeship. Work Ready Pathway offers an intensive six-week course which helps students gain full-time employment. This program is delivered by the International College of Advanced Education-Myriad Group Training. Palmerston High has also gained support and participation for their VET courses from Group Training NT, Youthworx, the Smith Family, the Australian Technical College and Palmerston Regional Business Association. Palmerston High School is an excellent example of how governments, schools, school communities, registered training organisations and local businesses can successfully work together to achieve positive education outcomes. I congratulate staff and dents on their fine work. They do a fantastic job in building the lives of young people and setting them on the path to positive careers. They deserve our respect and applause. Advertising Campaigns",161
222,Ms BURKE,ADJOURNMENT,"I have just done a radio interview with an announcer in Sydney. I had one of those moments where I thought, ‘Gee, I wish I had come up with that.' I was doing an interview in my capacity as chair of the Labor Party Waste Watch Committee. He ended the interview with, ‘Gee, there's a lot of waste to watch.' I thought that that summed it up just magnificently. Yes, there is a hell of a lot of waste to watch from this government. We are only three days into Senate estimates and already there is an avalanche of waste to watch. On day one we learnt about the proposal to extend the Prime Minister's dining room. You may say that that is off the drawing board, but at the time it was not. At the time $540,000-that is half a million dollars-was going to be put towards extending his dining room from a 16-seat dining room to a 20-seat dining room. This dining room comes on top of the Prime Minister's dining room at the Lodge and at Kirribilli, and there are restaurants and private dining rooms in this building et cetera. I am not sure how many dining rooms one man needs. I have a tiny one in Box Hill. It suits me. We are talking of an excessive waste of money-indeed, an obscene waste of money. This is more money than people spend on their homes. It was being contemplated seriously enough by this government to spend $65,000 on an architect to design it. This comes on top of a litany of spending by this government. Over the last 11 years $20 million has gone into the upkeep and maintenance of the Prime Minister's two residences. Again, why stu- does the Prime Minister have two residences? Surely there is one capital of Australia. It is here in Canberra. That is where the Prime Minister of this country should reside. But the cost of the maintenance of his two residences actually pales into insignificance when we look at the cost of this government's spending on advertising. Currently the Australian government is the largest buyer of advertising in this country. Indeed, the government is trying to purchase so much advertising at this point in time that it is pushing up the price of most as being bought on TV, on radio and in newspapers. Most as have gone up by 20 per cent. That might not sound a lot, but when you multiply it out, that is an extreme amount of money being pushed up. The government is trying to purchase so much advertising that Harold Mitchell, the media ad buyer, has said that he cannot purchase enough space to put in the as. In the last 11 years of this government, $1.7 billion has been spent on advertising. Where could that money have gone? But that is nothing when you look at it in the excruciating detail of what this government has spent in the last financial year, from 1 July 2006 until 31 March 2007-$111.2 million. But that is nothing compared to the $4.1 million they spent in one week. There was $4.1 million spent on Work Choices advertising in one week. Of course, it is not Work Choices anymore; it is advertising to rid us of that name so it goes out of the Australian consciousness. Kicking and screaming through Senate estimates we have discovered there has been $1.9 million for bushfire awareness, $4.8 million for national security, $2.9 million family law reform, $2.6 million for quarantine matters, $15.8 million for simpler superannuation, $500,000 for regional telecommunications, $17.4 million for Defence Force recruiting, $12.9 million for Skills for the Future, $4.1 million for workplace relations in one week, $7.5 million for smarter travel, $1 million for asthma awareness, $6.1 million for cervical cancer, $300,000 for pregnancy support, $14.5 million for private health insurance, $3.1 million for drought assistance, $2.1 million for citizenship, and $13.1 million for ending violence against women. Some of this advertising is justified, but it is the extreme amount of it and the abuse of the taxpayers' purse. If you want to get re-elected, use your own funds. Dip into the Liberal Party's purse, not the taxpayers' purse. This is an obscene use of taxpayers' money which could be going into desperately needed areas. (Time expired) Bonner Electorate: EM Tooth Memorial",162
223,Mr VASTA,ADJOURNMENT,"On Friday, 18 May I had the great pleasure of attending the 17th annual dinner at the EM Memorial Tooth Home in Brisbane's Bayside suburb of Lota. The EM Tooth Memorial Home is a highly valued aged-care facility in Bonner, and not only have I received outstanding reports on the quality of care provided by the home but I now know first hand that the level of service the home endeavours to provide is also second to none. The dinner was a success, and I commend the management and staff on their hard work and commitment to offering the best possible opportunities and living environment to the aged in our community. The EM Tooth Memorial Home has developed a fine reputation in Queensland, but has also come to earn an important place in the Bayside community. Since it was first established in the 1960s, for the community has seen the home grow. After its complete renovation in 2001, it now offers outstanding modern facilities that cater for residential aged care and respite care as well independent living. The facility manager, Sandra Tyson, and her team deserve congratulations on all that has been achieved, as the home is clearly a model for other aged-care facilities. I also commend this government on its commitment to addressing the needs of our ageing population. Given the great contribution that senior Australians have made to our country, the government is focused on ensuring that the best possible residential care and service is available to the aged. The government is also committed to supporting the organisations and homes, such as the EM Memorial Tooth Home, that work so hard to deliver this quality care. I note that in 1995-96, Australian government expenditure on aged care was $3.1 billion. Now, annual government outlays on Home aged care will increase to around $9.9 billion by 2011-more than a threefold increase. Furthermore, since 1998 the industry has invested $5.7 billion in the building and upgrading of aged-care homes. The Securing the Future of Aged Care for Australians package, which was announced by the Prime Minister earlier this year, provides $1.6 billion over the next five years. I applaud the measures included in the package, which will ensure that the increasing number of older Australians now and in the future will be able to access the right level of care when they need it. Most importantly, it will also help Australia's aged care sector to meet those needs. I also note that funding of $320.6 million was provided in the 2005-06 budget to make dementia a national health priority, an initiasome tive that I believe is both extremely important and meaningful to many older Australians and their families. The Australian government spends $1.7 billion per year on community care services, and this is a more than threefold growth in the expenditure on community care since 1996. Community Aged Care Packages have also grown from around 4,500 places in 1996 to almost 40,000 places in June 2006. I find it interestshe ing that in 1996 there was no program to provide high care support in the home, whereas, to date, there are around 2½ thousand such places in the form of Extended Aged Care at Home packages. This year's budget continues the Australian government's strong commitment to supporting older Australians and I believe the $1.7 billion in new funding for further improvements to our aged-care system is another step in the right direction. The EM Memorial Tooth Home has my full support, as do all the aged-care facilities in Bonner that provide quality care and accommodation to the aged in our community. Centrelink",163
224,Ms PLIBERSEK,ADJOURNMENT,"I was recently contacted in my Sydney office by a constituent of mine-Leanne, a university student from Balmain. She was experiencing some problems with Centrelink that raise some broader policy issues that I want to share with the chamber tonight. Leanne had applied for youth allowance to support her while she completes her study, and during the application process she was told by a Centrelink officer that she need not report her earnings as she was not working and therefore she was not earning any money. Her application for youth allowance was approved by the local Centrelink office. As part of her studies, Leanne was required to travel to Armidale, where she was doing on-campus study. Before she left for Armidale, Leanne received a letter from Centrelink stating that she had to report any earnings. She quite rightly contacted Centrelink and restated that she was not working and therefore not earning any money, and she believed the issue had been cleared up before she went to Armidale. When she was in Armidale her Austudy payment was cut off and she was told-when phoned up, mind you; she was not warned that the payment was going to be cut off-her payment was cut off because she did not report her income, despite the fact that she had twice been told that she need not report her income because she did not have any. Centrelink admitted the mistake over the phone and told her that a back payment would be made. However, due to a data entry error-a ‘keying error' as they call it-of one digit, the money was not sent to her bank account; it was sent somewhere other than her bank account. At that point Leanne had no money to get home to Sydney. She had to borrow money to get on a bus to return to Sydney. She subsequently had to borrow money from her flatmate's father for necessities such as something to eat. She was told by Centrelink that they could not re-issue her back pay-they agreed it was their fault that they had cut her off; they agreed that she was owed back pay-until they had recovered the money from whichever place in the ether they had mistakenly sent it to. This girl, who has had no money for several weeks, is borrowing money for bus fares and food, is told that she may have to wait days, weeks or months while Centrelink recovers a payment that it has made erroneously to a bank account other than her own. They did tell her eventually that they could give her a $200 emergency payment, but that she would have to go to the Centrelink office to have that payment processed. Leanne was faced with spending her last dollar on sending her assignment to university to be marked, or catching a bus to the Centrelink office to try to convince them to give her some of the money that they already admitted that they owe her. She was desperate and extremely upset when she rang my office. My extremely efficient and hard working staff contacted the Centrelink office. First we were told that the $200 advance could be made and that it could be done electronically-which was an advance on what Leanne had been told. We were told that Centrelink accepted full responsibility for the mistakes, but we still had the contested issue of the $660 that Leanne clearly was owed by Centrelink and that she was desperately in need of. They were saying that she would have to wait until they recovered it from a bank. Curiously, they told her that this would be a difficult process and they could not get information from the bank about whether this bank account actually existed. Leanne was able to get that information simply by phoning the bank. I am very grateful that in the end Centrelink decided to pay not just the $200 advance but the $660 that Leanne was owed. But Leanne is very distressed that, very upset and quite hungry, she had to ring me as her member of parliament and seek my intervention, and that she had to make decisions about whether to complete her course requirements or get enough money to pay the rent-all because of this quite unusual policy decision by Centrelink, who, having admitted their error and having said that they knew the money had gone into the wrong bank account, were making Leanne responsible and making her wait for that money to be recovered. It makes absolutely no sense that Centrelink, having admitted an error in this fashion, would make a desperate person wait for the money they are entitled to. (Time expired) Taiwan",164
225,Mr HAASE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to voice my concern and frustration over the exclusion of Taiwan over the last 10 years from participation in the world's premier public health forum, the World Health Organisation. Here in Australia we have a world-class healthcare system which aims for better health and active ageing for all citizens. However, if Australia's healthcare system is to remain effective it is not enough for it to continue to act or consider itself in isolation. As a consequence of shifting demographic patterns, changes in lifestyle and globalisation, a fully integrated global health system is necessary to ensure that not only Australians but all peoples have direct access to the best facilities and the most up-to-date information. To guarantee this, strong governments must work together that at the World Health Organisation, because individual countries cannot ensure this on their own. In this global environment and as interdependence among countries has increased, the consequences of Taiwan's continued exclusion from the WHO could also be felt in Australia. As Taiwan is Australia's 12th largest trading partner, the eighth largest importer of Australian goods and a major regional transport hub with more than 225,000 flights, 27 million passengers and 50,000 international vessels passing through it every year, quarantine inspection in Taiwan is vital. Without proper monitoring and involvement from the World Health Organisation, the door is left open for epidemics to spread. It is therefore imperative that as representatives of the Australian public we acknowledge and address the issues that this loophole in health security could pose in the future. This issue should be of great concern to the Australian public, as the impact on our trade, economy and health would be devastating. As leaders we must learn from past mistakes, and it is therefore important that we give serious consideration to the alarming problems Taiwan now faces as a consequence of exclusion from the World Health Organisation. There are many cases in which Taiwan has been prevented from accessing the resources and help of the World Health Organisation during times when there was great need for assistance. In 1998, Taiwan suffered from an enterovirus epidemic that came from Malaysia. In 2003, there was an outbreak of SARS, spread from China. We cannot allow such tragedies to be repeated. In this regard, members of the World Health Organisation-and Australia is one of those-must embrace the involvement of Taiwan. We should welcome Taiwan not only as a thriving democracy but as the No. 2 medical system in the world and one of the largest biotechnology science industries in the Asia-Pacific region. No loopholes can be afforded in international disease prevention. The World Health Organisation must uphold its obligation, as set out in its constitution, that all people are entitled to ‘the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health'. Australia, as a significant member of the Asia-Pacific region, should support Taiwan's bid for participation in the World Health Organisation. This should be considered a health issue as well as recognition of the rights of the people of Taiwan. I therefore appeal to all members to support Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organisation, not only today but into the future. As I said, we have an obligation, as leaders of the Australian people, to make our presence felt and our attitudes recognised in the World Health Organisation. We must ensure that Taiwan and its people are given the opportunity to participate in its information technology and in the dissemination of that information so that they can be aware of outbreaks of communicable diseases. This would go a long way to enabling them to secure their borders and ensure that they do not participate in the spread of diseases throughout the world. We owe this to our Australian public, to the commercial interests of Australia and to our vitally important trading partner, Taiwan, and its people. Question agreed to.

268,Ms ROXON,MAIN COMMITTEE,"I am quite happy for the member state governments have a role to play. I am wealth also has a role to play. My point is money in a smart way at all. The Commonwealth responsibility for dental care and we are pleased flip and decided to put some money into dental why on earth would you put it into a program Why would you not look at something that was lems around the country? This program deals with giving dental treatment their chronic disease will be made worse by their stricted group of people. It will be very have found is that in the last three years, spend $15 million, it has only been able MCPherson will be able to do the sums. If it ates, there cannot in her electorate be more to think that this scheme with all the same able to deliver massive improvements in dental will go through in detail why we believe this the Commonwealth finally giving in on their dental care, but why on earth could they not ally help people in our communities? I have been travelling around the country been raised with me almost everywhere I have Brisbane, Petrie and Longman. I have been on and people desperately want to talk about dental that the states have some responsibility. I do period of time, despite the minister trying they have actually massively reinvested in this fix this problem. So if we have Commonwealth prepared to put in, why wouldn't we actually for years to get access to care or to help people check-up? Quite rightly, the people who have who are in pain, get dealt with first and the after their teeth and get their regular check-up which are dealing with ongoing crises. There is a sensible role for the Commonwealth picked the right way to do it. Unfortunately, he got put into health as a political fixer. He that was causing the government some grief. What he has not been good at doing is actually fixed. So the problems in the health system and government's concern. What is actually causing for MCPherson to hear why I think the quite happy to explain why I think the Commonthat this budget is not using the Commonwealth spent 11 years denying that they had any that the government has finally done a backcare. But if you have a spare $370 million, which has, for the last three years, been failing? actually going to help fix the range of probto people who have chronic diseases if dental condition. So it applies to a very rewelcome for the people who qualify. But what we when the government thought this program would to spend $1.6 million. Perhaps the member for is $1.6 million over three years over 150 electorthan a handful of people who have benefited. And restrictions and problems is suddenly going to be care across the population is just ludicrous. I is a misuse of the money. As I say, we welcome outdated view that they have no role to play in spend it in a more sensible way that would actuin the last couple of months and dental care has been. I have been in Adelaide, north Tasmania, radio in Cairns, Bathurst and everywhere else, care. I agree with the member for MCPherson not pretend at all that they do not. But in the last to pretend that the states have taken money out, area. But to be frank, on their own, they cannot money that the Howard government is at last put it into help people who have been waiting on the waiting lists to get a preventative emergency needs or some particular crisis, or people who are trying to do the right thing to look can never be seen in public dental clinics, to play. We just do not think that they have I think it is typical of Mr Abbott. As we all know, got put into fix and close down political debate He has been fine as a fixer in political terms. fixing the problems that the community needs the difficulties for the community are not the the government grief is their concern, and the NA dental program they have announced in the budget down a political campaign if they can, not I mentioned some of the seats I have been ment would be aware that this is a very politically sorting to using pliers to pull out their teeth be at the top of the international tables but happen. We want to be able to make sure that health care, and that includes first-world dental care. I was not going to start on the dental care in particular knowing how big an issue it is in will be very concerned that when those thousands who no doubt will knock on his door and say: able to access dental care?'-find they cannot absolutely furious. There will be a really heavily very issue. I think it is a shame that the member going to be fighting on. Had he been prepared have explained why he is comfortable with the concerns. I am not at all confident that that is the case. In the health budget in particular, we tend for a moment that there are not some welcome made announcements and given our support budget has been what you could not describe tiatives-bits and bobs of programs, individually or theme, with no direction that the government are around 60 different initiatives in this package in any of them. I have spent quite a lot of my time, since months, arguing for a pressing need in the health gic approach to how we are going to spend need to refocus some serious attention particularly prevention, not just treatment of the government has been determined to ignore. of all Australians but it could get much worse cus its attention. Having pursued this issue for the period that minister was quite dismissive of these concerns, just go off and play around on this issue of a health issue this is for us. But I know that about this approach, because they see a clear health system will not be able to cope with. minister. We did see in the budget that the minister different initiatives and said, ‘This is the disease.' Unfortunately, the biggest chunk of ready touched on in more detail, where we highlights this perfectly. It is about closing about actually making some lasting change. travelling through because I think the governpotent issue for them-to have people reand to have kids' teeth getting worse. We used to we are starting to drop. We do not want that to in a first-world country we can have first-world issue, but the member for Dobell provoked me, his electorate.

I do not think you with chronic disease as successful, having only three years. To put that sum of money into it think is overstating it a little bit. There were also a number of initiatives in ple, specialists being able to consult for longer be helpful for people who have chronic disease way they should handle it. There was only just at preventing chronic illness. While we welcome preventable chronic illnesses, the funding committed required. Take, for example, the diabetes package. April, the Commonwealth government has already $100 million over four years as its contribution tory governments to address type 2 diabetes you think that $100 million sounds like quite are dealing with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes 1996-doubled in the life of the Howard government-really money per person. In 2001, about one million tions are that by 2031 this figure I think everyone in this House knows that type 2 diabetes is two to five times more likely have a heart attack or stroke. Access Economics well-being due to type 2 diabetes was $11.6 that cost is going to balloon. So when you think how much diabetes costs the community-and cost but also the community in lost productivity-and pledged simply $103 million over four years, major investment or not. I am also particularly worried that the diabetes participate in requires a $50 copayment. We curs in our Indigenous communities and in our is a disease where the impact burden is not concerned that a $50 copayment particularly that the people who actually need these programs pate. I would like the government to consider system for people who clearly need to be part that payment. I am sure the government, or the want to give people some incentive to make must be aware that it can be a disincentive cost of living is already under pressure because that looks like an optional expenditure, health, might be something that people are can call the dental program available to people been able to spend $1.5 million over the last and call this part of a chronic disease program I there that dealt with clinical changes-for examperiods.

No doubt they will and need a longer consultation to deal with the over $236 million in actual new money aimed these initiatives to help Australians avoid does fall far short of what is desperately As part of the COAG initiative announced in announced that it would provide around to a cost-share initiative with state and terriand that money was found in the budget. When a lot of money over four years, and when you in our community, which has doubled since this is not a large amount of Australians had type 2 diabetes and the projecwill be over three million people. without adequate management a person with than other people in the general population to has estimated that in 2005 the net cost of lost billion, and of course with the expected growth about the scope and scale of the problem and not just individuals who deal with the personal the fact that the government has it does put into perspective whether this is a package that the community will be able to know that the highest incidence of diabetes occommunities in lower socio-economic areas. It evenly distributed across the community. I am in our Indigenous communities may well mean most will not be able to afford to particiwhether they will look at some sort of waiver of this program but may not be able to afford minister if he were here, would say, ‘Look, we sure they keep participating in the program.' We for people to pay that amount of money. If your of a whole range of other things, something even though it might fundamentally change your not able to pay and I think we need to look at a NA way to support our Indigenous community particularly these programs. We are concerned about the approach the sues. For example, in tackling obesity, which nity, particularly childhood obesity, I am cided to fund the CSIRO to develop a diet book geous that we would suggest introducing children to want to talk about nutrition and healthy eating able to do that.

I have covered some of the issues House have spoken about the program over the government closed down the Commonwealth It took about $100 million out of the public denskyrocketed since that time and there are now lists. The minister and the Prime Minister have to spend any money on dental care because it do not care if it is a community problem, that they welcome their decision to play a role. But they there are going to be many people in the commuto their problem.

Even when you had gone through those hoops three visits to the dentist; I think it was year of program treatment. Way back in 2003, was the average figure for visiting the dentist. through the hoops and qualified, were not able program. The government have increased significantly to claim if they get through all those hoops. way is the referral from the doctor that is still required before you will be able to be part of the fact that large copayments will have to know that some of the people who will qualify They have the least resources available to them extensive copayments required to access this prised to know the amounts of some of the scheme-the copayments were almost $700. How sort of payment I do not know, and the government program is going to fix that. A question that is also unanswered is: how people going to make any impact on those not, of course, take over responsibility for those help fix that problem. The Australian Dental Association has criticised tinue to fail to address the problems that those appliances like dentures are included. We do tures are going to be available under this program meet all the qualifications, if the doctor ment-if you can get through all those hoops anything from the government? We It is critical, and I think that there will members who are going to start knocking down of things are not going to qualify or that they get access to them.
