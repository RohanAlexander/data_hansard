2,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I draw the minister's attention to today's Financial Review where the minister is quoted as saying that posed new standard for working hours ‘would be either 38 or 40 hours'. Isn't the proposed working week longer than the 38hour week that is standard in most awardswith some awards having a 35or 36-hour week and only a very small number of awards currently having a 40-hour week? Can the minister guarantee under the government's industrial changes that employees will not have their conditions reduced through an increase in the hours of an ordinary working week?,17
3,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This is a matter which the government is still considering at the present time.,17
4,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,17
5,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I presume the Leader of the Opposition wants to hear the answer. The government is still considering this issue at the moment. As he rightly points out, is a range of hours in various awards. What seems to be the most common is around 38 hours. The government is considering this, but I expect that what represents the common community standard will be what we decide on. Australian Workplace Agreements",17
6,Dr WASHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Will the minister inform the House how Australian employees have benefited from workplace agreements? Are there any alternative views?,17
7,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Moore for his question and his ongoing interest in the subject of workplace relations reform. Almost 700,000 Australian workplace agreements have been entered into in Australia since they were introduced by this government. Indeed, what the data shows is that workers on Australian workplace agreements on average earn 100 per cent more the prothan workers on awards-which are of course the ACTU's and the ALP's preferred alternative, it being the ALP's policy to abolish Australian workplace agreements. Our government believe in individual Australian workplace agreements because we believe in choice. We believe that individuals should have a choice to work under an AWA and they should have a choice to negotiate one with or without a union being involved. The reality is that the reason the Australian Labor Party is opposed to Australian workplace agreements is that they remove the guaranteed privileged position of the unions in relation to workplace arrangements. We currently have a highly misleading campaign being conducted by the ACTU. It is interesting that, when challenged by the government about the accuracy of the advertisements yesterday, the Secretary of the there ACTU, Mr Combet, defiantly defended the as. He said that somehow we were frightened of the ACTU. In light of this certainty from Mr Combet, I was surprised last night to read a lengthy three-page clarification that was posted on the ACTU web site. What this clarification does, in a nutshell, is acknowledge the truth of the government's allegations and criticisms against these misleading as. If people go to the web site and read this clarification, they will see that it concedes that the woman in the first ad with the young family, who is said to have faced dismissal, would in fact be able to bring a claim for unlawful discrimination. We said that this was the case. This lengthy clarification, which the ACTU have snuck onto their web site overnight, is a concession that they were wrong about these as. If they were wrong about that and were prepared to make that concession, they should issue cation: one which acknowledges that in cases of unlawful termination there is in fact verse onus of proof on the employer-that is, if an employee brings a claim for unlawful discrimination then the onus of proof is on the employer. The ACTU should also point that out as part of their ongoing clarification of this misleading ad. If an employee alleges that they have been dismissed for an unlawful reason, the onus remains on the employer to convince the court that the reason for the dismissal was in fact otherwise. That clarification should also be made. The reality is, as I said yesterday, that these as are wrong, they are dishonest and they ought to be withdrawn. NA",17
8,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the German Parliamentary Budget Committee. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to the members. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Workplace Relations Reform",18
9,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also directed to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I refer the minister to his refusal yesterday to guarantee that no individual Australian employee would be forced onto an individual contract, as depicted in the ACTU advertisements to which he has referred again today. Isn't it the case that the minister has been doing precisely that in his own department, with all new employees having no choice but to sign individual contracts? Doesn't that reflect what life will be like for the Australian work force under the government's proposed industrial relations changes? Minister, wouldn't it have been just as appropriate for the ACTU to shoot the as another clarifi- from your office?",18
10,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will iga re- nore the last part of that question.,18
11,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Perth for his question. The reality is that all existing employees of the office of the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations are offered the option of an Australian workplace agreement, and those who decline such an offer stay on the certified agreement. At law, no existing employee of the department can be forced to take an Australian workplace agreement against their will. Mr Stephen Smith-What about the new ones?",18
12,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Perth has asked his question!,18
13,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Perth this morning at his doorstopMr Stephen Smith interjecting,18
14,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Perth asked the question. Does he want to hear the answer? Mr Stephen Smith-I want to hear the truth!,18
15,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Do you want to hear the answer? Mr Stephen Smith-I want to hear the truth!,18
16,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Perth is warned!,18
17,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Perth, in his doorstop this morning, made two inaccurate claims. He said, firstly, that staff of the department are being forced onto AWAs on inferior conditions and he said, secondly, if they do not sign AWAs, they will be sacked. I quote from the transcript: Individuals whose only choice will be if you don't sign, you'll be sacked. That is what he said. Both of those claims are inaccurate and false. Firstly, let us with the facts about the substance of what people are paid under these Australian workplace agreements, which they are clearly better off with. Within the department, the median salary level for all employees on AWAs at all levels above APS 4 is 3.4 per cent higher than that of those employees at the equivalent level who are on certified agreements. Here is proof within my department that those people who have taken up AWAs are being paid higher salaries than those on certified agreements.",18
18,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,19
19,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They do not like to hear that because of their ideological objection to AWAs. If they really represented the workers of Australia, if they really represented the people who work in my department, they would be rejoicing at the fact that long time. people are getting paid more. But they do not, and the reason they do not is because of their ideological objection.",19
20,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,19
21,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is far too much noise on my left.,19
22,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On top of that, all staff on AWAs also have the ability to achieve a performance bonus of 20 per cent of the base salary. On the first claim, the member for Perth is clearly wrong. Secondly, nobody is sacked for refusing to take an Australian workplace agreement. I am advised that nobody in my department has been sacked. Currently, 53 per cent of employees in the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations are on Australian workplace agreements. By the rationale of the member for Perth, the other 47 per cent would be sacked. How ridiculous! OECD report",19
23,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question without notice to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen the OECD thematic redeal view report of older workers in Australia? Would the Treasurer inform the House of policies the government has implemented to address these issues? Ms Gillard-You're not that fond of older workers really, are you?",19
24,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for O'Connor for his question. I acknowledge that he is one of Australia's most famous mature age workers, and he is a great contributor to this House Ms Gillard-There's another right next to you!",19
25,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,19
26,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have a feeling that the very voluble member for Lalor will be sitting on that side of parliament watching the member for O'Connor in this House for a Mr Albanese-Show us your ticker!,19
27,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler is warned!,19
28,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And long may she do so. The OECD released overnight its thematic report on older workers in the Australian economy, and it said this in its country note: Compared with many other OECD countries, Australia has been far from complacent in addressing the barriers to employment faced by older workers. It notes that in many areas Australia leads the world in what it has been doing in this area. It notes the fact that we recently made changes to the mature age allowance to eliminate disincentives for the participation of older workers. It notes the age discrimination legislation which we have introduced. It notes the opportunities for training older people in the TAFE system-and to that one could add the government's announcement of the mature age workers tax offset, which this government introduced as a policy at the last election. But having said all of those things, there are always more things that could be done. The government takes these recommendations seriously. For example, the OECD recommends incentives to remain in work longer and, of course, we have the pension bonus scheme which is directed towards doing that. The OECD says to reduce incentives to retire early and, of course, this is government that announced the increase in the preservation age for superannuation to go to 60. We also have a program to lift the qualifying age for females for the aged pension to 65, the same as it is for males. In relation to this report, there are also recommendations-and I ask the opposition to listen to these-to improve the operation of Australia's disability support pension. The OECD says that disability benefits should be more closely tied to a substantial reduction in work capacity and recommends that we do away with the 30-hour a week test for disabilities. That is what we announced in this year's budget: to move from a 30-hour work test to a 15-hour work test for disability. The OECD also recommended that we review assessment procedures for disability benefits and that we reinforce mutual obligation. If you take this report as a whole, it notes that Australia-with our Intergenerational report, with our Productivity Commission report, with our statement on retirement for older Australian workers-is leading the world. But that does not mean we can stop; we have more work to do. In particular, as we announced in the budget, there is more work to be done in relation to welfare reform and the disability support pension. The only thing I would say to this House is: these reforms could be put in place so much easier if we did not have a negative, carping opposition which just opposes all good economic reform. Economic reform is in the long-term interests of Australia. This government wants to do it, and the opposition should allow it to proceed. Foreign Debt",19
29,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer and relates to our record foreign debt. Does the Treasurer agree with the Prime Minister's statement to the House last week that: the ... the debt servicing ratio has declined quite sharply since this government came to power. Can the Treasurer confirm that the debt servicing ratio on net foreign debt has fallen only marginally, from 11 per cent in March 1996 to 10 per cent today? Treasurer, given that the interest rates we are charged on our foreign debt have fallen by a third and our terms of trade have risen by almost a third, doesn't the tiny fall in the debt servicing ratio hide major structural deteriorations in Australia's capacity to service its foreign debt burden?",20
30,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer is no. Let me go on and talk about debt servicing ratios, because this was a favourite point that used to be made by the Australian Labor Party. Their favourite point was that the critical indicator in relation to foreign debt was the debt servicing ratio. It was a point that was made by the then Minister for Finance on 30 August 1995. He said that the debt servicing ratio, which had been as high as 20 per cent in the late 1980s, had fallen then to 11.2 per cent. He said that, as a consequence, foreign debt was nothing to worry about. If it was nothing to worry about at 11.2 per cent, he would be even less concerned today, because the debt servicing ratio today is 9.7 cent.",20
31,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,21
32,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point is this: it was not a problem at 11.2 per cent; it falls to 9.7 per cent and all of a sudden he wants to say it has become a huge problem. The second thing is that I recall him informing this House on 20 September 1995 that one of the things that was not a problem about foreign debt then was that over 60 per cent of it was held by the private sector-he said, ‘Only 40 per cent.' Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting",21
33,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If he was not concerned that 60 per cent of foreign debt was held by the private sector, how would he be feeling today when 97 per cent of foreign debt is held by the private sector? Let me say that, on the opposition's own tests-(1) debt servicing ratio and (2) composition of debt between private and public sectors-on both indicators, Australia's position has improved; and on composition it has improved very substantially, with the government falling from 40 per cent to four per cent, one-tenth of the amount of 1995. Let us add up the tests which the opposition has set and let us judge the result against what it has said and let us acknowledge the improvements on both of those indicators since 1995. Middle East",21
34,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question without notice is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of recent political events in the Middle East and their implications for the development of democratic processes in that region?,21
35,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I think all members of the House know that those on this side of the House, who are in what are now called per the Liberal and National parties, have always been on the side of freedom and on the side of democracy. I look forward to engaging the Labor Party in that debate in the years ahead-and we are off to a good start, I think. Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting",21
36,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Wills is warned!,21
37,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"One of the places where we have supported freedom is in Iraq. We were delighted with the success of the elections of 30 January and the fact that so many Iraqis bravely went out to vote. We have seen the emergence of a new democratic government in Iraq, and that is something this government supports. We know that it is fundamental to the long-term future of Iraq that the Iraqis themselves are able to take control of their own security. That democracy needs to be reinforced by the Iraqi army and the Iraqi police themselves, and we are contributing to training them. We are seeing a very promising phenomenon-it is a phenomenon that we have seen historically in other parts of the world-of the spread of democracy through the Middle East. It was once said, for example, that democracy would not take root in Asia-and it has. It has been said in more recent times by commentators that democracy would not take root in the Middle East. It is important that it does, and the fact is that it is taking root in Iraq and most recently it has been taking root in Lebanon. The fourth round of elections in Lebanon were held on 19 June. The member for Canning-I do not think he is back yet-was an observer of those elections. His participation was a practical demonstration of Australian support for democracy in Lebanon. The results show that a majority in parliament will be formed from the ranks of the opposition-unlike in this country-which has won over 70 seats out of 128. As one voter said-and this is an important point; it is a nice quoteMr Snowdon interjecting",21
38,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, the Labor Party won in the Northern Territory. That is small compensation, but it is compensation. In the case of Lebanon though, one voter said, ‘Without Syrian influence, my vote can make a difference.' This is an illustration of the point that, coming very much in the context of the overthrow of tyranny in Iraq, there has been a spread of democracy through the Middle East. For example, in Saudi Arabia there have been local government elections. In Kuwait, it is important that women, on 16 May, were given the right to vote and there is now a woman in the Kuwaiti government. Wherever you go, people want freedom; and wherever people want freedom, you will find that the Australian governmentMr Tanner interjecting",22
39,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Melbourne is warned!,22
40,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"the Liberal and the National parties, in one way or another, will be supporting those people who support democracy. Food Safety Standards Mr GAVAN O'CONNOR (2.22 pm)My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I refer the minister to the answer he gave in question time yesterday: ... imported fruit and vegetables are required to be labelled with their country of origin. It is the now. Isn't it the case that the current standard, standard 1.1A.3, does not require country of origin labelling at all but requires only a label saying the food may be imported? Isn't it also the case that the minister's proposed new standard, standard 1.2.11, waters down even this requirement, with country of origin information only provided if consumers request it? Will the minister now apologise for misleading the House?",22
41,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The allegation by the shadow minister that the federal government is proposing some new standard for country of origin labelling is completely wrong. The changes in the Food Standards Code are proposed by Food Standards Australia New Zealand. It is an organisation where the Commonwealth of Australia has one vote, New Zealand has one vote and each of the Labor states and territories has one vote. So the proposal that is being put forward is, in fact, one being put forward by FSANZ. The Commonwealth government has already indicated that it does not support the proposal being put forward by that organisation. This government will be voting against it when it comes to the next meeting of the ministerial council. Perhaps if the honourable member wanted to make a constructive contribution, he might lobby the state Labor governments to take a similar approach so that this standard is not changed. Regarding my answer to the question yesterday, I acknowledge-and I was going to raise it at the end of question time-that my answer in relation to country of origin labelling could have, in one section of the answer, been more complete. It is a fact that imported food and vegetables, when they are packaged or, for that matter, in many instances when they are not packaged, are required to be labelled. They must be labelled that they are law imported or labelled with the country of origin. I accept that my answer yesterday was not complete in that regard in one stage of the answer, and I apologise to the House for that. However, I would refer you to the completion of the answer to the question where I said: It is really a matter for consumers whether they want imported food, fruit and vegetables to come into this country. They are labelled. If they want them, don't buy them. That statement is completely accurate and I stand by it.  is directed to the Treasurer. Would the Treasurer advise the House of the benefits to the economy of the government's tax cuts? Are there any alternative proposals?",22
42,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. I can inform the House that the benefits of the government's tax cuts are that every Australian income tax payer will get a tax cut on 1 July this year. There was only one side of Australian politics that supported tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer on 1 July this year. The bill implementing those tax cuts was, as expected, blocked in the Senate-in the dying days of a passing Senate. So the determination as to whether or not the tax cuts go ahead rests, as it was always going to do, on the schedules, which have now been tabled in this House for nine sitting days and have now been tabled in the Senate for five sitting days. As the days count down, we have still not had an announcement from the Australian Labor Party as to whether or not it will move to disallow those schedules. Two weeks ago the Australian Labor Party determined not to determine a position, and determinedly it is sticking to its determination not to determine a position even today. That indicates, as we have always said, that the rest was a ruse. The Australian Labor Party decided to try to block tax cuts, and the Australian public knew it. It is a little unfair to blame just the Leader of the Opposition for this, because, as we all know, this decision was taken by the member for Lilley, the member for Swan and Senator Conroy. The three roosters were in the lockup, and they collectively made that decidon't sion. I read in the Age today that there is a belief among some caucus members that the influence of Wayne Swan and Stephen Smith is once again too strong on the Leader of the Taxation Opposition. This was a decision which came straight out of Roosters Central. They were all there in the fetid air of the lockup. They were all responsible, and members of Labor's backbench are quite right to be concerned about the influence that the roosters are now exercising over the egg. But there is a fox that circles this henhouse. Yond fox has a lean and hungry look as she licks her lips, because we also read in the Age today that concerns about federal Labor were raised in the shadow cabinet yesterday. Listen to this: according to the article, health spokesman Julia Gillard raised the concerns that the opposition was not developing policy, campaign themes and attacks on the government, and, ‘with parliament rising this week for the winter break, there is worry this period might be wasted'. I think the member for Lalor is actually the spokeswoman who briefs out of caucus meetings, generally, but she did not get the briefing job today. The Leader of the Opposition decided to go out and do his press conference today to announce his campaign themes and to try and get his name up. But we would say that that fox circling the roosters has a hungry look because she knows, as the backbench knows, that the roosters bear a heavy responsibility. I say to the Labor Party: do not blame the member for Brand for all of your troubles; please spare a thought for the member for Lilley over the break. Small Business",23
43,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. Can the minister advise the House which jurisdiction is cheaper and quicker for small business to defend an action in: an unfair dismissal application before the Industrial Relations Commission, an unlawful dismissal application before the Federal Court or a common-law claim for dismissal before a state supreme court? FRAN BAILEY-I know exactly where the member for Watson is heading in asking that question. But let me tell the House that, as far as any cost is concerned, what small business wants to see is the end of go-away money for unfair dismissals. And this government will provide, under its new workplace relations system, a flexible workplace which enables small business to increase its productivity and to increase its wage rates for its employees.",23

45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! FRAN BAILEY- Mr Speaker, those members of the opposition can interject and call out as much as they like",24
46,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I suggest that the minister keep to the question. FRAN BAILEY-but it is only this government that stands up for small business. NA,24
47,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a parliamentary delegation from the Kingdom of Cambodia. On behalf of the House I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Schools Funding",24
48,Mr BARTLETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Education, Science and Training. Would the minister advise the House how funding provided by the Howard government for state schools supplements state and territory funding? Is the minister aware of other policies related to state school funding?",24
49,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Macquarie for his question and for a lifetime of commitment to education, schools in particular. There are a number of facts in relation to school funding in Australia. The first is that state governments are responsible for, own, administer and primarily fund state schools. The Australian government makes a minority contribution to state government school funding, but it is nonetheless a significant and important one. It is that time of year when naturally we analyse and have the opportunity to see how the states are going in relation to the funding of their state government schools. The Howard government this year has increased funding to state government schools by eight per cent. So there has been an eight per cent increase in state government school funding from the Howard government in this year's budget. I can inform the House that throughout the country the state and territory governments have increased their funding to their schools not by eight per cent, not by seven, not by six, not by five and not by four-in fact, the states and territories have on average increased funding to state schools by 3.9 per cent. Honourable members would be aware that at this time of the year",24
50,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,24
51,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister does not need that!,24
52,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"we publish the ‘missing millions' table. The ‘missing millions' table, as members know, provides us with the opportunity to compare the funding of the Howard government for state schools with that of the states and territories. The member for Macquarie probably thinks that the state of New South Wales is the worse-performing state in the country for funding state schools. The Treasurer agrees with that? Mr Costello-That would be right, yes.",24
53,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You could be forgiven for thinking that that is the case, Mr Speaker. The New South Wales government increased funding to its schools, not by the 7.8 per cent increase of this government but by 4.3 per cent. Had it increased funding to the extent that the Howard government did, another $241 million would have been available for state schools in New South Wales this year alone. In fact, right across the country, if the states and territories had kept up with the Commonwealth, $882 million more would have been available for state schools in this country in this single year. But it is my melancholy duty to inform you that the worse-performing state in the country-and I am looking at the member for Adelaide and the member for Hindmarsh as I say this-is the state of South Australia. The Howard government has increased funding to state schools in South Australia by 7.3 per cent. The South Australian government has cut funding to state schools by almost half of one per cent-in other words, $133 million is not available for South Australian public schools this year, because the South Australian government is not keeping up with the Commonwealth. What would that do in terms of getting a performing arts school for Salisbury High School, as the member for Wakefield knows, or upgrading the Salisbury East High School, as the member for Makin knows? The fact is that the Labor Party has as much credibility on state school funding as it has on tax-so do not come here to Canberra driving a social justice truck, trying to lecture this government about funding for state schools. Mr Farmer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I was just wondering if we could ask the minister to table the document he was referring to.",25
54,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do not object.,25
55,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The ruling on tabling is that ministers have the right to table; they do not seek leave. The minister does not have to talk. Superannuation,25
56,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. Can the minister confirm that under the government's choice-of-superannuation arrangements it is illegal for an employer to refuse an employee's request for a choice of superannuation but that under its proposed unfair dismissal laws it will be legal for an employee to be sacked for having asked the question? Does the minister consider these arrangements to be fair?,25
57,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister may choose to answer that question, but it probably is not her direct portfolio responsibility. FRAN BAILEY-The answer to the member's question is no. I take this opportunity to remind the House that it is this government that provides choice for the workers of small business people. We actually believe that those workers have the right to choose where their funds should be invested for their future. Aged Care",25
58,Mr SCHULTZ,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is indeed a pleasure to rise in the House to ask a mature age question. My question is addressed to the Minister for Ageing. Would the minister advise the House how the government is supporting older people in rural and regional communities?,25
59,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Hume for his question. Aged care in this country has been transformed under the Howard government from the days of disinterest and apathy under Labor. Nowhere has that transformation been more evident than in rural and regional communities, where under the Howard government's reforms we now see more places and better care, better homes, better management and greater skill levels in the aged care work force. In relation to the allocation of places, for example, the Howard government will have allocated over 95,200 aged care places, community and residential care, in the period from 1996 to 2007. Currently, one-third of all aged care places are located in rural and regional communities. Last year in the 2004 aged care allocation around 40 per cent of places were allocated to rural and regional Australia. This year a further 11,000 places will be available, and 50 per cent of them will be available in rural and regional areas. We expect that level to continue for the next two years. Under the Aged Care Act, introduced by this government, rural and remote communities are deemed to be special needs communities. That is why, in the advertisement for the allocation of places that will be in this weekend's paper, there will also be information on applications for capital grants for rural and regional communities; that is why we have increased the viability supplement for rural and remote homes by $14½ million over four years; and that is why respite in rural and regional areas has also been a focus. In recent weeks, I have had the opportunity to visit a number of rural and regional communities in electorates in Central Queensland, the Hunter Valley and the Riverina, as well as in the electorate of Richmond. I have been impressed by the enthusiasm that the local communities have for aged care and the enthusiasm with which they have embraced the government's reforms, working in partnership with this government to ensure highquality, affordable and accessible care for older Australians in rural and regional Australia. In the meantime, the Labor opposition continues to wallow in apathy and disinterest. The Labor opposition still has no aged care policy. Superannuation",25
60,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. I refer the minister to the government's decision to reject Labor's amendments to the super-choice laws which would have guaranteed that no employer would face a jail term for providing advice in response to a request from an employee where the employer has no pecuniary interest. Can the minister provide the House with an example of where it would be appropriate for an employer who assists an employee in this regard to be sent to jail?,26
61,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am the minister for superannuation and I am happy to take the question. This question goes to a legislative matter raised in 2000-01 that was agreed to by both sides of the House-that is, people who are not licensed to provide financial advice shall not do so. This is not a new piece of legislation. Can I put to bed the rumour and the innuendo and the fear campaign of the Labor Party in regard to what is required of the small business community. If an employee goes to a small business personMr Burke- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The question quite specifically asked for one example. He can either give one or he cannot.",26
62,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister is in order.,26
63,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am endeavouring to explain to the opposition, as we did during the debate on the legislation, what is required here. When an employee goes and asks an employer for information to assist them, the employer is well within their rights to provide them with the government's help book on superannuation choice or direct them to the web site. What they cannot do is offer specific advice on a particular product. In the event that an employer inadvertently does the wrong thing, let us understand what is required here. First and foremost, ASIC would be required to receive a complaint. If they have received a complaint, they are obliged to do a criminal investigation. If there was criminal intent, they would then refer that to the DPP. The DPP then would determine whether or not there were charges to be laid. The scare campaign being waged by the Labor Party is just that; it is a last-ditch attempt to dent the opportunity of Australians to have choice of their own superannuation, and it is a disgrace. Medicare",26
64,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. How does the government's support for private health insurance strengthen the wider health system, including Medicare? Minister, are you aware of any alternative policies?",27
65,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I very much thank the member for Hughes for her question. I know how much she supports both our Medicare system and our strong private health system. The member for Hughes, like other members of the Howard government, understands that you cannot have a strong Medicare system unless it is backed up and supported by a strong private health insurance system. Under the policies of the former Labor government, private health coverage was at 30 per cent and falling but, under the policies of the Howard government, private health coverage is 43 per cent and stable. Thanks to the policies of the Howard government, nearly nine million people now have private health coverage, including more than one million people with incomes of less than $20,000 a year. Almost three million people have taken up private health insurance since 1997, in large measure because of the private health insurance rebate that this government put in place and which saves the average Australian family with private health cover nearly $1,000 a year. If members opposite had their way, they would rip the guts out of private health insurance. They would immediately abolish the private health insurance rebate. The member for Brand, the current Leader of the Opposition, described the private health insurance rebate as an ‘exceptionally bad piece of public policy'. He even called it a boondoggle in the days when he wore simplicity as a talisman. The member for Perth described the rebate that was put in place by this government as a public policy crime. The member for Melbourne, who is just waiting to come down onto the front bench, said it was one of the least efficient government programs of all time. The boss of the AWU, Bill Shorten, who sees himself as the next Leader of the Opposition, has called the rebate a subsidy for the rich. We know there is a dangerous sense of drift in the shadow cabinet. We know this because Michelle Gratton has reported the views of the member for Lalor. This is what happens when you ignore the member for Lalor's requests for questions in this parliament. That is what happens when you humiliate the member for Lalor by letting her say on Sky News, ‘We are going to ask questions on it this week,' and then you stamp on her. You cannot humiliate the member for Lalor without in turn being humiliated yourself. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to dispel the sense of drift, he can say exactly where he stands now on the private health insurance rebate. When it comes to Medicare, this House and the whole country knows that the Howard government is the best friend that Medicare has ever had. The whole country knows that. When it comes to private health insurance, the Howard government is the only friend that private health insurance ever had. Research and Development",27
66,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. I refer the minister to the government's research and development offset, which is intended to be the major assistance for small companies to invest in research and development. Can the minister confirm that a small business that invests $990,000 in research and development would be entitled to an immediate tax offset of $270,000? Can she confirm that, if a business spent an additional $10,000 to reach the $1 million threshold, it would lose this entitlement in full and would only be able to make any claim years later when it makes a profit? Will the minister immediately act to remove this disincentive for companies that have research and development expenditures approaching $1 million? Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 98, which says questions that seek an expression of opinion, including legal opinion, must not be asked of ministers. I refer you to page 543 of the new Practice, issued today, which deals with the issue of seeking an opinion. The question, which the opposition continually asks, is in breach of the standing order and I ask you to rule it out.",28
67,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have listened to the point of order that the member for Mackellar has raised. I feel that the question should be directed to the minister responsible. I would suggest to the member for Watson that he direct that question to the minister responsible.,28
68,Mr BURKE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister for small business describes herself as the advocate for small business within the government. This is the major R&D issue for small business. If she is the advocate, it is her portfolio. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. The point of order is that the question seeks the minister's opinion, which is clearly out of order. The member is asking for an opinion as to which, on those stats, would be the legal position. That is quite out of order.",28
69,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question is in order, but I do not believe it should necessarily be directed to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism.",28
70,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I think it falls under the portfolio of the minister for industry. The minister for industry is absent today.",28
71,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,28
72,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I am the best advocate in this House for small business. Don't you worry about that. Out of respect for the member for Watson, who is a new shadow minister, I will obtain some information and I will be very happy to provide it. I can assure the member for Watson that the advocacy for small business is passionately shared by all members of this front bench. Whaling",28
73,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of outcomes from the first day's meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Korea?,28
74,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I am pleased that he shows so much interest in this issue. The International Whaling Commission meeting began yesterday in Ulsan, which is in South Korea. Senator Ian Campbell is strongly representing Australia at this meeting, as is Australia's International Whaling Commissioner. Senior officials from his department and my department are participating. At the initial stage, I am pleased to inform the House that Australia, with like-minded friends, was successful in voting down several measures proposed by Japan and other pro-whaling nations. We defeated Japan's attempt to remove conservation related items from the International Whaling Commission agenda by 31 votes to 24. We also defeated Japan's attempts to broaden the use of secret ballots in the IWC by 30 votes to 27. That is a good thing, at least for the purposes of this exercise. Australia has introduced a motion requesting that Japan's expanded scientific whaling program not be considered by the IWC until a review of their original scientific whaling program is completed. This motion will be voted on later this week. It has attracted 25 sponsors, which is promising. To be frank, this is not going to be an easy vote to win. Obviously Senator Campbell is making every effort on the ground there to make sure he is successful. I need to emphasise that the numbers on the IWC remain finely balanced. Delegations from several pro-whaling nations have not arrived yet, so we will have to just wait and see. We are obviously doing what we can to be successful in this meeting. We have a chance of being successful, but we do not want to overstate what we believe our chances are. It is going to be difficult. Two of the delegations that have not turned up are those of Nauru and India. I have written to the Nauruan foreign minister urging Nauru's support in this meeting. When I was in India the week before last, I met not only with External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh but also with Environment Minister Raja",28
75,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,29
76,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, I did enjoy it. I took the opportunity to express to them Australia's strong opposition to commercial and scientific whaling, given that the meeting is coming up, and hoping that India would share not only our views but also our sentiments in the way it votes. We will continue to work with like-minded countries in the hope that we can prevail at this meeting. National Public Toilet Map  the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. I refer to the government's election decision to spend $10,000 to upgrade the amenities block at Lancefield Reserve in the minister's electorate of MCEwen. As tourism minister, the minister would be aware that there are more than 14,000 other toilet blocks on the government's grand national public toilet map and thousands more unmapped and functioning public lavatories in Australia. Yet only this one in the minister's electorate was singled out by her for an upgrade in this year's budget. Does the minister stand by this allocation of taxpayers' funds or has she wiped her hands of it? Dr Southcott- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 98(c), a minister can only be questioned on matters of administration for which the minister is responsible to the House.",29
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Boothby raises a valid point of order. I suggest to the Chief Opposition Whip that he redirect that question to the relevant minister. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I can understand that there is some confusion on this matter, but the $10,000 grant being referred to is a tourism grant. The minister is being asked in her capacity as the minister for tourism.",29
78,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Small Business and Tourism may answer the question. FRAN BAILEY-In answer to the Chief Opposition Whip's question, this was an election commitment which this government honoured. While I am here, let me correct the point: it was not for a toilet block; it was lighting. This shows the opposition's level of concern for any advance of tourism in regional areas. Just as the constituents of my electorate of MCEwen benefited, so too did the constituents of the member for Lyons, who received $850,000 of an election commitment in exactly the same way. Forty-eight cents out of every tourism dollar is spent in regional areas. This government supports tourism in regional areas. Free Trade",29
79,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Trade. Can the minister inform the House how free trade contributes to alleviating poverty in developing countries? Can the minister also advise the House how Australia is contributing to freer world trade?,30
80,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Maranoa for his question and recognise his interest in both these issues, in terms of opening up world markets not just for Australian exporters but for the developing countries of the world to help generate more economic activity in their countries. Developed nations like Australia have a responsibility in that regard. Our government firmly believes that free trade is the single most effective tool for lifting people out of poverty, particularly in the developing world. We have backed this belief with action. We have opened our market to the 49 least developed countries in the world so that they can get tariff-free access for their exports into the Australian economy. As the Prime Minister said last week, much of the solution for the undeveloped world lies in a major reduction in agriculture trade barriers. It is one thing to provide debt forgiveness and to provide aid, but those issues will not work by themselves. We need to see trade liberalisation and the opening up of the markets of major wealthy countries of the world to the developing world. It is time for the major subsidisers, like the United States and the European Union, who spend over $US20 billion annually on support for agriculture, stood up to the protectionist forces within their countries and opened up their markets. They should follow the lead that is being taken and the example that is being set by British Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair. With the support of some northern European nations, he has refused to endorse the European Commission's budget-a budget which proposed to spend 40 per cent of their revenue on agricultural support, which would support five per cent of the European population, who produce less than two per cent of the EU's total output. We should support the stand taken by British Prime Minister Tony Blair in this regard. This type of agriculture protectionism must end. The leadership shown by Mr Blair is to be applauded. Again, it highlights his ability to show leadership on tough political issues. He did the same on the question of Iraq in recent years. He did the same when he was confronted with calls to roll back the Thatcher reforms on industrial relations. He resisted those calls. Mr Blair is a quality Labour leader who can show clear leadership when confronted with difficult issues. I would suggest that, as we go into the winter break and as the Labor Party drift into the winter break, the Leader of the Opposition could take a leaf out of his friend's book-the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair-and show some leadership. Lyndon Withdrawal Unit",30
81,Mr ANDREN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Could the minister assure the House that the Lyndon detoxification unit in Orange, which is still in a funding limbo despite the short-term and welcome assistance from the government last March, will receive the necessary funding to continue operations next financial year? What can the minister do to guarantee the in-principle funding agreement reached in April between state and federal authorities-and due for finalisation last May, on the 31st-will be finalised before Lyndon runs out of money on 30 June?",30
82,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Calare for his question. I appreciate the concern he has for this service. It is a concern that is shared by quite a number of members of this House, particularly the Deputy Prime Minister, who has made representations to me about this service. The government have extended the funding until 30 June. We are now working urgently with the New South Wales government to try to ensure that funding is provided so that the future of this excellent service is assured. Superannuation",31
83,Dr JENSEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. Is the minister aware of any proposals to increase-and I will repeat that: to increase-taxes on superannuation? Does the government agree with these propositions?,31
84,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Tangney. He is right to be concerned about reports that anyone would want to be increasing taxation on Australians' retirement incomes. Yesterday the OECD released a report, Ageing and employment policies: Australia, and in that it recommended that taxes on superannuation could be increased to discourage older people from leaving the work force. Specifically, it said ‘at least ject to less generous taxation rules'. I can understand it making that comment, because I can make allowances for the OECD being unaware that I announced in April of this year, of course, the Howard government's transition to retirement policy, which will allow workers to remain connected with the work force and to start to get access to their superannuation. What we cannot make allowances for is those who sit opposite who want to increase taxes on superannuation. It is a shame. It is an unmitigated mistake by the Labor Party to want to enforce upon the Australian public the retention of the super surcharge, at a cost of $2.5 billion over the next four years. Furthermore, they want not only to do that but also effectively to add another $4 billion in taxes by getting rid of the super co-contribution. This is something that Australians now have less than 10 days of this financial year to take advantage of. In other words, under the Howard government any worker earning under $58,000 in this financial year can put $1 into their superannuation, get $1.50 added on to it and make a big plus for their own retirement income. I am sure the member for Tangney will be telling his constituents about that and reminding them at the same time that it was only this week and last week that the Labor Party voted again to impose the super surcharge on Australian workers.",31
85,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Parliamentary Sittings",31
86,Mr EDWARDS,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Is the Speaker aware that the House is due to sit on 15 August, which is VP Day? Is the Speaker also aware of any plans to have the sitting for this day cancelled to allow members to attend services in their own electorates? Given the significance of this day to all Australians, subwill you, Mr Speaker, undertake on behalf of all members to ascertain an answer to this question and report back to the House before the House rises at the end of this week?",31
87,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Cowan. I believe the Leader of the House would like to respond. Mr Abbott- Mr Speaker, I think the member for Cowan raises a very good point. It is a very important day. I can appreciate that many members would wish to attend services in their electorates and elsewhere. That is a matter that the government will certainly have a look at and consider sympathetically. Mr Edwards-I thank the Leader of the House for that answer. Given the time constraints, Mr Speaker, could I ask through you whether the government would undertake to advise members at its earliest convenience as to the outcome of that particular matter.",32
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Cowan. I think that is a question better directed, again, to the Leader of the House. Mr Abbott-On indulgence, Mr Speaker, the decision has been made. Consider yourself in your electorate that day.",32
89,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I think the member for Cowan has his answer. Distinguished Visitors,32
90,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, during question time today, you invited the attention of the House to the visiting delegation from Cambodia. It struck me that there is a real contrast between the way this House greets distinguished visitors and the way if attending parliaments in other countries, are sometimes received. Mr Speaker, I wonder whether you might consider, consistent with standing orders, whether there could be some more formal acknowledgment on behalf of the House of the presence guished visitors, recognising that, when we visit other chambers, there is an occasion whereby members rise in their places and acknowledge the presence of a senior delegation of parliamentarians or other distinguished visitors in a way which is a little more reflecting of the significance of that occasion than is customary in this place?",32
91,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I think the member for Denison raises a very valid point. It is something I would like to discuss with the relevant committee of both government and opposition members. I think it certainly is worthy of some consideration. NA,32
92,Ms GILLARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation.",32
93,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the Manager of Opposition Business claim to have been misrepresented?,32
94,Ms GILLARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I most certainly do.,32
95,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,32
96,Ms GILLARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"In question time today, the Treasurer referred to me as ‘a fox' and asserted that I had not conducted the Labor caucus's media briefing today. I am taking the description ‘fox' as a compliment; I did not know the Treasurer cared. But his assertion that I did not conduct today's media briefing is simply untrue.

99,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Watson proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to provide an advocate for small business. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",33
100,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"When the Minister for Small Business and Tourism took on the portfolio, she made it clear that she thought there was one job in it: to be an advocate for small business. On 30 November last year, she said the minister for small business needs to be an advocate for small business. At the National Small Business Summit this year, during the great debate that was held there, she said that the best advocate for small business is the minister. This is not the line the Prime Minister ran a few minutes ago. The minister wanted to say that the small business minister was the best advocate going. Why is it, then, that this minister is completely unable to advocate for small business? We remember, for a start, that she does not sit in the cabinet meetings. During debate in this chamber on the different pieces of legislation that affect small business that have been introduced since she took on the for portfolio, how many has she spoken on? Not one. She has not made one attempt to make any contribution to any piece of legislation since taking on the small business portfolio. Today, she asks why we are asking her the question when we get to research and development. Fran Bailey interjecting",33
101,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, you did not stand up to answer it, Minister. I remind the minister of the article in the BRW magazine on the entrepreneurs round-table at which the minister and I were present. The conversation around the table was published in the May 12 to 18 edition of BRW magazine with the different comments made by me, the minister and the different people present. I am quoted as saying: The research and development-R&D-tax offset works on a sudden death system so the moment your turnover goes beyond $5 million you lose, immediately, the entire capacity to claim the tax offset in one year. That issue was put to the minister at the round-table and published in BRW magazine. I remind the minister that when you go through the press clippings you do not just read the bits that have your own name next to them. It is worth reading the detail in the whole article. Yet today she treats it as though it is the first time this issue has ever been heard of. If the issues that are published are not being noted, what chance does a local small business operator have of their voice being heard by this government? On the issue of unfair dismissal, the minister, in an answer today, said: ‘Oh, yeah. I know where the member for Watson is heading.' She then said that small business wants to see the end of go-away money. Fran Bailey-They do.",33
102,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right, Minister; this side of the House could not agree more. The key question is: why does go-way money occur? Fran Bailey interjecting",34
103,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The minister will have an opportunity to speak later.,34
104,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Does it occur because of a final decision of the commission? Go-away money does not occur because of final decisions. It occurs when the cost of compliance is too high. You do not get go-away money on the basis that you are sure you are going to lose the claim. Small businesses are consistently giving go-away money because they know it is too expensive to fight the claim. What is the response from this government to the issue that the minister has refused to respond to at all? The response is say: what we will do is get rid of the cheapest of the three jurisdictions where someone might lodge a claim. We will get rid of the one jurisdiction where you do not have to employ lawyers for a small business to be able to fight a claim. As was acknowledged yesterday by the member for Menzies, the claims go instead to unlawful dismissal. I acknowledge straight up that the genuine people will not do that. The genuine people who are unfairly dismissed will get honest legal advice, will be told that they do not technically have a case and will go off, having lost their livelihood. But the person with a vexatious claim, the person lodging a frivothe lous claim, will now be able to get go-away money like never before because they will not be looking straight down the barrel of the industrial commission, where you can represent yourself. What will happen now is that the small business operator facing a vexatious claim will be facing it in one of two forums. Either they will still have to go through all the conciliations but, instead of ending up in the industrial commission, they will end up in the Federal Court; or they will end up facing a common law settlementand you are right, they do not have to face the Federal Court; they get the compensation of the cheap jurisdiction of a state Supreme Court. Those are the only two options that this government then leaves small business with. If go-away money is the priority, then you do something about the procedures-you stop the compliance costs from being so high. Yet last year the member for Perth stood here and offered a whole series of procedural changes that could be made. What was the response from the government? Nothing-no response at all. I assume the minister remembers another MPI, although we were sitting at opposite sides of the table to so it has probably escaped her memory, just like the BRW conversation. In that MPI I again put forward those procedural changes to make the jurisdiction cheaper. Instead, the response from this government is to say to the honest person who is unfairly dismissed: ‘You have no formal legal recourse,' but to say to the people lodging vexatious and frivolous claims, ‘Go for your life.' The goaway money is paid because of the compliance cost. If the minister wants to argue-she did not take the chance in question time-that the Federal Court or a state Supreme Court is a cheaper jurisdiction for small business than industrial commission, she should go for it-make that argument. But unless the minister is willing to embrace the genuine problem that small business will face by the end of this year, as the government pursues its legislative program they will realise that what they have come up with and proclaimed as a solution is going to look hollow by the end of the year, when unfair dismissal claims from small business go to zero and unlawful dismissal claims go through the roof. That is the exact path that will be followed. The minister was asked that precise question about what was the cheaper jurisdiction in question time today and she either did not know or did not care. The minister has also claimed, as part of her fourth-term agenda for small business, that she wants to reduce red tape. I have to say that, yes, in the state parliament it got frustrating hearing the states always blaming the Commonwealth. I thought that, when I got here, the Commonwealth would always blame the states, and that came through. This minister takes it one step further. While adding layer upon layer, in 3,000 new levels of regulation that have been put through that affect small business-putting every extra of layer of red tape there-what is the response from this minister? Let's get stuck into local government. Local government becomes the answer. I have to say that there are compliance problems with local government. The opposition does not argue for one moment that there are not compliance costs in dealing with local government. But, for heaven's sake, don't start complaining about other people's problems when this government continues to make it worse for small business. If the minister believes that red tape has reduced over the life of this government: get up and say that, get up and claim that. The Prime Minister said on 11 February 1996: ‘We are committed to reducing the red tape that small business has to grapple with by 50 per cent in our first term.' If the minister lieves that promise has been kept, she will get her turn in a moment to stand up and say that. What did the Office of Small Business say when they were asked by Senator Lundy in Senate estimates: Can you take on notice to provide a list of all of the regulations that have been introduced in the last 12 months for small business and all of the regulations that have been removed in the last 12 months? The response from the Office of Small Business was: ‘That would be a fairly extraordinary request.' It went on. Senator Lundy asked: So who monitors the ebb and flow for the purposes of assessing red tape for small businessanybody? I would have thought that was the role of the Office of Small Business? The response from the Office of Small Business was: ‘I think that that would be a fairly large task.' If it is too large a task for the government to even count the regulations, how big a task is it for small business to have to live by them? How big a task is it for small business to have to function, trying to run a business and dealing with regulations, when the Office of Small Business says that it is too large a task to even count them? This government then introduce the new compliance burden in the way they have implemented choice in superannuation. It is not good enough for the government to simply look at this entirely from the perspective of, ‘We want to provide this to employees.' The added question is: why is it that, every time this government has a new idea, the compliance burden lands at the feet of small business? Why is it that, when they had an idea about how to change the tax system, the entire compliance burden landed at the feet of small business? Why is it that, when they have the idea of choice in superannuation, they decide that clearing houses can be run by small businesses-they can outsource bethem at a cost to small business? Or else they can have this really bizarre idea, which was referred to during the debate on super choice, where the default fund pays for it, which means that the only members of the fund who end up paying for the compliance cost of super choice are those employees who did not choose a different fund. They are the ones who end up with a compliance burden. The way this government has implemented super choice is appalling. The government have become fond of quoting MYOB. But they do not quote the question that Chris Knight from MYOB asked the minister at the National Small Business Summit: My guess is that the regulations have come through treasury, it's happened that way primarily because there just is not enough consultation with small business. It didn't really go past, I suspect, yourself and your division and I suspect COSBOA nowhere near enough. And what was the response from the minister, having been challenged by MYOB about the appalling way in which this had been implemented? Mr Gavan O'Connor interjecting",34
105,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Corio might think he is hiding, but I can hear him.",36
106,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister was challenged about the appalling way in which this government had left the compliance burden with small business. Her response was: ... it has been out there for a very long time, but this is something I have inherited. Fran Bailey-Give the rest of the quote.",36
107,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You want more? You are about to get more, I can tell you. Please come in spinner. I am not going to give you the entire speech, but I will keep reading for you: I can tell you that we have had a lot to do simplification of the formthat is the two-page form with the 55-page explanatory document for employees and the 16-page explanatory document for employers; that is the one you helped withand making sure that it's in as simple a form as possible but as I said earlier, look I readily acknowledge that there's an impost here. That acknowledgment has not been made inside the House. I acknowledge that you would probably have to speak on legislation to make that acknowledgment inside the House. Fran Bailey interjecting",36

You got the whole quotation in there, Minister. And let me make it clear that small business compliance and red tape is this minister's portfolio. Fran Bailey interjecting",36
110,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The minister will have the chance to read it in herself.,36
111,Mr BURKE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The red tape burden-the failure of the government to reduce red tape; in fact, they continue to increase it-is this minister's portfolio. It is time this minister fessed up and acknowledged that, if it is a problem for small business and you reckon you are the advocate for small business, then you make it your problem. You take on the responsibility-you do not shirk it-and you actually give small business the belief that there is someone out there fighting for them, someone who might not ever be in the House or in the cabinet room but who will at least take some level of responsibility. It is not with the good enough to have a portfolio by media release and, every time you are challenged about something being your responsibility, to dodge it by saying: ‘It's not my portfolio. Well, it's not. It's not. It's not.' That is the way the minister has chosen to handle this issue. This is the same ministeralthough I guess this is not in her portfolio either, as it affects small business-who wanted to fast track the collective bargaining laws which went through this House last year yet are still to be listed for debate in the ate. This is the fast tracking that the minister pushed for in the media. And this is the same minister who failed to intervene on the 25 per cent entrepreneurs tax offset. We believe home based businesses should be given a good go, and that is why we voted for it, but for the lives of us we cannot understand why the only test is a test of turnover. Why give a huge financial benefit to the retired accountant, the retired solicitor and the retired company executive and then punish the home seller, the person selling Enjo or Nutrimetics products? There is one simple test, which was put forward by the Prime Minister. If you want to see whether someone is an advocate, look at their record. The record of this minister is something to be ashamed of. Small businesses need an advocate, and they certainly do not have one sitting on the other side of the table.

112,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Member for Lingiari! I will deal with the member for Lingiari immediately if he comes in here with those stunts. The member for Oxley is in the same category. FRAN BAILEY (MCEwen-Minister for Small Business and Tourism) (3.25 pm)The antics of the opposition in both question time today and this MPI debate show a lack of understanding, a lack of commitment and a lack of any resolve to do anything on behalf of the 1.2 million small businesses in this country. Let me begin my response in this debate by reminding the shadow minister opposite, and those of his colleagues who have remained, that the former Labor leader Paul Keating said: The Labor party has given up the middle-class, middle-ground, sole-employer, self-employed and small business people. And he was right. The opposition has given Senup. In fact, to be quite honest, I do not think there has ever been any resolve on behalf of this opposition to do anything for small business, other than to come into this place and criticise, object to and try to demean anything that this government is doing for small business. Let me also put on the public record comments by the shadow minister. Referring to Mr Latham, he said: ‘Mark has started making noises that we needed to engage with small business. By and large, the engagement in the past wasn't what it should have been.' What an understatement that is! In the eight months that I have been in this position, I have travelled around the length and breadth of Australia. I have met a number of small business people in small country towns and in outer suburban areas. Mr Bowen interjecting",37
113,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Prospect is warned! FRAN BAILEY- Mr Deputy Speaker, this is all they are good for. They are only good for objecting. They show no commitment to small business whatsoever. Let me get on the record what small business people are saying to me as I travel around the country. The first thing that they want maintained is a good, strong economy. It does not matter how often the shadow minister comes in here and attacks and ridicules and is sarcastic; small business people and the 3.3 million Australians who are employed by small business people remember what it was like for small business under the Labor Party. There were business loans at 20.5 per cent. Compare that to today, when they are at 9.1 per cent. Home business loans have gone from 17 per cent down to 6.95 per cent. When we have such rapid growth of home based businesses occurring in this country, where two-thirds of our small business people have home based businesses, it is no wonder that as I move around the country small business people say to me, ‘Thank God we don't have the Labor Party in charge of government or running the economy, because we can't afford them.' You really do not have to think back all that far. When you go around the country towns, the suburban areas and the metropolitan areas today you see shopping centre strips that are full of small businesses employing people. No longer in our country towns do we see streets of vacant premises the way we did under Labor. The only thing the Labor Party did in relation to small busibillion ness when they were in office was to drive people out of small business and reduce the work force, especially in country towns. You only have to look at the unemployment level under Labor in December 1992, before we got into office, which was 10.9 per cent. has been halved to 5.1 per cent. In question time today-when we saw the antics of the shadow minister, who was deliberately asking questions that were not within the responsibility of this portfoliothe Prime Minister told this parliament that he is the best advocate for small business. Never was a truer statement made. The reason he is the best advocate for small business, and the reason small business people know that he is the best advocate for small business and that he is a minister who is prepared to stand up for small business, is that, unlike the opposition, he has been prepared to develop policy and actually put a plan into action. One of the issues that small business people constantly talk to me about is the action of the opposition in blocking the $21.7 billion of personal tax cuts. Does the opposition seriously think that small business people have not noticed the antics of the opposition in opposing those tax cuts? As the Treasurer said during question time today, the opposition still have not declared their hand on the tax schedules. Mr Burke interjecting",37
114,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Watson has had his opportunity. FRAN BAILEY-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Bevis-She needs all the protection she can get.",38
115,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Brisbane is similarly warned. FRAN BAILEY-I am quite capable of standing up for myself and for small business to the member opposite. In regard to the $1.8 of business tax cuts that were handed down in the budget, what have we heard from the opposition? They were absolutely silent. Yet again, we heard the shadow minister criticising the 25 per cent entrepreneurs tax discount. I ask you: who, other than the That opposition, would criticise 540,000 small businesses benefiting from $1.2 billion worth of tax cuts? Mr Downer-No-one. FRAN BAILEY-That is right: no-one but the opposition. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that no small business people or home based business people criticise it, because they know that this is a very genuine decision by the government to assist those fledgling small businesses and home based businesses that are getting started. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might be interested to know that one of these home based businesses, with a net income of $35,000, gets a tax rebate of $1,668. If that small business decided to invest that into a computer, a printer or something for their business then, on top of the rebate, they would get the tax deduction. As I said, there are 540,000 small business people, largely home based business people, benefiting from this. The shadow minister also attacked the government's plan to reduce red tape. What on earth has the opposition ever come up with by way of policy development? Zero. Absolutely zero. Somehow or other the shadow minister decided to portray the $50 million regulation reduction incentive fund as an attack on local government. Nothing could be further from the truth. That shows his ignorance about small business, because anyone who has been involved with small business and who understands the needs of small business knows that when someone wants to start up a small business or expand their small business the first level of government that they interact with is local government. A young woman came to me and said that she wanted to start up a home based hairdressing business-but she had to complete 28 forms. Surely those days should be long behind us. I can advise the House that for the past or seven months we have been working very hard indeed in the Office of Small Business through demonstrator programs with local government authorities. They are more than prepared to assist and work with the government. Local government authorities want to reform their practices and reduce red tape, because they understand that this is a compliance cost on small business. Out of these demonstrator programs we have identified a number of ways in which small business can improve-for example, in the area of planning. People should be able to track where their planning permit is. They should be able to do this electronically. They should be able to see exactly where their application is in the process-and it should not take six months or more, as it does in many cases, which is a disincentive for small business to invest. The next issue which the shadow minister raised was in regard to industrial relations. He made a point of trying to portray the unfair dismissal legislation which catches small business now as something that small business is not really concerned about. According to him, the real issue is unlawful dismissal. I can tell you that, at every small business that I have visited in the years that I have been a member of this parliament, one of the first issues that they raise with me is unfair dismissal, because the problem of ‘go away' money is very significant. It is all very well for the shadow minister to sit in here and nod his head and then for him and his colleagues to not support the legislation that we have before this parliament. Of course, the shadow minister is continuing a very long Labor trend. While I have been a member of this parliament we have introduced, on 42 separate occasions, exemptions from unfair dismissal for small business. On 42 occasions that has been defeated by the Australian Labor Party. I can also tell six you that small business know this. They know who is opposing any real reform. They know who is opposing them in being able to have that certainty about employing people. We have only got to go back to the Sensis survey in February. What was the hesitancy factor identified by those smalland medium-sized businesses that were interviewed? It was their fear of the unfair dismissal legislation. It is actively causing those smalland medium-sized businesses to not want to employ people. I notice the shadow minister is still nodding his head. It begs the question: as he pretends to support these reforms for small business, why doesn'the convince his leader and his caucus to actually do something about it and support the government? We know that the new workplace relations arrangements, which are part of the policy developed by this government, will provide the flexibility that small business needs. They will lead to higher productivity and they certainly will lead to higher wages. The shadow minister was quoting COSBOA recently in this debate. Tony Stevens, the Deputy Chairman of COSBOA, had this to say about the IR reform: We believe it will provide small businesses with an opportunity to grow … We're happy with it, absolutely. That is what the small business community is saying. It really supports what this government is trying to do. There are many other people, of course, who have come out and put on the record that they support what the government is doing. The range of measures in the last budget that was handed down was absolutely fantastic for small business: support and assistance, mentoring programs, succession planning, and the importance of a business plan. It is this government that is actively putting these policies into action. In other words, it is really developing an entrepreneurial culture. The business.gov.au site is absolutely fantastic. But, in the time left, let us see what Labor have proposed for small business. They want a national payroll tax. They want compulsory small business redundancy payments. They want to abolish AWAs. They want trade unions to have a greater role in the running of small business and they support the automatic right of entry into a small business site. They want small business to be able to negotiate on behalf of small business in the amendments to the Trade Practices Act that we will be bringing in with regard to collective bargaining. They have no commitment. (Time expired)",38
116,Mr MURPHY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I remind the Minister for Small Business and Tourism that the matter of public importance before the chair today is the failure of the government to provide an advocate for small business. Fran Bailey-You failed to make your case.,40

You went through the history of Paul Keating and Bob Hawke; it was not relevant to the motion before the chair. The motion before the chair, Minister, was the failure of the government to provide an advocate for small business. Then you moved on to our position of blocking the tax cuts. We are very proud to block the tax cuts because, on your side, you are very happy to reward the highincome earners",40
125,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Lowe will desist in using the word ‘you'.,41
126,Mr MURPHY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am making the point, Mr Deputy Speaker, that on that side the minister stands with the government to reward people, like ourselves, on high incomes-over $100,000-by giving them 10 times the amount of tax relief than someone who is on a lower, smaller income. You come in here and defend that and you have got the hide to come in here and make a point",41

We supported the bill but she did not deal with the substantive issues that the member for Watson raised. The minister waffled on about the red tapeFran Bailey interjecting",41
131,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Minister!,41
132,Mr MURPHY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"and said, ‘What are the opposition going to do'? The minister did not respond to the issues raised by the member for Watson in relation to red tape. The minister went on and on and on, talking about how this government supports small business. Minister, you have probably heard me say many times how this government looks after big business. You only have to look at your agenda in relation to media ownership in this country. You want to look after the two biggest media companies in Australia. I will say no more about that today; I will say something at another time when the bill comes into the House. It is quite scandalous that you have been absent from the debate regarding many of the superannuation, industrial relations and tax changes that will have an impact on small business. The shadow minister for small business has just correctly pointed out that it is unacceptable that small business people in Australia apparently have no advocate within the Howard government. We know that on 1 July the government's highly complex changes to the way small business pays its employer superannuation will begin. The 500,000 small business employees across Australiaincluding those in my electorate of Lowe in Sydney's inner west-will have to make sure that every employee has received a super choice form before 29 July 2005, or penalties will apply. They will then have two months to deal with the forms. They must have a default fund in case staff do not return the form. Employees will be able to change their fund every 12 months. If a super fund merges with another fund, employers will have to reissue the super choice form within 28 days. That is a lot of red tape, and this all adds up to a nightmare for small business. I understand that the minister, to her credit, has recognised that super choice will be an impost on small business, but she has failed to respond to the small business sector's call to be made exempt from this legislation. Mr Kelvin Thomson-That's right.",41
133,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Wills must know that he has been warned already. I warn him that one more peep and he will be gone.,41
134,Mr MURPHY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"With typical arrogance and contempt, the Howard government voted against Labor's amendments that would have made this legislation fairer for small business. Instead, it has ensured that local small business owners will face hefty fines or jail terms for inadvertently advising employees on which superannuation fund to join. The shadow minister has pointed out correctly the adverse impacts that the government's unfair dismissal changes and its research and development tax offset changes will have on small business. That said, today I will focus on the horrible missed opportunity that has eventuated with the government's 25 per cent entrepreneurs tax offset to benefit business operators selling products. The minister has just glossed over that. Home based small businesses now total more than one million people Australia wide-and there are many in my electorate of Lowe. These home based businesses are a critical group in the community, and there is a growing concern about the people who are running them. Sometimes, Minister, they are franchisees. Many franchises are run as small home based businesses now. Sometimes they are start-up businesses that people themselves have organised. But, whichever way they work, these businesses are a group that is worthy of assistance-and there is no argument about that from this side of the House. Many home based businesspeople across my electorate of Lowe, from Drummoyne to Homebush West, have complained to me and to my electorate staff. It is a fact that many of these home based operators endure very high input costs, and the clear expectation was that the government would seize the initiative in this year's budget to provide tax relief to these battlers. Quite frankly, I do believe that the government has any real insight into the plight of small businesses operating from home; that is my personal view. While the opposition was pleased to support this change, it is clear that the government does not understand the impact this will have on many home based businesses which have high input costs and which have missed out on this much-needed tax relief. It is a fact that a 25 per cent tax offset is pitched towards those people running a business that has low input costs. But I ask the minister: what about those people who run home based businesses that have high input costs? It is clear that the government prefers those who want to sell services to those who want to sell products. These are the consultants and the retired professionals, to whom the member for Watson referred, who might undertake part-time work from home. Clearly they are the government's favoured clients. I say to the minister: not all home based businesses are run by consultants or retired professionals. I ask: what about the mums and dads who sell Tupperware, Bessemer, Amway, Nutrimetics and other products? Mr Quick-Enjo.",42
135,Mr MURPHY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Enjo. I will tell you what happens to them. They get slugged both ways on their turnover by this government. They shoulder the heavy burden of high input costs and the government expects them to carry the grandstand and flogs them by disqualifying them from the discount. I ask the minister: where is the justice in that? What is fair about that? The minister did not address that issue. Minister, what about those who think they have struck it lucky and receive a tax break and who have always done their own tax? They will have to find an accountant because understanding the tax offset is a very complicated matter. They will not find out quickly that the government expects them to be happy to pay the extra accountancy fees so they can then claim the discount. These matters in the MPI are very serious and there are serious concerns about the complexity of the system, as it has been proposed. Many people who run home based businesses do their own BAS statements and tax returns, as generally the number of their inputs and the amount of their paperwork are small enough. Trying to avoid the expense of using an accountant encourages people in these situations to complete their own paperwork. Generally they do not employ anyone, although sometimes they do and often they hope to do so in the future. But at this stage, by and large-for the benefit of the minister-the 25 per cent entrepreneurs tax offset will hit them while they are not yet functioning as employers. We must remember that the limits of $50,000 at the beginning of the phase-out and $75,000 at the end are not profit figures but turnover figures. There will be some instances where employees are involved but, more often than not, we are talking about sole operators. So my concern in this afternoon's MPI is with complexity. Why should people have to go from one situation where they do not need to use an accountant to a situation where they have no choice but to employ an accountant? How much monetary benefit will they receive relative to the cost of accessing the scheme and getting the clear and unambiguous advice they need to understand it? (Time expired)",42
136,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Snowdon interjecting",43
137,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Lingairi is warned!,43
138,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Having listened to the debate that has come from those opposite, I find the idea that the opposition purports to paint itself as a party that is interested in small business an absolute joke. This is a party that is dedicated to and owned by the trade union movement. The trade union movement's main aim in life is to interact with big business in order to dragoon employees into its membership for the purpose of taking fees to fund its political wing, the ALP. The trade union movement is totally opposed to small business. It wants to turn small business tradesmen who are contractors into employees so that, once again, it can capture them and take their money for the purposes of employing a political party. The idea that somehow we can have the opposition stand up and say that this government is not an advocate for small business is truly nonsensical. The Prime Minister said it very well at question time: he is the best advocate for small business. He with his government, of which the minister is part and parcel, is a strong and effective advocate for small business. Let us take a look at the record of what we have done. The first thing we have done is introduce a successful, growing economy where productivity is continually on the rise. We have introduced low interest rates. We have introduced a system where people have the freedom to exercise their opportunity to go into business for themselves. The passage of the new industrial relations reforms will take away the disincentives for small business people with regard to employment. The opening spokesman for the opposition admitted the existence of go-away money, and that is the first time. I have heard the opposition actually admit that go-away money is a reality. We have been saying for a long time that this has been a disincentive to employers and that employers who are caught by the unfair dismissal laws will simply pay people to go away, because it is too expensive, in both time and money, to fight what have become unfair claims against good employers. So making these legislative changes means that those people will be freed from that harassment and will be willing to employ more people, whereas, hitherto, they have found those laws a disincentive to so do. I was most encouraged to hear the member for Lowe say that it was unfair to remember Paul Keating. I tell you: there is not one small business person in the country who does not recall the 20-plus per cent interest rates that were forced upon small business people by former Prime Minister Keatingwho was Treasurer before that-who said, ‘This is the recession we had to have.' We on this side of the House-this government-say that recession is something that is behind us with the Labor Party. We have been interested in growth, in seeing the economy succeed, and in bringing in policies that have enabled individuals to use their talent so that both they and the economy as a whole can prosper. The result of those policies has been that the growth in small business-and the definition of that is people who have 20 or fewer employees-has grown at a rate of 3.5 per cent, as opposed the growth in businesses of 200 or more employees, which have grown at a rate of 2.5 per cent. Something like 700,000 people are involved in at-home businesses where there is a single operator. We brought in a program that has meant that small business gets opportunities-government-provided opportunities-which have never been seen before. For instance, we have just brought in $1.8 billion worth of tax cuts, which the minister mentioned. They will be effective over the next four years and include the removal of the three per cent tariff on business inputs, and the provision of tax relief for ‘black hole' expenditure to allow small businesses to write off many establishment expenses such as feasibility studies. From 1 July, proximately 540,000 small businesses will benefit from a $1.2 billion tax cut, through the 25 per cent entrepreneurs tax discount. Distinct from what was argued on the other side of the House, this is not a complicated exercise. It is designed to assist those people who are in the simplified tax system and have a turnover of $50,000 a year or less. It will give them a tax benefit which they will be able to use to grow their business and hopefully see their turnover grow past $75,000, which is the cut-off point for that benefit to apply to them. The government have reduced company taxes from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. We have substantially reformed the capital gains tax, introducing specific small business capital gains tax concessions. That is very important, because so many small business people use the growth of the capital investment in their small business as their own superannuation. Making those concessions for small business is most important to the quality of life of those people when they retire. It is quite interesting, by the way, to take a look at the retirement ages of people into volved in small business. People who are employed in large corporations such as banks and insurance companies are the people who retire earlier. Those are the employers that we have targeted as a government to see if they can keep mature age people in the work force longer, to gain from the benefit of that expertise. If you are a sole employer, are self-employed or are employed by small business, statistically you will stay in the work force a good number of years longer than somebody who is employed by a large corporation. So that concession on capital gains tax is a very important point to them. We have, of course, reduced the income tax rates, with the first band of tax going down from 17 per cent to 15 per cent. We ap- have moved the thresholds for the 42 per cent tax rate and the 47 per cent marginal tax rate. But, of course, whether this is applied from 1 July this year is contingent upon the Labor Party making up its mind whether or not it will disallow the schedules that are presently in the Senate. They have been there for four sitting days. You have 15 sitting days to do something about it. Hopefully the commissioner will be reassured by the fact that you have done nothing already, and will allow the schedules to apply to give some certainty to small business employers. They are the people who would be most inconvenienced by the denial of those schedules. Denial of those tax laws would put them, for the first two months before we take control of the Senate and are able to pass the laws, in the situation where their employees would not be able to recoup that tax until the end the financial year. As a government, we have assisted those 1.2 million small businesses. We have acknowledged the fact that there are 3.3 million employees who represent 47 per cent of non-agricultural private sector employment. We recognise that they represent 27 per cent of all business turnover. In other words, what we represent on this side of the House is advocacy for the entrepreneurial skills and the ambition of individuals who want to take advantage of their talent and the opportunities that a working and growing economy offers and make a substantial investment for their own future in terms of establishing their own business, of having the enjoyment of being their own employer and of providing an enormous amount of employment for workers in those small businesses. For the Labor Party to come in here and try and say that this government is not an advocate for small business or has failed to give small business an advocate is truly a ludicrous proposition. I repeat: the Labor Party is the party of doing deals with big business through its trade union ownership. It is dedicated to seeing collective outcomes. It is not the slightest bit interested in individuals who are the people who go into business for themselves. This government makes laws for people so that they can use their skills, so that the economy can benefit as a whole and so that more and more people can gain jobs. The net result is that we see the lowest unemployment figures that we have seen for decades. That is largely because of the growth of the small business sector, which has been made possible essentially because we have run a good economy which allows opportunity by having low interest rates and low inflation and because of the policies that we have brought into play to get rid of laws which have acted as a hindrance to the successful of outcome of an individual's zeal to be someone who can use their talents and benefit themselves and the nation.",43

149,Mr RUDDOCK,CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill, the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005, amends the Criminal Code Act 1995, the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 and the Crimes Act 1914. On 13 October 2003, the Australian government announced a $20 million package of measures to combat trafficking in persons. Many measures from that package have already been implemented. An important part of the 2003 package was a thorough legislative review. The review carefully analysed Australia's antitrafficking laws to identify what changes were needed to fully and comprehensively criminalise trafficking in persons. This bill is the result of that review and represents part of the government's demonstrated and continued commitment to the fight against trafficking in persons. The bill incorporates many of the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and comprehensively criminalises all aspects of trafficking in persons by introducing a number of new and extended trafficking in persons offences. It creates specific offences where the trafficker transports the victim into or out of Australia by using force, threats or deception. It also creates new trafficking offences that do not specify a means of trafficking but require the perpetrator to be reckless as to whether the victim will be exploited. The new trafficking offences carry a penalty of 12 years imprisonment. An aggravated trafficking offence applies where a victim is also exploited, subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, or endangered. The aggravated offence carries a tougher penalty of 20 years imprisonment and is comparable to penalties for kidnapping and serious assault. The new trafficking in children offences are also punishable by a tougher penalty of 25 years imprisonment. This reflects the particularly repugnant nature of trafficking in children. The protective regime for child witnesses and complainants in part IAD of the Crimes Act 1914 will apply to proceedings for trafficking offences. The bill also creates new offences for trafficking in persons activities that occur wholly within Australia. The domestic trafficking offences will ensure that each and every participant in the ‘chain' of exploitation of the victim can be prosecuted for that participation. The domestic trafficking offence is punishable by 12 years imprisonment, with a higher penalty of 20 years imprisonment for the aggravated offence where the victim is also exploited, subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, or endangered. The bill also introduces the offence of debt bondage. This offence prevents traffickers from using unfair debt contracts and other similar arrangements to force victims into providing sexual services or other labour to pay off large debts supposedly incurred by the trafficker in transporting the victim. Legitimate employment arrangements that are not exploitative or unfair are not captured by this offence. The debt bondage offence has a penalty of 12 months imprisonment, with an aggravated offence where the victim is under the age of 18 years. A tougher penalty of two years imprisonment for the child offence reflects the abhorrence of forcing a child into debt bondage. The bill also extends an existing offence to capture traffickers who induce victims to provide sexual services by deceiving them about the conditions of their employment. To ensure law enforcement and anticorruption agencies can effectively investigate and prosecute these heinous acts, the bill provides that telecommunications interception warrants are available under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 for the investigation of the new offences. People trafficking is a growing form of transnational crime that is receiving increasing attention throughout the world. Australia has a moral obligation to ensure that it has every possible measure in place to fight the trade in human beings and to investigate and prosecute traffickers. The bill is a significant step. It ensures that Australia meets its obligations under the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children. Once this bill is passed, the Australian government will be able to meet its commitment to ratify the protocol. The offences ensure that all aspects of trafficking in persons are criminalised in Australia-from the use of deception to recruit a trafficking victim, through to the transportation of a victim to or from Australia by the use of threats, force or deception, through to receipt and exploitation of a victim. The new offences complement Australia's existing package of measures and will ensure that Australia remains a world leader in the fight against trafficking in persons. I commend the bill to the House and I present what I am told is a revised explanatory memorandum to the bill. Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately.",46
150,Mr MCCLELLAND,CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT,"The Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005 is important legislation, and it is fully supported by the opposition. It is, as the Attorney-General indicated, about the protection of the vulnerable and, in the various instances that the Attorney-General outlined, indeed provides for additional penalties if children are involved. Trafficking, as the Attorney-General indicated, is not a new crime but it is becoming more prevalent as the world increasingly opens up borders towards the freer movement of goods and people. As we globalise, so do the criminals. Criminal activity is never more reprehensible than when it exploits the vulnerable. Sex trafficking, in particular, is a serious problem throughout the European Community, where unscrupulous gangs are preying on vulnerable women from countries in eastern Europe and Russia-countries which are still suffering economic decline-for use as sex slaves. In the United Kingdom, even, the Solicitor General-and I assume it is still the same Solicitor General-has stated that an estimated 80 per cent of prostitutes in London are foreign. As she says, the idea that these women have chosen to sell sex is clearly wrong, indicating that there is pressure on them. Recently, too, the United States Department of State identified the possible emergence of sex trafficking in Singapore, despite that country having what we would regard as a very strong lawenforcement culture. It is also clearly a problem in Australia. There is debate as to how extensive that problem is; nonetheless, it is clearly a problem. Women who are trafficked as sex slaves often work illegally, possibly with the wrong type of visa or even with no visa at all. Regrettably, in the past some criminals may have escaped prosecution because immigration officials deported the victims of these crimes before they could give evidence. These measures, at least partly, as well as a change in culture will do a considerable amount to prevent that occurring in the future. The bottom line is that even if this bill were only to stop one woman or one child from enduring the horrors of being trafficked as a sex slave, it would still be worthwhile. If properly enforced-and I accept the government's commitment-it will of course be far more effective than that. The provisions relating to the trafficking in persons offences are not limited exclusively to trafficking for the purpose of sexual services but also include trafficking in instances where someone is using force or the threat of force to achieve the entry or receipt of a person into Australia. This bill would also, for example, make deceptive conduct in recruiting a person to work in the sex industry illegal and punishable by imprisonment of seven years, or nine years for an aggravated offence. The offence of debt bondage is also introduced and is a most welcome measure. Again, we welcome the fact that in the case of minors there are additional penalties. Debt bondage measures will cover all workers no matter what industry they are in. Debt bondage is effectively serfdom, where a person is so economically dependent on another because of indebtedness that they are deprived of their freedom to work elsewhere. We have seen this insidious phenomenon in the actions of people smugglers who, it has been reported, frequently paid the passage of people to Australia only to make them economically dependent-effectively placing them in a situation of debt bondage for some years while they paid off the debt for that transporing tation to Australia. We have also seen unscrupulous employers who have effectively resurrected the concept of serfdom in Australia, taking advantage of vulnerable citizensall too frequently noncitizens from South East Asia, in particular. Poverty has driven those people to move to Australia perhaps unlawfully, and the mere fact of their unlawfulness has made them the most vulnerable. The bill significantly strengthens existing laws to enable enforcement agencies to deal with some of these transnational scourges. There are already clearly a number of people-smuggling offences in the Migration Act and in the Criminal Code. For example, the Migration Act includes the offence of bringing an unlawful noncitizen or a group of such persons to Australia. There are also ther offences that have been added to the Criminal Code with the passage of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (People Smuggling, Firearms Trafficking and Other Measures) Act 2002. These offences apply to what might be called international smuggling-for example, to the smuggling of people into a foreign country, whether or not via Australia. The new people-smuggling offences are in general based on the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, which has been called ‘the smuggling protocol'. While many people all too frequently attack the role of the United Nations-and it was a mantra of the One Nation Party-the reality is that it has played an important role in combating international crime generally and also the phenomenon of people-smuggling. To combat the growing phenomenon of transnational crime, the United Nations adopted a Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, which was supplemented by the United Nations Trafficking Protocol. The government has indicated its intention to ratify the UN TraffickProtocol once this legislation is in place and the requirements of the protocol are brought into effect. We commend that course of action. The bill was derived from a transnational response to organised crime. Some years ago the United Nations adopted a Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, which Australia signed in 2000. Out of that convention, a protocol to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons, especially women and children, was established. It was signed by Australia in 2002. Not only are those international treaties and protocols relevant to the background of the legislation but valuable work was undertaken more recently by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, which fur- has a statutory responsibility to examine trends and changes in the method and practice of criminal activity. The joint committee's report, Inquiry into the trafficking of women for sexual servitude, made nine recommendations to the government. Those recommendations included a review of the adequacy of existing provisions in the Criminal Code dealing with the recruitment, transportation and transfer of women for the purpose of trafficking; an amendment to section 270.7 of the Criminal Code, which deals with deceptive recruiting for sexual services, to broaden the offence to include deception regarding the kind of services to be provided, whether of a sexual nature or not; and that all trafficked women accepted onto the victims support program or receiving the criminal justice stay visa be exempt from compulsory return to their country of origin. This is an important measure to adopt that culture. All too frequently, the deportation process occurred before the criminal investigation process could be completed. By way of some complaint, we do believe that there has been inadequate consultation to properly implement this regime. Ordinarily bills that create or amend federal crimes are referred to the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. That is obviously for good reason. The aim of that Model Criminal Code Officers Committee is to develop uniform national criminal laws. If the Commonwealth does something that impacts on or has the potential to impact on the criminal law of the states, then it is obviously very important to consult with those state governments. But we understand this did not happen in respect of this bill, at least in genesis. We hope greater consultation has occurred more recently. We note in particular that this bill is primarily directed towards preventing the trafficking of women and children for the purpose of prostitution. The government chose, at least originally, not to consult with the very level of government that regulates prostitution and we hope that has been redressed. Indeed, we think broader consultation with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission would also have been appropriate, given the vulnerabilities of those the legislation is intended to protect. That lack of consultation has been remedied somewhat by the Senate committee process, instigated by Labor. I do not recall our being criticised by the government in instigating that committee process. Again I flag the very valuable work of the parliamentary committee system and in particular of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, which made 13 substantive recommendations in relation to the bill. Seven of the recommendations have now been incorporated into the bill, and Labor welcomes these additional measures. A further two measures were partially adopted by the government, while three measures have been rejected. Recommendation 8 in the committee's report should be flagged for further attention. It relates to the inclusion of servile marriage in the bill. However, it was recognised that this may have been beyond the scope of the bill because its effect in relation to the Marriage Act is unclear. Labor also accepts that this recommendation of the committee is perhaps too large in its effect to be accommodated in the bill, but it is a topic that should be further examined. We reserve the right to determine whether this type of conduct should be made illegal and, if so, by its what means. I think most members who have served in this House will have seen at some time in their electoral offices situations of real concern with respect to compelled marriages. In noting our concern, we should respect cultures and cultural practices, but all cultures in turn-in accordance with international human rights standards that apply to all human beings-should respect the fundamental and equal dignity of every man and, in particular, every woman in respect of the choice of married partner. A further recommendation that also requires future examination is the inclusion of non-commercial exploitation of adults. The government has put it to the opposition that, while this may be amoral, it is not desirable or practicable to make that conduct illegal. We recognise there are some arguments to that effect, and we do recognise the complexities, but we nonetheless think that this matter should be explored further. We do not want to hold up these other important and significant measures contained in this legislation for the sake of this one recommendation given, as the Attorney-General indicated, that the non-commercial exploitation of children has been criminalised in the legislation. The majority of recommendations from the committee are supported by both sides of parliament and have been incorporated in the bill. I will not list them-they are obviously on the public record-but, significantly, they include among their number three measures: the inclusion of non-commercial exploitation of children-as I have indicated, significantly adopted; the inclusion of the offence of debt bondage, which I have described, as did the Attorney-General in his second reading speech; and the strengthening of the criminal definitions and extension of the Crimes Act to offences against division 271 of the trafficking legislation. In addition, the government has added new offences to cover instances of trafficking from Australia to other countries. This is a common sense measure and is supported by the opposition. The government has also increased the maximum sentence for trafficking in children, as the Attorney indicated, from 22 to 25 years to bring it into line with slavery offences. Again, given the extreme vulnerability of children, it is something that we applaud. There are, however, two amendments that Labor would like to pursue and we will be doing so. They are, firstly, an amendment to ensure that section 270.7(1A)(c)(ii) and section 271.8(2)(c)(ii) cover instances where trafficking victims are deceived in a language other than English. We think that this is a common sense measure that all members of the House would support. We also have an amendment for the purpose of enabling victim impact statements so that the victims of this disgraceful crime can have their say in court after a conviction is handed down. We think these measures are important. In particular, the opportunity for victim statements has become an important part of the modern criminal justice system. Labor would like to see this become a part of the court process, with the choice of participating at the discrewhereas tion of the victim. We will move these amendments in the Senate process and therefore commend this bill to the House.",48
151,Mr WAKELIN,CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to support the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005. I thought it might be useful to remind the House of the global context of trafficking and smuggling. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission estimates that there are possibly 700,000 to four million people trafficked annually worldwide. The trafficking takes place for a variety of purposes, including domestic service, forced marriage and sweatshop labour. Forced sex work is the most visible end result of trafficking, especially in developed countries such as Australia, but there is no evidence that it is the most common. To define the difference between trafficking and smuggling, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime explains it this way: In some respects, trafficking in persons resembles the smuggling of migrants ... but there are several important differences. The smuggling of migrants, while often undertaken in dangerous or degrading conditions, involves migrants who have consented to the smuggling. Trafficking victims, on the other hand, have either never consented or, if they initially consented, that consent has been rendered meaningless by the coercive, deceptive or abusive actions of the traffickers. Another major difference is that smuggling ends with the arrival of the migrants at their destination, whereas trafficking involves the ongoing exploitation of the victims in some manner to generate illicit profits for the traffickers. From a practical standpoint, victims of trafficking also tend to be more severely affected and in greater need of protection from re-victimization and other forms of further abuse than are smuggled migrants. Finally, smuggling is always transnational, trafficking may not be. Trafficking can occur regardless of whether victims are taken to another country or only moved from one place to another within the same country. Previous speakers have covered pretty well the general intention of the bill. It is not my intention to speak at any great length, other than to welcome the government action on this. It is worth making the point about what actually happens to a victim in trafficking. The explanatory memorandum says: For example, the victim may enter into a debt arrangement with the trafficker so that the victim will provide sexual services in Australia in return for paying off a ‘debt' incurred because the trafficker arranged for the victim's travel to Australia. The trafficker may deceive the victim that they only owe a $2,000 debt for their travel to Australia. However, once the trafficking victim arrives in Australia the trafficker tells the victim that owe $10,000 and must provide the sexual services for a longer period of time to pay off the debt. That is just one scenario that is described, but it makes the point of why this legislation has become increasingly important. The legislation deals with the impact on minors and a range of other issues, including debt bondage. There is a list of terminology to guide practitioners, those who need to understand this act, and the parliament. The consequential amendments deal with telecommunications interception et cetera. I have watched the unfolding story in the media in recent years of this very ugly trade. I suppose I am left with the impression, perhaps similar to many average Australians, that it is very hard to understand how anyone could think of exploiting anyone else in this way. Perhaps it is a different culture. I hope it is foreign to this nation. It is a reminder that we must always be vigilant. This parliament can take great pride in being part of the constant vigilance needed to give people at least the basics of decent protection and to set some standards and general guidelines which will allow our regulators, our enforcement people and anyone with responsibilities in this area-from the minister, to the chamber and to the parliament-to see some improvement in this horrific trade.",51
152,Mr KERR,CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT,"This legislation before the House, the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005, is important, welcome and worthy. That, I think, acknowledges the reality that many persons in the community-not simply parliamentarians-have spent a very long period of time raising awareness of the fact that slavery, although largely abolished in the forms that we thought of it historically, still is very much a fact of life in many parts of the globe. In some senses and in some places slavery is they actually very similar to the kind that we associate with the slave trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, where people were trafficked from one continent to another and forced to work in degrading circumstances. In the Australian context it is relatively unthinkable that such a practice could occur. Nonetheless, we know, sadly, that there have been instances where people have been trafficked into this country to work in the sex industry. Some of those persons have been abused. They have been held in conditions which amount to imprisonment. They have been exploited. They have been tricked or mistreated in the way in which they have been recruited. We have not had effective laws in place to deal with those circumstances. It is to the merit of the government that ultimately this legislation has come forward. To put the matter in the larger context, this legislation has required an enormous amount of massaging to reach the form in which it is now brought forward. In the form in which it was first introduced it would certainly have failed to meet the task that the Australian community would wish the parliament to address. It was only after a Senate inquiry process and other joint committee processes, where a substantial number of amendments were ultimately agreed on and incorporated into this legislation, that we could be confident that the islation actually does address Australia's ternational obligations so that we can not only sign with confidence and ratify the United Nations antitrafficking protocol but also, more importantly, satisfy those Australians who are concerned that we do nothing to prevent this country being an end point where women can be trafficked and used to generate money through the sex trade. Unless they do so voluntarily, we should make certain that that cannot occur. This legislation ultimately comes forward against that very long backdrop. I have taken part in the inquiry of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission that this parliament established, which looked at this kind of offence. My colleagues on that committee raised a number of very significant concerns. Some of those concerns related to the legislation. Others related to the practices of the Austraable; lian Federal Police and Centrelink to make certain that persons rescued out of the clutches of those who may have trafficked them are properly protected and not immediately returned to circumstances where they may be in harm's way. I am not entirely confident that all of those protocol arrangements have been worked out in a way which will be ultimately satisfying. I know that the government has picked up a number of those recommendations or responded to a number of those concerns. I would hope that we actually do not end up in a circumstance henceforth where what used to be routine continues. What used to be routine was that if somebody trafficked into this country was becoming troublesome for a brothel operator they would, through a third party or themselves, contact the department of immigration. There would be an immigration raid. The person who was unlawfully in Australia-because they would not have the proper visa or they legwould have outstayed their visa, they were inworking when they should not have been working and they were working in the sex industry-would be put in detention and removed from the country almost within a week or less. Sometimes they would be moved back to circumstances where they would be retrafficked or where they would go missing. Plainly that was an abuse of their human rights. When people do come forward and make allegations of impropriety in this area, it is very important not only that the law as it is written supports them but also that practices are in place to make sure that people are not put back into danger; that they are properly and adequately provided for within Australia; that there is proper financial means available to meet their living requirements; that they are protected as they move from an area where they have been exploited and vulnerthat they can give evidence, if that may be necessary, against those who have exploited them; and that they are protected after that. If, for reasons unconnected with their experience-if the person against whom the prosecution is brought dies, or leaves the country-a prosecution cannot proceed, they still have to be protected. The obligation to protect people in those circumstances does not end. The fear that our response was rather too limited to people who were in those circumstances was one of the things that particularly concerned members of the Australian Crime Commission's parliamentary oversight body when we were looking at this. Whilst the legislation has been amended substantially and improved, and I understand the government has taken into account a number of these practical concerns that were raised in other committee proceedings including the ones which I served on, I still down a note of caution for members of this House and for the government advisers that we are not going to take our eyes off this ball. There will be further examinations in the future of the way in which this legislation is being implemented. I hope that we do not find that previous indifferent practice towards those who have worked in the sex industry and have been violated and abused by it, where they require our protection and are not receiving it. I hope that good faith can relied on to ensure that that does not happen. In response to the legislation, my colleague the member for Barton indicated that the opposition was to move two amendments. Those were amendments which commended themselves to the opposition and were highlighted in the Senate debate but it now transpires, after discussion with the government's advisers, that the amendment that addresses the circumstance where deception of a person to come to Australia occurs in a language other than English has been covered off by the way in which the legislation has been drafted. The proposed amendment that the member for Barton intended to move will not be proceeded with. We thank the government for having picked up the point that Senator Ludwig raised in that debate. Senator Ludwig's very careful examination of the various measures, including his work on the Senate legal and constitutional committee, and later in debate on the amendments that he proposed for this bill, should be acknowledged in the House. He pointed out that as the bill was later presented, after the amendments, it still did not deal adequately with the offence of deceptive recruiting for sexual services. Senator Ludwig gave an example where, because of the way in which the legislation was drafted, a French-speaking person who recruited a Swahili girl with limited proficiency in French-even if she was tricked into arriving put in Australia, thinking she was going to work as a domestic servant but found herself facing work as a sex slave in an illegal brothel-might have been able to argue that, as the deceptive recruiting had occurred in a language other than English, the jury could not consider that evidence as admissible. The new amendment clears the matter up and makes certain that that will not be possible. The other amendment that the opposition proposed related to a requirement that the act be include provision for victim statements. The opposition has had discussion with government advisers and acknowledges that in this instance the government will not be agreeing with the proposed opposition amendment. In this instance, we accept that there are plausible and perhaps good reasons why that opposition to the proposal has been stated. The advisers point out that section 16A(2)(d) of the Crimes Act 1914 already provides that, in determining the sentence to be imposed on a person in respect of a federal offence, a court must take into account ‘the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence'. Paragraph (e) of that section provides that the court must consider ‘any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence'. So evidence can be given to the court as to those matters. It can include a statement by the victim of the offence about his or her experience of the impact of the offence. That applies equally to the new and amended offences provided by the trafficking bill. We are told that it would be difficult to include a specific provision, more broad than that, applying only to this provision rather than to the generality of offences under the Crimes Act and that the Australian Law Reform Commission is currently examining section 1B of the Crimes Act which deals with sentencing and administration of federal offenders. I understand that, as a consequence, the Australian Law Reform Commission will be looking at the question of victim statements. We accept the reasonableness of the government's position that, in that context, whether or not to include such specific provisions in relation to victim impact should be dealt with in the context of the ALRC review rather than in the bill. In those circumstances, neither of the amendments proposed by the member for Barton will be pressed. We thank the government, firstly, for its cooperation with the first amendment by adopting and including it. While the second has not been included, it has been explained that the substance of the issue is partially addressed by the existing legislation and the larger concerns of the opposition will be looked at in that review. It would not be appropriate to press those amendments to a division. We thank the government for their cooperation on those particular issues.",52
153,Mr SLIPPER,CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT,"I am particularly pleased to be able to join in this bipartisan debate on the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005. It is indeed heartening that members on both sides of the House are prepared to strongly support the provisions of this bill. I think all of us would accept that Australia has an enviable international reputation for looking after our neighbours. We also respect the general concept of caring for those who are in need of our protection. It is a notion that was no better demonstrated than in the outpouring of support from the pockets of ordinary Australians, as well as the Australian government, in the aftermath of the Boxing Day tsunami. Australians, on the whole, embrace the ideals of safety, freedom and respect for our fellow man-and, I suppose, to be politically correct I should say ‘our fellow woman', and I see the member for Throsby nodding somewhat enthusiastically at that statement. When someone is in need, when someone finds himself or herself caught in an unwanted situation, the inner desire of most of our citizens is to want to reach out and help. It is a very natural sentiment. The Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005 further recognises the global scourge that is peopletrafficking-the unacceptable import of human life as a mere product to be used for a variety of means. In order to wipe out this menace, we as the Australian government and the Australian people must do all we can to reach out and help. The underlying motivations of the people trafficker is an overwhelming lack of recognition of the high value of ordinary human life, compounded by an overwhelming motivation to do anything and everything in an insatiable pursuit of money and, perhaps, power. The major concern is the trafficking of womenhelpless, afraid and vulnerable-for use in the sex trade. But the victims of these crimes also include children. Thankfully, these crimes are not as rampant in Australia as in other nations, but there have been arrests and prosecutions in this country and we, as the government and the Australian parliament, must remain ever vigilant to prevent further ongoing breaches of our laws. These breaches are unacceptable violations of ordinary human decency and everyday morality. These crimes are so secretive that international statistics vary greatly. Some agencies believe the people-trafficking problem involves around 700,000 victims globally each year but others suggest the figure is closer to four million victims. Whether 700,000 people or four million people are involved, it is clearly a worldwide scourge and a worldwide problem, and we as Australians need to play our part in preventing it. The Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005 will help to further prevent such crimes and safeguard the humanitarian ideals of our citizens, giving greater real legal clout to the battle against those animals who disregard the rights of others in their immoral pursuit of financial gain. The Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005 will add offences related to people-trafficking as opposed to people-smuggling and debt bondage to the Criminal Code. People-smuggling by definition involves the movement of those who have agreed to be brought into a targeted country, albeit by questionable means; whereas the victims of people-trafficking are mostly tricked, forced or threatened and are in many cases unaware of their destination or their intended use when they get there. The majority of victims of people-trafficking eventually end up in the sex trade, often too frightened or unable to escape. Others are used as workers in sweatshops, some are forced into marriages against their will and still others into other domestic work. The new offences to be created by this bill are based on the desires to stamp out the problem, prosecute the offenders and, most importantly, protect the victims. While there are already some trafficking offences outlined in the Criminal Code, in the categories of slavery, sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting, this bill further adds further deterrents already in place. A trafficking offence of debt bondage will also be added to the Criminal Code as a result of this bill. Debt bondage is effectively exactly what it says: the situation where a person agrees to give his or her services, or the services of another, to someone to whom he or she owes a debt. However, in many cases there has been no agreed value set on the services, nor does that service actually go toward the repayment of the debt in question. It becomes clear in these scenarios that the payee of the debt inadvertently becomes a victim of people-trafficking. This debt bondage will be a specific offence under these amendments. The offence becomes more serious-once again, with more serious consequences-if the victim is under 18 years. It is common for victims to be ‘persuaded' by the trafficker through the use of force or threats that cause the victim to agree to the entry under duress. This has also been addressed by the amendments currently before the House. Guilt of this offence comes as a consequence of any threats or forcefulness having been used to pressure the target into becoming a victim. It is all well and good to have these offences outlined in Australia's laws, but laws can become somewhat toothless without the appropriate penalties to back them up. The amendments outlined in this bill are accompanied by sentences in the range of 12 years to 20 years, serious time for serious crime. Aggravated offences under the peopletrafficking banner will attract prison sentences of 20 years. This appropriate penalty will come about if the offender has intended to exploit the victim on entering Australia; if the offender has subjected the victim to inhumane or cruel treatment; and if the offender has put the victim at risk of death or serious injury, which could be the case into the some sweatshop operations. In the case of victims who are under the age of 18, traffickers will also face a lengthy 20 years behind bars. This is a vital safeguard for those who are less able to defend themselves against the traffickers. I only hope and make the plea that, when the courts come to sentence some of these offenders, the courts use the full range of very serious penalties at their disposal to make sure that serious time is served for serious crime. There is no point in having maximum penalties unless these penalties are imposed in appropriate circumstances. The amendments outlined in the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005 include powers that extend outside Australia's geographical borders to include crimes by Australian citizens that occur in other countries. This means that the laws and the penalties will apply to any Australian citizen, any Australian group and any Australian organisation anywhere in the world. This is eminently appropriate because it is important that Australians are aware of the behavioural standards required of them, regardless of where they happen to be in the world. It is no surprise that the most valuable human commodities of the perpetrators are also the most vulnerable. It again highlights the cowardice and weakness of those who perpetrate the crime of people-trafficking. also underscores the greater need for strict and appropriate laws and penalties to afford the necessary protections to victims of these inhumane crimes. The new offences and penalties I have outlined and others contained in the bill and various other amendments included in the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005 will help to bolster the protection afforded by Australia's laws for potential victims of peopletrafficking. This bill will further help to shore up the everyday wishes of ordinary Australians to afford the necessary protection, safety and respect for all mankind. I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting this legislation and I commend the bill to the House.",55
154,Ms GEORGE,CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT,"I begin by concurring with the comments made by the member for Denison in his contribution when he referred to the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005 as a bill that was ‘welcome' and ‘worthy'. That certainly is the case, and it is also very timely because it is intended to meet Australia's obligations under the United Nations' trafficking protocol. I had expected that it would have been dealt with some time ago but, following a report from the Senate's Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on obvious inadequacies in the original bill, it has now been reworked with a substantial number of amendments. The details of those amendments were canvassed in the contribution made by the member for Barton, so I do not want to go over the technical debate about the bill, other than to commend the work of the Senate committee and particularly Senator Ludwig in bringing this bill to the House today. The provisions relating to trafficking in It persons offences are not limited exclusively to trafficking for the purpose of sexual services. They also cover instances where someone is using force or threat of force to facilitate the entry of a person into Australia. The bill will also make deceptive conduct in recruiting a person to work in the sex industry illegal and punishable by seven years imprisonment, or nine years for an aggravated offence. I concur with comments made by speakers on this side of the House that the introduction of the offence of debt bondage is a most welcome measure. Debt bondage is a form of modern day serfdom and has no place in a civilised society. The debt bondage measures will cover all workers, no matter what industry they are in. I really want to focus my comments on the issue of trafficking in women and children for prostitution. I do so because there has been quite a lot of public debate and discourse about this issue, and today I have the opportunity as a woman on the Labor side to outline my views on this very serious infringement of human rights. In a recent article in the Sydney Morning Herald, Sheila Jeffreys, an associate professor from the University of Melbourne, drew attention to the increased use of euphemisms in this debate-euphemisms that are obfuscating the harms that are being done to women who are trafficked and that are deliberately calculated to downplay the seriousness of the issue. In the article, Jeffreys said that the terminology associated with the trafficking of women and children can be downplayed or reinterpreted with detrimental consequences for women who are trafficked. She went on to give some examples. What used to be widely known as prostitution is now referred to by some as ‘sex work' . Trafficking has become, for some, ‘migration for labour'. Trafficked women are sometimes euphemistically called ‘migrant sex workers', while traffickers themselves are referred to as ‘agents', ‘brokers' or ‘immigration organisers'. Debt bondage, long recognised as a modern form of slavery, has in the words of some become ‘contract work'. Such neutral terms and euphemisms are used in a manner which attempts to make these matters more palatable, but in my view nothing can make human rights violations palatable, in any sense of the word. It is a matter of some regret that it took Australian government some time to realise the magnitude of the problem. Until about mid-2003 the Howard government appeared to hold the view that trafficking was not a problem because-it was argued-the women-mostly Thai-who came to Australia for sex work must have consented to do so. They knew their destination and thus were not trafficked, or so the argument went. The government introduced legislation against trafficking into servitude in 1999, but it was inadequate since it incorporated a strict free-of-force distinction and included no mechanism to support trafficked women who complained. At that time there was no Federal Police unit detailed to investigate complaints. In fact, the first arrests under the 1999 legislation did not take place until mid2003, after extensive media reports on trafficking in women. Those media reports eventually led to a parliamentary inquiry, largely inspired by the work undertaken by two journalists in particular. I want to mention their names today because I think they did a great deal to bring this issue into the public domain. Those two journalists were Natalie O'Brien and Elisabeth Wynhausen from the Australian. Following their work, an excellent parliamentary joint committee report was produced, after an inquiry into the trafficking of women for sexual servitude. The conjunction of the public discourse and debate with this very detailed report really spurred the government into more substantial action. It was the death of a Thai sex worker in the Villawood detention centre back in 2003 that first brought this issue to my attention and certainly to the attention of the public. As you will recall, the revelation at the time of Ms Simaplee's case was a shock. She came from a hill tribe in Chiang Mai province and was sold by her parents as a 12the year-old. She was then smuggled into Australia on a false Malaysian passport in 1986. As we know, regrettably and sadly, she ended up in detention waiting to be deported and died there. Regrettably, deportation was the action most often taken by the department of immigration. They seemed intent on deporting the women in a hurry-and along with them the evidence that could convict the traffickers and the perpetrators of these horrendous practices. These women were not just illegal immigrants but actual victims of organised crime. This business is a very profitable one for the traffickers. The United Nations recently estimated that in 2003 trafficking in the global sex trade was worth between $US5 billion and $US7 billion annually. As we now know, these traffickers facilitate women's entry by a range of fraudulent means, including providing visas-typically student or holiday visas-false passports and funds. It is now estimated that approximately 300 women are trafficked in this manner each year into Australia for prostitution. Some enter with full knowledge and consent; others enter with consent but are deceived as to their conditions of work; and then there are those who are completely deceived about their future work in the sex industry. The latter-those who are deceived-are the ones that we usually refer to as being kept in sexual servitude. They are often forced to have sex with hundreds of men to pay off their so called ‘debts' to the traffickers which can average between $35,000 and $50,000 a year. I will quote from the report of the parliamentary inquiry to confirm what I am saying: These women are required to work six or seven days a week, and see as many as ten customers per day. They often have little or no freedom of movement, poor food and accommodation, and no control over which customers they see, or what sexual acts they are forced to provide. Many women are the victims of sexual and physical assaults and suffer a range of physical and emotional health problems. Surely as Australian citizens we should be absolutely appalled to think that sexual servitude is going on under our noses here in Australia. I will quote the words of Detective Senior Sergeant MCKinney from the Asian Squad of the police force who testified at this inquiry about the conditions he found in one of these investigations: There were bars on the windows. The outer windows that faced the street had all been nailed or painted shut-they could not open. The conditions were grotty. Theythat is, the womenwere stacked in the room ... I had trouble walking into the room because there were that many beds in the room that you had to shuffle and shimmy between the beds to get around. … … … In the premises there was a public area at the bottom and the private area was up the stairs. There were very large steel bars up the side of the stairwell and a big, lockable steel gate. When the girls were brought back at, say, four, five or six in the morning, depending on how busy it was, they were put upstairs and the steel gate was locked. The report goes on to say that not only are the women held in these unbearable physical conditions but there is a degree of control and imprisonment which goes far beyond the physical problems I have mentioned. Their situation was reinforced by physical violence and the extent of the power the traffickers have over women in other ways: the women, for example, may not speak English, may have no money or passport and may not even know where they are. This is compounded by the women's distrust of authorities, the fear-deliberately cultivated-that the law enforcement agencies are involved with the traffickers and the misinformation about the consequences of cooperating with authorities. I want to say on the public record, and I think I speak on behalf of every decentminded Australian, that these kinds of violations are absolutely tragic in a civilised society such as ours. I regret that it has taken some considerable time for the government to take meaningful action to deal with this horrendous issue. There were no prosecutions or convictions for years after the enactment of the Commonwealth sexual slavery laws back in 1999. In fact, the first person charged with forcing women into sexual slavery was not charged until June 2003. I was pleased to read in the parliamentary inquiry report that the Australian Federal Police reported at the time that they had commenced 62 investigations, with 15 current investigations that had resulted in 10 arrests and 35 charges. That was a belated, though pleasing, development. However, it is disappointing to read that recently a Victorian jury was discharged after failing to a verdict in a key sexual slavery case. This was the second occasion that jurors in New South Wales and Victoria could not agree on how to apply previously untested laws. In fact, the New South Wales jury remained hung after a 10-week trial. In all, one of the great virtues of this amending bill is that it will provide greater clarity for cases to be prosecuted in the future. I commend all the people who have worked hard in the Senate committee to bring this bill before the House. I certainly believe it is a welcome and worthy bill, and it represents a most significant improvement on what to date has been available to our law enforcement agencies in dealing with the scourge of trafficking of women and children as sex slaves in this country.",57
155,Mrs MOYLAN,CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT,"I think it is a great tragedy to have to stand this House today to speak on the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005. Here we are in the 21st century; we are an enlightened society and, certainly in our country, we are an educated society and we do not have the kind of grinding poverty that is experienced in many of our neighbouring countries. I thought most of us believed that slavery had been abolished in the 19th century. Certainly in the United States Abraham Lincoln's contribution to stopping slavery there probably cost him his life. Slavery has been around for a very long time-we know that. It goes back to China and Ancient Egypt in 1600 BC. There were great slave markets in Athens, Rhodes, Corinth and Delos. Thousands of slaves were sold every day. But even these people, as bad as that was, had rights. Today slavery still exists but it is in a new form. It is in a form where it is an illegal practice and where people have no rights and where quite often it is reach swept under the carpet and the average member of the public has little idea that under their noses, even here in Australia, these terrible practices are actually taking place. Sadly, in current times trafficking in people includes a range of human rights violations. They extend to dreadful crimes such as the sale of children, child prostitution, child pornography, the exploitation of child labour, the sexual mutilation of female children and the use of children in armed conflicts, debt bondage and the sale of body partsorgans-and of course prostitution features very largely in the trafficking of humans, mostly but not exclusively affecting women. Figures on the United Nations web site reveal that these practices are widespread. One recent study by the International Labour Organisation showed that about 100 million children are exploited in these ways. It is a in shocking indictment. The United Nations revealed that things are often made worse because child labour is considered cheap and those who are the victims often come from the very poorest areas and therefore are from some of the most vulnerable groups of people. Today slavery extends not just to physical violence but also to deep mental and psychological torment. It is understood that the majority of children-an extremely vulnerable group in itself-who are trafficked are girls, although, as I said, it is not exclusively so and many countries traffic in boys as well. Some nations even cultivate a sense of normality in young women being controlled and manipulated. Then when they are sold by their parents, who are sometimes unaware of the truth, the girls feel obliged to work hard otherwise they know that their parents and families will suffer. Often they are told that they have to pay and repay big debts. The BBC recently produced a program to be broadcast on trafficking. It reminded me of the horrendous case in the UK where Chinese people were taken to the UK and were getting cockles from the sea and, as we know, many of them were killed as the sea rose very fast. This is very typical of some of the kinds of activities going on. They got to the UK, realised of course that they then had to pay a very substantial debt and needed to do anything at any cost. Sadly, in this case they lost their lives. Cultural norms have prepared young women for control and compliance amongst the traffickers. A girl will be told her parents will suffer if she does not cooperate and work hard and how the debt is on her shoulders and must be repaid. Human Rights Watch estimates that between 800,000 and two million women are currently working in Thailand as prostitutes. The following two cases were found on a site on the internet by the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, and I think they highlight a couple of the problem areas. A 14-year-old Nigerian girl was brought to a suburban home outside Washington-so these situations are not just occurring in Third World countries-under the impression she could attend school in the United States. Instead of being enrolled in school, the woman was forced to do domestic duties and take care of six children in the home. She was also subject to physical and sexual assault. In a second case a woman in South Florida was convicted of illegally harbouring a young Haitian orphan in her home as a domestic servant in 2004. The girl was 12 when she was rescued from the home where she spent three years as a virtual slave and was repeatedly sexually assaulted. I do not think that as Australians we can take any comfort from these examples in other countries because, sadly, some of these practices are going on here in our country right under our very noses. The sex trade, although prolific among trafficking practices, is not the only form of modern slavery. According to the United Nations and UNICEF, children are also being forced into the military at a very young age and the results are devastating. The UNICEF put out some figures on their web site and I think it is worth repeating them here. It said: - An estimated 1.2 million children are trafficked worldwide each year; - An estimated 1000 to 1500 Guatemalan babies and children are trafficked each year for adoption in North America and Europe; - Girls as young as 13 (mainly from Asia and Eastern Europe) are trafficked as mail-order brides. In most cases, these girls and women are powerless and isolated and at great risk of violence; - From West and Central Africa children are taken, mainly for domestic work but also for sexual exploitation (nearly 90% of them are girls); - Children are trafficked from many poorer African countries, to places sometimes as far as the Middle East and Europe. This is only part of what goes on. Much more needs to be done globally, and the Australian government is working with other countries to ensure changes are made. I turn to an overview of this bill and the issues it goes to. It will amend the Criminal Code Act to strengthen Australia's fight to reduce the incidence of trafficking in persons. The bill comprehensively criminalises all aspects of trafficking in persons. There are a few new elements, including the introduction of new trafficking offences where a person is transported into Australia under force, threat or deception. Higher penalties are imposed where the victim is a child or is exploited, endangered or subjected to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment. The bill creates a new domestic trafficking in persons offence where trafficking activity takes place wholly within Australia. Hundreds of organisations throughout the world are working to combat these offences, and I know that the Australian government is strongly committed to combating these terrible crimes against humanity. The government put out a booklet recently called Australian government's action plan to eradicate trafficking in persons and I know from that book that the Australian government has demonstrated its commitment to the international fight against trafficking in persons by participating in negotiations for the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children. Australia is a signatory to both the convention and the protocol, which has been ratified. Under the Australian federal system of government, this will involve consultation with the states and territories. I support the bill and I will support any further changes that might emerge in the future. The minister is to be congratulated on the work that he has done. I know he has taken a very personal interest in trying to do everything that Australia can both to combat the trafficking of people on our shores and to work within the international forums to combat trafficking abroad, and the government does commit money to programs targeted at trying to prevent trafficking in people. So I support the bill and I thank the minister. In finishing, I have to say that I believe, and I am sure most reasonable-minded Australians would agree-as my colleague the member for Throsby just said-that there is no place in a civilised society for trafficking in people.",60
156,Mr MURPHY,CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT,"Like the member for Pearce, I rise, as members of the government and of the opposition have done, to support the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005. For too long our country has been the subject of international operatives that have participated in the trafficking of persons. I am deeply concerned about the encroaching terminology which, I note, is reductionist in that it reduces the person to the point of a mere commodity. I refer specifically to the term ‘people-smuggling' as distinguished from the term ‘people-trafficking'. There is no dispute regarding the term ‘peopletrafficking'. However, the word ‘smuggling' has a special significance and a unique definition. When I looked for the term ‘peoplesmuggling' I could not find a statutory definition for it. Before asking the question as to what people-smuggling is, it is important to ask the question: what is smuggling? Smuggling is defined in section 4 of the Customs Act 1901: ‘Smuggling' means any importation, introduction or exportation or attempted importation, introduction or exportation of goods, with intent to defraud the revenue. So we see that the principal purpose of the offence of smuggling is that of a financial nature to prevent any person importing, introducing or exporting goods with ‘intent to defraud the revenue'. What does the offence of smuggling entail? In Australian law, smuggling includes those import and export regulations administered by the Australian Customs Service. These regulations, in turn, provide schedules of tariffs and customs that are revenues payable to the Commonwealth. Those persons who attempt to import or export goods that are listed in those schedules are guilty of a criminal offence because they are attempting to defraud the revenue of the Commonwealth. I now turn to the definition of ‘peoplesmuggling'. What is people-smuggling? The Bills Digest, No. 96 of 2004-05, on the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2004 does not find or cite a definition of the term ‘peoplesmuggling'. On page 2 of the Bills Digest there is a paragraph titled ‘Peoplesmuggling, people-trafficking and the bill' which attempts to distinguish between the terms ‘people-smuggling' and ‘peopletrafficking'. However, when we read the Bills Digest, we find there is only an anecdotal reference to another 2002 Commonwealth act of parliament, the Crimes Legislation Amendment (People Smuggling, Firearms Trafficking and Other Measures) Act 2002, No. 141 of 2002. In this act-which, for the sake of simplicity, I will call the peoplesmuggling act-schedule 1, division 73 reveals a new group of offences-‘Peoplesmuggling and related offences'. Subdivision A refers to the various new offences of people-smuggling. However, such offences are not defined, but provisions-including punitive provisions-are made in the new offence of people-smuggling. Section 73.1 notes that a person is guilty of an offence of peoplesmuggling if: (a) ... the first person organises or facilitates entry of another person ... into a foreign country... and (b) the entry of the other person into the foreign country does not comply with the requirements under that country's law for entry into that country; and (c ) the other person is not a citizen or permanent resident of that the foreign country; and (d) the first person organises or facilitates that entry: (i) having obtained a benefit to do so or (ii) with the intention of obtaining ... fit. I cite this legislation because it becomes apparent how the policy between ‘smuggling' and what is known as ‘people-smuggling' differs. With smuggling, there is a prescribed import and export schedule of customs and tariff amounts placed on items called ‘goods' in which a custom or tariff is payable to the Commonwealth respectively. However, and this is the critical point, a human being cannot be bought or sold; a living human being cannot be exported or imported. This moral principle is reflected in the policy intent of the Commonwealth's Customs Import and Export Regulations: a living human being is not a good that may ever appear on the schedule of import or export items. This is so because a human being, being a person, can never be itemised or described as a commodity-a thing to be bought or sold. I now turn to the definition of ‘peoplesmuggling'. We note immediately that the policy emphasis of the term in the Commonwealth's people-smuggling act of 2002 is specifically concerned with the benefit received by a person as a formal element of the criminal offence. If what is called ‘Person A' is proven to obtain a benefit in so called ‘smuggling' a person called ‘Person B' into Australia, then the offence is caused. It is also critical for members of this House to note that if a benefit has not been received the then there is no offence of people-smuggling. This is the critical nature of the offence of so-called ‘people-smuggling': financial or other benefit. In my view, the policy implications of the 2002 act and now this legislation are profound. I put to the House this evening that the combined policy impact of this legislation is to take the offence of peopletrafficking away from the intrinsic wrong of the offence of deprivation of liberty of the natural rights and freedoms of a person and a beneturn the offence of people-smuggling into a financially based offence. It appears the offence of people-smuggling is based on the fact that another person has derived a financial or other benefit in so-called ‘smuggling' a person into Australia. The repercussions of this legislative direction are at once selfapparent, as in the apparent necessity of this bill we are debating tonight. Specifically, the repercussions are that people-smuggling, as currently expressed in Australian Commonwealth law, is a financial or other benefit based legislation. The offence of people-smuggling is not concerned with the intrinsic wrong against the natural rights of a person which include, inter alia, the rights of freedom and liberty, and other rights. The offence of people-smuggling is solely concerned with the financial or other benefit obtained by one person in the so called smuggling of people into and out of Australia, coupled with the breach of migration law loosely defined and capable of circumvention. It may be argued that the limited benefit based purpose of the people-smuggling act of 2002 is precisely the reason why the 2005 people-trafficking bill is before this House today. Not so. The Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005 today does not address the wrongful definition of people-smuggling which, I say again, reduces the person to that of a mere commodity by describing the person in such a way as to use the word ‘smuggling' in the context of the illicit movement of people against their will and against the greater laws of the Commonwealth, including migration law. This policy direction means that this government has deviated in a perverse way from the law making of the Customs Act. The definition of smuggling now takes on a role very different from the revenue powers it was originally designed to express. When we review the term ‘people-smuggling' this provision is really a messy hybrid of Commonwealth migration law power admixed with a criminal power which, in turn, bears no resemblance to the revenue and finance powers, which are the real policy intent of antismuggling law found in the Customs Act. I put to the House tonight-and to the people of Australia-that this government has hopelessly confused itself again in the drafting of laws. Over and over again, this government introduces bills in such a way that it fails to read other laws in cognate with bills before the House. This government is driven by populism, as in this bill. On the surface this bill appears to do a good thing in clamping down on people trafficking. When we look more closely we see that the objective is to draw moral weight from United Nations instruments, which in turn are baseless. The relevant United Nations instrument is known as the ‘trafficking protocol' andas noted in the Bills Digest I referred to earlier-makes no reference to the term ‘people smuggling' but speaks exclusively of the term ‘people trafficking'. So where has the government discovered this term ‘people smuggling'? I cannot find the definition of people smuggling in any international instrument, or in any other Commonwealth legislation. The Bills Digest rightly notes that the substantive area of law, being Australian migration law, refers equally exclusively to the term ‘people trafficking'. I invite the minister to clarify this matter when he sums up and concludes the second reading debate this evening. In reality, this legislation properly belongs to the domain of Australian migration law. Whilst the provisions of the peoplesmuggling act of 2002 and the bill before us today create punitive provisions under the Commonwealth Criminal Code, it is misplaced legislation that these offences lie within the domain of Commonwealth criminal legislation. As the Bills Digest authors rightly note, they instinctively refer to Commonwealth migration law when determining whether a breach of those elements of people smuggling and people trafficking occurs. I note again that a material element of the criminal offence in people smuggling is: ... entry into the foreign country does not with the requirements under the country's law for entry into the country. What laws can this bill be referring to, if not Australian migration law? This code is not speaking of Commonwealth finance powers under customs import and export regulations. The object of the act and this bill is about persons, not commodities. It is apparent that, yet again, the Commonwealth has hopelessly confused itself with this legislation. In policy terms, it has shifted the statutory emphasis away from the policy intent of illicit movement of goods and attempts to defraud the Commonwealth of its revenue, to one concerning the obtaining of a financial or other benefit of a person and reliance on breaches of migration law, in order to establish the nature of the new criminal offence. What a messy parcel of legislation the combined effects of the people-smuggling act of 2002 and the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005 represent! What has happened, in reality, is that the people-smuggling bill of 2002 has, to use a colloquial saying, come out of left field. We do not really understand where that bill has come from. However, we do know why the government has introduced the Criminal Codes Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005. We are debating this bill tonight because the Commonwealth is attempting to honour its international obligations as a signatory to the trafficking protocol, an international instrument tabled in this House on 3 December 2003. All that I have said highlights the paradigm errors that are patently clear in the manner in which this government makes law. This government, as I have said in the 39th and 40th parliaments and in this parliament, deliberately ignores other legislation already in place-principally the people-smuggling comply act of 2002 and the Customs Act 1901-by ignoring well-founded pre-existing definitions. Critically, the definition of ‘smuggling', through the invention of new terms such as ‘people smuggling', bears no policy relation to the root definition of ‘smuggling'. All this creates massive confusion and hence even more loopholes in the administration of criminal justice. Further, it helps the perpetrators of such crime escape, by establishing such eclectic definitions. Smuggling means a breach of finance accountability by defrauding the revenue in one act, the Customs Act 1901, but means obtaining a benefit with no obligation to the Commonwealth revenue in another act, the peoplesmuggling act of 2002. On the one hand, people smuggling means recourse to Australian migration law, whilst on the other hand the offences of people smuggling and people trafficking are nowhere to be found in the broader migration law, but are in fact discrete criminal codes administered by the Attorney-General. Really, you could not create a more tardy, incoherent legal system. This law reads like a poorly written essay of a school student, drafted in haste and thrown at the desk of the teacher. The legislation, when read in cognate with other extant parcels of Commonwealth legislation, reads with definitional inconsistencies, loose ends and a lack of cohesion. For this reason, I am going to bring my concerns to the attention of the shadow minister for justice and customs and senator for Queensland, the Hon. Joe Ludwig. It is necessary to overhaul this patchwork quilt of utilitarian objectives. This bill makes perfunctory responses to our external affairs powers by ratifying domestic legislation consistent with our obligations as a signatory to the trafficking protocol. This government has simply introduced this bill with no clear vision as to the composite implications of this bill admixed with other bills-to wit, the Customs Act 1901 and the people-smuggling act of 2002. Finally, I wish to end on an instrument of great clarity and relevance to the notion of what is a human being. In light of the recent death of His Holiness Pope John Paul II, I refer to Pacem in Terris-Encyclical Letter of Pope John XXIII on Establishing Universal Peace in Truth, Justice, Charity and Liberty released on 11 April 1963. I am sure that the honourable member for Watson would be aware-others might not be-that at the time of the birth of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Vatican was active-and still is very active-in participating in the debate of human rights. Pacem in Terris is a seminal work on what are human rights and duties. I bring the instrument Pacem in Terris to the minister's attention because it sheds critical light on the intrinsic nature of the person as anything but a commodity. The Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005 and the 2002 act describe the person as a commoditysomething that is capable of being bought and sold-because they use the term ‘smuggling' synonymously in the context of persons. This is a fatal flaw in the legislation and must be corrected, along with the other laws that commit the same mistake. People are not commodities and may never be treated as such. In the act of drafting this legislation, the government participates in assisting those persons whose ultimate objective is to profit from the illicit movement of persons for their own gain. The time honoured maxim ‘By doing good, they shall do much evil' is particularly relevant to this bill. For the purposes of tonight's debate, I believe it is very important that the House familiarise itself with the true meaning of human rights. I am all but in despair when I read the direction of certain United Nations instruments and, more disturbingly, how this government interprets them. I am specifically disturbed at how the government has seen fit to ratify its obligations to this United Nations instrument here tonight. Whilst I have no issue with the bill itself, I take great issue with how this bill will admix with extant legislation-namely, the peoplesmuggling act 2002 and the Customs Act 1901, as well as other legislation and law, including, as I have said innumerable times, impacts of administrative law, conflict of laws, procedural law and the law of equity. It is clearly a case of selective amnesia. This government is forgetting-if, in its invincible ignorance, it has not already entirely forgotten-those laws which are critical to the democratic governance of Australia, which was founded on natural law, procedural fairness and ultimately the cohesiveness of laws. Like the Tower of Babel, if we use the same words but speak different languages, how are we to understand each other? It is time to rediscover the essence of human rights. It is time to read learned and illuminated texts such as Pacem in Terris to remind us of what is a human being. I conclude by saying that this bill is acceptable in itself. However, when read in cognate with other bills already passed by this House, it establishes the reductionist policy direction of this government towards reducing the human being to that of a mere commodity. In doing so, it participates in the very evil that this bill is attempting to stamp out. I urge the minister to seriously consider the concerns I have raised tonight and reassess the government's direction in setting Commonwealth policy.",62
157,Dr WASHER,CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT,"The Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005 amends the Criminal Code Act 1995-the Criminal Code-and the Telecommunications Interception Act 1979. The bill comprehensively criminalises every aspect of trafficking in persons. How does it achieve this? It creates a specific offence where the trafficker transports their victim into Australia by using force, threats or deception. This offence expands on the existing slavery and sexual servitude offences. Whereas the existing offences focus on the final exploitation of the person, the new offence includes transporting the person for the purpose of exploitation. The new trafficking offence carries a penalty of up to 12 years imprisonment. The bill introduces a specific offence for the transportation of a person from Australia by means of force or threats. For example, a perpetrator who uses force or threats to gain the compliance of a trafficking victim to leave Australia, even where the perpetrator is not involved in the final exploitation of that victim once the victim has left Australia, will be prosecuted. A penalty of up to 12 years imprisonment will apply for this offence. The bill will make it an offence for a person to organise or facilitate the entry, proposed entry or receipt of another person into Australia where there is deception about the fact that the entry, receipt or arrangements made in Australia will involve the provision of sexual services, exploitation, debt bondage or the temporary or permanent confiscation or destruction of the other person's travel or identity documents. For the purposes of this offence it does not matter whether the victim's entry or proposed entry is lawful or unlawful under the Migration Act 1958. A penalty of up to 12 years will apply for this new offence. An aggravated trafficking offence applies where a victim is exploited or subjected to cruel, inhuman, degrading or dangerous treatment. The aggravated offence carries a tougher penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment and is comparable to penalties for kidnapping and serious assault. The new trafficking of children offences are punishable by up to 25 years imprisonment. The recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered to be trafficking. There will be separate offences for the trafficking into and from Australia of those under the age of 18. The offence of trafficking from Australia will apply where a person organises or facilitates the exit or proposed exit of a child or is reckless as to whether that child will be used to provide sexual services or be otherwise exploited. Sexual services as they apply here are defined broadly as including the use or display of the body of the person providing the sexual service for the gratification of others. It is not limited to the commercial use or display of the body of the person. For example, this definition would include the use of the body of a child, to make pornography for the perpetrator's personal use or for sharing with friends, without payment or reward, regardless of whether or not it occurs in a commercial context. The amended bill also proposes that trafficking in children be included as relevant offences in the Crimes Act 1914. This is important as, in prosecuting these offences, it may be necessary to use child witnesses. This section of the Crimes Act 1914 contains a protective regime for children in proceedings for sexual offences. It is essential that this protective regime be applied to trafficking prosecutions. The bill also creates new offences for the trafficking in persons activities that occur wholly within Australia. The domestic trafficking offences will ensure each and every participant in the chain of the exploitation can be prosecuted for that participation. The domestic trafficking offence is punishable by up to 12 years imprisonment, with a higher penalty of up to 20 years imprisonment for the aggravated offence where the victim is also exploited, subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, or endangered. The bill also creates the offence of debt bondage. This offence will prevent traffickers from using unfair debt contracts and other similar arrangements to force victims to provide sexual services or other labour to pay off large debts supposedly incurred by the trafficker in transporting the victim to Australia. This new offence will not criminalise legitimate employment arrangements that are not exploitative or unfair. The debt bondage offence has a penalty of up to 12 months imprisonment, with an aggravated offence penalty of up to two years imprisonment where the victim is younger than 18 years. To ensure that law enforcement and anticorruption agencies can effectively investigate and prosecute these heinous acts, the bill provides that telecommunications interception warrants be available under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 for the new offences. The term ‘people-trafficking' has been subject to a range of interpretations, and this has resulted in confusion over the prevalence of the crime within Australia and internationally. The absence of consistent definitions makes it difficult to achieve accurate comparable estimates. People-trafficking and people-smuggling have often been used interchangeably. However, there are important differences. People-trafficking is defined by the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, as: ... the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. People-smuggling, on the other hand, is the term used to describe the illegal movement of people on a fee-for-service basis. Such transactions are not conducted without the consent of those being smuggled. How much of a problem is peopletrafficking? The clandestine and criminal nature of trafficking and the reluctance of victims to report their experiences to authorities or to testify in court cases ensures that many instances of trafficking never become known to authorities. Internationally, it is estimated in a report of the US Department of State that around 600,000 to 800,000 men, women and children are trafficked across international borders every year. The majority of trafficking victims are women and children from Africa, Asia and parts of Eastern Europe, with estimates of 80 per cent being trafficked for sexual exploitation and the remainder for forced labour or slavery. There is also a growing trade in the trafficking of body parts. It is estimated by the International Organisation for Migration that the worldwide proceeds of people trafficking is around $US10 billion. In Australia it is unclear what numbers of people are being trafficked, because estimates are greatly varied. Project Respect estimates up to 1,000 women being under contract at any one time. This estimate was obtained from a six-week research period which documented the cases of approximately 300 individuals trafficked into Australia, including a large number of women. This would be in line with the parliamentary joint committee findings that in Sydney alone there are at least 30 trafficked women seeking to escape the sex industry. Conversely, the Scarlet Alliance stated: ... there are less than 400 sex workers entering Australia in any one year on a contract, the ity of whom knowingly consent to the work. Our organisations have collectively had direct contact with less than ten women in the last year who have been deceptively recruited. Since the introduction of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Amendment (Slavery and Sexual Servitude) Act 1999, 12 people have been charged under the legislation, to the end of June 2004, and 11 people are currently subject to prosecution action. The difference in the estimates may be partly explained by differing definitions; in particular, the definition of ‘informed consent'. Project Respect considers that the majority of women who entered contracts, although agreeing to work in the sex industry, were deceived as to the conditions of work and the size of the contractual repayments. As such, they fit within the UN definition of trafficked women. Whatever the true numbers are, they are certainly significant enough for the government to make moves to address the problem. There are also indications that the problem is growing. In any market there are supply and demand forces at work. The rise in displaced persons during the 1990s and the decreasing opportunity for regular migration has seen an increase in supply. Refugee camps for displaced persons provide a ready pool of vulnerable women and children to be recruited into the global sex industry. Some believe that the commercialisation of sex on the internet and satellite television may have increased the demand for women and children from the developing world to be trafficked into these new sexual entertainment industries in the Western world. Certainly in Australia the few figures we have already show a trend of growth. The number of people trafficking matters that have been referred to the Australian Federal Police by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has majorrisen steadily from one in 1999-2000 to 90 in 2003-04. The Australian government responded to the suspected levels of people trafficking and known smuggling in the Asia-Pacific region with the establishment of antitrafficking initiatives between governments, such as the Bali process. It has also provided aid to the region aimed at alleviating the economic and social conditions that encourage people trafficking. In 2000, the United Nations recognised the growing problem with the introduction of a trafficking protocol-that is, the United Nations Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime. This wide-ranging international agreement addressed the crime of trafficking in persons on a transnational level. It created a global language and legislation to define trafficking in persons, to assist victims of trafficking and to prevent trafficking in persons. It also established the parameters of judicial cooperation and exchanges of information among countries. After a national interest analysis, the Australian government signed the protocol in late 2002. The Australian government intends to ratify the United Nations trafficking protocol once our laws meet the requirements. In June 2003 a parliamentary joint committee began an inquiry into the trafficking of women for sexual servitude. The inquiry looked at the extent of the problem, the adequacy of the current legislation, the protection and treatment of trafficked women and the need for ratification of the UN trafficking protocol. In October 2003 the Commonwealth action plan to eradicate trafficking in persons was released. This $20 million package was focused on the enhancement of the detection, investigation and prosecution of all those involved in the trafficking of people. The package included: a new community awareness campaign to raise awareness of trafficking issues within Australia; a new 23member Australian Federal Police mobile strike team-the Transnational Sexual Exploitation and Trafficking Team-to investigate trafficking and sexual servitude; a new senior migration officer in Thailand focused on trafficking in persons; closer links between officers of the Australian Federal Police and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in the detection and investigation of trafficking, and enhanced training in trafficking issues; new visa arrangements for potentially trafficked victims; comprehensive victim support measures provided through contracted case managers, including assistance with appropriate accommodation and living expenses and access to a wide range of social support through legal, medical and counselling services; enhancement of arrangements, including access to additional support for the small number of potential victims who may be required to remain in immigration detention; development of a reintegration assistance project for trafficking victims who are returned to key source countries in South East Asia; improvements to legislation to comprehensively criminalise trafficking activity; legislative amendments to make telecommunications interception available for investigating trafficking offences; and ratification, once all domestic requirements are in place, of the United Nations trafficking protocol. The formulation of this bill is in response to recommendations by the joint committee, provisions of the government's Commonwealth action plan to eradicate trafficking in persons and the need to ratify the United Nations trafficking protocol. Countries ratifying the trafficking protocol will enable it to become an instrument of international law. As the traffickers have been adept at globalising illegality, the trafficking protocol will globalise legality by promoting police and judicial cooperation between borders. The Australian government will continue to monitor the extent of trafficking of people into Australia, respond to emerging domestic and international trends in people trafficking, provide developmental aid aimed at alleviating the conditions that foster people trafficking and related transnational crime, and act with due consideration for the interests of victims of trafficking. With the passing of this legislation, the Australian government will effectively prosecute those that are involved in any aspect of the abhorrent trade of people trafficking, whether to, from or within Australia.",67
158,Mr RUDDOCK,CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT,"in reply- Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you very much for the opportunity to sum up debate on the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2005, which I introduced an hour or two ago. I thank the member for Barton, along with his colleagues the members for Denison, Throsby and Lowe, as well as my colleagues the members for Grey, Fisher, Pearce and Moore. I thank them for their contributions and their support for this measure. When I introduced the bill I outlined the importance of it, the government's response to people trafficking, particularly of women and children, and the many steps that have been taken. I do not intend to detain the House by speaking to those matters again; I gave my second reading speech only a short while ago, which really addressed all of the points. The member for Barton foreshadowed two amendments when he spoke. I indicated to him afterwards that proposed amendment (1) had already been picked up by the government in the Senate and was part of the measures that we were implementing. Proposed amendment (2) was a matter which, in our view, should not proceed, because the Australian Law Reform Commission is looking at the broader range of issues in relation to statements from victims and the usefulness that they can provide. That issue ought to be addressed in a wider context. For those reasons, if the amendments had been pressed, we would have indicated that the first was superfluous and that there was an alternative course being followed in relation to the second. I understand that the member for Denison stated that the opposition would not be moving either of the amendments that were mentioned by the member for Barton. I am pleased about that and I wish the bill speedy passage. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",70

NA (DETENTION ARRANGEMENTS) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr MCGauran, and read a first time. Second Reading",71
161,Mr MCGAURAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Gippsland-Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs) (5.51 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. On 17 June the Prime Minister announced a number of changes the government is making to migration law and the handling of people in immigration detention. The Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005, which I now introduce into the House only four days later, is landmark legislation and far-reaching in both its scope and importance. The broad framework of the government's approach is unaltered. It is essential that we continue to have an orderly and wellmanaged migration and visa system. The government remains committed to its existing policy of mandatory detention, its strong position on border protection, including excision, the maintenance of offshore processing and in the unlikely event of it being needed in the future-the policy of turning boats around. These changes also represent the responsiveness of this government in taking opportunities to see that our existing detention policy is administered with greater flexibility, greater fairness and in a more timely manner. The government is committed to ensuring that the impact of detention on individuals is, where possible, softened. These changes build on the reforms to immigration detention arrangements that the government has introduced in the past several years. For example, the introduction of residential housing projects has provided more home-like living conditions for mothers and children. Some children have been accommodated in the community with the assistance of community organisations and state welfare authorities. The new removal pending bridging visa allows for the release, with support benefits, of detainees where the minister believes it is not reasonably practicable to achieve removal in the short term, and the detainee is likely to cooperate with removal from Australia, once that becomes practicable. These new changes do not alter the broad framework of immigration detention, but will allow greater flexibility, fairness and timeliness in the administration of matters affecting persons in immigration detention and provide for greater scrutiny by the Ombudsman of the operation of the detention powers. The Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 implements the most pressing of these changes, which will enable greater flexibility in how families with minor children can be detained, and also enable the release of persons from detention by the grant of a visa, such as the removal pending bridging visa. The amendments in this bill will: - Incorporate into the Migration Act a statement that ‘the parliament affirms as a matter of principle that a minor shall only be detained as a measure sort'. This principle relates to the holding of children in detention centres. Where detention of a minor is required under the act, it should, when and wherever possible, take place in the community, under a residence determination. - Provide an additional non-compellable power for the minister to specify alternational tive arrangements for a person's detention and conditions to apply to that person. This will enable the detention of families with children, in particular, to take place in the community with conditions being set to meet their individual circumstances. - Provide an additional non-compellable power for the minister to grant a visa to a person who is in immigration detention, including a removal pending bridging visa. - Require the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, DIMIA, to report to the Commonwealth Ombudsman when a person has been detained for two years or more, or for periods that total at least two years, and every six months thereafter that the person is in detention. The Ombudsman will then assess the appropriateness of the person's detention arrangements and make any recommendations the Ombudsman considers appropriate to the minister. The Prime Minister also announced that in future all primary protection visa applications will be decided by DIMIA within three months of the receipt of the application. This emphasis on timely decisions does not mean that the quality of the decisions being made by DIMIA will be compromised. On the contrary, DIMIA officers will continue to be obliged to make fair decisions in a manner that does not entail a great deal of uncerof last re- tainty for asylum seekers. Likewise, reviews by the Refugee Review Tribunal, RRT, will occur within three months of the tribunal receiving an application. Periodic reports of cases where these time limits have not been met will be made to the minister, who will table these reports in the parliament. This will provide addiassurance that applications for review are dealt with in a timely manner. These time limits will be included in amendments to be brought forward during the forthcoming spring sittings. In the meantime, instructions have been given to both DIMIA and the RRT to administratively implement these time limits immediately and provide periodic reports to the minister. It is noted in this regard that elements of processing time are not within DIMIA's or the RRT's control, for example, security checking processes, provision of information from the applicant and the timeliness of information from other governments. That information will need to be addressed in any reports that are provided to the minister. Failure to meet time limits will give rise to a report to the minister but will not give rise a right to the issuing of a visa or release detention. To the extent required, priority for processing will be given to those in detention. The minister's new non-compellable powers will allow families with minor children who are currently in immigration detention centres and residential housing projects to be placed in community detention arrangements. Generally this will occur where primary processing has been completed and where removal from Australia is not under way. It should be recognised that, before community detention can start, suitable arrangements will need to be made for the families currently in detention. Depending on the circumstances, this could take four to six weeks. The amendments empower the minister to make a determination, termed ‘a residence determination', if the minister considers this is in the public interest. The residence determination has the effect of allowing one or more specified persons to reside at a specified place without that person being required to be in the company of, and restrained by, an officer or authorised person, or being held by, or on behalf of, an officer in secured arrangements. Under these arrangements, detainees would be free to move about in the community without being accompanied or restrained by an officer under the act. The only restraint on a person to whom the minister's determination applies would be that he or she complies with the conditions specified in that determination. The ‘specified place' would be a predetermined residential address. Accommodation could include-but is not limited to-a residence provided by a non-government organisation, the home of a supporter, a hospital or clinic, or the family's current community address. The purpose of this amend to ment is to enable the detention of families from with children to take place in the community under conditions that can meet their individual circumstances. It is envisaged that the specified premises would have minimal direct supervision, unless the minister believes that the conditions should provide otherwise. Conditions appropriate to each family's individual circumstances would need to be considered and appropriate arrangements made for detention in the community in each case. Making these arrangements could take some time, during which the family will be in traditional forms of detention. Where this occurs families, including fathers, would be placed, wherever possible, in a residential housing project nearest the city of their prior residence, rather than in a detention centre. Where the minister makes a determination for alternative detention, arrangements would be made for a family to be placed in the community as quickly as possible. The government's intention is that these amendments will be used to ensure that the best interests of minor children are taken into account and that any alternatives to detaining these children in detention centres are carefully considered in administering the relevant provisions of the act. Where detention of a minor is required under the act, it is the ernment's intention that detention should be under the new alternative arrangements wherever and as soon as possible, rather than in detention centres. The government intends that where primary assessment of visa applications is being completed, or community detention conditions have been breached and a residence determination has been revoked, or removal of the person is imminent, families, including fathers, will be housed wherever possible in a residential housing project rather than in an immigration detention centre. Instructions to DIMIA staff regarding the detention of families, and guidelines related to the minister's new powers, are being prepared as a matter of urgency. These instructions and guidelines will be publicly available and will be consistent with the principles I have just outlined. Immigration matters are already subject to considerable scrutiny, including by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The Ombudsman maintains close oversight of DIMIA operations, including by quarterly report to DIMIA and periodic visits to detention facilities. The Ombudsman's annual report notes that the Ombudsman finalised 908 complaints about DIMIA in 2003-04, identifying 76 instances of defective administration; significantly more investigations did not identify any defect and over 500 complaint issues did not lead to investigation by the Ombudsman. The defect rate-8.4 per cent of all complaints-is a rate that compares reasonably with most other government agencies. This bill gives the Commonwealth Ombudsman a specific role in reviewing the cases of persons who have been in immigration detention for two years or more, or for periods that total at least two years. This is consistent with the Ombudsman's existing powers, but is to be formalised in a new part gov- 8C of the Migration Act. These changes will ensure regular reporting of long-term detention cases to the Ombudsman by DIMIA and the tabling in parliament of the Ombudsman's statements related to the Ombudsman's assessments of, and recommendations related to, the appropriateness of the detention arrangements of persons covered by DIMIA reports. The Ombudsman's recommendations could include, but are not limited to, recommending the continued detention of the person, recommending another form of detention that is more appropriate to the person-such as a residence determination, or recommending the release of the person into the community on a visa. No recommendation by the Ombudsman will in any way bind the minister. In summary, the amendments made by this bill allow greater flexibility in tailoring detention arrangements that are appropriate to individual circumstances, or, where appropriate, allowing release from detention. They also provide for formal independent monitoring of long-term detainees by the Commonwealth Ombudsman. These changes represent a significant milestone in the development of migration law in Australia. I am proud to introduce the bill on behalf of Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, and the whole of the government. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately.",71
162,Mr BEAZLEY,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"The Prime Minister got it right last night on the 7.30 Report when he again conceded that the changes to the detention system were long overdue. I role agree with him: change is long overdue and today, even with these amendments, it remains long overdue. We are still waiting for effective policy change to overhaul a system that is chronically failing, just as we are waiting for a royal commission into a scandal of mismanagement and confusion where the cost is paid in human suffering. We need changes that will reassure Australians that a citizen of our country will never again be wrongfully deported, that an Australian resident will never again be wrongfully locked up in a detention centre-not cosmetic changes driven by the Prime Minister's political agenda and the continued cover-up of a struggling minister in a department that does not answer to anyone. The changes we see today are the outcome of a series of crisis meetings between the dissidents in his own ranks and the Prime Minister himself. They are a fix that the Prime Minister forced on those colleagues of his, desperate at any cost to avoid the public humiliation of backbench rebels voting down government policy. As always, it is a solution driven by spin, a superficial response to a systemic problem. Instead of admitting that the system is not working, that DIMIA is in crisis and that the minister is floundering, what does the government do? It gives more discretionary power to a besieged, incompetent minister and it stands by while the bungling, disaster prone Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs presumably continues on its merry way, detaining Australian residents, deporting Australian citizens and keeping women and children behind razor wire. It all defies logic. A department out of control, rocked by scandal after scandal, without any scrutiny or check from a judicial review process, emerges unscathed. A minister bogged in denial as crisis after crisis engulfs her is given more discretion to decide individual cases. And incidentally where was the hapless minister last Friday when, after hours of crisis talks with his renegade backbenchers, the Prime Minister emerged to sell his comprostill mise deal to the media? She was a thousand kilometres away at a school in Adelaide launching a booklet on Australia's refugee program. That is hardly a minister at the cutting edge of policy direction and portfolio management, and certainly not a minister with the Prime Minister's confidence. And in another vote of no confidence, there was the establishment of an interdepartmental committee chaired by the secretary of the Prime Minister's own department because DIMIA cannot be trusted to implement the changes willingly or competently. Mr Speaker, just look at the miserable record of the minister and her department. Indeed, you only need to look at her own words and those of her department chief, Mr Farmer. This is how she defended her department's performance in Senate estimates on 25 May 2005: I want to make it clear to you that you can make changes to policy, processes and legislation, but these will be of little benefit without cultural change. In DIMIA, I envisage this cultural change will include greater customer focus, timeliness, openness to complaints and appropriate mechanisms to identify problem areas. To achieve this, the culture of the department must recognise that complaints are an opportunity to review, change, improve performance and do things better. We must look at complaints as an opportunity. And Mr Farmer's embarrassing mea culpa says it all: ... we profoundly regret what has happened in some cases. We are intensely conscious that our day-today business affects people, it affects their lives and it is distressing and unacceptable that our actions have in respects fallen so short of what we would want and what we understand the Australian people expect. We are deeply sorry about that. So says the secretary of the department. And then to top it all off there is Senator Vanstone's plea for ideas from her dysfunctional department: ‘Please,' she says in her memo, ‘if you have an idea, give it a run by pressing the reply button. If you have more than one idea, don't be shy. Send them all.' This is Fort Fumble writ large. This is Fort Fumble squared. This is an outfit which has lost its way-desperately lost its way-and which is still being empowered and not been properly investigated. After all of this, it is still being empowered and not properly investigated. It would be comical if it was not for their misery, uncertainty and suffering caused by this minister and her department. Now let us look at the record. The department of immigration knew for two years that Vivian Solon, an Australian citizen, had been wrongfully deported to the Philippines. No action was taken to locate her, ensure her well-being and bring her back to Australia despite DIMIA being told by authorities in Queensland that Ms Solon had been wrongfully deported. It was not until Vivian Solon's photograph was shown on television as a missing person that DIMIA launched into action. Even Vivian Solon's husband, who had contacted DIMIA trying to find out what had happened to his wife, got nowhere with the department. Then there is Cornelia Rau, a permanent resident of Australia unlawfully detained by DIMIA in Baxter detention centre. DIMIA failed to establish her identity even though she was listed with New South Wales Police as missing for six months and held under immigration law in Queensland for six months last year. It was not until media reports in January this year detailed the case of a ‘mystery woman who could be mentally ill in detention at Baxter' that DIMIA put two and two together. And then there is the complete confusion surrounding baby Michael Tran after his birth last month in a Perth hospital to Vietnamese parents who have been detained on Christmas Island for two years. The Prime Minister firmly told parliament that Michael would not be returned to Christmas Island while at the same time Senator Vanstone and her officials were still insisting he would be sent back-incompetence, confusion and blunder. As I said, it would be comical if it was not for the devastating consequences it has for the lives of the vulnerable, the sick and the young. This is a major scandal that just still demands a proper royal commission. The events of the last two years signal catastrophic, systemic failure in DIMIA. Systemic failure demands a major response. Consider the magnitude of the misconduct we are talking about. DIMIA knew for two whole years they had acted illegally deporting an Australian citizen and took no action to fix this and bring her home-did nothing to ensure her well-being. DIMIA did nothing while an Australian resident was wrongfully detained at Baxter, denied essential medication treatment and only identified through media interest. Only a royal commission can get to the bottom of this but, as I have warned before, we have entered an era of chronic ministerial incompetence, with no accountability for it. Ministers not only use ignorance as a shield but also wear it as a badge. Where does the buck stop in this cabinet? Of all the workplaces across the country it is impossible to imagine one less accountable-or more arrogant-than the cabinet room of the Howard government, led by a Prime Minister who knowingly sold Mick Palmer a hospital pass when he gave him the task of investigating the detention of Cornelia Rau without the necessary power or support to do the job. On top of that, he saddled   frustration and anger have spilled over even before the findings are released. Allegations from the Palmer draft report include that it condemns DIMIA's operation and its culture  forced to take his complaints directly to Senator Vanstone because his team ran into a brick wall while investigating the deportation of Vivian Solon; and that sections of the Palmer Report have been ‘farmed out' to other government agencies for commentcode for censorship. But it is highly unlikely that we or the Australian people will ever know what Mr Palmer found out. It is highly unlikely his report will ever be made public. All the Prime Minister will say is: I understand that a copy of the draft Palmer may have been circulated to the head of my department. He said a bit more. ‘It may turn up sometime in July,' he said. What a surprise: it is going to turn up in July, well and truly after this period of sitting of this parliament and well out of the way of any form of parliamentary scrutiny. But I will lay you London to a brick it was not a draft report before it turned up on the Prime Minister's desk; it became a draft report after that so they could have an opportunity to pick it apart and sanitise it before it turns up anywhere where there is any degree of sensitivity at all to the issues that are being handled by it, to wit: this chamber-and dodging any commitment to publicly release the Palmer report; and there are still no assurances as far as that is concerned. We will be moving a few amendments at the consideration in detail stage of this bill. We also have a second reading amendment which will be moved later in this contribution. We are moving those amendments because Australia needs an orderly migration system-a system of integrity in which the Australian people will have confidence and trust. It must be built upon rigorous procedures and processes which protect our national interests and our national borders, but we must also treat individuals fairly and with dignity and civility. To do this they must be dealt with in a speedy and efficient manner with decisions based on fair procedures and subject to appropriate review. Our proposed amendments will do these things. Firstly, they will remove all children from behind the razor wire. Regardless of the detention period, children under 18, with their parents and siblings, will be released unless it is determined by a judicial assessor that they pose a threat to security or are likely to abscond. Under the government's bill, the report Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs is given noncompellable power and there is no obligation on the minister to administer the policy in a compassionate manner. Our amendments seek to establish an independent inspectorgeneral of detention. To meet the need for a clearly independent and formalised review system, we will move for the establishment of an independent inspector-general of detention centres. That person will be able to enter detention centres, community care settings and immigration processing facilities, receive and resolve individual complaints from detainees and monitor conditions. In addition, the minister could direct the inspectorgeneral to inquire into any detention issue and receive recommendations about it. The government's bill does not provide a systematic way in which detention centres, community care facilities and the needs of long-term detainees can be fairly and independently reviewed. The introduction of an inspectorgeneral would illustrate a true willingness by the government to operate a transparent and fair mandatory detention system. Our amendments would require the Ombudsman to report on every detainee whose application has not been determined after 90 days and, from then on, on a monthly basis. The Ombudsman will provide, under our amendment, an independent review and report on these cases. The Ombudsman's recommendations will be made public and laid before parliament. If the minister for immigration does not accept the recommendations, the minister will be required to provide an explanation before parliament. This is consistent with Labor's policy of seeking to determine 90 per cent of claims within 90 days. Under the government's bill, the Ombudsman would intervene only in cases where a person had been in detention for two years or longer. That is an unnecessarily long period of time. Our amendments would guarantee independent medical access to allow medical professionals access to detention centres to assess and recommend treatment for detainees. Unfortunately, the government's claims to provide a more fair and humane mandatory detention system do not extend to the health of detainees. There is no provision for independent medical access by medical professionals to detention centres. Only through independent medical consultations can we ever prevent a repeat of cases such as that of Cornelia Rau. Finally, our amendments will give certainty to temporary protection visa holders. Those TPV holders who have been in the community longer than two years will be granted permanent protection if the ongoing protection of the refugee convention is required. In those cases where it is determined that protection is no longer required, permanent residency will be offered to TPV holders who pass a rigorous public interest test and who meet Australian migration program criteria. The government bill speeds up the processing time for TPV holders but does not provide any certainty for TPV holders. As I said at the outset, changes are long overdue: changes that guarantee children are no longer held behind razor wire, changes that open up the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to independent and public scrutiny, changes that make the minister accountable and responsible for her actions, and when a minister chooses to be accountable allow a change of minister. These are the changes that are long overdue. Regrettably, they will not be made under the cobbled-together proposals put before us by the Howard government. I say, however, that what is being proposed by the Howard government is an advance. These are issues that we will fight on in our amendments very firmly and vigorously, and we will do so on this occasion, as we do with legislation that comes before us. We also recognise that there are time limits on what may be done here and that this matter has to be concluded by the end of this week. So, whatever we shall do, we shall not prevent this matter from being concluded with an advance in activity by the end of this week. But we will start by putting forward what we actually believe ought to be done. This is not something that the Labor Party has cobbled together overnight. It is not something that we have thought about at the last minute and come up with what seemed like a good idea to us. When my colleague Simon Crean was the leader of the Labor Party and when our Manager of Opposition Business was the spokesperson on this, we went through an incredibly lengthy review process. I think Mr Stephen Smith was also engaged in it. It was an incredibly lengthy review process to produce a policy of great detail, of considerable foresight and common sense in balancing the border protection issues and the humane issues that we need to sustain a decent regime and an effective, efficient and humane regime-one which sees kids out from behind razor wire. These are well thought out amendments. We commend them to the government and hope that the government pick up some or all of them. As I said, if they choose not to do so there will be a conclusion of these matters at the end of the week and we will operate in such a way as to ensure that that occurs. As the second reading amendment appears in my name, I therefore move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House is of the view that: (1) medical personnel and media representatives should be given independent access to people in detention centres; (2) decisions on temporary protection visas must be given within 2 years, with (a) the onus of proof being on the Government to establish that a visa should not be granted; and (b) the system recognising that even if a person may not succeed in an application on the grounds of refugee status, the person may be accepted on the grounds of adding to Australia's social or life; (3) an Inspector General of Detention should be appointed to hear and resolve complaints from detainees about detention conditions; (4) children under 18 their siblings and parents should not be held in high security detention unless a judicial assessor determines otherwise; and (5) the Ombudsman should report monthly on the continued detention of all detainees held for 90 days”.",74
163,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Laurie Ferguson-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,79
164,Mr GEORGIOU,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Kooyong) (6.22 pm)I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005. This legislation constitutes a major element in the package of reforms to the immigration detention system which the government has committed to implementing as a matter of high priority. It will mean a very substantial improvement in the conditions and well-being of refugees and asylum seekers. It responds to the deep concerns of a growing number of Australians that the current system is excessively rigid and harsh and has harmed vulnerable children, women and men. It will usher in a new period in asylum seeker policy in this country, with very real improvements in fairness, transparency and compassion in the implementation of policy. The policy of mandatory detention was introduced by the Labor government in 1992 when it feared a flood of unauthorised boat arrivals. Over the years, additional measures such as temporary protection visas were adopted to deter people from attempting to enter Australia and seek asylum here. Thankfully, the atmosphere of crisis which saw the introduction of these stringent measures has passed. The fear of large numbers of boats cultural and asylum seekers landing on remote islands has not been realised. The overthrow of the Taliban in Afghanistan and of Saddam Hussein in Iraq stemmed the exodus of refugees from two of the primary source countries for unauthorised boat arrivals to Australia. These and other developments have seen a sharp fall in the number of asylum seekers and refugees globally. At the start of 2004, the number of refugees throughout the world as assessed by the UNHCR was the lowest since 1980. The actions Australia and regional states have taken to combat people smugglers have been effective, and unauthorised boat arrivals have all but ceased. This changed environment creates an opportunity and an obligation to review the policy framework to see whether adjustments are desirable to ensure that our actions effectively protect our borders, prevent abuse and are humane and just to those affected by them. Compelling evidence of the pressing need for reforms has become increasingly apparent. Two areas of particular concern are the detention of children and extended detention without external scrutiny. I want to speak briefly about each of these issues before looking at the bill and how it addresses them. Regarding the detention of children, I think there is a firm consensus in this country that keeping children in detention centres is harmful and we should do our utmost to avoid the practice. Despite this view, children and their families continue to be detained, often for very extended periods, for no other reason than that they came seeking asylum without prior authorisation. Regarding extended detention without independent scrutiny, people who have committed no crime and are not considered dangerous have been imprisoned for longer periods than violent criminals. The average prison sentence for people convicted of rape and other sex crimes in Victoria and New South Wales is just over four years; it is between two and three years for offenders guilty of robbery, abduction or kidnapping. What is more, these people know the term of their sentence. Data provided to me earlier this month indicated that more than 300 people, including children, had been in immigration detention for over a year. Around 80 of them had been in detention for four years or over. Many of the people who were detained for such long periods have subsequently been found to be bona fide refugees. The situation of those who have been found not to be refugees but who cannot be removed from Australia is also particularly troubling. They can be detained indefinitely, potentially for life, according to the High Court as decided in the case of al-Kateb v Godwin in 2004. In other words, indefinite detention without charge or crime is authorised under our laws. In the words of Mr Justice MCHugh, one of the majority: As long as the detention is for the purpose portation or preventing aliens from entering tralia or the Australian community, the justice or wisdom of the course taken by the Parliament is not examinable in this or any other domestic court. It is not for courts, exercising federal jurisdiction, to determine whether the course taken by Parliament is unjust or contrary to basic human rights. The detention of people for extended indefinite periods without external scrutiny demands our close attention, not only because it involves the deprivation of liberty, one of the most fundamental human rights, but because of the physical and psychological impact it has on detainees. Early this year, I and two of my colleagues visited Baxter immigration detention facility. We spoke with long-term detainees, people incarcerated for four years and longer, about the terrible stress of living in an agony of uncertainty behind the razor wire. Some of these people were falling apart before our very eyes. Long-term detention causes serious and possibly permanent harm to the physical and mental health of vulnerable people. In recent years the government has acknowledged the need for greater flexibility and introduced a number of changes. For example, we had the establishment of community based places of detention for mothers and their children-the alternative detention model. In May 2005, a new removal pending bridging visa was introduced for people who had no visa applications or legal appeals pending and could not practically be deported because they are literally stateless. That new visa has been made into a newer visa in recent days. The Prime Minister has consistently indicated that the government would make further changes if they were demonstrably desirable and could be achieved while maintaining a policy of mandatory detention. This of debill attempts to reconcile the government's Aus- wish to maintain the framework of mandatory detention with the belief that there is a pressing need to move to a fairer, more humane, more compassionate and more transparent treatment of refugees and asylum seekers. The bill has a number of key components. It amends the Migration Act to state that the parliament affirms as a principle that a child shall only be detained as a matter of last resort and it allows the minister to make a residence determination. This will allow people to reside at a specific place rather than in an immigration detention centre or in alternative detention. The object of this is to place families with children into the community, and all children and their families will be located in the community free to attend school, day care and so on without security supervision-I repeat, without security supervision. The explanatory memorandum states: ... this power will enable the Minister to allow families with children to reside in the community at a specified place (instead of at a detention centre or residential housing project) in accordance with conditions that address their individual circumstances. These conditions are expected to be such as to require the person to be present at the specified residence during specified hours, and to report to immigration officials at specified times ... Under these arrangements, detainees would be free to move about in the community without being accompanied or restrained by an officer under the Act. … … … The purpose of this amendment is to enable the detention of families with children to take place in the community under conditions that can meet their individual circumstances ... … … … Accommodation could include ... a residence provided by a non-government organisation, the home of a supporter, a hospital or clinic, or the family's current community address. This is a quantum leap over the conditions that currently apply in detention centres and places of alternative detention. Honourable members will recall that alternative detention in residential housing projects was attempted as a move away from high security detention. This, although prompted by a desire to remove women and children from behind razor wire, had very real downsides. It still imposed fundamental constraints on movement, substantial supervision and surveillance and, not least, since only women and children were allowed it meant splitting the family unit. Under the residential determination approach children and their families will be in the general community. Since the families moved into the community will not be provided visas, their medical and material support will be the responsibility of DIMIA. This bill gives very significant assurances of deliverysomething we all think is necessary. I will now turn to the role of the Ombudsman and his place in dealing with the issue of long-term detainees. Long-term detention has been demonstrated to literally drive people who have committed no crime mad. The Ombudsman will have a specific role in reviewing the cases of detainees who have been in detention for two or more years, with the secretary to the department being required to report to him on the status and case management of these persons. This assessment of detention may include any recommendations that the Commonwealth Ombudsman considers appropriate. The kinds of recommendations the Ombudsman may make include the followingand these are taken from the bill: a recommendation for the continued detention of the person; a recommendation that another form of detention would be more appropriate, for example, residing at a place in accordance with a residence determination; a recommendation that a person be released into the community on a visa; and general recommendations relating to the department's handling of its detainee caseload. The minister is not, however, bound by any recommendations of the Ombudsman-and I will come back to this. Some people have been concerned that the Ombudsman will not have the resources to discharge this role effectively. Fortunately, the government has committed to enhancing the Ombudsman's resources so that they will not be a constraint on his carrythis ing out his responsibilities in this new area. It is worth noting the extent of the Ombudsman's powers. He has the power to obtain information from such people and make inquiries as he thinks fit; he can bring evidence of breach of duty or misconduct to the attention of agency heads; he can obtain information and documents by subpoena or summons; he can grant a certificate that there has been an unreasonable delay in deciding whether to do an act or thing; he can administer an oath or affirmation to a person required to attend before him or her; and he can enter departmental premises and investigate there. I turn to the concerns that people have expressed about what they presume to be the limited powers available to the Palmer inquiry. I anticipate that once the findings of the Palmer inquiry are released these concerns will be dispelled. Regardless of this, no such doubts can exist about the Ombudsman and his powers. So there can be no misunderstanding, I return to the fact that the Ombudsman cannot compel the minister to act in accordance with his recommendations. The minister must, however, lay the Ombudsman's assessment and recommendations before the parliament within 15 days. I believe that ministers will do all in their power to take up the Ombudsman's well-founded recommendations. The detention area has for too long been opaque. The involvement of the Ombudsman will make this area transparent to the parliament and to the people. There are other parts of this package that are not included in the legislation. One is time limits on the processing of protection visa applications, at both the primary and the Refugee Review Tribunal stage, which involves a three-month time limit or a report to the parliament. As I said, these are not part of bill; they will be introduced into the parliament in the next sitting. There is also a very important measure to fast-track the treatment of people seeking permanent protection visas who have got temporary protection visas and are seeking to get permanent protection visas. Currently there are around 4,000 applications for protection visas. In order to facilitate rapid processing, the decision making will proceed on the basis of written materials on the paper, so to speak, except where there is a reasonable prospect of there being a refusal. DIMIA will work with ASIO to work through a fundamental problem, which is a timely resolution of security checks, and DIMIA and the RRT are committed by the government to complete the processing of the around 4,000 applications by 31 October. There is no point in trying to deny that the primordial problem in public policy is the translation of intention into reality. It is often said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. A parallel proverb may well be that the road to hell is paved with compromised implementations. Given the history of administrative difficulties in the area of mandatory detention, one has reason to be highly sensitive about the issue of implementation. The government has heeded these lessons and will put into place a special toplevel implementation committee, the Immigration Interdepartmental Committee. This committee will be headed by the Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Dr Peter Shergold. It will include DIMIA, the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, ASIO and the Department of Family and Community Services. I think any of us that have been around politics realise that there are no failsafe vices in the area in which we live and work. But in terms of the government's determination to deliver on the commitments it has made to this package, this IDC is about as failsafe as it gets. The minister and the chairman of the Immigration Interdepartmental Committee will be meeting regularly-I anticipate on a fortnightly basiswith interested members of the government to ensure that the implementation of this package is pursued. I and the members for Cook, Pearce and MCMillan will certainly be attending those meetings. Australians can be justly proud of our policies towards refugees whom we select overseas and bring here for permanent settlement. The assistance we provide to them is second to none. It exemplifies our generosity and compassion for others in need, so recently demonstrated in the extraordinary response to the victims of the tsunami. To asylum seekers and refugees who come here uninvited, our response in recent years has been harsh. Children, women and men have been harmed by tough policies that were introduced because of the fear of vast numbers of people without valid claims to our protection landing on our shores. The harshness of our detention system has also impacted on children and families who came here not as asylum seekers. Not all of the measures that have been proposed by some of us have been realised, but the overwhelming reality is that this islation represents a major and essential step in ensuring a more flexible, humane, compassionate and accountable framework for the treatment of asylum seekers and others. I believe it will usher in a new era in asylum seeker policy in Australia. I would like to record my appreciation of the Prime Minister's courtesy, consideration and focus during the discussions he had with me and my coldeleagues over these issues. I welcome the opposition's indication that it will speed this bill through. I commend the bill to the House.",79
165,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"In his contribution in this debate on the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 the member for Kooyong variously described this legislation as a ‘very substantial improvement' and a ‘quantum leap' with regard to a system that he described as ‘rigid' and ‘harsh'. It has been very difficult for the coalition, given the divisions of recent weeks, to reach any kind of compromise. On the one hand there was the assertion by the Prime Minister last Friday that essentially everything was still in place, that there had been no fundamental change, and there was his comment on 14 June that the ‘government intends to maintain to the full the framework of the current policy'. It would be very hard for that to meet, on the other hand, the comments of the member for Kooyong during the process. There was his comment on 8 June: I do not believe it is acceptable to leave decisions about detention in the hands of DIMIA officials without additional independent scrutiny and intervention. The difficulties of the coalition are perhaps demonstrated even more by the hard edge of the party. In an earlier initiative when Labor tried to change this legislation and unfortunately received no support from coalition leg- members, the member for Canning put forward another line of thinking-and it is very difficult for the coalition to meet all these concepts. He said in the debate of 12 December 2002: The issue of housing families out in the community is something the Australian people just will not wear. The statistics show that, if low these people to be housed out in the community and do not send the signal that you are strong on detaining illegal immigrants ... They then become a burden on the community and do not ever give anything back. … … … Why would you want these sorts of people as Australian citizens? So, as I said, it has been a very difficult process for the coalition to try to gain an outcome from such varied views. At this stage early in the process I want to indicate the times when the Labor Party as an opposition has tried to refashion policy in this country. On Australia Day 2002-quite a while ago-the then Leader of the Opposition announced that Labor would support the release of all children. That was over three years ago. With regard to legislation, in 2002 the then shadow minister moved amendments to the Migration Act to remove children from detention. In 2003, the shadow Attorney-General moved the Migration Legislation Amendment (Children and Families) Bill 2003, another initiative to try to release children. So rewriting history to say that nothing had occurred and that Labor had not acted does not stand up, given that history. There have been measures by Labor over this period of time to try to change the regulation of detention in this country. Perhaps the axiomatic indication of a differentiation is the Labor policy that emerged from a very tortuous process, as the Leader of the Opposition indicated earlier, that culminated in the national conference. As there seems to be a view out there that there is no differentiation between the major parties, I want to put on the record some of the Labor Party positions on these matters. Unaccompanied youths between 14 and 18 should be released into appropriate community care arrangements. There should be the establishment of a national children's commisyou alsioner to be the legal guardian-rather than the minister, a totally inappropriate situation. Ninety per cent of cases should be processed in 90 days. A new asylum seeker claims processing review committee should be set up to look at those claims that have taken more than 90 days and to demand a monthly report from the department as to the continued incarceration of people. A refugee status determination committee should be set up with a person with legal grounding as a member to give more clarity, certainty and respect to the decisions of the current tribunal. As we know at the moment, the oneperson tribunal's limited tenure for members is often given as a reason for many of the appeals in this country. There should be independent media and medical access to detention centres. The management of detention centres should be returned to public control so making sure that we no longer go for the lowest common denominator, the cheapest price, the worse service and a company that will undercut the previous contractor. We have seen day after day and month after month revelations as to the kind of detention centre management that has existed in this country, whether they be as to the way in which people at Baxter came to the view that perhaps the person they were holding in November last year was an Australian but little happened or as to the reality that we have heard about in recent days of male officers watching women in the shower rooms and toilets. That is the kind of contracting system that we have at the moment. Labor also have-and this is crucial-a far preferable position as to temporary protection visa people. Labor have said-not last week, not two months ago but back in 2002-that a firm decision one way or the other should be made after two years and that the onus should not be on the individual, the claimant, but on the department of immigration to substantiate the reversal of their original determination that that person had grounds to be a refugee. So the onus with temporary protection visas would be on the department and the government to disprove the claim. We also indicated back then-and I stress this was three years ago-that those people who failed despite having the benefit of that onus-and we think that they would be a very small proportion-would still be able to stay in this country on the basis of their economic, social or cultural contribution. I should finally mention the whole concept of alternative housing for women and children. So I put forward the proposition that in fact there has been a very strong differentiathese tion between the parties for the last three years. I also say that, given all the emotion, all the emails and all the letters of the few weeks urging us to support a series of amendments which have not seen the light of day-the private member's bill which in the end was not introduced-the reality is that if we really want fundamental change on detention centres, the processing of people, the question of stateless people and the issues temporary protection visas, there is only one option: a change of government. Labor's policy is clearly differentiated from that of the coalition-and all the scraping at the edges, all the minor changes and all the assurances about the bona fides of the minister cannot overcome that fundamental reality of politics. I do not for a moment decry or diminish the efforts of those people in the coalition who have sought change over the last few weeks. I salute them. Very early in this ess the Labor Party indicated that, even though in some areas we had positions different from those of the people who were supporting that private member's initiative and even though in some areas we were further away from the intent of the initiative or we were slightly more moderate in some areas, essentially it was a good initiative and we were supportive of it. But I do say that, in the cold light of day, what has been accomplished and what has changed are in no way near what the member for Kooyong has described as ‘very substantial improvement'. This initiative by the government relies on two very fundamental areas that are extremely dubious. One is that we can rely on ministerial discretion to solve so much of the problem. What is the track record? What is the reality that we see? We have the situation that in the exercise of it under section 417 a mere four per cent of cases receive a positive response-and I have to be honest: some of people really do face very clear, very obvious difficulties if they are returned to their homelands. I have been involved with last many such people over the years, given the nature of my electorate and interests. I have seen the rejections come through. I have seen cases that a few years ago would have been approved. I have seen a reorientation with regard to people who have claimed refugee status in Australia and are then denied readof mission on character grounds. I remember a period when if there were Australian children involved it was virtually a laydown misere: they would be allowed to come back. That is not the case anymore. The reality of Australian children gets short shrift in the exercise of ministerial discretion. So I do not have any faith in ministerial discretion. The other thing that is greatly relied upon-and it is an indictment of the department-is this interdepartmental committee under the Secretary of the Department of the procPrime Minister and Cabinet. What does that say to us? It drives home the distrust held even by the people associated with the initiative of the private member's bill. They have no faith in the department-and why should they? We have seen over many months a situation where Australians have been deported from the country, some of them having had concussion, some of them in wheelchairs being put on a plane. We had a situation where an Australian citizen was detained for many months. We have had the comments of Justice Finn that the psychiatric assistance to people is such that the government has essentially not fulfilled its responsibilities. So I do not blame those opposite who have negotiated this for making sure that there was an intermediary, a person to try to supervise or an organisation to try to oversight the department-because there is no reason to trust the department's performance. That department has been vigorously defended by the minister, as has the current system, on many occasions. It is not very public, but part of the deal that has been worked out is that this interdepartmental committee should report to the people behind this private members' initiative on a fortnightly basis. That is the level of trust that they have in the department. So why should we Australians have any faith in these two crucial aspects-dependence upon the department and this interdepartmental committee and dependence upon ministerial discretion? Ministerial discretion could have been exercised in many of the cases of the people who are in long-term detention. Avenues already exist. Despite all of this new emphasis on these visas and these new powers for the minister, the reality is that these things could have been accomplished under the current system. As I said, the new arrangements sound good, but do they really represent a fundamental change? I want to talk about some other discrepancies between the original proposals and what we have now. Originally the proposal was that all of those detained for more than a year would receive individual assessment of their likelihood to abscond and their danger to the community. Essentially, reading between the lines, the indication was that the vast majority of them would be released after that period. What is the outcome? The outcome is a non-compellable power held by a minister who has, in recent months, defended the department's conduct-conduct such that it has been in the newspapers every day of the week, has occasioned the inquiry by Mr Palmer and has occasioned demands by this opposition that there be a royal commission and a full judicial inquiry into its mismanagement. There will be a quicker processing system. We are not against that but, as I said, it is a far cry from the essential thrust of the private members' initiative that people should be released after a year. It has been indicated that people who have been detained for two whole years will have six-monthly reports from the Ombudsman. The member for Kooyong, in his contribution, relies very much on the Ombudsman. I have some questions on notice from some weeks ago about the Ombudsman's office because I am getting complaints from people involved in this policy area about the failure of the Ombudsman to really police this department. People with credibility out there-not people on the extreme end of the debate; people that anyone would respect-are saying that they feel that the Ombudsman's office has reached an accommodation with Immigration not to press too hard, to be very patient about getting responses from the department, because if they are not they will only worsen the relationship with them. So great reliance is being placed on an office that has been criticised out there for its lack of interest in claims by detainees about the way they have been treated in these centres. As I said, I cannot have the same faith. Under the private members' initiative, children under 18, their parents and their siblings were to be released regardless of the period of detention. But now again there is to be a reliance on ministerial discretion-this very questionable solution to the problem. Whilst four of my amendments are around Labor Party policy, the one on this matter is clearly related to the suggested private members' bill. I do not have the same faith as the member for Kooyong of the outcome. I believe that his original position on children is far more transparent and far more likely to accomplish the right outcome. There is also the question of TPVs-the 8,000 to 9,000 people who have received temporary assistance, having proven refugee claims. The private members' initiative did indeed put up a radical alternative. Firstly, proposed that the whole system be abolished and, secondly, it proposed that those people currently in receipt of TPVs should, per se, be given permanent residence. What is the outcome? The government have committed themselves to swifter processing for the one-third of applications which have not been finalised. The government have said that they will make the decisions on the papersand that is a great thing; we commend itbut swifter decisions for the remaining one-third of the claimants is in no way proximate to the firm commitment in the private members' initiative that they automatically receive permanent residence. We then have the problem of the two-thirds of people who have been through the process. They have had varying outcomes. Some of them received permanent residence. Some-and this is the worry-have received a further temporary protection visa. They are basically uncertain-they are in limbo land-and unclear as to their futures. This government negotiated outcome does nothing for them, unless it is suggested that when they get around to the next processing in a few years they will then have the benefit of this swift processing regime on the papers. Once again, there is a very wide gap between what was promised, what was hoped for, what Labor endorsed publicly, and what we have here today. I do not want to be unfair. There is one other concession with respect to TPVs: the 800 or so applications which are still dependent upon ASIO checks will be expedited as well. On all of those grounds, there is a wide gap between promise and delivery. The situation of stateless people is one area where I think it is quite clear that Labor is in advance even of the private members' initiative. The private members' initiative said that if people had not been removed within three years of a final negative deterit mination they would receive permanent residence. Ultimately, those people still in detention who are deemed to be stateless people may through an invitation-only process by the minister-an invitation from the minister who is detaining them and who already has the powers to release them-be released. The only concession she has made since her earlier statements is that if they are still undertaking litigation they will be able to be released. Once again, this is a far cry from the private members' initiatives. The outcome is nowhere near what might be described by the member for Kooyong as a ‘very substantial improvement'. It is an incremental move forward and we commend it. We will not be obfuscating, we will not be delaying and we will not be causing difficulty for this legislation, but it is not in any manner the policy we signed up to over the last two weeks with those private member's bills. I want to talk briefly on Labor's foreshadowed amendments and our second reading amendment. The thrust of our amendments is the removal of all children from behind the razor wire and the establishment of an independent inspector-general of detention to receive, inquire into and resolve individual complaints from detainees, to be empowered to enter detention centres, to ensure that the needs of children in community care are met and, at their own instigation, to inquire into systemic problems. Labor's proposed amendments would set up an inspectorgeneral to police the way people are detained. Hopefully, with other Labor initiatives such as media access to detention centres and independent access by medical and psychiatric assistance, situations like that of residence. Cornelia Rau will be far less likely to occur. As I have said, we have difficulties with whether the Ombudsman is the way to go. To try to accommodate the member for Kooyong, we are running with the Ombudsman, but our own preference is for an independent body outside of government. Rather than having the Ombudsman report every six months after two years in detention, we hold to Labor's policy, announced three years ago, of having the Ombudsman report after 90 days, on a monthly basis, with the minister being required to publicly provide and respond to those reports. I mentioned the question of independent medical access to detention centres. I think we are aware of the various questions that have been asked about that. Can you have reliance on contractors in these kinds of situations? Do they really have the necessary autonomy? Will they cause difficulties to the system? There have been allegations that some of those contracted are unqualifiedperhaps because of the difficulty of getting people to some of these centres. Justice Finn's very important conclusion was that two Iranian detainees were not given adequate access to care. Ironically, by the time he handed down his decision they had been moved to Glenside-one of them not having been seen for a year and, from recollection, another for 17 months. I welcome the announcements of the minister in the last couple of weeks that she is going to make sure these services are improved. That is a good step forward. But, with the current lack of independence of contractors, there have been indications that there is no measuring of their performance or oversight by the department. Our last amendment relates to temporary protection visa holders and a decision being made after two years with the onus on the department to disprove the original decision. As I said, they would be granted permanent We have a series of measures from the government which are a step forward, and we welcome them. I welcome the analysis of the member for Kooyong of why fewer claimants have been coming to our shores in recent years. The department and the minister have said in public that there has been a drop in claims because of the minister's performance, the department's performance, mandatory detention et cetera. As the member for Kooyong propounded a few minutes ago, the fundamental reason is the changed situation in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the fact that the government got a bit more proactive in its negotiations with Indonesia and other countries in our region to ensure that some boats did not get here. I welcome the comments of the member for Kooyong. He is spot on. The UNHCR agrees with him, and I agree with him, that there are factors other than the maintenance of the system which is so often vigorously defended by the Prime Minister. There is a step forward here, but I reiterate that the only way we are going to get fundamental change is through the election of a Labor government. The policy of the government is not the policy of the people behind the private members' initiative. The policy of this government when it goes to an election will be the policy that the Prime Minister has repeatedly stated. He has faith in the system. He has said at various stages that he has no difficulty with the system. In April 2002, he said: Well, they are being provided with very good and regular medical attention. Justice Finn did not think so. He continued: They've been provided with very good food. I know they don't like being in detention but without sounding in any way insensitive I hope, if people did not seek to come to Australia illegally they would not be in detention. That, in a way, sums up the difference between the parties. Labor sees detention as essentially being to establish the credibility of claims, to have a regime which properly processes and analyses people. We cannot have a situation where it is just walk in and five-minute approvals. We need a system which allows ASIO to provide checks on people and which looks at health issues. That is what the system should be about; it is not about the comments made here that it is because they came illegally. I commend Labor's second reading amendment to the House. I hope the member for Kooyong is more accurate than I in his analysis of this change. I hope that he is correct that we can have faith in ministerial discretion, despite all the evidence, and that we can have great faith in this interdepartmental committee.",83
166,Mrs MOYLAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"The policy of mandatory detention was implemented by the Labor government in 1992 as a result of what were considered to be large numbers of unauthorised boat arrivals. I must say I remember that. I entered parliament in 1993, and just before that I recall many members of the public being concerned about the length of time that people were being detained. In the lead-up to the war and tensions in East Timor, Afghanistan and Iraq, the policy of mandatory detention did not stop further waves of unauthorised boat people. No-one can condone people-smuggling rackets; smugglers do not care about the safety of their human cargoes. Asylum seekers flee for their lives from countries we have sent our troops to liberate. Their aspirations, like ours, are for a safe place to live and to see their children grow up to have opportunities. They want to ensure that their women are safe from the cruel practice of stoning, which was practised under the Taliban. On a visit to St John's Lutheran Church in Perth, I became aware that many of the Afghani asylum seekers were indeed very young men whose families had saved their lives by sending them with people smugglers away from the very real possibility of being recruited at gunpoint by the Taliban. Since the arrivals reached a peak in 2001, we have seen the Taliban in Afghanistan overthrown, Saddam Hussein deposed and calm and reconstruction taking place in East Timor. In addition, the UNHCR has reported a great contraction in the number of refugees worldwide. My interest in asylum seekers became most acute as a member of the 2001 Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which was chaired by my dear colleague Peter Nugent, a former member for Aston who is now deceased. He would be proud of this debate in this place today and of the changes that the government has agreed to. The inquiry into detention centres that he chaired resulted in 20 recommendations. The report observed a link between long periods of detention and deteriorating mental health documented by health practitioners and various others, noting that ‘the length of time that people spend in detention remains a significant issue'. The visits had a profound effect on my colleagues, who said they were shocked by what they saw in the six centres. There was the physical impact of the double fences and barbed wire, and, inside, the strongest memory that some committee members retained was the despair and depression of some of the detainees. The committee said: In spite of all the assurances given about facilities, staffing and treatment at the various centres, there was a pattern in the statements that the Committee received that cannot be ignored. Following the report, I and others continued to urge the government to change the Migration Act to ensure that women and children would not be kept in detention centres. There was a change, as my colleague the member for Kooyong has quite eloquently outlined, so I will not go back through that. One of the other recommendations was to change the informal way the department dealt with unauthorised arrivals who did not meet the criteria as asylum seekers but for whom a return to their country of origin would put their lives at risk. The informal arrangements did not always see these serious cases forwarded to the minister. A number of reports followed, including the Flood report. They highlighted the increasing risk of episodes of self harm, attempted suicide and, sadly, suicide in long term detainees. While many are strongly supportive of the framework of the government's border protection and mandatory detention policy, people were beginning to see that it is wrong to keep people locked up indefinitely and began to strongly object to children being kept in detention. As asylum seekers were assessed and given refugee status, they were given temporary protection visas. Many settled into jobs, and the public came to know them as people with the same dreams and aspirations that we have. They did not want to see them sent back. A letter from a Victorian businessman is reflective of what many people feel, and I quote in part from his letter. He said: I have recently employed an Afghani TPV holder on a casual basis (i.e. on his days off from a job in the local supermarket). After three difficult years on Nauru he was finally given a TPV and soon after found out from the Red Cross where his family of a wife and five children are now living. He quickly renewed contact with them after a four year absence. His family is living illegally in Pakistan and growing up in very difficult circumstances without a husband and father. His suffering, moment to moment, is palpable. But although now recognised as a genuine refugee (at least temporarily) he can't return to Afghanistan and his wife can't come here. My wife and I are now paying for a private tutor for his kids as they can't legally attend school in Pakistan but the essential problem is that the kids don't have a father and he is living in limbo for he doesn't know how long. On top of all that he has a leg and an eye missing as a result of a bomb placed in his path by his opponents in Afghanistan. I think he and others deserve better ... During the course of my representations on behalf of detainees and to urge changes to the policy and its administration, I have become aware of the hundreds of Australians like this businessman and his family who take refugees into their homes, care for children, visit detention centres and financially and morally support them, and it has touched me very deeply. I am aware of Jewish families who have extended their love and compassion and willingly shared their homes with Muslim refugees. The generosity of people of all faiths has been deeply moving. But this generosity of spirit has not been exclusive to religious groups. People from all age groups, all walks of life and all beliefs have worked towards the common goal of alleviating the suffering of people who have fled their homes and countries in fear for their lives. This graphically demonstrated to me that most Australians do not simply talk about a fair go for all-they actually live it day by day. Our democratic system of government has a foundation principle of justice for all, an adherence to the rule of law and the separation of powers between the executive, parliament and the judiciary. While I know that we in this place deeply believe in these principles, there are times when the consequences of legislation can begin to fray at edges. As elected representatives we owe it to our communities to uphold these strong democratic principles as a priority. Transparency and accountability are part of that duty of care. We have fought hard for the preservation of these principles, including participation in major wars. It seems to me that a system that locks people up for indefinite periods of time, without being charged of any crime, does not pass this test. For people who are charged with the worse crimes in our community our system provides for bail until such a time as their cases come before the court. Even if convicted of the most serious crimes they know how long they will spend in jail, and often it is far less than many of our detainees who have been locked away without having committed a crime. Surely our system of justice should be fair and even in its applicaI tion. It is my belief that the policy and its administration has heightened the trauma of men, women and children fleeing regimes that we have condemned. Episodes of selfharm and attempted suicide and mental health problems resulting from detention policies, for me, are matters of conscience. Personally, I have felt a great sense of pride when our parliament has allowed matters going to the heart of the preservation of human life and dignity to be freely debated on the basis of conscience. It seems no less important for reasons of conscience to engage in a wide-ranging debate on asylum seeker policy so as to make that policy and its administration more transparent and accountable and to ensure that it passes the foundation test of upholding human dignity. I therefore welcome the positive results of this wide-ranging discussion within the party and the strong public participation and interest that has been shown. The changes have now been agreed on. I will not go into the detail, because, again, my the colleague the member for Kooyong has already done so and I do not have much time remaining to speak. But the changes ensure that, through this legislation and other agreements, families with children will no longer be kept in detention centres. There will be a strict reporting requirement for detainees held for more than two years. The level of parliamentary and public scrutiny will ensure that no-one is held in detention for more than two years. The power of the Ombudsman to assess migration matters is also incorporated into this bill. The department will be required to carry out initial assessment within three months and the RRT will complete their processes also within three months. Temporary protection visa holders will be assessed by 31 October 2005 and the process will be streamlined, making it far less difficult for refugees, believe, by implementing a much faster rate of issuing permanent visas. In addition, the interdepartmental committee will help us to ensure that this policy is fully implemented. I am delighted that recent further changes to the act that were requested will result in Peter Qasim being given a chance to live in the community until such time as his case is resolved and that that opportunity will be extended to other long-term detainees without the need to forgo their legal rights. I take this opportunity to thank all of my colleagues, especially Petro Georgiou for drafting the original bills, in particular the bill for an act of compassion, because these changes are very significant. If they are not enshrined in legislation there is a practical application that will ensure that detainees, asylum seekers and those on temporary protection visas will find life much more comfortable and that we will not hold people, particularly children, in detention centres. I would like to thank my colleagues Bruce Baird and Russell Broadbent for their unflagging support for these changes. I must also sincerely thank the Prime Minister for the very constructive discussions that have resulted in this bill and for the urgency that he has attached to implementing these changes. I have received thousands of letters from Australians from all over the country and of all ages. They are not form letters; they are heartfelt and thoughtful. I know that those many thousands of people and others will welcome these changes to ensure that our policies in relation to the detention of asylum seekers and others are transparent, accountable and humane.",89
167,Mr CREAN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Of course Labor welcomes the legislation that has been introduced by the government, but we make the point that it does not go far enough. If we are seriously genuine about the compassion that I know the member for Pearce holds, then clearly there is a lot more that we have to do. I congratulate the members for Kooyong, Pearce, Cook and MCMillan on having achieved this, but they must see it as a start only because there is still a long way to go if we are to get a true balance between being strong on our borders and being compassionate for the people who get here under whatever circumstances. I also observe that the only government members in the chamber, apart from the duty minister at the table, are the four who have led this charge. It says something to me. It says that the government does not really own this bill. I know the Prime Minister has been forced into this position; he has not wanted to do it, but he has had to do it to avoid a backbench revolt. How big that revolt would have been I do not know. It is hypothetical, but I think it is interesting that not one other government member is in this chamber for what is an important start. Labor argue that the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 does not go far enough. That is the basis upon which we have introduced not just the second reading amendment but the more detailed amendments that we intend to move in the consideration in detail stage. So we welcome the start but we know that it is only a start; we have to go further. I know that the member for Kooyong, because I listened to his speech, said that the guarantees are as failsafe as they can be. We, like you, Member for Kooyong, have had some experience with the Prime Minister's commitments. I hope your judgment is well founded. I note the fact that the interdepartmental committee is going to report to you on a fortnightly basis, but I also note that you said the Prime Minister has indicated that further amendments may be countenanced down the track. I suggest to you that you start by looking at the amendments that we have put forward. Labor have been calling for changes to the system that the government effectively put in place post-Tampa. We have been calling for changes to the detention and immigration assessment system in this country for more than three years. After our election loss in 2001, I understood that we on this side of the parliament had to engage actively with the community-in the way in which the members have talked about it. As a party we set about doing that. When I assumed the leadership, I indicated that we knew that we had to change the policy. I took the initial step on Australia Day in January 2002-within a couple of months of assuming the leadership-in an address to an Australia Day citizenship forum in Brisbane, to call for the kids to be released from behind the razor wire. It was a call that said: ‘All unaccompanied minors should be released and all children with their whole family should be settled in alternative accommodation.' I argued at the time that we needed an independent medical assessment available in the detention centres. Had that call been heeded, we could have avoided the tragic circumstances of Cornelia Rau. I also argued that the government should be back in control of the detention centres, that it should mothball Woomera and move the detainees to other facilities and that it should allow media access to detention centres with appropriate protocols. This, you might recall, was something that the United Nations was calling for and had been critical of in terms of this country. I make the point that that call was made by the Labor Party as early as January 2002. Here we are in June 2005, heralding a great breakthrough with this legislation, when in fact this initiative was called for by Labor. Not only that, but on 12 December 2002 we moved amendments to the migration legislation amendment bill to get the kids out from behind the razor wire. We did not argue to the full extent of our policy. In fact, we tened it in the hope that we could get some of the members on the other side of the parliament to join with us in showing some compassion. We asked the then minister of the day who was in charge of the legislation to allow a conscience vote. We forced a vote in the parliament, but not one of the members who is associated with the credit for these changes today voted with us. I might also say that we took the opportunity to get the kids and their families out from behind the razor wire not just on that occasion. In December 2003, the member for Gellibrand moved a private member's bill to get the kids out before Christmas. Did we get one vote from those on the other side of the chamber? No, we did not. That was the second occasion that we on this side of the parliament gave an opportunity for a vote for more compassion. In addition, when the government needed to make changes to the Pacific solutionthey realised that they had botched it-we used that opportunity to force a technical change: people who had been held on Manus and Nauru and who were returned to Australia and still in Australia six months later would get the opportunity to make an onshore claim. That was us negotiating with the minister of the day. But could we get anyone on the other side of the chamber to support our other amendments, some of which went to the question of a proper, time limited safe haven arrangement for Afghans, like those that had been extended to the Kosovars? When it came to the excision of islands legislation, on 20 June 2002 we also gave this parliament the opportunity to vote on amendments that would have seen a more compassionate, a more organised and a more humane approach to the way in which we dealt with asylum seekers. We talked about strong border security-but essentially a sofcomprehensive long-term solution being associated with it-and coordinating our international effort and talking to the UNHCR. I spoke to Mr Lubbers, the head of the UNHCR, when I was in Geneva in the middle of that year, to see whether we could get a collective program. I also had similar discussions with the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. I took up the opportunity in the AustraliaUS dialogue to argue that we, together with the United States and Europe, had an international responsibility to try and solve this problem. Why couldn't we get an agreement between the two great powers, Europe and the US, together with Australia and the rest, to have a more humane and organised way to deal with people who were genuine refugees? Labor also called for a fast, effective processing arrangement for asylum seekers to ensure that asylum seekers whose claims had failed were returned quickly. Labor never retreated from the policy view that it introduced back in the early nineties. I argued consistently that we did have to maintain detention for people who arrived here under whatever circumstances and who came without papers, without a security check and without a medical check. Of course, it is a responsibility for us, in terms of securing our borders, that they be detained in that circumstance for the purposes of establishing their identity. But what we argued for was the expedited processing-the 90day turnaround-and then the reversal of onus so that the minister had to demonstrate why people had to be retained in detention after that time. So this legislation is not something that comes new to Labor. We have consistently argued for this-but could we ever get a supporter on the other side of the House? No. And I must say that it rung a bit hollow when I read in the paper some reference by the member for Cook to the effect of: ‘Where has Labor been in all the circumstances?' I say to the member for Cook-and he is not in the chamber now-where was he when Labor were moving these amendments in this House not just once but time and time again? I support the second reading amendment. Hopefully, I will have the opportunity to say something more tomorrow during the consideration in detail stage. The fact of ter is that this bill is only a start. The has had numerous opportunities to turn this into a policy which secures our borders but has a compassionate approach. But the only way that you will get decent policy is with a Labor government because we are the only ones committed to the comprehensiveness of it-not as certain individuals sitting in as members of the government but as a party that is prepared to make the change. The reality is that we did not need a conscience vote for our party. We had the policy; we did not have the numbers. What we required from the other side of the parliament was a conscience vote for those of you who are troubled and worried and want to make change and even want to go further. If we can secure that opportunity in the future, we look forward to more of you joining in supporting Labor's amendments to give us the very compassion that you say you want. It is a start. It does not go far enough and only Labor's amendments will take us through the next important steps in getting that balance right.",92
168,Mr BROADBENT,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Firstly, I would like to commend the member for Kooyong and the member for Pearce for their speeches and thank the member for Hotham for his kind words and his obvious concern and compassion on this issue. I have great pleasure in supporting the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005. It will put into effect some of the key changes in detention policy announced last Friday by the Prime Minister. In particular, it addresses the issues of child detention and the long-term and, particularly, indefinite detention of asylum seekers-the two issues that have emerged as major community concerns and that have become unacceptable in this nation at this time. Undoubtedly the issue of child detention the matfor extended periods has been the most House vexed one. There can be no doubt, as my colleague the member for Kooyong has pointed out, that keeping children in detention is harmful to their well-being. They also suffer when families are separated and when the fathers remain in detention while the rest of the family unit is released into the community. The amendment now before the House will address this situation. It affirms as a principle that the detention of children should be a measure of last resort and that, where detention of a child is necessary, whenever possible it should take place in the community. It stresses the desirability of allowing families with children to live in a more family-friendly environment. The other key issue dealt with by this leg- ance. islation is that of long-term detention. The bill ensures that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs will deal with applications expeditiously so that any time in detention is minimised. All future primary protection visa applications must be decided by the department within three months, as must reviews by the Refugee Review Tribunal. As part of the new framework, the department will also be required to report to the Commonwealth Ombudsman every six months where detainees have been held for more than two years. A secondary oversight will come with the establishment of the Prime Minister's task force to ensure the full implementation of the amendments in this bill. In the wake of last Friday's announcement by the Prime Minister there has been criticism from some refugee advocates and from the opposition that the measures fall short of what is required, and I would like to address those criticisms. It would be nice to think that we live in a world where we would be able to completely dismantle the detention system, but this simply is not practical. The Australian government has a moral obligation to treat all refugees and asylum claimants in a humane and compassionate manner, but it also has an overriding obligation to Australian people to ensure the integrity of our borders and the safety of our citizens, not just from the threat of terrorism but also from the possible introduction of pests and diseases that could affect humans, livestock, agriculture and horticulture, as well as our flora and fauna. The only way we can achieve a practical balance between these competing obligations is to have in place a policy that includes a detention system that is effective in providing the protection demanded by Australian citizens but still treats asylum seekers in a compassionate way. I believe together we have achieved this balThe opposition, for its part, has had a sorry record on the detention issue. In the first instance, it did not really know quite how to respond to the moves within the coalition to effect changes to detention policy. It certainly did not have any ideas of its own. When it did realise it was being left behind in the whole debate, it sought to exploit in an opportunistic way what it perceived to be a division in government ranks. This was a forlorn hope. What it failed to recognise was democracy at work, with backbench members pressing for change in response to growing concern in their respective communities over the serious impact that detention, particularly long-term detention, was having on asylum seekers. What is different about the process we have just been through-and this is probably alien to the Labor opposition-is that debate on the issue was not stifled. Indeed, the Prime Minister himself took the lead in negotiating the changes and showed great patience as we worked through the issues of concern to us all. The opposition also complained that the changes to the Migration Act vested too much power in the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. They have ignored the fact that the changes, the while giving the minister greater flexibility in dealing with detention issues, also provide for much greater transparency in the department's processes, with the requirements to report to the Ombudsman and subsequently to the parliament. At this point I should pay tribute to my colleague the member for Kooyong, who has devoted a lot of time and energy to this issue for a number of years. His efforts have now been rewarded. I also acknowledge the strong support of the member for Pearce, who ably articulated our concerns to the public; the member for Cook; the intervention of the member for Riverina; and Senators Troeth, Payne and Humphries. To those we are indebted. Finally, I would like to express my thanks to the thousands of people throughout Australia who expressed their support for what we were trying to achieve and took the trouble to email, write to and call my office. In particular, I would like to thank those people in the MCMillan electorate who contacted me-I will remember you all-with messages of support and encouragement, many of them from sectors of the community that I would not normally have expected support from. The messages of support outweighed overwhelmingly those in opposition to the status quo. The principal concern of those opposed to the change was one of national security. I would like to assure those people that I did hear what they had to say, but I firmly believe that the changes we have achieved will not compromise our borders. I would also remind them that measures we have taken beyond our own frontiers with neighbouring countries have dramatically reduced the likelihood of another influx of boats carrying unauthorised entrants into Australia. In conclusion, I would like to thank the Prime Minister personally for his time and patience so freely given during the last weeks. Through his accommodation we have a more compassionate response to asylum seekers and refugees. By the Prime Minister's efforts we have achieved a more compassionate system without compromising our national security or the integrity of our borders. I commend the bill to the House.",94
169,Mr ANDREN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"May I begin my contribution to the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005 by paying tribute to the efforts, and indeed the courage, of the Liberal members who have taken on the forces of darkness in their ranks. One can only wish they had been empowered far earlier than this. On 29 August 2001, after the introduction of the Border Protection Bill-introduced as the pre-election wedge to beat up the alleged threat posed by the asylum seekers aboard the Tampa who were rescued, as we know, by the Norwegian captain who believed, naively, that Australia was a compassionate country; instead, as events showed, the 433 people aboard that stricken boat were saved from the seas by the Tampa skipper and his crew and were distributed to offshore locations under the so-called Pacific solution-I read out a press release of mine to this House: In the short term we have a humanitarian crisis on our doorstep, whatever the law of the high seas, and in the absence of any other option we must accept the people aboard the Norwegian ship the Tampa are our moral responsibility. … … … We cannot claim the high moral ground in sending our troops against Saddam, we cannot condemn the Taliban extremists, if we aren't prepared to accept there are thousands of persecuted victims of those regimes who manage to escape. Why wouldn't they seek asylum in the most free nation on earth? I retract the words ‘most free nation on earth'. Since the shameful Tampa episode we have seen a steady decline in our reputation as a fair go country, and the treatment of asylum seekers has been the major contributor to that dramatic decline. I said in August almost four years ago Tampa episode was being exploited to create the desired anti-asylum-seeker sentimentindeed what was, in its effect, an antiMuslim sentiment. I said then that if that the way to win government in this country then whoever exploits that way holds a poisoned chalice. Fast forward to this bill: a response by a Prime Minister under enormous pressure from the four dissident members doing the job of an opposition that is locked into the mandatory detention process because it invented it, which has been rigid with fear of a backlash from the electorate-so rigid that the opposition to this obnoxious policy has gradually developed within the ranks of the government itself. The Prime Minister does not want a debate on existing policy; he now wants one on the proposed new legislation. He has introduced this legislation now simply because the poor wretches who have been incarcerated in unconscionable conditions in outback Australia have served their political purpose. They have been the unfortunate pawns in the border security debate. Remember that former minister Mr Reith had the shameful gall to suggest boat people were potential terrorists at a time when he knew, and the Prime Minister knew, that around 50,000 people were in this country illegally, having deliberately overstayed visas. But they apparently are not potential terrorists. They are mostly middle class and not of Middle Eastern background. In short, while the measures we are debating tonight-the reformed detention lawscould have and should have been the bare minimum legal regime from day one in our immigration detention laws, we see them only introduced and debated after years of suffering by men, women and children who had no right to suffer when their only crime was to seek our compassion. The Prime Minthe ister suggests that in hindsight the changes he has put into these bills should have been introduced some time ago. Why weren't they? And, with the greatest respect to that was endangered species, true Liberals, why weren't the dissident backbenchers introducing private member's bills almost four years ago when these policies were tightened to the point of human rights abuses? It is quite simple: the linking of refugees or asylum seekers to border security and the wider terrorism debate have served the Prime Minister's political purposes, for the time being at least. He now brings about some changes only when faced with revolt from within his ranks-not reform driven by an opposition but by the opposition growing from within the ranks of the Liberal Party. Despite the amendments proposed by the opposition to get kids out from behind razor wire, and despite calls to shut down Woomera, the opposition has given a very mixed message on its position over the past three years. Of course, it has been possible all along to introduce a more humane policy: a brief detention for security-which no-one would disagree with-and health checks in humane accommodation, and then a series of halfway houses for families while their claims were being assessed. Surely Australia has the wit to create a process unique in the world, using smart card technology, to locate people as they access health services or make essential purchases that, indeed, may be provided to them on a credit basis and to require their reporting to a central point when a decision has been made on their status. Remember that around 90 per cent of refugee applications are successful, especially among the so-called boat people. No border security is compromised at all. But this did not suit the government's cynical, political purpose. Instead we-I say ‘we' for we are all ultimately responsible-allowed the boat people to be herded on to Pacific islands in return for bribes. We built state-ofdeportations the-art razor wire outback prison camps and outsourced the responsibility of care to private operators with little public accountability. We allowed an out-of-control Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs to oversee the whole operation-a department that gradually shamed many of its own employees by the uncaring modus of much of its operations. Not only in detention but in deportation the department has distinguished itself, under ministerial supervision one presumes, for the blunders and bloody-mindedness of its work. Dr David Corlett from Monash University has completed a study of asylum seekers sent back home, so to speak, after years of detention on Nauru, Manus Island and in Australian mainland detention centres. He is putting a book out next month, I understand, and I think it should be compulsory reading for all in this place. By and large, the Afghani, Pakistani and Iranian returnees that he traced have not fared well, living in varying degrees of fear, poverty, depression and homelessness. In the case of the Afghanis their families were gone, forcing them to flee again to Iran or Pakistan. When I dared question the policy of returning the Hazaras home from Nauru at Christmas 2003 to reportedly face assaultsand at least one case has disappeared believed murdered-there was a threat of legal action from the Afghani representative in this country as if I and others were somehow defaming their country. Afghanistan was decreed safe to send refugees back to at the end of 2003, but by early 2004 all had changed. The Australian government changed its position and most Afghan asylum seekers still in detention gained protection. Not only did DIMIA, with ministerial blessing, send people back to uncertain and dangerous situations, out of sight, out of mind, but we also have a sorry recent record of detentions and with Cornelia Rau and Vivian Alvarez-Solon just the latest examples. As Glenn Nicholls from Swinburne University writes in today's Age, just last week an attempt to remove a Bangladeshi citizen refused refugee status was blocked at Perth airport after an appeal to the United Nations-the United Nations process which is so denigrated by many on the government side. This was a similar case to that of Somali asylum seeker Sadiq Shek Elmi whose deportation was similarly blocked after UN intervention in 1998. As a senate inquiry revealed, the Elmi case and the removal of the heavily pregnant Zhu Qingping to China disclosed a range of problems with the deportation system. Where in this legislation are the judicial checks on removal actions to stop wrongful deportations? Where indeed are the provisions in the Georgiou act-of-compassion bill for a former judge to be appointed as judicial assessor to individually review the criteria for detaining any asylum seeker? Let us look at this legislation, which the Prime Minister says is about administering a policy ‘with greater flexibility, fairness and above all, in a more timely manner'. According to Children out of Detention, this reform legislation still breaches the convention on the rights of the child. Quite clearly, children are not being released. They are being transferred from razor wire detention to another form, albeit more benign, which is still a place of detention. According to ChilOut, so-called community detention will only apply to families for whom removal operations are not underway. Those families will remain in detention. Again according to ChilOut, it will be near impossible for detained families to obtain bridging visas as they simply will not be able to afford the several thousand dollar bond. The Prime Minister told Kerry O'Brien on ABC TV last night that the new laws do not affect people in offshore detention. Why? Because we have excised those islands from coverage by such laws. In O'Brien's words this new found sympathy does not extend to the kids in Nauru. The Prime Minister says we would never have stopped the flood of boats without the island policy. That flood was 4,508 between 1999 and 2001. At the time there were an estimated 23 million asylum seekers seeking safe haven around the globe. The PM again raised the spurious argument of asylum seekers reaching Australia jumping queues of legitimate refugees-and the Prime Minister said that again last night. All but the PM and some of his ministers, it seems, forget the nearest refugee registration point to Afghanistan when that war broke out was Bangkok. As O'Brien put it: people facing death do not consider lining up in queues. There has been a softening of community attitudes to Middle Eastern asylum seekers in rural Australia in the past few years, but there is a hell of a long way to go. It has largely due to the work of Rural Australians for Refugees, but also because communities saw, for instance, the Hazara refugees in Young as hard-working people who had suffered constant and ongoing victimisation in their homeland. Suddenly these people and others from Iraq and elsewhere were recognised not as demons flooding in by boat but as people with undeniable claims to our compassion, despite the worse endeavours of racist elements who tried to split those communities. A Calare constituent wrote to me last week before the PM's change of tack. He says he would gladly recruit the assistance of four or five families including his own to sponsor a family of detainees to live in Orange. He envisages a community trust fund to help pay for housing rental, clothing, schooling needs and other essentials. The Refugee Council of Australia describes these changes as a missed opportunity. There are people out there in the community ready and willing to put out their hands to provide the sort of protection that we as a nation have the wit to devise in the interests of showing the world how we can compassionately look after people, 90 per cent of whom, as I have said, have been decreed to be genuine refugee applicants. The Refugee Council welcomes the positive impact of keeping families intact, time limits set on processing, increased oversight by the Ombudsman and the deadline on completion of processing further protection visas, but points out fundamental problems that remain. As with ChilOut, the council points to matters of grave concern such as continuing breaches of human rights conventions, no prevention of people being detained for long periods, no solution for people whose legitimate need for protection falls outside the refugee convention, the damaging use of temporary protection visas for been convention refugees and no guarantee of structural change within DIMIA. Of course, one has to accept the small mercies that have been offered by these changes. But they are political changes to save political face. The Prime Minister, when asked about the harshness of his detention policy, says, ‘Perhaps parents should have asked themselves if they should have come in an unauthorised fashion.' Perhaps that was what the parents who drowned with their kids as SIEV X sank were asking.",96
170,Mr SECKER,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"First, I congratulate those who formed the very public face of the Liberal Party, put forward private members' bills and spoke very passionately-the members for Kooyong, Pearce, Cook and MCMillan. It was very brave for someone in a marginal seat like MCMillan to take a stand like this. This parliament should acknowledge the fact that these four people put a lot of work into this-not just over the last couple of months, but for some time. I come to this issue from a slightly ent angle from other members. As with the members for Mallee and Riverina, my seat of Barker is in a rural area. We have quite a few TPV holders in our electorates. I first started agitating for TPV holders about 18 months ago. I met something like 83 TPV holders in Murray Bridge. They were part of the Hazara ethnic minority from Afghanistan, where they were persecuted. These people all had jobs in the electorate; they were trying to learn English; they were trying to be part of the community. The community supported them, and they wanted to be part of the community. Like many of our genuine immigrants in this country, they had proved themselves and they deserved to stay here in Australia. One by one, I supported them, and I have had a lot of success in ensuring that they stay in Australia. I am very pleased to see the Prime Minister's announcement, as part of these negotiations, that all these people will be fully reviewed by 31 October. Of course, my constituents are not yet voters, but I would like to see them become permanent citizens of Australia. I think they will make a very worthwhile contribution to this country and that in years to come we will be very thankful that they are here. I have had the same sort of representations from the Riverland. I started receiving them about a year ago even though I was not then their local member. The Riverland in South Australia has since become part of my electorate, and a very good part which I am pleased to represent. The employers up there were also very keen to keep the TPV holders who had been working very hard and were becoming a strong part of the community. The great thing about the Riverland is that the community there accepts all nationalities. There are Greeks, Italians and Sikhs as well as the Afghanistan Hazara people. They are a differgreat part of our community. That is where I am coming from. I am very pleased to support the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005. I could not have supported the original private members' bills, and I have said that before. I thought they went too far. I thought they gave the sort of message that the Labor Party and the previous speaker, the member for Calare, gave: ‘Come here; we will have an open door policy; you can stay.' We get over a million people wanting to come to Australia each year. Either you have an open door policy or you say, ‘We're going to make some choices about the people that come to Australia.' I do not resile from that. I do not think that Australians would ever accept us having over a million immigrants each year. We have doubled that number in the time that we have been in government. I think we allow something like 140,000, give or take a few, into this country each year, which equates to a bit over 400 people immigrating to Australia every day. And we admit 40 refugees a day. We have increased the number of refugees coming to Australia. We have a proud tradition of accepting genuine refugees. So it gives me great pleasure to support the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005. In seeking to amend the bill, we are making our immigration system more efficient, more compassionate and more accountable. Let me go back to my history again. During the Second World War, my parents had an Italian POW helping them on the farm. He was treated as one of the family. In fact, we invited and sponsored him to come back after the war, and he worked for us. That was a very special part of the upbringing of my older siblings. I was not born then, but my older siblings were very much brought up with that attitude, and I was too. The bill seeks to do two things. Firstly it will give flexibility as to how families in detention with minor children are detained. The bill gives the minister non-compellable power to determine how an individual or individuals are detained and their specific conditions. Secondly, the bill will give the minister non-compellable powers to grant a visa, such as a removal pending bridging visa, to a person in detention. This bill demonstrates the government's commitment to the mandatory detention policy and an orderly, functional and effective migration system. Our mandatory detention system has been very successful. Not only has it helped prevent the crises we were facing in 2001, it has undoubtedly saved many lives in the process. I thought the cheap shot of the member for Calare at the end of his speech was quite uncalled for-as if we are somehow to blame for that. If anything, we have stopped that sort thing happening now. We were faced with the situation in August 2001 of some 1,200 people arriving illegally in Australia. They were coming here in leaky boats and risking their lives on false hope. These were the lucky ones. The 400 who lost their lives made it very certain that we had to stop this ever happening again. We could not stand back and watch this happen. Our mandatory detention policy, which was a strengthening of the original Labor Party detention policy, has stopped this illegal activity for the good of Australia and for the good of those who were paying exorbitant sums to those people who deal in human misery, the people smugglers. Since December 2001-nearly four years-only four boats have arrived in Australian waters. That is a significant achievement. Our mandatory detention policy, teamed with our swift return of people-smuggling boats, the removal of offshore island and reef areas which are attractive targets for people smugglers and the establishment of offshore processing centres, has prevented what could have become a huge problem for this country. One point which must be mentioned is the increased cooperation with our regional neighbours. This relationship has enabled us to disrupt the lucrative organised peoplesmuggling operations that so many people pin their hopes on. Like everywhere else, this country has processes that refugees must go through. Genuine refugees who go through this process will be allowed to stay; those who use illegal means to get here will face mandatory detention. We have made that more compassionate but it is important that we keep the basis of mandatory detention. It is a deterrent and it has worked. What this government is doing through this bill is ensuring that those people who do face mandatory detention are dealt with in a fair and timely manner. It should never be forgotten that about 90 per cent of those people who apply for refugee status in Australia do receive it. That is very high by world standards. That is something that should never be forgotten-we are quite generous to start with. At present, families in detention are living in detention centres and residential housing projects. We want to see all families out of these mandatory detention centres, apart from during their first health assessment and while we are ensuring they are not a public risk. I do not think there is a person in this House that does not recognise the importance of families. We certainly do not want to put them through any unnecessary delays. This bill does ensure that we have a very transparent policy on this. The minister will have to go through the process after two years. There has to be a very good reason for children or families to be in a detention centre. That in itself will ensure that it is last resort. The Prime Minister recently announced that all primary protection visa applications will be assessed within a three-month period and that the current caseload DIMIA is dealing with will be cleared by 31 October 2005. This change goes a long way to giving Australia a fair and efficient immigration system that will provide certainty for those in detention and also for Australians. I commend this bill to the House.",99
171,Ms KATE ELLIS,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I rise tonight to speak on the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005. It is indeed pleasing that the government have finally given this parliament a chance to debate the issue of a more humane immigration system. After they ignored the pleas of Australians to deal with the draconian detention system in this country, I am heartened to have a chance to debate a bill which will go some way to addressing some of my concerns and the concerns of so many people in my electorate and across Australia. I am constantly approached by residents of Adelaide urging me to keep the pressure on this government to show some humanity in this important issue. Whilst I believe that long overdue, it is pleasing that this parliament now has an opportunity to have a debate on this very serious issue. Whilst I do not believe it goes far enough, the government's bill does make some improvements to the current system. I would like to acknowledge that there are some members of the Liberal Party who have played a role in placing pressure on the government on this issue to enable us to have this debate tonight. Whilst I commend these efforts, I think it is appropriate to also acknowledge and pay tribute to the thousands of Australian citizens who have worked in the past, and will continue in the future, to only a push for both a change in community attitudes regarding asylum seekers in this nation and a change in government policy. I believe that it is because of their hard work that some members opposite, who themselves were recently voting against Labor's moves to get children out of detention, have now also recognised that something must be done. I am well aware of the many refugee support groups within my own electorate who work tirelessly for this cause. They include Circle of Friends groups, church groups, organised advocacy groups and individuals, and they all have worked extraordinarily hard at a grassroots level to offer some real support to the victims of the harsh government policy as well as to educate our local community and push for attitudinal change. I use this opportunity to thank these groups and reaffirm my continued support for them. The Howard government has a shameful record on detention centres culminating in the recent detention of Australian citizens. What kind of government waxes lyrical about protecting its citizens only to lock them up instead? It is a system which, under the Howard government, has been mismanaged, pushed to its limits and shattered in a it is spectacular and tragic fashion. Something has to be done, and I hope that the measures presented tonight will be only the beginning. Since taking office last year I have received much correspondence on the issue of immigration. Letters and emails have been written with much passion and with great concern for the plight of others. One constituent recently wrote to me saying: My faith in the integrity of our government has been severely shaken by what has happened with the current system ... I used to believe that where values, on what is appropriate policy may have differed with different governments, nevertheless our core values as a nation would always include honesty, humanity, and reasonable spending of government monies. That belief has been thoroughly shaken. Yet another elector in Adelaide wrote to me saying: I am extremely concerned, and at times outraged at the way this country continues to treat asylum seekers and fully support any proposals that seek to correct the injustices of the current mandatory detention policies of this country. Another wrote to me saying: I am ashamed of how Australia is handling the Refugee situation but hopeful that you will sent the people in creating change. It is late yet nonetheless welcome that there may now finally be some members opposite beginning to catch on to these sentiments and that tonight we can start to create this change that we and so many others have been pushing for. Let us first look at the everyday practicalities of our current system. I recently inspected the facilities at the Baxter detention centre in South Australia. The detention centre, as you probably know, is located near Port Augusta in a harsh, arid landscape. There are nine secure residential compounds for detainees. These compounds consist of small rooms surrounding a central courtyard. Whilst detainees can see the sky, they generally cannot see beyond the walls. Entry to the compound is via a security door on one corner. To leave the compound to access other facilities such as the medical centre detainees must first seek permission. The whole facility is surrounded by razor wire atop an electric fence. Whilst the staff at Baxter seem to be slowly putting into place programs to facilitate recreational activities for detainees, it is not and can never be an environment suitable for children. Labor has committed to the removal of children from detention. I spent just two hours at the Baxter detention facility that day but I cannot even begin to imagine spending several years there. Something must be done, and we must begin right here tonight. The bill as it stands is an improvement. However, there are still many unanswered questions of a department which is out of control. The government should immediately announce a judicial inquiry into the Cornelia Rau affair and the deportation of Vivian Alvarez Solon, both Australian citizens. I understand these cases are only two of approximately 200 that have been referred to the Mick Palmer inquiry. While I believe that  character, I do not believe that the inquiry has sufficient powers to find out what has been going wrong. There is something fundamentally wrong when the government is locking up and deporting Australian citizens. I would like to speak briefly about the issue of children in detention, something that I, like so many of us, feel passionate about. Labor policy since 2002 has been to remove children from behind the razor wire and Labor are serious about this. We want children out of detention. The government's bill leaves it to the discretion of the minister. It provides for a non-compellable power for the minister to specify alternative detention arrangements. This is not good enough. Labor's plan would see children removed from behind the razor wire and placed in the care of foster families after a health check. Under Labor, additional ministerial powers would not be required for this to take effect. Children in detention is probably the most emotive issue associated with our detention of asylum seekers. Many people find it unconscionable to keep children behind razor wire. A GP in my electorate wrote to me to explain her view that ‘the effects of long-term detention are disastrous in every way'. Others question the policy logic behind the government stance on detaining children. One wrote to me saying, ‘To destroy the lives of children as a means of deterring unauthorised arrivals in our fair land is simply immoral.' I agree. Another lady, from College Park in my electorate, was concerned about the impact on children of their detention, writing to me to say, ‘Having children in detention is abhorrent to me and not reflective of true Australian values.' It is not just children in detention; we are also dealing with claims in a reasonable amount of time. Labor believe in a target of dealing with 90 per cent of claims within 90 days. Those cases which fall outside the 90day period must be reviewed and reported on by an independent authority. The Prime Minister thinks it is okay to leave people in limbo without an explanation. We disagree. There needs to be an independent assessment for those cases which are not determined within 90 days. These recommendations in respect of the future handling of each individual case would be made public and laid before parliament. Further to Labor's policy, if the minister for immigration does not accept the recommendations, the minister would be required to provide an explanation before the parliament. This provides for a fast, fair and transparent system, something which has been decidedly lacking in the immigration policies of this government. Another important issue which this parliament must address is the granting of independent medical access to our detention centres. Numerous cases have been highlighted recently of the inadequacy of detainees' access to appropriate medical assessment and treatment. The case of Cornelia Rau shocked the Australian public. We must deal with the underlying faults in the system which caused an Australian citizen to be locked up. Access to decent health care is a basic right, not a privilege. In line with Labor's policy of fair and transparent processing, Labor will move amendments relating to the provision of access to independent medical professionals. Independent medical access will allow medical professionals to assess and recommend treatment of detainees. In light of a number of other detainees with serious mental health issues, provisions relating to independent medical access will ensure greater monitoring of health and psychiatric services, and adequate treatment. I want to talk particularly about the situation of those on temporary protection visas. I strongly believe that people deserve to live their lives with some certainty. It is unacceptable to have human beings strung along by the long periods of uncertainty associated with temporary protection visas. Labor argues for a one-off TPV period of two years, after which, if ongoing protection is still required, permanent protection will be granted. The onus or burden of proof will be on the Commonwealth to show that the ongoing protection of the refugee convention is not required. In those cases where it is determined that protection is no longer required, permanent residence would be offered to the TPV holder who passes a rigorous public interest test where it is found that the person is the sort of person whom Australia would otherwise select for a migration programsomeone who has made, and will continue to make, economic, social, community and family contributions beneficial to the Australian community, particularly within rural and regional Australia. I would like to speak briefly about a former Baxter detainee whom I have had the good fortune to have dealings with. Abbas Al Khafaji is an asylum seeker living within my electorate. His detention five years ago on arrival lasted for three years. After a Federal Court case, a High Court case and a further 25 days in detention, he was released on a bridging visa. Although he wants to contribute to the community, he is prevented from working whilst on a bridging visa. If his case is now successful with DIMIA, he will be placed on a TPV for a further three years. The drawn-out process presided over by this government is a bureaucratic mess. There need to be changes-and they need to happen now. Abbas is a wonderful contributor to my local community. From my encounters with him I have discovered not only that he is a wonderfully warm and friendly resident of Adelaide but also that he is capable of making an even more fantastic contribution to our society. He has lived with uncertainty for long enough. Whilst the bill currently before the House is headed in the right direction, it does not go far enough. The amendments to be moved by Labor are sound policy to ensure the immigration system is not a punitive shambles but a system based on the rule of law and respect for human rights. The Labor amendments, if passed, would fulfil the hope of so many whose expectations have been raised that this parliament is finally going to make a difference on this issue. I believe that the values of the Australian people should underpin all Australian government policy. This nation's harsh and unfair immigration system reflects on all of us as Australians. This bill does one thing very well: it provides an opportunity for discussion and debate on the issue of the treatment of asylum seekers in our country; it is a start. But let us make it very clear that our immigration system is a national disgrace. The system is a dreadful reflection on all of us. I commend those opposite who have got on board and fought for reform. But let us all ensure that this is just the beginning of reform. Let us not now sit back and think that the job has been done; there is much more for which we must fight. The Labor Party have been fighting for this in the past and you can rest assured that we will continue to fight for this in the future, and I you will all join us.",102
172,Mr BAIRD,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"At this stage I would like to give credit to my colleagues, particularly the member for Kooyong, for bringing forward the private members' bills upon which much of these particular migration changes have been based. I also give credit to the member for Pearce, Judi Moylan, and the member for MCMillan. Senators Troeth, Humphries and Payne have also been very supportive in this process and I would like to thank them. It is also true that many of our other colleagues, including the minister at the table, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, have quietly been encouraging us about the changes that are necessary, so it is not just one small group but a broader grouping of the actual party room involved here. We would also like to give credit to the Prime Minister for the amicable way in which he dealt with our concerns and the long process we went through to reach finality with these private members' bills. My involvement in the whole exercise began with my part as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, which looked at the issue of the detention centres around Australia. I was involved in chairing another committee and could not participate but I reviewed the report. It was called-for those who have not seen it-Not the Hilton: Immigration detention centres: Inspection report. The committee did not actually speak to any detainees, which I thought was somewhat of a mistake in terms of that process, and the report being brought down in the year 2000. As a result of that, the human rights committee decided to go around to every detention centre in Australia. The member for Pearce was part of the group that undertook those visits. The visits that we undertook in 2001 were amongst the most confronting that I have hope undertaken. We visited every detention centre. In each centre we spoke to three groups of 25, including one group that was specifically for women and children. It was confronting in terms of the psychological damage that detention inflicted on the particular groups that we met. It was confronting in terms of that impact on the children that we saw. It was confronting in terms of the women who wept openly as we spoke to them. The memories that I have of places like Curtin, which fortunately has subsequently been closed down, are that they were more reminiscent of gulags than modern Australia. We expressed our concern at that time through the human rights committee with 20 recommendations. A number of people did not support the recommendations that we made but people from both sides of the House who were involved in that committee did express their strong concern at the way that the whole of the detention policy was being administered and at the serious breach of human rights that was occurring. I would particularly point to the exercise of finding that prison blocks actually existed within detention centres into which people-both adults and children-were put on an arbitrary basis without any checks or balances on the program. That exemplified for me the great need for change. Once you have seen the injustice that occurs in those detention centres there is no turning back. I undertook study leave and went to five European countries to look in particular at what they were doing. I recognised that in most of them there were aspects that we could copy for our processing in Australia. It was not that these other countries were following us. They were confronted by a much greater migration program and a much greater number of asylum seekers. Rather, I saw that their processing was faster and more humane-the two aspects which are addressed in this bill. The member for Pearce and I were involved in a whole range of particular cases, and the closer we got to the processing of claims the more concerned we became. There were people who had been in detention for five or six years and whose psychological state was very much challenged, and people who did not know what the future held for them and were terrified of going back to the country from which they had escaped-often over mountains and without any papers-to arrive in Australia, which they hoped would promise a more humane existence for them and-often-their children. As one person said: ‘I have committed no crime other than coming into this country illegally but I have already been here five years. If I knew that there was some end to this process I would be happy. Send us anywhere, but don't you recognise the despair in which we find ourselves?' As part of the process, we began discussions with the then minister for immigration and with the Prime Minister. There is no doubt-and my colleagues who are here were involved in that process-that we made the small incremental changes. But often, as we reviewed the process and we looked at the question of children in detention and the question of long-term detainees, we saw that the progress in this exercise was undoubtedly slow. Then we came to the question of what happens with long-term detainees. We were not satisfied that the guidelines that were being produced were adequate to reflect the concerns that we had about long-term detention and its implications for the individuals in the detention centres. That is why we came together and said, ‘Let's discuss with our colleagues the possibility of more significant changes.' Therefore we began the process which has resulted in this bill. If we look at the various aspects of the bill we can see that some are fundamental. The first one goes to the question of children and families in detention. There was a particular family that I was involved with-the Jezan the family. They were wonderful Sabian Mandaeans, followers of John the Baptist. One of the daughters had won, two years in a row, the citizen of the year at Bass Hill High. I went to see them in January. There they were, locked up in a detention centre, while the rest of Australia was out playing on the beach. I thought that exemplified the fact that we should not be doing that to young families. I am very glad to say that they are now out and enjoying life in Australia. They have been granted residency, but they were in detention for 3½ years. Other people in the detention centre whom I became involved with often ended up being treated in psychiatric centres. So on the questhe tion of children in detention centres it solutely imperative that parliament affirm, as a principle, that a minor child shall only be detained as a measure of last resort. I am sure that all members from both sides of this chamber would absolutely endorse this as fundamental. Let us never again see children in detention in this country. They should not be behind barbed wire or razor wire. It is an indictment that we have let it happen. Both sides of the House have been involved in that but we are changing this process through the bill. I really stress the importance of these changes. Now I come to the question of the long term detainees. Changes have been occurring and the minister has now been given the ability, even though individuals have litigation on foot, to release them into the community. Even this very night some people whom I have been involved with, who have been in detention for 5½ years, have been advised that they will be going out into the community. When the removal pending bridging visas were first brought down we saw problems. They have been revised and the whole process has been simplified. That is a great step forward. I also think the time limit for processing protection visas is a great thing. In the UK they have a two plus four rule: two months for primary decisions and four months for their RRT review. That was the objective, and they were up to 65 per cent when I was there a few years ago. We are now going to have it in legislation. There will be a requirement that the minister report the occasions when the processing times do not meet the objectives. On this hangs all the law and the prophets. Shortening the length of time taken in processing is absolutely essential. The Ombudsman's oversight means that we will have an independent person looking at activities of the immigration department is abin relation to long-term detainees. When somebody is in detention for two years a report from the minister to the Ombudsman will be triggered. The report will review the reasons the person has been kept in detention-which is entirely appropriate-with the Ombudsman having the ability to do research and ask more questions. If it is negative, of course the minister is going to be under considerable pressure to say why the person is still being kept in detention, with a report going to the parliament. Instead of asking individuals to come back in, go right through the process and establish their bona fides, the department will process permanent protection visas on the papers that have already been provided. Only in those cases where it is thought a negative decision will be made will those individuals be asked to come back to discuss their cases. I think we are going to see a significant number of TPV holders converted into permanent residents. Of course, the promise from the Prime Minister is that this will all be decided by 31 October this year. Finally, there is the fact that we will have the oversight by the IDC, which will be chaired by the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. My colleagues and I are absolutely delighted about that. It will happen. It will have the imperative of time and it will make a significant change. We want to see these changes occurring rapidly in terms of getting the children out of detention and converting long-term detainees, those who cannot be returned to their countries of origin and the TPV holders, into permanent residents. That is what we want to see, and I am sure all members of this House will join in acknowledging the importance of this piece of legislation. My colleagues with me have all worked hard in reaching the point where we have this legislation. I am very pleased to say that we have received quite strong support from our colleagues and I certainly commend this bill to the House.",105
173,Ms PLIBERSEK,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I was reminded, when the member for Barker was speaking earlier in this debate, about being in the back seat of my parents' car-I was probably about 14 years old-when my dad was taking a group of us to the blue-light disco. We were driving from Oyster Bay to Rockdale and the station wagon was packed. My friend Kaleen was sitting in the back seat with me and she said, ‘I really hate wogs and their big cars.' I had to point out to her she was, in fact, in one of those big cars driven by one of those wogs. What the member for Barker reminded us of is that people fear what they do not know, but when they know the stories of the refugees who come to Australia they are less fearful and begin to admire the stories of triumph over adversity. They begin to admire the spirit that takes a person from the most adverse circumstances in a depressed or war-torn country and has them come half way across the world so that they can provide a better life for their children. The members for Kooyong, Cook, Pearce and MCMillan have done a very brave thing, considering the way party rooms work, and I commend them on their bravery. I am not embarrassed at all to say that I admire what they have done in putting this issue once more into the public arena. I acknowledge that they were enormously brave to face up to the Prime Minister and the party leadership and say, ‘We've done our very best to negotiate these things privately. We have talked and talked.' For years they have been working behind the scenes to get some movement from the government on these very important issues, but their diplomatic and subtle ways did not achieve what they were seeking. They had to take the very brave step of moving outside the usual party structures and putting up suggestions to force the Prime Minister's hand. The member for Cook spoke very eloquently about what he hopes to see from those changes. I dearly hope he is right about the practical changes that will result from this legislation. I fear that there has been a triumph of optimism over experience and that the measures agreed to will not deliver all that the members of the government who have worked so hard would have hoped for. Consequently, Labor will be moving amendments that relate to a number of the that areas we have discussed in the past. In our first amendment we propose the removal of all children from behind the razor wire. We have seen in the government's proposal a lack of clarity on this issue. The noncompellable discretionary power granted to the minister is fine as far as it goes, but in my heart of hearts it does not give me the greatest confidence that we will not continue to see children behind razor wire. One of the crucial things will be whether detainees will be able to go out into the community as a whole family unit. It is not difficult to understand that a family that has been through so much together, coming to Australia in the most adverse circumstances, does not want to be separated. If it meant leaving father behind, they would stay together in the most adverse circumstances rather than be separated, with all the uncertainty and sadness that involves. That is an area in which we will be moving an amendment. We propose establishing an inspectorgeneral of detention. This will give a great deal more security to detainees, who will be able to raise complaints with the inspectorgeneral of detention. Our proposal for an ombudsman is very much in line with the government's proposal, in the hope that it will be supported by the government. The difference is that our ombudsman will have to report after 90 days of detention rather than after two years of detention. Two years of detention is long enough to drive a person mad. I think 90 days is a perfectly reasonable period in which to gain some understanding of why a person needs to be in immigration detention. If they need to be in detention yond 90 days because they are a security risk, a health risk, at risk of absconding or for some other reason, then a case could be made for continued detention, but the onus should be on the department to describe why the person needs to be in detention longer than 90 days. In my view, the two-year period is too long. We will move an amendment relating to the granting of independent medical access. We have all heard the saddest stories about children, in particular, in need of psychiatric care or some other counselling. We have heard stories of sexual abuse that have not been investigated. In one case a charge of sexual abuse of a five-year-old boy was apparently not investigated until a week after the alleged incident. It is very difficult to gather any convincing evidence a week after a sexual assault has occurred. We heard a story about an adolescent girl-an unaccompanied minor who had responsibility for her younger sibling-who was so traumatised by her experience in detention that she became incontinent. These tragic stories must be open to scrutiny. Children and adults must have the support of appropriate medical professionals. That does not mean it is a zoo, that professionals can come and go as they please and that detainees have no control over who they see and in what circumstances. At the moment, qualified professionals are being denied access to people who need help. We certainly saw in the case of Cornelia Rau the consequences of that sort of neglect. We have a further amendment which proposes certainty for temporary protection visa holders. It has been our principle for a number of years now that, after a short initial temporary protection visa period, there is an assumption that people will become permanent residents unless the government can prove that things are safe enough in their be- country of origin for them to go home. Once this initial period is over and once an assessment has been made that it is not possible to prove that someone should be sent home, we need to give these people certainty. For goodness sake, we have people who are being told that they will never be Australian citizens, that they will never have the ability to see their family again, that if they leave Australia they will never be allowed to come back and that they will never be able to have their family join them. It is absolutely inhumane to say to a person: ‘I acknowledge that you are a genuine refugee in need of protection according to all the international rules, but you'll never see your family again. They'll never be able to see you here. You'll never be able to visit them in a third country and you will always have the threat of being sent home hanging over your head.' We also have concerns that long-term detention is not dealt with by this legislation. Very long term detainees who have no country to which they can practicably be returned still must rely on ministerial discretion. The vagueness of these provisions is of very little comfort to anyone. I want to conclude by saying that of course any progress in this area is welcome. At the end of the day of course Labor will support even this incremental change, because the notion that anyone would be in immigration detention for a day longer than they need to be because we are not perfectly happy with the package is completely unsustainable. But this is not cause for us to be dancing in the streets with joy that, finally, the great battle for freedom and humanity has been won in this area. That is just not the case. We still have a very long way to go before we will have a truly humane, fair and compassionate policy for refugees and asylum seekers in this country.",108
174,Mr FORREST,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"I am delighted to stand in support of the Migration Amendment (Detention Arrangements) Bill 2005. I have worked towards these sorts of improvements to our detention arrangements for some time now, and it has been an interesting journey. I confess that my first public call for some changes was met with some surprise from colleagues. But like the member for Barker, who made similar comments, I have a constituency in which the issue of immigration has a very high profile. In fact, when I think about the workload in my office, this is the one single portfolio that causes us the most involvement. I will explain the reasons for that. When I first entered this place in 1993 it used to be veterans affairs. Then we came into government and we funded veterans advocacy networks right across my constituency. They have access to their own resources now to fight for their entitlements. But the immigration issue has surpassed that by far. It is the nature of the constituency, particularly in association with the Murray Valley. There is much positive capital investment and development going on because we have excellent water policy in Victoria. All of the industry bodies along the Murray Valley constantly remind me and the member for Farrer that the single most important issue is access to labour. So we as a region are a natural attraction for the people whom we are discussing tonight. Particularly of late we have had a huge influx of people on temporary protection visas who have justified their need for protection. Latterly they have come from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan and other countries in the Middle East. This aspect of my constituency of Mallee is not new; it has been happening for 50 years. In the last 50 years Australia, in demonstrating its willingness to accept refugees, has had over 630,000 refugees come to our nation. A lot of that was following postwar European resettlement, and a lot of those people settled in the Mallee electorate. In the last 10 to 15 years there has been a huge intake from the Asian communities and, over the last five or six years, from the Middle East. So there is a very high proportion of such people in my constituency. It is a very positive story in one way that we can offer gainful employment. It is not all unskilled and it is not just at harvest; it is right throughout the year in many industries associated with horticulture and agriculture generally, such as processing plants, abattoirs and the like. Many of these people, of course, are not work entitled, which introduces another very high profile issue: our region is an obvious target for compliance visits by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. These are euphemistically referred to as ‘labour compliance raids'. They occur on a regular basis, sometimes two or three in one week. All this makes the issue very high in the minds of the people I represent in this place. It has therefore been very difficult for the bodies who support the various industries, whether they be table grape growers, wine grape growers, vegetable growers or stone fruit growers, and to keep their support for the government in getting control of this right to work compliance issue. Regularly there are headlines in my local newspapers to do with the issue of immigration in one way or another. The view of industry bodies is that this is a resource: ‘Thank you for what you do, Government, in sending us backpackers and all the rest of them but it is still not enough.' Such is the demand. So why remove this resource? I mention all this because that is what has led me to take such a strong position on the need for the changes we are discussing tonight. What it has done is brought me, along with my communities, into close association with the sorts of people that members have been talking about in this debate, particularly a large number who have lately come from very high-profile Middle Eastern countries. The communities have been very strong in giving them moral and financial support and in providing them with employment. Having sat with some of these people, many of them having spent long periods in detention, and listened to their stories, I can say that the only way to understand their situation is to put yourself in their position. If I were a highly intelligent intellectual in a country being governed by a punitive regime which I spoke out against and then endured unbelievable intolerance, abuse and threats of violence, I wonder what I would do. If I had felt so intimidated, maybe I would have gathered whatever meagre savings I had and taken a chance to go to a country that I had heard celebrated a wonderful democracy. That is their only crime. In doing so, unfortunately many of them have fallen into the hands of manipulative people smugglers and the like. All that is in the past; the reality that they are here. In that context, I say it is time for us to adopt a much more humane approach to the issue of their confinement. Having said all that, I am a very strong advocate of the need for mandatory detention. In all of my efforts in dealing with people in these matters, particularly the Prime Minister and other ministers, I have sought to not undermine that policy. I think there are very strong and sound reasons in the public interest for us to impose a period of detention to sort out various matters, as other members have noted. My objective was to quietly work away at making changes. But of late-in the last six months-some very disturbing issues have come to light which led me to the conclusion that drastic action was needed. I commend my colleagues the members for Pearce, Kooyong, Cook and MCMillan for their courage. Whilst I had some misgivings about the process by which they sought to drive the Liberal Party in particular, I am grateful for the outcome it has produced. The measures we are discussing tonight will be welcomed by my constituency. They are already rejoicing. I will be meeting over the weekend with some of them, ordinary Australians-my own supporters-who said to me, ‘John, we are just a little bit uncomfortable with this policy approach. Surely some changes can be introduced with which we can be much more comfortable.' Mandatory detention is very strongly in the public interest, but it is not a deterrent. If incarceration were a deterrent, we would not have the need for the large number of jails in our country. The initiatives in this bill to work hard to shorten the period for which detention is required are welcome and have my strong support. The measures to adopt a more family friendly approach to those people who arrive as families with children are commendable. I would be quite supportive of is any accommodation requirements. I know that people, particularly in my home city of Swan Hill, would welcome these people and be prepared to take responsibility for them and, in the process, offer them the very thing that can be an important part of their rehabilitation-namely, employment. I am very pleased to stand in support of these measures. I commend the Prime Minister. His willingness to embrace the broad church of his own party, the Liberal Party, has been obvious in his consideration and support of these changes. I think tremely strong leadership and indicative of the leadership he has given the nation over the last decade. I commend the members for Kooyong, Pearce, Cook and MCMillan for their courage. I understand the need to continue to work closely to improve these arrangements. I commit to do that and I commend the bill to the House.",110
175,Mrs IRWIN,MIGRATION AMENDMENT,"Last Friday, Australians awoke to the sound of bells ringing from every church across the land. That night, bonfires burned on every hill and the people danced in the streets. The cluded: government had changed its policy of mandatory detention of asylum seekers. The member for Kooyong and his band of merry men and women had broken the spell of the evil Prime Minister and goodness had won through once again. Children would no longer spend their formative years behind razor wire. Young men would no longer grow old in the despair of isolated desert camps and on deserted islands. Mothers would no longer cry for their despondent children. Milk and honey would flow throughout the land. And for all this we have to thank the member for Kooyong-this latter-day knight in shining armour, so brave and so courageous to take on the Prime Minister and fight for goodness and right. And how easy it was. Like Joshua before the walls of Jericho, the member for Kooyong sounded his trumpet and the great walls fell. It was all so easy. It was a cause that the member for Kooyong had championed for so long-for four long months. That is what the record of this House shows. The first occasion on which the member for Kooyong mentioned detention of asylum seekers was in February this year-four long months ago. After 12 years in this parliament he finally came out. In the debate on the address-in-reply to the Governor General's speech, the member this is ex- for Kooyong told the House: I want to raise one area where I believe innovation and change are necessary and possible, and that is the area of refugees and asylum seekers. Our policies towards asylum seekers were premised on concern about vast numbers of undeserving and potentially dangerous people landing on our shores. Today, unauthorised boat arrivals have all but ceased and the great majority of people they carried have turned out to be genuine refugees. There were no terrorists hiding amongst the asylum seekers. The member for Kooyong went on to focus on the policy of indefinite detention and conTo put it simply, I believe that the policy of indefinite detention of people who have committed no crime-and I think this is a position actually supported by both sides of the parliament-and who pose no threat to the Australian community should not be sustained. Well, ‘Hear, hear!' to that. You have to wonder whether the member for Kooyong and the member for Pearce spent last Christmas in Damascus, because that was the first time in this House that they revealed their views on mandatory detention-conveniently after last year's election. It was hardly the first opportunity they had had to do so. Since his conversion, the member for Kooyong's commitment to this issue knows no bounds. On 10 May this year, he mentioned the mental health of asylum seekers and refugees in his speech on the Migration Litigation Reform Bill 2005. On 23 May, he mentioned the plight of a group of Vietnamese refugees on Christmas Island. That is the proud record of the member for Kooyong. As it happens, some but not all on this side of the House agree with the member for Kooyong. There is a small band of Labor members who, it has been suggested, meet secretly at the member for Fremantle's home and plot the invasion of thousands of ships bearing unwashed refugees to our shoressome members would like to think that. As a card-carrying member of that small band, I know how the member for Kooyong feels in his party room. I cannot say I blame him for holding his peace for so long on this issue. But it is not as though other members have not raised this issue in the House on many occasions over many years. To quote my own record on this issue, in September 2000, a year before Tampa, I told the House at the tabling of the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled Not the Hilton, which looked at detention centres: My overall impressions of the detention centres left me in no doubt about the government's objectives in maintaining its detention centre strategy. Its objective, like that of Basil Fawlty, is to that no guest ever returns to a facility and that none of their family and friends wish to go there either. Instead of detention centres, you could call them deterrent centres. I also said at that time: I cannot omit to mention that over 90 per cent of detainees in these centres will be granted at least temporary protection visas, and I have no doubt that the great majority will become permanent residents and ultimately Australian citizens. And that is exactly what has happened. That speech was made nearly five years ago. It was made before Tampa, before the crisis that the member for Kooyong referred to. Then, in February 2001, I spoke in this House on the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 [2000]. It was an election year, and who could have known in February what part migration policy would play in the election outcome later that year? As I said in speaking to the bill: ... it is not about the national interest; it is about self-interest: the narrow self-interest of coalition members As the outcome of the November election showed, it was very much a case of self interest. I went on to say to the House: You see, a certain redhead is back in town and all the boys on the coalition benches are trying to catch her eye. They have put on the Old Spice and the Californian Poppy, they have polished the old FJ Holden, they are flexing their anti-migration muscles and now they are trying to outdo each other to show how much like One Nation they can be. Where was the member for Kooyong and his happy band then? Where did they stand in that happy coalition that I described as the Liberals, The Nationals and Pauline Hanson's One Nation? I went on to say: Where are the small ‘l' Liberals who championed the cause of human rights? Where are those who worked to establish Australia's reputation as a leader in human rights? ensure That was in February 2001, and the answer came in August when the Tampa sailed over the horizon. While the Tampa was still lying off Christmas Island, I told the House in an adjournment speech on 30 August 2001: The decision to draw the line in the sand with the Tampa incident has more to do with catching votes than catching people smugglers. That led to the sorry chapter in Australia's history of overseas detention-the Pacific solution. At home we held on to the policy of mandatory detention of children. In March 2002, after a visit to the Villawood detention centre, I told the House in a grievance debate: Children are wondering why they are being punished, wondering what they have done to deserve this treatment. These are children surrounded by despair; these are children without hope for the future. Again in March 2002, I referred to the fate of Tampa refugees and reminded the House that the Prime Minister had asserted that Tampa asylum seekers would not set foot in Australia. But today many are living in our community. In October 2002, I rose in the House to speak on the first anniversary of the sinking of SIEVX-a tragedy that resulted in the loss of over 350 lives. Out of 150 members of this House, I was the only one to recall that disaster-then or since. I again spoke out in June 2003 on the Migration Amendment (Duration of Detention) Bill 2003, but I did not hear a word from the member for Kooyong. I support the amendment moved by Labor and the minor improvements made by this bill. If the heavy burden of despair is lifted off just one parent, if just one caged child can breathe the free air of our country, Australia, I would support the bill. But I cannot help feeling like the soldier who has spent years in the trenches of the Somme: it is tempting to think that those who now claim the glory spent most of their time drinking champagne back in the bordellos of gay Paris. NA",112
176,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being approximately 9 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Asylum Seekers",114
177,Ms BURKE,ADJOURNMENT,"In light of the debate in parliament about a slight step in the right direction for asylum seekers in Australian detention centres, I want to highlight a petition I have recently tabled in the parliament. It says: ‘That this Synod regrets the Government's adoption of procedures for certain people seeking litical asylum in Australia which exclude them from all public income support while withholding permission to work, thereby creating a group of beggars dependent on the Churches and charities for food and the necessities of life; and calls upon the Federal government to review such procedures immediately and remove all practices which are manifestly inhumane and in some cases in contravention of our national obligations as a signatory of the UN Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.' This is a silent issue in the immigration debate: those living in the community on bridging E visas. A report by the Asylum Seekers Project Hotham Mission has found: There are approximately 8000 asylum seekers living in the community on bridging visas. In general, these asylum seekers have never been in detention because they arrived in Australia with valid visas and were immigration cleared before lodging a protection visa application. This group of on-shore asylum seekers make up the majority of all asylum seekers in Australia. They are free to live in the community on a bridging visa while awaiting a decision on their application. The rights and entitlements for asylum seekers depend on which bridging visa they hold and the particular stage of their case. If an asylum seeker has lodged an application within 45 days from the time of arrival and has not appealed beyond the Refugee Review Tribunal (RRT), he or she is entitled to work rights and Medicare. If an initial decision has not been made within six months and the RRT has not rejected the application, he or she may receive a federally funded Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme (ASAS) payment through the Australian Red Cross. However many asylum seekers are not aware of the requirement to lodge an application within 45 days. Consequently many fail to do so and are therefore deemed ineligible to receive work rights, Medicare or any other welfare payments. This includes all asylum seekers awaiting a humanitarian decision from the Immigration Minister and all asylum seekers released from detention on a Bridging Visa E, including those released on psychological or medical grounds. poWhilst the recipients of these visas are extremely thankful that they have been released from detention, in some cases their situation has actually deteriorated upon release because they have no rights to work or access to Centrelink payments. In my electorate of Chisholm there are many terrific individuals assisting those who have been released on bridging E visas. These individuals are often involved with the Asylum Seekers Centre and the Asylum Seekers Project Hotham Mission-both fantastic organisations surviving without any government funding and relying on the generosity of many individuals, churches and schools within my electorate. The Hotham Mission has been in operation for about seven years, mainly providing a housing project for homeless asylum seekers. It started with just two people. The project now works with over 200 asylum seekers in 30 properties, and this is just within Victoria. With changing policies, the pressure on the project has both increased and varied from time to time. Housing remains the main focus, along with the Basic Living Assistance Program, which provides $30 a week to families to survive on. It also provides referral support to other agencies, volunteer support and advocacy. The project works with asylum seekers who have no income, work rights, Medicare entitlements or other means of support. The Hotham Mission was awarded the 2002 Human Rights Award for the Community by HREOC. The Asylum Seekers Centre, which is another terrific organisation, is able to assist onshore applicants for refugee status-those who arrive in Australia with valid visas and passports and who are granted bridging visas to cover the time during which their applications are being processed. In many cases, this bridging visa is attached to an 8101 no work condition, which excludes the majority from any paid work. The penalty for breaking such a condition is to be placed in mandatory detention. The majority of these people do not have access to Medicare or any Centrelink benefits. So how are they surviving? As I said, on the charity of others. The government has made some small steps in assisting the people who are inside the detention centres. Perhaps it could consider doing something to assist those asylum seekers who are out in the community. The Hotham Mission believes that this is not a great step. Firstly, if you allow work rights and health care for all asylum seekers by reversing the 1997 amendment to bridging visa E category, including the 45-day rule, you would ensure work access and Medicare rights, and this would provide humanitarian assistance to many people in our community. properties and 15 (Time expired) Seaford Rise Neighbourhood Watch",114
178,Mr RICHARDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to acknowledge an initiative within my electorate of Kingston taken by a local Neighbourhood Watch group. The Seaford Rise Neighbourhood Watch Area 475 delegates attended my office approximately 10 weeks ago now and said: ‘Kym, we want to do more in our area to raise the awareness of crime prevention and of controlling and preventing crime and antisocial behaviour in the local area. Would you be able to assist in any way?' They were aware of the Howard government's recent national crime prevention initiative booklets and, with my previous policing background and knowledge of the area, I advised the Neighbourhood Watch group we could possibly obtain 3,000 copies of each booklet. These booklets were: Crime prevention for seniors; I/D theft-a kit for preventing identification theft; Protecting your home from intruders kit; and E-Crimea crime prevention kit for small businesses. We then discussed the best method to reach the community and raise the awareness of local residents. It was decided to advertise the launch of the project called Operation Safer in the South and hold a community information evening to provide the details of the operation and hand out crime prevention booklets to raise community awareness. This community forum was held on 8 June at the Moana Surf Life Saving Club, where over 80 local residents attended and listened to me; the acting officer in charge, South Coast lice, Paul Greathead; Neighbourhood Watch SA President, Mr Al Thompson; Mr James Armitage from the state Attorney-General's office; and the chair of the forum, Mr David Gillatt, a local volunteer zone representative of the Seaford Rise Area 475. To further enhance and promote community awareness, the committee of the Seaford Rise Neighbourhood Watch decided to conduct a week-long display within the mall of the local Seaford shopping centre. These volunteers of Neighbourhood Watch, the area coordinator and delegates, manned the display from Saturday, 11 June to Saturday, 18 June-again, further providing the message of the federal government's crime prevention booklets along with Neighbourhood Watch and security aspects. Throughout the entire time, these volunteers continually promoted the Operation Safer in the South theme to create greater awareness of controlling and preventing crime and antisocial behaviour in our area. It is further intended by this Neighbourhood Watch group to provide each resident within Seaford Rise, and perhaps residents in neighbouring suburbs, with the respective crime prevention booklets over a period of the next six to eight months. They intend to deliver them at the same time as they provide residents with an update on Neighbourhood Watch. I will personally provide to businesses within the same area the booklet for small businesses regarding e-crime, which is a crime prevention kit for small business. I believe this initiative by the members of Seaour community. ford Rise Neighbourhood Watch Area 475 is above and beyond their normal and traditional voluntary work for Neighbourhood Watch in the local area. This is a group of people who are members of the community and who want to make a greater impact on making the south safer, so we named the project Operation po- Safer in the South. They simply wanted to promote community awareness of the Howard government's crime prevention initiative booklets and to get involved, and for other people to get involved, in becoming aware of controlling and preventing crime and antisocial behaviour in our area. They should all be congratulated on the part they played and on their future vision and role. In particular, I would like to acknowledge the entire full membership of Seaford Rise Neighbourhood Watch Area 475established since October 1997-the RAA, the local CPS Credit Union and the Moana Surf Lifesaving Club for the community forum night. Specifically the following people should be recognised and acknowledged for their leadership and commitment to Operation Safer in the South: Mr David Gillatt, and his hard working wife Mrs Margaret Gillatt. David's ‘never say we won't be able to achieve that' attitude and encouragement of others will always get the job done. His committee from the Neighbourhood Watch area 475-Julie Coster, Kathy Ayres, Ashley Slater, Charles MCCormack, Martin Dunstan, John Richards, Max Draheim and Trevor Simmonds-have also been instrumental in their support and assistance to the project. As the local federal member for the area of Seaford Rise and the electorate of Kingston, I congratulate the above-mentioned persons on behalf of the Australian Howard government, myself and residents of the southern area on making a difference in crime prevention and crime awareness for Tutorial Voucher Initiative",115
179,Ms BIRD,ADJOURNMENT,"In this adjournment debate tonight I want to raise a concern that I have about some local constituents and an issue they have raised with me that is causing a lot of distress in some families in my electorate. In April this year the parents of Tahlea-Rose Satter came to see me. They had been notified in May 2004 that as Tahlea-Rose had not met the basic benchmark standards in the year 3 literacy and numeracy tests she would be eligible for a $700 literacy voucher under the federal government's literacy voucher initiative, which the Minister had announced in 2004. This announcement was targeted at young people who had done the year 3 test in 2003, and Tahlea-Rose was one of those. The idea was that young people who had not met the required benchmarks in that 2003 test would be offered the opportunity to purchase literacy support and tutoring in order to prove their skills. Tahlea-Rose's parents came to me because they were concerned that Tahlea-Rose was coming up to sit her year 5 literacy and numeracy tests this year-2005-and they had not been able to get access to the tutorial support. The letter that they received in gave them a central number which they were requested to ring to organise to have the eracy tutoring put in place. They had rung the number and been told that the program was still being put in place and that they should continue to ring. They had been doing so for six or seven months by the time that they came to see me and they were starting to get quite concerned that she had now entered year 5-and as I said was facing the year 5 test this year-and still had not been able to get tutorial assistance. I pursued some inquiries for them and discovered that the brokers for each state had only partially been appointed, and in New South Wales at that time no broker had as yet been appointed. Subsequently, I think in late April or May, a broker was appointed for New South Wales. I spoke to Tahlea-Rose's parents today and they told me that they have finally received an indication from the broker that if they provide a range of documents, including the original letter telling them that they were eligible for this tutorial support, the support could be put in place. I am pleased that that is happening for Tahlea-Rose and for her family. Subsequent to talking to them and raising the concerns in the local media, I was contacted by a number of other families who were in the same circumstance. In last week's debate in the consideration in detail stage of the appropriation legislation, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, told parliament he understood that to date only 2,000 students across Australia have been im- receiving tutoring under this program. The sad thing is that 24,190 students have been identified across Australia as requiring such literacy support-7,330 of them in New South Wales. I am particularly angered by this failure to get the program up and running. We all rec2004 ognise hiccups in getting bureaucracies in place to implement new policies but in this litcase there were families whose deep concern about their children was preyed upon by a promise that they would get the support that they needed-but that support was not delivered. It was causing them a great deal of anguish. This applies to a young girl now facing her year 5 test who thought that she was going to get some support to help her meet the benchmarks this time, and a family who want the best educational outcomes for their child. I have heard similar stories from other families. They received a promise, and a letter from a minister of the federal government, and nearly 12 months later nothing had happened. I think the minister should apologise to those families for raising their hopes that there was going to be some intervention to help their children, and for then failing so abysmally over such a long period of time to put that in place. (Time expired) Salisbury North R-7 School",117
180,Mr FAWCETT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to talk about one of the good aspects of representing federal seats in Australia-that is, that you get to see the good and encouraging aspects of our society. I am talking particularly about the Salisbury North R-7 school in Wakefield. To put it in context, Salisbury North is an area about which the Australian wrote an article in 2001. It said that the high school there: ... has made a Cinderella like transformation from a school considered a wasteland of South Australia's youth to a place returning dreams to some the nation's most deprived teenagers. This transformation occurred because of the commitment and dedication of individuals who are prepared to step up to the mark and make a difference. I particularly want to talk about principal Gerry Dillon and the work that he and his staff are doing at Salisbury North R-7 school in Wakefield. I was out there earlier this year on Harmony Day and it was my pleasure to see the activities and work that the students had put together. The concept of harmony is particularly relevant in that school when you consider that 24 different language and cultural groups are represented there. The sort of innovation that the school have undertaken means that they do not see this diversity of cultures as a problem but as an opportunity. They have things like new arrivals programs to integrate people into the community and to get good outcomes for the kids. The sort of innovation that they undertake stretches to things like literacy programs. The school have a high focus on literacy development. In fact, their work has been such that they gained federal funding for research projects and the results of that work have been published and promoted nationally. The federal Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson, has visited the school on the basis of that work. And so the work, in what is often seen as a disadvantaged area of Australia, has actually been leading in its field. Tonight I would particularly like to talk about Indigenous education. Principal Gerry Dillon has spoken to me previously about some of the funding that the federal government has provided for Indigenous education and the way that has helped, but he continues to innovate. I was pleased this week to be able to contact the school to notify them of a grant from the federal government for $3,000 of under the Australian government's Whole of School Intervention Strategy. It is for a program that they have put together called the Nunga boys mentoring program. This program involves boys being mentored by a parent who is a respected member of the Aboriginal community and a local football player. The mentoring program will run for two lessons a week for the remainder of this year and for term 1 of next year. There are a range of activities here that are designed to engage young people and to help them see that there are other things they can do with their time. These activities include things such as sports skills, internet research, teamwork and goal setting. They may not seem huge things to many people but for some of these communities, where perhaps there is not that support at home, these are incredibly important life skills for these young men and women to be learning. Each of these children will be given a contract which will be signed by them and their caregiver. This contract will require students to achieve certain agreed goals each week. Achieving these goals will be mandatory to graduation from the program. This is yet another example of good outcomes occurring in communities because of the dedication and hard work of parents, teachers and community members with the support of both the state and the federal government. I see it as a good example at a time when many people comment on the lack of cooperation to show that there are real differences being made in our communities through cooperation at the levels of government, but particularly through the innovation and commitment of individuals. I commend principal Gerry Dillon and the staff of the Salisbury North R-7 school for their initiative in running this program. Defence Capability Plan",118
181,Mr MCCLELLAND,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to express concerns about the government's commitment to the Defence Capability Plan. In particular, in its recent analysis, The cost of defence: ASPI Defence Budget Brief 2005-06, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, in analysing the current defence budget, stated: The mounting delays to the approval of projects in the DCP are rapidly rendering the current verthan sion of the plan obsolete. The 2001 Defence Capability Plan outlines the government's major capital equipment investment plans for the coming decade. When you look at the detail between the original DCP of 2001 and that of 2004 there has been a delay in a number of projects of between nine to 15 months. As a result of this delay, the projects actually increased in cost by an average of about 20 per cent in the three years since the original 2001 DCP. We are all now aware that the ADF has been plagued by financial mismanagement which the Australian National Audit Office report on 2003-04 financial statements identified as being in the order of $8 billion of unaccounted items. If Defence cannot account for the assets it has on hand it cannot be managing its assets in a long-term strategically competent manner. Indeed, as a result of mismanagement the ADF has been unable to spend money allocated by the government for major capital projects to the tune of $2 billion, which have been deferred to beyond 2008. This is significant because the development of new military capability can take a decade or more from conception to entry into service. I acknowledge that, as a result of at least some reforms to the Defence Materiel Organisation, some of that deferred money has been brought forward-approximately $300 million-but about $1.7 billion remains deferred to post 2008. There also appears to be an emerging problem with the approval of new projects stalling by some 16 months. The ASPI report notes that only a small portion of projects that were originally planned for the years 2004-06 can possibly be approved on schedule. They say: The most optimistic projection would be that around 30% of projects by value from those two years will make it on time. This amounts to some $5 billion in projects that will commence later planned ... or in terms of project numbers the best we can hope for is 17 out of 35 projects from 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 will be approved on schedule. The ASPI report stated that this was very worrying. It said: Without projects being approved and transferred on schedule to DMO for delivery, it would be impossible for the capability to be delivered on time. It should be noted that these delays are in the context of the Defence Capability Plan being released in February 2004, only 16 months ago. ASPI identifies much of the problem as arising from a new two-pass process of project approvals that has been put in place in accordance with the recommendations of the Kinnaird report to the Department of Defence. The new process imposes a much more stringent demand for the provision of information before a project is approved. The opposition accepts the argument that it is better to delay a project in its early stages to get it right from the outset than to rush in and face the delays and cost overruns that we have seen due to inadequate planning and attention to detail in the final stages. However, it is quite evident that the government has not sufficiently resourced the planning process for crucial defence projects. Clearly this is a very concerning matter that can and should be addressed. As ASPI notes, there is also a difficulty in that the government has not identified its long-term strategic priorities. While the government has promised a strategic update, it is yet to be delivered. As ASPI notes: So long as the future roles and capabilities of the ADF remain a matter of debate, it makes sense to hold off the approval of projects whose priority not assured. ASPI notes, however, that there is a hint of Groundhog Day here because, since the end of the last decade, we have seen constant delays while waiting for more updates before there is a further revision of the Defence Capability Plan. (Time expired) Bishop David Chislett",119
182,Mr SLIPPER,ADJOURNMENT,"On 8 March this year, I spoke in glowing terms in the House about the consecration of Bishop David Chislett in Philadelphia as a bishop. Bishop Chislett has been for 10 years the Rector of All Saints, Wickham Terrace, in Brisbane. Last night in the adjournment debate, I spoke about the farewell mass for Bishop Chislett and the tremendous feeling and ceremony at that time. As a former altar server, parish councillor, synod person and now deacon in the church, I am well aware of the importance of All Saints, Wickham Terrace and the very strong support that members of that parish have for the Catholic faith. Honourable members may well ask how, in the space of some four months, we have moved from a situation where Bishop Chislett was going to minister to traditional Anglicans in the Anglican Church of Australia and also those in the Traditional Anglican Communion to the situation where there was a necessity to have a farewell, sad but glorious Pontifical High Mass and Solemn Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament at All Saints, Wickham Terrace last Sunday. I am happy to enlighten honourable members on the situation. On 25 February this year, Bishop Chislett, who in my view was one of the finest Anglican priests in the diocese of Brisbane, was suspended by the Archbishop of Brisbane on the basis of his consecration to the historic episcopate. In his letter to Bishop Chislett, Archbishop Aspinall said: is In these circumstances I must ask you to show cause why I should not revoke your licence as Rector of the Parish of All Saints', Brisbane, issued on 31 May 1995. Bishop Chislett, quite appropriately, responded to Phillip Aspinall and pointed out that he was not a member of the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia and that the purpose of his episcopal ordination was, as clearly expressed on numerous occasions: ... to consecrate a bishop in the Church of God with the capacity to minister to certain members of the Anglican Communion and the Traditional Anglican Communion (of which the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia is part) ... Of course, in his consecration, bishops from both communions took part. In his response to Archbishop Aspinall, Bishop Chislett also said: Historically in the Church of England, an incumbent's being consecrated to the episcopate ‘out of range'-so to speak-of the canons regulating his ecclesial relationships, has not of itself been cause for revoking his licence, even in cases where the consecration has been of dubious validity. There is ample evidence to show that such incumbents have been regarded as having committed a canonical offence only if they act in a manner contrary to the terms of their incumbent's licence. In his correspondence with Archbishop Aspinall, Bishop Chislett made it clear that he did not intend to act contrary to the terms of his licence as Rector of All Saints, Wickham Terrace, in the diocese of Brisbane. He also said: These points taken together clearly demonstrate that there is insufficient cause to revoke my licence as Rector of the Parish of All Saints Wickham Terrace in the diocese of Brisbane. The archbishop set up commissions of inquiry under the Benefices Avoidance Canon. The commissioners wrote to Bishop Chislett saying: The Enquiry is considering whether you have wilfully contravened or violated the provisions of the Constitution, Canons, Rules or Regulations of the Synod of the Diocese of Brisbane, Anglican Church of Australia by being consecrated a Bishop and being appointed a Suffragan Bishop in the Anglican Catholic Church in Australia and/or whether the circumstance of such consecration and appointment is ‘grave cause' within the meaning of s 7 of the Benefices Avoidance Canon. Bishop Chislett appeared before the commissioners. In their response, effectively the commissioners affirmed the honesty and integrity of Bishop Chislett. They confirmed that no constitution, canons, rules or regulations of the diocese were contravened by the consecration. But they still found that, by being consecrated, there was grave cause that warranted his removal as rector of All Saints. We have a situation where a man was found innocent, but under the provisions of the Benefices Avoidance Canon, even though he was innocent, he was able to be sacked. I believe that it is important that the Supreme Court of Queensland investigate the Benefices Avoidance Canon. It is unjust and unfair. The situation is that there is now religious persecution by Archbishop Aspinall of traditional Anglicans. I believe that Archbishop Aspinall has to seriously consider resigning as Archbishop of Brisbane, because he is simply unfit to hold that high office. (Time expired)",120
