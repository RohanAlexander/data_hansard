NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Withdrawal from Treaties (Question No. 1330) Mr Slipper asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: What procedures are available for a future Commonwealth Government to withdraw from any international treaty, convention, protocol agreement signed and ratified by the current Government if the instrument is not supported by or consistent with the values of the future Government, Commonwealth or State Parliaments or the Australian people. Mr Bilney-The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: There are various procedures for withdrawing from treaties, and the procedure generally depends on the terms of the relevant treaty. Most treaties provide that withdrawal will take effect at the end of a specified period following notice of by the withdrawing party. Were the Australian Government to decide that it was no longer in Australia's interests to be bound by a particular international agreement, it would need to observe the conditions for withdrawal provided for in that agreement. All countries enter into international agreements on this understanding. Under the Constitution, the treaty making power is vested in the Federal Executive. Accordingly, only the Federal government is authorised to enter into or withdraw from an international agreement on behalf of Australia. Withdrawal from an international agreement is a treaty action of similar significance to becoming party to an international agreement, and similar domestic procedures apply. For example, in deciding whether to withdraw from a particular agreement, the Government would usually consult interested sections of the community. International Court of Justice (Question No. 1392) Mr Melham asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: NA (1) Did the UN General Assembly and Security Council on 10 November 1993 elect 5 members of the International Court of Justice for a nine-year term of office beginning on 6 February 1994.

(3) Have any Australian citizens taken part in a blockade of Bougainville by (a) alerting PNGDF units or vessels travelling between the Solomon Islands and Bougainville to assist their interception or (b) by any other means. (4) Is the Minister able to say how the PNGDF deals with crews of unarmed vessels believed to have breached, or attempted to breach, a blockade of Bougainville; if so, (a) what are the details and (b) have crews been killed; if so, what are the details. (5) Have PNGDF practices in Bougainville been the subject of Australian diplomatic protests, investigations, intelligence gathering or any other procedure potentially leading to these measures; if so, what are the details in each case. (6) Is Australia a signatory to any international treaty or agreement concerning matters dealt with in the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978; if so, (a) what are the details and (b) is the declaration referred to in part (1) consistent with Australia's obligations under each instrument. (7) Is Australia a signatory to any international treaty or agreement concerning actions of the types referred to in previous parts of this question; (a) what are the details and (b) has the Government fulfilled Australia's obligations under each instrument. Mr BilneyThe Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Yes, although the declaration to which Mr Mack refers was made on 20 July 1989, not 28 July 1989. (2) A number of Australian nationals employed by the aviation company under contract to the PNG Government have served as pilots for Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) UH-IH helicopters. The PNG Government has repeatedly assured the Australian Government that the aircraft are used in accordance with the guidelines set down and agreed between both governments in July 1989. These provide that the aircraft are to be used for purposes that are limited to such activities as transporting troops and supplies around Bougainville, patrolling and surveillance activities and evacuating military and civilian casualties. The Government is aware of only one Australian national being wounded while operating a PNGDF UH-IH. He was shot in the leg while flying in central Bougainville in 1992. The Government is not in the possession of any evidence to suggest that at the time of sustaining the wound he was engaged in any offensive military activity. Australian nationals are also employed as helicopter pilots on Bougainville by other civil aviation companies contracted by the PNG Government. The Government regards the details of their employment and activities as matters for the PNG Government and the contractors and individuals concerned. Members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) serving as loan personnel with the PNGDF under the Defence Cooperation program have from time to time visited North Solomons Province. Their visits have been at the request of the PNG Government under the terms of the letters signed in 1977 by the Papua New Guinea and Australian Ministers for Defence on the use of ADF personnel in politically sensitive areas. Such visits are approved on a case by case basis by the Australian Minister for Defence. They have been limited to providing technical advice for the PNGDF and Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC). There has been no ADF direct involvement in mounting or participating in PNGDF operations on Bougainville. The Government is aware that there may be other Australians living in Bougainville. One Australian has been reported to be living in BRA controlled territory in central Bougainville and there may be an Australian teacher in the Talena district. if so, In addition there are several business people (mostly in the construction industry) present in Bougainville at anyone time. As many of these people do not inform the Australian High Commission in Port Moresby of their movements, it is impossible to provide further details. The Government has no reason to believe however that any of these people are engaged in ""military or militarystyle operations"" in Bougainville. (3) Some of the Australian nationals employed as UH-IH pilots by the PNG firm contracted by the PNG Government, may have been involved in conducting surveillance of the PNG/Soiomon Islands border. The Government is unaware of any further activity that would be relevant to this question. (4) The Government understands that the PNGDF carries out the internationally accepted process of calling on vessels suspected of illegally crossing the PNG/Soiomon Islands border to halt and be searched. The Government is aware of incidents where vessels crossing the border have been fired upon by the PNGDF on occasions when those vessels have refused to allow a search or have fired at the PNGDF. The Amnesty International report for 1993 contains allegations of unarmed vessels being fired at by the PNGDF. The Government is not able to confirm the accuracy of those reports. (5) The Australian Government has a keen interest in the human rights situation on Bougainville and has regularly engaged the PNG Government, including at ministerial level, on reported incidents of human rights abuses. During regular visits to Bougainville since mid-199I, Australian High Commission officials have investigated PNGDF practices on Bougainville and its relationship with local communities. Human rights issues were given particular emphasis during the visit to Bougainville in April 1994 by an Australian parliamentary delegation which was funded by the Australian Government. Some of the issues raised have included the alleged execution of Ken Savia (a former minister in the Bougainville Interim Government), treatment of BRA captured by the PNGDF and the detention without trial of BRA members. The Australian Government has also strongly supported the proposal that Papua New Guinea establish a Human Rights Commission and has offered both financial and technical assistance. The frequency with which the Australian Government has engaged the PNG Government on human rights issues makes it impracticable to give comprehensive detail. (6) There are no international agreements to which Australia is a party concerning matters dealt with in the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978. The International Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries has not yet entered force (and is unlikely to do so for some years). Furthermore the Australian Government has not yet finalised its position on signing the Convention, although the issue is under active consideration. (7) (a) Australia is a party to a number of international agreements concerning armed conflicts, notably the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the two protocols of 1977. (b) Yes.
