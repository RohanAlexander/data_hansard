2,Mr COSTELLO,Unknown,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The measures contained in this bill will cut personal income tax for all Australian taxpayers. The tax reductions amount to $21.7 billion over the next four years. This is in addition to the $14.7 billion in tax cuts provided in last year's budget. From 1 July 2005, the 17 per cent marginal tax rate will be cut to 15 per cent. The 42 per cent threshold will increase to $63,000 and from 1 July 2006 will increase again to $70,000. From 1 July 2005, the 47 per cent threshold will increase to $95,000 and from 1 July 2006 will increase again to $125,000. The reduction in the 17 per cent rate to 15 per cent means that taxpayers who are eligible for the full low income tax offset will pay tax until their income exceeds $7,567, up from $7,382 currently. Senior Australians will also benefit. From 1 July 2005, senior Australians who receive the senior Australians tax offset can earn more without paying tax. Single senior Australians will now pay no tax on their annual income up to $21,968 and no tax on equal incomes up to a joint $36,494 for a couple. The Medicare levy threshold for senior Australians will be increased to ensure that they do not pay the Medicare levy until they begin to incur an income tax liability. The personal income tax cuts will assist low-income earners, boost disposable incomes and improve incentives for all Australian taxpayers to participate in the work force, to invest and to save. This will ensure that over 80 per cent of taxpayers will face a top marginal tax rate of 30 per cent or less. These personal income tax cuts will further improve the structure of Australia's tax system and increase our international competitiveness. Our strong economy, lifestyle advantages and changes to the top two thresholds will provide incentives to work in Australia. Taxpayers will not reach the highest marginal tax rate until they earn around three times average weekly earnings, with the top marginal rate applying to only three per cent of taxpayers from 2006-07. If the threshold for the top marginal rate had been indexed to inflation since 1996, on 1 July 2006 it would have stood below $64,000. Under the measures contained in this bill it will stand at $125,000. This income tax cut is due to take effect on 1 July of this year. In order to ensure that the tax cuts take effect on 1 July this year, this parliament needs to pass legislation. The legislation is the basis for the Commissioner of Taxation to publish the scales which inform employers how much tax they should not withhold. Until such time as those new scales are published showing the lesser amounts to be withheld, employees will still have today's tax taken out rather than the reduced tax which would apply after 1 July 2005. For that reason this legislation needs to go through this parliament in good time before 1 July 2005. Any blocking measures by the Australian Labor Party could only be designed to keep from people the tax cut which they deserve on 1 July 2005. Let me make it clear: the Australian Labor Party will not block this tax cut. This tax cut will go through in the new Senate if it does not go through in the current Senate. The only thing that the Australian Labor Party could be expecting to achieve with their current tactics is to delay a tax cut for all Australian income tax payers. Their opposition will be futile. It will not work. The new Senate will be able to pass this legislation, but the new Senate does not sit until 9 August. The tax cut is due on 1 July. I call on the Australian Labor Party not to stand in the way of tax cuts for every Australian. We know that Labor stand for higher taxes. They are demonstrating that they stand for higher taxes by trying to delay this bill. This morning the Australian Labor Party is in absolute chaos because of the brilliant Black Adder like tactics of the member for Lilley and the Leader of the Opposition. They have a cunning plan to deny Australians the tax cuts which they deserve. There are members of the Australian Labor Party backbench who know that this is a ridiculous tactic. I call on those members, if they are in the Senate, to at least abstain in relation to this vote and to allow this legislation through before 30 June. Let us be clear about this-Labor can only delay this tax cut if it has every single its senators voting against it in the Senate and combining with other minor parties. If those senators are prepared to join with the government, or at least to abstain from the vote, Australians can have their tax cuts. This government stands for lower income taxes. This government announced a plan for lower income taxes on Tuesday night. This government has fully funded it. This government calls on the opposition to join with it. This government says to the Labor Party, ‘Do not stand in the way of tax cuts.' Labor may stand for higher taxes, but this time the stand will be futile. This will go through the new Senate; it ought to go through immediately. I can also indicate, on behalf of the government, that if the Australian Labor Party wants to bring the vote on today, we would be prepared to facilitate that-with no divisions and no delaying tactics. If it wants to bring this bill on today, have a vote and go down on the record as voting against it in the House of Representatives, I make the offer that we would facilitate that if it were done by leave and by agreement. Why? Because Australians want income tax cuts. I commend this bill to the House. The full measures are contained in the exploratory memorandum which I present to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Gillard) adjourned. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2005 MEASURES No. 3) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Brough, and read a first time. Second Reading",17
3,Mr BROUGH,Unknown,"Longman-Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (9.09 am)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends various taxation laws to implement a range of changes and improveone of ments to Australia's taxation system. Firstly, the bill will implement a number of proposals to increase flexibility for charitable funds, ancillary funds and prescribed private funds, and hence further encourage charitable giving in Australia. The bill expands the concessions relating to the capital gains tax provisions, distributions by charitable funds, the income tax exemption for charities and the refund of franking credits provisions. The measure gives effect to the government's announcement in the 2004-05 budget. The amendment in Schedule 2 to this bill is technical in nature and deals with the recently expanded foreign branch profits exemption. The expanded exemption, in conjunction with Australia's treaties, could have resulted in foreign branch income and gains derived from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic not being taxed in Australia or the country in which the company operates. Schedule 2 to this bill reinstates the way Australian companies with foreign branch income and gains from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic were taxed prior to the implementation of the expanded foreign branch income exemption. This will ensure that such amounts continue to be taxed in Australia. The Commissioner of Taxation can release taxpayer information to certain law enforcement agencies, such as police forces and various crime commissions, if the commissioner is satisfied that the information is relevant to establishing whether a serious offence has been committed or to the making of a proceeds of crime order. The third measure will add the Corruption and Crime Commission of Western Australia to the list of law enforcement agencies to which taxpayer information can be provided. The fourth measure will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to make a technical correction. This will clarify that certain government institutions that are charitable institutions at law are not eligible fund. for fringe benefits tax rebatable employer status from 1 July 2005. This amendment will ensure that the status quo is not changed. Finally, this bill introduces a standard definition of a dependant: a child less than 21 years or a full-time student less than 25 years. This means there will be a single set age criteria for the housekeeper, keeper, medical expenses and zone tax offsets, as well as the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge. It will provide consistency for taxpayers and will allow more taxpayers to access the dependant-related offsets, the concessional Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge thresholds offsets, and the Medicare levy and Medicare levy surcharge family thresholds. Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. I commend this bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Fitzgibbon) adjourned. SUPERANNUATION BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Dr Stone, and read a first time. Second Reading",18
4,Dr STONE,Unknown,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (9.13 am)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Superannuation Bill 2005, together with the Superannuation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2005, will provide for the separation of the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, the PSSAP, from the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the PSS. The bill will also provide a framework for Australian government employers to offer employees and office holders with choice of The PSSAP will be established as a fully funded accumulation scheme for new Australian government employees and office holders and certain other persons from 1 July 2005. It was established as a subplan of the PSS by the 20th Amending Deed, which of amended the trust deed and rules under the child house- Superannuation Act 1990. The bill will provide for the PSSAP to commence as a scheme separate from the PSS. This will allow it to operate on the same basis as similar superannuation schemes. While it exists as part of the PSS, the PSSAP must operate within the framework of a largely unfunded defined benefit scheme, rather than a framework appropriate for a fully funded accumulation scheme. This requires it to include features that are not usual for accumulation schemes. Although the PSSAP will be separate from the PSS, the PSS board will continue to be responsible for the PSSAP and the Commissioner for Superannuation will continue to provide administrative services to the board in respect of the new scheme. The PSS board will also be responsible for the new PSSAP fund established by the bill. Like the PSS, the rules for the PSSAP will be provided for by trust deed. Following the passage of the bill a new trust deed and will be made for the PSSAP in essentially the same form as the existing rules for the PSSAP as a subplan of the PSS. It is intended that Australian government employees and office holders will be treated in the separate superannuation scheme in the same way as they would have been treated in the subplan of the PSS and employer contributions will be payable in the same circumstances. However, the bill, together with the consequential bill, will require new Australian government employees and office holders to be given choice of fund arrangements from 1 July 2006. Their employer may also offer them choice of fund from as early as 1 July 2005. This framework will provide them with unprecedented flexibility for investing their superannuation savings and will address the rigid arrangements currently in place where membership of one scheme is mandated for most employees. From 1 July 2006, Australian government employers will be required to comply with the choice requirements of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (SG Act), like most private sector employers. The legislation also provides that the PSSAP will be the employer-or defaultfund for Australian Public Service employees and certain other prescribed persons who do not choose a fund. Other employers will have the flexibility to nominate the PSSAP or another appropriate complying superannuation fund or retirement savings account in these circumstances. The proposed changes do not affect existing Australian government employees at 30 June 2005, including those employees who are members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme or the PSS. Also the arrangements will not generally rules affect those new employees who have an existing relevant interest in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme (CSS) or the PSS, for example where a person has a PSS preserved benefit. Those employees will continue to be eligible to join those schemes as appropriate. I commend this bill to the House and I table the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Fitzgibbon) adjourned. NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2005 First Reading Bill presented by Dr Stone, and read a first time. Second Reading",19
5,Dr STONE,SUPERANNUATION,"Murray-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration (9.18 am)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Superannuation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2005 will amend eight acts and the trust deed under the Superannuation Act 1990 as a consequence of the establishment of the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan, the PSSAP, as a separate superannuation scheme and will allow Australian government employees and office holders to have choice of fund. The Superannuation Bill 2005 will establish the PSSAP as a separate scheme from the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme, the PSS. The Superannuation Act 1990, which provides for the PSS, will confirm that the PSS will close to new employees from 1 July 2005 with the commencement of the PSSAP. The Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 is being amended to allow Australian government employers to comply with the choice of fund requirements until 1 July 2006 in respect of employees who are PSSAP members. From that date, employers will be required to meet the choice of fund requirements in respect of new employees in the same manner as most private sector employers. The Superannuation (Productivity Benefit) Act 1988 provides for superannuation guarantee type contributions for Australian government employees and office holders who are not Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme or PSS members. The bill will amend that act so that it does not apply to new employees and office holders from 1 July 2006. Superannuation will be provided for these persons as agreed with their employer subject to employers providing contributions at least in accordance with the perannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. Also, these employees and office holders may join the PSSAP if eligible to do so. The bill will also amend the productivity benefit act to ensure that the act does not apply in respect of PSSAP members who have chosen to cease PSSAP membership in accordance with the choice of fund arrangements. The Governor General Act 1974 and the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 are being amended as a consequence of the closure of the productivity benefit act to new employees. The amendments provide safety net superannuation guarantee minimum support to the Governor General and judges in rare circumstances where the benefit otherwise payable would be less than the superannuation guarantee minimum employer superannuation. The bill makes minor amendments to the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and to the trust deed PSS. These amendments concern the establishment of the PSSAP as a separate scheme. The Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990 also includes minor amendments to allow Australian government employers to provide employees with choice of funds. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Snowdon) adjourned. NA Corporations and Financial Services Committee Report",20
6,Ms BURKE,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee Suon Corporations and Financial Services, I present the committee's report entitled Statutory oversight of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, together with the evidence received by the committee. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper",21
7,Ms BURKE,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I rise to welcome the report and wish to start by thanking most sincerely the staff of our committee, who go to great lengths to make these events worthwhile-particularly Dr Anthony Marcinac, Mr Alex Olah, Ms Loes Slatery and Ms Laurie Cassidy. I want to thank also the chairman of ASIC, Mr Jeffrey Lucy, in his first statutory oversight appearance since his appointment as chairman, and his team for their cooperation in this hearing process. Several issues of currency were pursued during the hearing and, for the sake of the record, I would like to go to a few today. In this all-party process, where we get the benefit of parliament in action, it was reassuring to see all committee members seeking assurances from ASIC in respect of the FSR legislation and whether the process is achieving the desired outcomes of protecting consumers at a reasonable cost to business. ASIC was of the view that FSR was a success, as no-one was criticising the underlying philosophy and what it delivers-the criticism is about piles of paper and mechanical aspects. Whilst there is no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater, I would beg to differ that the FSR is not a success just yet. The principle is correct but, if the process is flawed, no-one is benefiting. Consumers feel more confused than ever and participants are bogged down by paperwork, and that was not the intention. There is a need for greater transparency in this process. Quoting from the committee's transcript: Our very public position is that we have disappointed with the length. That is in reference to the length of paperwork. It continues: It is just a question of how you encourage or enforce shortness. I am not sure that we can encourage or enforce shortness, but we do need to recommend the relevant authorities, who currently are in consultation, to refine the disclosure and licensing regime to make the FSR process work as it was intended. The refinements to the FSR proposals paper have just been released by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, and the committee will watch with interest to see whether this process can iron out the ‘bugs' in the system. The ability to get FSR right is critical as we embark on the brave new world of choice of superlegislation has just been introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration. Certainly there is a need for greater clarity for consumers going into this hugely complex and, in some respects, frightening area of choice. Given the very low take-up of choice of investment, there does appear to be a huge leap to actually achieving choice of fund. The start date of 1 July is bearing down upon us rapidly and there is very little in the way of education for consumers and, in some respects more importantly, for employers, who will bear the burden of implementing this regime. Employees will be looking for advice and the boss will probably be the first choice. Employers need greater protection from the claim of giving bad or biased advice. ASIC conceded that it is concerned there is a need for greater education of and protection for consumers and that greater disclosure is required. Again I quote from the transcript of the hearing: So, yes, we are concerned. It is a very large been amount of money and a large number of consumers are involved in it, but we think we have the programs in place to deal with it, along with other agencies. … … … Certainly we are going to be undertaking surveillance to try to monitor [the introduction]. The issue of third-line enforcing was also canvassed during the hearing. Whilst ASIC rightly pointed out that this is an area for the ACCC, it was monitoring the area of disclosure-and, again, the committee will monitor this area with interest-particularly to ensure that the concerns of small business are not realised. There was great discussion about enforcement activities that ASIC is currently undertaking. Regarding enforcement activities and specifically the prosecution of HIH executives, the committee called on ASIC for an explanation of the prosecution strategy and process for determining which charges would be pursued and which would not. Chairman Lucy preferred to defer discussions in these matters until after sentencing of the HIH directors concerned. Sentences for Rodney Adler and Ray Williams have now been handed down. The committee reserved the right to call on ASIC to explain its strategy in selecting which charges would be pursued and which would be dropped. While Labor members understand that prosecutorial procedures demand an interpretation of the facts at hand and assessment of the most prudent prosecution strategy, the public have the right to understand these procedures and trade-offs that are made, in the event that we are faced with another multibillion-dollar collapse in the future. Whilst these two individuals have gone to jail, many consumers out there still bear the brunt of this collapse. These issues will be taken up initially in the budget estimates hearings, but the committee has reserved the right to call ASIC at a later date, necessary. I was very pleased to see that ASIC did agree that there was need to enforce the law at hand so that we do not see a collapse of this nature again. The committee went into detail in respect of CLERP 9. Chairman Lucy noted a difference of view with the government on the issue of independence and conflicts of interest regarding market analysts. This is still an area of concern for Labor members of the committee. Despite the government's preference for a statement of potential conflicts of interest by analysts, not all conflicts can be mitigated in this manner. ASIC's original submission to Treasury on CLERP 9 in 2003 took a robust view in relation to the types of conflicts that need to be disclosed and those that need to be prohibited. In its submission, ASIC advised that effective regulation of analysts required an integral legislative approach. ASIC suggested that such an approach would comprise three elements: restrictions or prohibitions on certain conduct that cannot otherwise be effectively regulated by an obligation to manage or disclose conflicts; a general obligation on licensees to manage other conflicts when providing research reports; and a specific obligation on licensees to disclose conflicts of interests when providing research reports. ASIC's submission also raised concerns about whether disclosure was sufficient in relation to certain conflicts. ASIC said that, in its view: ... at a fundamental level, the Act needs to prohibit certain activities of analysts where conflicts cannot be effectively managed, and disclosure of such conflicts is not sufficient to mitigate consumer ... risk. ASIC went on to recommend that the following activities be prohibited in the act: trading by an analyst or researcher in products that are the subject of a current research report, if within a set period, and trading by an analyst or its individual researchers against a recommendation or opinion contained in a current research report. Labor's view remains that the government's response has been inadequate to these issues and that ASIC was well placed to interpret requirements for change in this area. Like ASIC, Labor's view is that, while conflict management is an often-expressed desire by management and staff of analyst organisations, its effective implementation has been found wanting. In a recent newspaper report it was stated: ASIC found that a voluntary code of conduct introduced by the industry's peak body in 2002 had “not been adopted as uniformly and closely as is appropriate”. We are concerned that while conflict management is an often-expressed aspiration of both management and staff, the effective implementation of such an ideal has been found to be disappointing ... I commend the report to the House. NA (TEACHING PROFESSION) BILL 2004 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 May, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That the bill be now read a second time.",22
8,Mr SNOWDON,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,"I was engaged in addressing the parliament on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 last night and unfortunately had to finish early to allow for the adjournment. So I am back, but the message remains the same: the government's proposal to amend the Sex Discrimination Act in the way that it proposes is, in our view-and certainly my view-unnecessary. It is a narrow-sighted action by the government, which has sought a short-term solution as a knee-jerk reaction to an issue that requires considerable consideration of the social, political and economic factors that have led to the imbalance of males in the teaching profession in the first place. It is also redundant because a satisfactory conclusion was reached with the Catholic Education Office in New South Wales as to the way in which they could deal with their proposal to have scholarships for boys-that is, by agreeing to have an equivalent number of scholarships for young women. What we have discovered as a result of the scholarships being offered is this: of the 12 scholarships, each worth $8,000 a year, that were offered to males, only six were taken up. That clearly demonstrates to me that the scholarships issue itself is not the question. It is a far deeper problem, and amending the Sex Discrimination Act in the way that is being proposed will not solve it. There are reasons why graduates, both male and female, are not presenting to enter the teaching profession through schools in the arts, science and technical fields and other areas. These are the things that the government should be addressing. Once having got them into our schools, the government should be addressing how to keep them there, with satisfying career paths to allow both them and their students to achieve their full potential in a safe, well resourced environment satisfactory for the 21st century. In my own electorate of Lingiari there are many schools, particularly in remote communities, that do not fit that bill. They are under-resourced. Physically they are an aberration, largely due to 27 years of indolence by conservative governments in the Northern Territory, and of course the kids who are subject to this indifference and indolence are the poorest students in Australia-Aboriginal kids. They are the sorts of issues that the government should be addressing. There is no shortage of goodwill among those people who are involved in the teaching profession and engaged in the classroom-let that be very clear. There was a time when males dominated the teaching profession for a range of reasons. A generation ago, female workers, including teachers, were paid less than their male counterparts. A generation ago, female teachers were expected to resign-that is, to sacrifice their career-when having a child. There are female teachers today that have had to rebuild their careers-in terms of long service, superannuation and access to promotion-after having their careers interrupted by conditions of service that certainly would not be tolerated today and were discriminatory. A generation ago, for many males teaching was an early career option. I mentioned this last night. I, along with many other people in this chamber-I am not sure how many of our generation, because there are not many of us here-entered the profession. My colleague at the table, the Attorney General, never entered the teaching profession though, and I think he is even older than me. Mr Ruddock-My father did.",24
9,Mr SNOWDON,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,"He was a good man. Mr Ruddock-I was born in Canberra, like you.",25
10,Mr SNOWDON,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,We were very lucky. Mr Ruddock-We are the only two in this House.,25
11,Mr SNOWDON,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,That is right. The minister reminds me that we are the only two people to have served in this parliament who were born-and in my case raised-in Canberra. That is a bit of trivia that may be ful to some student at some time in the future. Mr Ruddock-It was Ainslie infants school.,25
12,Mr SNOWDON,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,"He is a child of Ainslie infants school. I was a child of St Benedict's primary school in Narrabundah, which, by the way, has its 50th anniversary this year. Nevertheless, we entered the teaching profession because it was an opportunity. We were able to gain bonded scholarships-in my case, a New South Wales teaching service scholarship, as I mentioned last night, and later a Commonwealth scholarship. Teaching was a staging post on the way to one's preferred career, but what many people did was stay on that career path. Once they entered the teaching profession, they realised what an opportunity it was, and those who became dedicated professionals did a very good job. Of course people have moved on, and many who were once teachers are now in this place. I am not sure how many but I would suggest it is probably the most significant representation of any profession in the parliament. We always thought it used to be lawyers, but certainly when I first came here the parliament was dominated by teachers. The bonded system also meant that many talented graduates received life-challenging experience of communities different from their own-and they were not all episodes from the novel Wake in Fright. I am sure you recall that, Mr Deputy Speaker. A broad range of teachers from different social and cultural backgrounds entered our education system, bringing with them an understanding of and empathy for the students in their charge. A generation ago, schools were bulging at the seams. Career prospects for teachers were good and the supply of students meant there was a need for senior teachers, principals, student support specialuseists and education managers. Nothing has changed, except that the profile of the teaching profession is an ageing one. A young student teacher long ago could identify a career path that could be achieved within a short space of time. Now there are bottlenecks: people are finding that it is far more difficult to get promotion because people in the promotional positions are staying for longer periods. There was also an optimism that education was a pathway that, if pursued, would reap rewards, part of which was the esteem in which teachers were held within the community. Of course, those things have changed over time-critically, I think-so that teachers are not given the recognition and support of the general community that they deserve. The sad fact is that, compared with other careers, teaching is not well resourced. Hours in the classroom are very intense and the technological revolution is daily changing the role of the teacher. We know this to be the case. The skills required to be a good teacher today can often readily have a better application and be more financially rewarding-as well as socially and professionallyin another area. Rather than tinkering with the Sex Discrimination Act, this government should be more proactive in providing resources that will attract students, both male and female, to the teaching profession. This government should be ensuring that all schools have adequate facilities to serve their communities. I will give you an example, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee recently conducted hearings in my own electorate of Lingiari into Indigenous education funding. At one of the hearings, at Ross Park Primary School, which is my local primary school-my son attends that school and my partner teaches there-a parent, Matt Skoss, who is also a teacher, related to the committee how at his school last year there was an Indigenous male tutor employed under the Aboriginal Tutor Assistance Support program. It is a very important position in the school and he is a very important role model for the school. This young man enjoyed his job and was clearly a very important factor in providing guidance to young Indigenous kids, particularly the males. His support around the school was much appreciated by the other professional staff. This man had been encouraged by his principal to undertake study to become a teacher. What did the government do? They changed all the tutorial assistance arrangements so that he and many others like him had their jobs put in jeopardy. In fact, start of this year, tens if not hundreds of people like this were without a job in the education system. These were tutors who were working with the most disadvantaged and deprived students in Australia. They lost their jobs because of the idiocy of decisions taken by the government. Instead of tinkering with the Sex Discrimination Act, this government ought to be looking at the real reasons why we have a lack of males within schools-whether or not they are teachers or other role models such as tutors or tutorial assistance workers like the one I have just discussed. I might also point out that Ross Park Primary School-which I think has only one male teacher for a school of about 320 studentshas a dedicated program to working with boys. All of the staff have dedicated their time to trying to develop strategies to ensure better outcomes for boys at that school, and they are not alone. It happens in schools-I know this to be the case in my electorateright across the community. The teachers are actively engaged in addressing issues which were identified by the member for Macquarie in his contribution last night about the way in which boys are performing in schools. These are the issues that need to be addressed by the government, not this proposal to amend the Sex Discrimination Act. We need to make sure the government looks at the big picture-and not through this little divisive bill. I think this is the third time this bill has been in the parliament. Why would you do this? It is completely unnecessary and it is designed to be divisive. That is the only reason. There is absolutely no educational motive for this. As has already been evidenced by the experience of the Catholic Education Office in New South Wales, even offering the scholarships did not achieve the outcome they were after. They now acat the knowledge they have to adopt different strategies to address the sorts of issues that have spoken about in my speech this morning and last night. We need to have a holistic approach to developing professional pathways that will attract men and women into the teaching profession. We need to make sure we do this quickly, because the nation demands it.",25
13,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak to the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 today because it is highly concerning to me and to my coalition colleagues that in this country the proportion of male teachers is shrinking, particularly in our primary schools. It seems that that point at least is non-controversial. At least my colleague the member for Lingiari would concede that the proportion of male teachers has shrunk. Even in the example that he has just cited, there is only one male schoolteacher in a school of 300 students. Nobody on this side of the chamber is arguing that the proposal put forward in this bill will somehow solve that problem on its own, as if this were a silver bullet which could cure all of society's issues, difficulties and challenges in education. Nobody on this side of the chamber has ever put forward that argument. We as a government are looking here to provide one sensible measure which we believe will at least help to address that problem. Only one-fifth of Australia's primary school teachers across the country are male, and I am worried that this is having a negative effect on the education of all our young people in schools, and young boys in particular. But I would hasten to add that this is not just a boys' education issue, because it is an unsustainable argument that girls would not also benefit from having an appropriate balance of male and female teachers. The reality is-and this is borne out by anybody who has been a parent or anyone who has been a schoolteacher-that both boys and girls I benefit from having a real gender balance in the teaching profession. That may be difficult to achieve, but if we do not try nothing will change. Through this bill that I speak of today, the Howard government demonstrates its commitment to addressing this gender anomaly and to ensuring that children-both boys and girls-have male as well as female role models in their school years. I am able to speak to this bill today not as an expert but from experience, as I was once a high school teacher in the Tasmanian state education system. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, I know that you have a similar work background and perhaps, as you listen to my comments, you too might reminisce about some of the issues that we as schoolteachers have faced in the past. I will not harp on about this today, but it has to be said that public education in this country is underfunded. That is another point that is non-controversial. On our side of the chamber we continue to provide increases in real funding to education through support to all schools around Australia-public and private. Nobody on the other side of this chamber could argue with this government's record in funding public schools, public classrooms and public school teachers. We provide real funding support to the schools we do not even run. We are not embarrassed about that. We do not begrudge that funding and we do not feel that we need a gold medal for the excellent work that we have achieved-for example, the unprecedented $34 billion quadrennium funding that was passed by this parliament early this year. We asked the state and territory governments to lift their game. We asked them to substantially increase funding such that it could at least match or approach the funding increases that the federal government has offered. I think Brendan Nelson, as the Minister for Education, Science and Training, should be recognised and commended for the excellent work that he has done in raising the level of federal funding to public schools, despite what the Australian Education Union and his state Labor colleagues may taunt him with. I can recall a time as a schoolteacherbelieve this or not-when I was considered the first male role model that one young student had ever had any meaningful contact with. I will never, ever forget this young low. This boy-today he is a young manhad grown up in a single parent home. His mother had taken on that role in this particular case and he had never known a male teacher throughout all of his years in primary school. Bear in mind that I was a secondary school teacher and the child was in grade 7. He had never known his father, and his family life, if I may say, was somewhat insular. As would be expected, his sudden ongoing contact with several male teachers, such as me, in secondary school was a disaster. If I may reflect on this situation for a moment, I believe that he could not cope with not being the man about the place anymore. He could not cope with taking some direction and instruction from a man. His behaviour suffered enormously and his time in high school, I am very sad to say, was largely misspent. Of course, in a secondary school environment he was surrounded by many male teachers. The ratios there are so much different. It breaks my heart when I reflect on that young student. I do not know where he is today. I suspect he will have ongoing challenges in his life. I am not arguing that having more male teachers in his primary school would have solved or resolved all of his issues and challenges in life, but the Australian parliament should have a go. Why don't we try something that has not been tried before? Why don't we show some courage and be bold. We should have a go and try this. It cannot hurt. Providing incentives for male teachers to enter the classroom is not going to hurt anybody, but until we do this, until we at least give it a go, until we at least attempt to get through this parliament 500 new opportunities to encourage some men into the classroom, people on this side of the chamber and people on the other side of the chamber will never know whether it can work. It is therefore very important to encourage fela positive view about the role of men in the honourable profession of teaching. Again, I speak with experience when I say that teaching can be an extremely satisfying career path, with lifelong rewards. If I ever get tipped out of this place I will very favourably consider going back to the classroom. It is a great job. As a teacher you are able to play a significant and life-changing, life-affecting, life-affirming role in the lives of young people. We are there to teach them, to help them learn, to help them through difficult times, to encourage them to fulfil their potentialbecause they all have that-and to guide them in the right direction in many areas, from academic pursuits to sporting endeavours. My personal goal was always to encourage young people to engage closely with their community through community service. At this point I think it is important to make clear that teachers are not, and should not be, a substitute for parents. But they can still have an important and vital role in a child's life. Ideally, their roles should be seen as complementary to those of parents. I think we as a government and certainly as a federal parliament should recognise that, while so much more work is being placed on teachers to help in the socialisation of children, particularly where there have been issues and challenges at home, parents have the primary role in a child's life. They are, after all, the ones who love them. As much as we believe in education and the welfare of children, and as much as teachers want to see children achieve all of their potential and goals in life, they are not the ones who love them. Parents are the ones who love the children. It is the parents who make sacrifices for the welfare of their children and parents who cry from the heart for the aspirations of their children. Parents have a lifelong commitment to their children as they grow into adults and hopefully enjoy satisfying, happy and rewarding lives. The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 is also a strategy to support male teachers and to address the particular education needs of boys in schools. I do not have time to go into this today, but it is something that has been recognised. The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training inquiry into the education of boys makes it clear-boys do learn differently from girls. Shock horror! None of us should be too amazed about this. It is not a discriminatory statement. We are not saying that somehow boys are inferior to girls. We are not saying that boys are better at maths and physics and that girls are better at English, social sciences and humanities. None of those statements are being made, but what I have said has to be acknowledged. People from the far Left just cannot get over the need to accept that men and women are different. Boys and girls are different too and boys and girls can learn differently. This is not about woodwork versus sewing. This is about providing a reasonable balance. It is about providing a balanced environment in which a child can learn. Our society should do all that it can to ensure that the classroom environment reflects a good balance of the complementary roles of males and females, in much the same way that healthy motherhood and fatherhood roles are the pre-eminent way to look after the needs of children in the home. Not all children can live with both their mother and their father. That is the case for so many different reasons, many of which are heart breaking and difficult, and can even be difficult to speak about. But as long as I stand in this place I will never give up the belief that this is still the ideal. It is always worth our remembering that it is the ideal to strive for, and to hold it up as such. In the lives of so many people that ideal is not possible, and we will support them. We will help them and we will not judge them. But we will not give up the notion of an important balance between male and female as being a beneficial environment in which to grow up-in the home and in the classroom. The 2003 report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training Boys-getting it right: report on the inquiry into the education of boys identified significant challenges for boys, and I would ask those few members of the opposition who are here today to hear me out. The report states: Between 1975 and 1995, the literacy achievement of fourteen year-old boys declined. In 2000, 9 per cent of boys in Year Three and 15 per cent of boys in Year Five failed to achieve minimum reading benchmarks. This compares with just 6 per cent of girls in Year Three and 10 per cent of girls in Year Five. Year 12 retention rates are 11 per cent higher for girls, driving a 6 per cent higher rate of university entry. In some cases, the Year 12 gap between boys and girls is up to 19 percentage points with girls outstripping boys in almost 90 per cent of courses. However, the real problems are at the other end of the educational spectrum. Recent research shows that, in some instances, boys represent up to two-thirds of those in the bottom quartile of school achievers. Boys represent 80 per cent of students in school disciplinary programmes, and are more likely to be involved in assault and drug related incidents. They are three times more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident, and for people aged 15-24 the rate of male suicide is five times that of the male rate. The problem is not that girls are doing better boys-it is instead that boys are not doing as well as they once did. And I add: as well as they can and should. So I ask this parliament: what are we going to do about the problem? Nobody on this side is arguing that this one bill on its own will address this problem. But if that short quote from that lengthy report does not put some fire into your belly to help to address the problems of boys and girls, but particularly boys, who are struggling in schools today, then you are blind to the reality of what is happening in Australian schools and to what is happening in the lives of young people who will grow into young men and who will, based on their life experiences and based on their missed opportunities, perpetuate some of these problems in their own families. Earlier this year I attended a presentation by boys education advocate Freerk Ykema. He is from the Netherlands and he has pioneered a learning approach which he has called ‘Rock and Water'. This is being implemented in schools around the world. It has been somewhat of an educational revolution in his own country, but more recently there has been a large take-up of the approach in New South Wales, Northern Queensland and parts of Northern Tasmania. He has a groundswell of support at the University of Newcastle. As a teacher and father of two boys, this presentation helped me to better understand this sometimes complex issue. He talks about the qualities of boys: energetic, creative, explorative and loving a challenge. Boys like rules to be fair and strict. Boys must be challenged and must be given physical challenges. He argues that boys have some difficulty in areas such as literacy, self-reflection and verbalising feelings and emotions and, therefore, it is more difficult fe- for them to learn from mistakes and, he argues, more difficult for them to find inner than direction. That is not to say, of course, that boys cannot do very well in literacy, selfreflection and verbalising their feelings and emotions, but he is arguing that it is not their impulse to achieve in those areas. To achieve in those areas they have to be challenged in the right way. Freerk Ykema also argues that society has changed, and none here would disagree with that, and is in a state of change. Women have been emancipated and traditional role patterns have changed. Increasingly, technology has meant that traditional ‘male' jobs are disappearing, and with them the male identity. Multicultural society has caused some obscurity in young people's minds about values, standards and social manners. Education has been feminised in the past 15 to 20 years, he argues. There are more female teachers, especially in primary schools. This has directly resulted in fewer male role models and more emphasis on reading, writing, reflections, conversation and communication. Sadly, it has also accidentally resulted in less understanding, respect and support for boys' qualities, which I have already described. That might sound a little controversial to somebody reading this speech in Hansard at a later time, and that might be difficult to accept for somebody hearing me say it, but before quickly judging me or Freerk Ykema on some of these points perhaps the reader or the listener should talk to a parent. In short, the outcome of much of this is that boys are missing out in many Australian schools. So often boys have been discouraged and misunderstood instead of being valued, and this has diminished even further their lower capacity to communicate their problems. So teachers have witnessed increasing disturbing behaviour. Education authorities have witnessed a decrease in the academic performance of boys. There is more violence in Australian schools and there is something of an inability of school principals to deal with that. There is more drug and alcohol abuse in our community. Boys are increasingly the victims of their own risk taking. Suicide of our boys is one of our nation's greatest shames and the harshest reality check. The University of Sydney's Dr Peter West, of whom we have heard already, has also spoken on how male teachers are different. He argues that male teachers have louder voices, are more down to earth and organise more hands-on activities for children in the classroom. This is not to say that female teachers are not effective too; of course, they are. But if the teaching profession were male dominated and only 20 per cent of primary school teachers were female, the same changes to the Sex Discrimination Act that we are debating today would still be needed-and dare I say would probably have the support of the Labor Party. The outcomes of a comprehensive review of a Tasmanian secondary school revealed that parents, teachers and students at the school identified student motivation and engagement, particularly of boys, as a significant concern. The review found that 95 per cent of all students sent to detention at time were boys from grades 7 and 8, 80 per cent of students suspended were boys, and boys were well below girls in statewide tests of literacy and numeracy. The politically-correct and left-wing set would do well to consider the serious state of play that I have described before dismissing changes to the Sex Discrimination Act. The community wants change, parents want change, and boys want and need change. I am proud to be part of the movement to begin the sorts of structural changes that are now warranted and long overdue. Why are there more female teachers in primary schools than male teachers? HREOC have something to answer for in that because, of course, when the Catholic Education Office sought to have special scholarships for male teachers they were knocked back. They were told they could only offer scholarships equally to male and female students. I have heard the Labor Party say that that is being played out. Kelvin Canavan of the Sydney Catholic Education Office has now said that he has filled all 12 positions for the female scholarships but has not even received that many applications for the male ones. Rather than the Labor Party getting away with saying that that proves their point, they ought to accept that that actually highlights the fact that the teaching profession for males is not valued by this community. We have to improve our act. It highlights the need for specific male-only teacher scholarships in places where there is a demand and a need for more male role models in schools today. I commend the bill to the House and call on the Labor Party to support it.",27
14,Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,"The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 has, of course, been before us before. Indeed lunchthe comments I have heard from the member for Bass and other members on this matter are ones that I do not necessarily disagree with. However, I think the last part of the member for Bass's comments is the critical part that should be focused on today because what we do find in this place is a common view that there needs to be more male teachers in the education system. I have not heard one member of this place indicate otherwise. The fact is, however, that this bill is not really going to solve that problem. I think the member for Denison said it best when he said that the legislation before us today proposes a solution to a question that we have already answered. I think that that is the case. To place this in some historiand, cal context, effectively what happened was that the Catholic Education Office sought to provide 12 scholarships to males only and sought an exemption from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The commission considered the application to be discriminatory and in breach of the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act and therefore suggested instead that the best approach would be to allow for 24 scholarships, 12 male-only scholarships and 12 female scholarships-in that way still providing the capacity for the Catholic Education Office to invite and fill 12 scholarships for men as future teachers. So the solution to the problem was determined by some innovative thinking by the commission and was accepted, as I understand it, by the Catholic Education Office as providing an alternative to their earlier application. Notwithstanding the fact that the problem was in effect solved in relation to this particular matter, the government continues to proceed with this bill in the belief that it is okay to turn on its head the antidiscrimination law of this land. If you are able to solve a problem without adversely affecting the antidiscrimination law of the Commonwealth, clearly that is the best approach. However, unfortunately, the government chose not to listen to the opposition on this matter back in the last term and has chosen not to listen again this week. The fact is the scholarships that have been provided for male teachers have not been filled. It is important to note that in March this year-and it may have been subsequently reported-the Australian newspaper revealed that the Catholic Education Office managed to fill only six of the 12 teaching scholarships it was offering to men. In effect, it sought an application to provide male-only scholarships, the commission provided an alternative to allow for 12 from each gender notwithstanding that, there have been only six applicants able to fill the 12 positions, leaving six vacancies in the male scholarship positions. I am not sure whether that has changed since it was reported in the media, but clearly it points to a problem that is much more complex than the government is suggesting. The government is suggesting that you can reverse years of antidiscrimination law to fix a minor matter. That is what we would be doing if we voted for this bill today. But, of course, it would not solve the problem. The parliament has considered this before, and the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Workplace Relations clearly indicated in its report entitled Boys: getting it right that the paucity of male teachers in the education system is a complex matter. Indeed, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission also reviewed this matter and made three findings. Clearly, there were more women than men primary school teachers in Australia, and the reasons for the gender imbalance were varied but included the status of teachers in the community, child protection issues and the pay and conditions of primary school teachers relative to other occupations. There are three factors that at least attempt to explain the dearth of male teachers in the education system, particularly in primary schools. They are the matters we should be dwelling on when seeking to fix this matter, and the government has failed to consider them properly. The parliament has not properly examined ways to raise the status of the profession of teaching. Most people in the community value teaching as one of the most important professions anyone could enter because of its value to society. As has often been said about teaching, it is a noble profession. To undertake the care and learning of young people in society is a very important role and should be valued as such. Over many years there has been a devaluation of the teaching profession. I am not sure whether this has been caused by the fact that teaching has been feminised-to use the term-that is, increasingly more women have taken up the teaching profession, thereby affecting the way in which teachers are remunerated. Historically, where you find an industry that predominantly employs women you will find, generally speaking, that their rates of pay when compared with the competencies, responsibilities and skills required to undertake the work are undervalued. We have seen that in nursing. If you compare the responsibilities, skills, wages, tions and career paths of nurses with other like professions where there is a larger proportion of men you will find that they have been historically undervalued. I think there has been some attempt over the last 20 years to rectify that inequity. But the fact is that when you have occupations that are primarily taken up by women, for whatever reason, it is likely that their conditions of employment and their career paths are not valued as highly as those occupations filled mainly by men. There was a time-and I think the member for Brisbane mentioned this in this debate-when women had to retire as teachers once they married. It is only a generation ago-only 30 years ago or thereaboutswhen women were forced to resign from their employment, their noble profession, in the event of marriage. Thankfully, that has altered, but clearly what has occurred is a gradual diminution in the recognition of teachers in our society. Therefore, all governments-federal and state-should be considering the ways in which we can reassert the importance of teachers in our society. The ways we could do that would clearly include reviewing pay structures and career paths and looking at the issue in a more holistic way, rather than seeking to amend antidiscrimination laws in order to provide for male-only scholarships which, as I said earlier, have not even been taken up by enough male applicants. There is clearly a problem that goes well beyond the reach of this bill. This bill is more about playing politics than developing good policy. This is about attempting to argue that the Labor Party is in some way discriminating against men. Nothing could be further from the truth. What is being proposed here would have to mean that in the teaching profession there are a multitude of men waiting at the door to be interviewed and successfully appointed as conditeachers and for some reason they are not getting the jobs-that because of their gender they are not receiving offers to be employed in schools. To seek an exemption to the Sex Discrimination Act is effectively to say that there has been some form of evidential discrimination against men in this profession. The fact is that discrimination is not being exerted by schools; there is just a dearth of interest by males in entering the profession. Other speakers have indicated the importance of finding a balance-that is, having men and women in the teaching profession. I concur; that is important. But the only way we will do that is to attack those matters that have been left unattended for many years. Of course, the member for Bass is a former teacher, and he and I probably disagree on a number of matters. But he is an example of somebody who obviously valued his teaching but chose, for whatever reason, to enter this place-as indeed have other former teachers, such as the member for Brisbane, I think, as well as other members. That might be for all sorts of reasons. Many teachers seek work outside the teaching profession, which of course is their right. Many of them are doing so because of the lack of satisfaction they get in the workplace, the stress that comes about from the lack of resources in certain schools or, as I said earlier, ing. the failure to recognise the importance and value of people in this profession. I think it is a little rich for the government to continue with a bill that for all intents and purposes is unnecessary when the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission had managed to find an innovative way to allow for 12 scholarships for men and 12 scholarships for women. After that was achieved, by amending the application made by the Catholic Education Office-and I understand that was happily accepted by that office-those 12 scholarships for males have not been filled. That clearly indicates that the problem is far more complex than the government is letting on. Instead, we are seeing the government playing politics over good policy. I oppose this bill. It is an unnecessary It does not solve the problem it seeks to solve. It is attempting to belittle the very portant history of antidiscrimination laws. The fact that the government thinks it can turn these laws on their head to solve a problem shows its lack of regard for antidiscrimination laws per se. I oppose the bill and I ask other members to do the same.",31
15,Ms CORCORAN,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,"Isaacs) (10.17 am)The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 is here essentially for the third time. The bill was introduced in March 2004 and was knocked back-very sensibly, I might say-by the Senate. The bill was reintroduced in August 2004 but the proroguing of parliament for the 2004 general election meant that the bill lapsed. It is now introduced again. The purpose of the bill is to amend the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 to provide a permanent exemption for the provision of gender-specific scholarships which can be offered to students in a teaching course. These scholarships must be designed to address gender imbalance in teachThe beginnings of this bill are found in the Sydney Catholic Education Office. The Sydney CEO applied for an exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act, the SDA, so that it could offer male-only scholarships to student teachers for a period of five years. The students were to be students of primary school education. While the application was for a five-year exemption, the Sydney CEO said that the provision of male-only scholarships might form part of a longer term strategy to encourage males into primary teaching. In February 2003 the president of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, HREOC, refused the Sydney CEO's application. Whilst the Sydney CEO was considering its options regarding an appeal against this bill. decision, the government launched into action and prepared this bill. The Sydney CEO im- did not ask for the bill and was in fact taken by surprise by it. The Sydney CEO and HREOC reached a solution to the Sydney CEO's problem. This has been done without any need to amend the Sex Discrimination Act, so the stated original purpose for this bill has disappeared. The fact that this bill is back indicates an agenda other than the stated one. There are those who argue that the action taken by the government when it first introduced this bill was more about an ideological debate than trying to fix the problem. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Education, Science and Training talk about the ‘zealous commitment' to the SDA of those who oppose this bill and the ‘triumph of narrow ideology over common sense'. It seems to me that there is indeed a lack of common sense in this debate, but not from this side of the House. It is worth remembering that this bill was initially introduced at a time when the then Leader of the Opposition was quite successfully making lots of good points about boys needing men around them. At that time there was an election in the wind and the Prime Minister was getting a bit rattled. These ments were making sense to the electorate, and the PM was on the back foot. This bill was essentially about deflecting the issue rather than addressing it properly. After all, as I said before, the problem has been fixed, so there is no real reason for this bill. There are actually two issues here, both of them to do with the imbalance in the numbers of male and female teachers. The first question is to decide whether or not the imbalance is actually a problem; if it is lem, then the second question is how to fix it. Some people have raised the interesting side issue of whether it would be anti affirmative action to oppose this bill. I will deal with affirmative action first and then get back to the more substantive issues. The question is sometimes put: why is it okay to have affirmative action to get women into jobs or areas where they are underrepresented but not okay to apply these principles in this case? The answer lies in why the underrepresentation exists-that is, why are men underrepresented in the teaching profession, particularly in primary teaching? HREOC makes the point that special measures are required to redress the effects of historical discrimination and/or the generally disadvantaged position of a particular gender. The commission found in this case that men had not experienced discrimination in their choices about entering or not entering the teaching profession and were not directly disadvantaged; rather, they chose not to enter the profession, for whatever reason. The point to stress is that men are choosing not to enter teaching. There is nothing stopping them from entering the profession if they choose to do so. There is no historical discrimination and there is no general disadvantage. Affirmative action is not required here. Going back to one of the main points, why com- are men not entering the profession? The reasons put forward include that teaching is not very well paid or respected, and that men are often put off by societal issues around child protection. It is interesting to note that, despite the low numbers of men in primary schools, men are overrepresented in the senior positions in these schools. The men that are in primary schools usually occupy the senior positions. How many primary schools do we know in our electorates where the a probonly man in the place is the principal? In determining the Sydney CEO's application for exemption from the SDA to allow it to offer scholarships to male students, the commission set about an inquiry. The commission made four findings of fact. The first was that there are more women than men primary school teachers in Australia. The second was that the reasons for the gender imbalance are varied, but include the status of teachers in the community, child protection issues, and the pay and conditions of primary school teachers relative to other occupations. The third was that there was insufficient evidence that the proposed scholarships would address the problem. The fourth was that there was insufficient evidence that the gender imbalance was adversely affecting children. There is no argument that there are fewer men than women in primary schools. Australian Bureau of Statistics schools data indicate that in the last 10 years the proportion of male primary school teachers declined from 25.6 per cent in 1993 to 20.9 per cent in 2003. In government schools the proportion of male primary teachers fell from 26.7 per cent in 1993 to 21.1 per cent in 2001, a decline of 5.6 per cent. The decline of male primary school teachers in non-government schools was only 1.7 per cent. Within the non-government school sector there is a significant variation in the proportion of male primary school teachers, with Catholic schools having the lowest proportion overall and independent schools the highest proportion. This phenomenon is not exclusive to Australia. In 2001, in all OECD countries for which data were available, primary school teachers were predominantly female-64 per cent or more. The other issue that is not the subject of contention is that boys are facing problems within the schooling system. The situation in Australia at the moment is that boys, particularly in adolescence, are not doing as well education, particularly in basic literacy, as they were 35 years ago. Boys are represented more than two to one in the bottom 25 per cent of performance at school. Boys are falling behind girls by some three to four percentage points in operational literacy right throughout the assessed cognitive curriculum from early primary to late secondary school. Boys represent 80 per cent of all schoolchildren in school disciplinary programs and close to 100 per cent of those expelled from school. Boys are more likely to be involved in drug related incidents and in assault and they are three times more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident and five times more likely to take their own lives. Clearly boys need help. I am convinced that boys-and indeed girls-need both male and female role models. But that is not the same thing as saying that more male teachers will fix all the probsion lems our boys are facing. Two studies undertaken by the British Office for Standards in Education were concerned with schools where the gap between the attainment of boys and girls is less than the average. The reports identified characteristics of these schools that were to do with teaching style and school culture. There was no mention of gender factors. The characteristics identified included a ‘non-macho' culture of learning where pupils benefit from a strong sense of community; where pupils feel valued by an ethos that celebrates achievement; where teachers provide prompt and detailed feedback in marking pupils' work; where pupils are set short-term tasks that can be tackled in clear stages; and where teaching is undertaken enthusiastically with a good use of humour. The office concluded from these reports that boys do well where the traditional three Rs are complemented by a fourth ‘R': respect. Last year the Australian Council for Eduin cational Research made a submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's inquiry into a previous incarnation of this bill. The submission addressed the two issues I identified earlier-why the imbalance exists and whether it actually matters. The ACER noted that, whilst there are plenty of anecdotal reasons and myths as to why the gender imbalance exists in the teaching profession, there is a pressing need to know more about the attitudes of senior secondary students towards, and perceptions about, teaching as a career-particularly those of male students. The ACER also noted that the evidence available indicates that a student's general academic achievements are influenced by that student's background and intake characteristics; however, all this pales into insignificance compared with the classteacher effects, regardless of teacher gender. Another organisation to make a submisto the Senate inquiry was the Victorian Institute of Teaching. The VIT expressed deep concern about the proposal to offer scholarships-or, to use their words, ‘inequitable opportunities'-for trainee teachers. The VIT makes the point that for years teaching has been one profession where men and women are on an equal footing, at least in terms of entering the profession. This bill then would be a backward step and is not the best way of encouraging high-calibre students into teaching. A third organisation to make a submission to the Senate inquiry was the Australian lege of Educators. In their submission, the ACE said that having additional male teachers was not a key factor in achieving excellent outcomes for male or female studentsjust part of the mix. The ACE listed the indithink cators of successful schools. These indicators included strong and effective leaders, learning as a central purpose, good curriculum knowledge and other factors. None was to do with the gender of the teacher. The ACE noted that getting more men into teaching is important but that there is no short-term lution and that the long-term solution has more to do with promoting the profession holistically. The ACE added that, in pursuing a social objective to have more males working as teachers in schools, full recognition needs to be given to the achievements of female teachers who have served the teaching profession for years when, for many reasons, males have chosen not to do so. This bill will not address the social of getting more men into teaching. We need to find out why men are not attracted to teaching as a career and to address these sues. Anecdotally, we think these reasons include pay and career opportunities. In March this year the Australian reported that there were only 10 applications for the 12 male-only scholarships on offer by the Sydney CEO and that only six were taken up. To my mind, this is clear evidence that there are many more complex reasons as to why men are not going into teaching. The article quotes a male student who said that teaching is seen as a female job. He had had only one male teacher in his primary school years. This student also made the point that many men think that the salary for teaching is not enough to support a family. A female student interviewed for the article said that, in her opinion, girls are not as interested in pay as in job satisfaction and that that distinCol- guishes them from their male colleagues. In summary, this bill glosses over the real issues. It does not do anything to find out why men are not getting into teaching; it does not address some of the factors that we are acting as blocks. The bill takes the Sex Discrimination Act backwards.",34
16,Ms LIVERMORE,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,"I would normally start out by saying that I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate on the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Professo- sion) Bill 2004 but today I am more bemused than anything else. I cannot believe that the government is persisting in this debate and pressing ahead with this bill, when the premise for this bill-which was always pretty shaky, in our opinion-has now been completely stripped away. The issue with the Catholic Education Office has been satisfactorily resolved. The latest development with that issue, as my colleague the honourable issue member for Isaacs, Ms Corcoran, has just pointed out, was the report in the Australian on 15 March, the last time this bill was on is- the Notice Paper, which shows that, of the 12 male scholarships being offered by the Sydney Catholic Education Office, only six have been filled. So the argument that we have to pass this bill so that we can have all these male-only teaching scholarships has been shot down in flames. In contrast, I think of the Indigenous education bill that was debated last year. I spoke on that bill a second time at the end of last year, after the election. It was one of the bills that had been debated but had not passed into law before the dissolving of parliament in August. In that debate I remarked that I had no problem with making a second speech on Indigenous education so soon after having debated the exact same bill just a few months earlier. I thought in that case that most members would have agreed that it was a very constructive use of the parliament's time. It was an extra opportunity to raise an important issue and one that demands a great deal more attention and commitment from government than it currently enjoys. This bill comes before the parliament in similar circumstances, having been debated once before in the lead-up to the 2004 election but, unlike the Indigenous education bill, I cannot say that it is a good use of the parliament's time to debate it yet again. I am sure that all members on this side of the House who have participated in the debate have already made this point. This bill was an obvious stunt on the part of the Minister for Education, Science and Training before the election and nothing has changed. It is still a political stunt. It is a stunt because measure in the bill is not necessary since the resolution of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission case involving the Sydney Catholic Education Office. And it is a stunt because it does not address the real underlying issues and barriers that have made teaching an increasingly unattractive career choice for men over the years. As I pointed out, this was highlighted most effectively in the case of the Sydney CEO scholarships. Those scholarships have been offered but have not been taken up by the full complement of male teaching students. The government's charge against the Labor Party, and presumably against all of us who are speaking in this debate, has always been to accuse us of ignoring the needs of male students and not caring about boys' education. Just to make it clear-as I am sure all my colleagues have done before me-of course I am aware of all the evidence showing the underachievement of boys in many aspects of education and the gap that is opening up between boys' experiences in our schools and those of their female classmates. I accept the need and the responsibility for governments and education providers to act on that evidence and find effective and appropriate ways to make schools and educational programs responsive to boys and capable of bringing out the very best in them. But I do not accept the government's lazy and superficial response which pretends that a handful of male-only teaching scholarships is the answer to all the very real and multidimensional challenges facing boys in our education system today. And I do not accept the government's attempt to portray this bill as being about more male teachers and boys' education. This bill contains nothing like the comprehensive and multi-faceted policies, backed up with a serious financial commitment, that are needed to attract the highest the quality graduates-both male and femaleinto teaching and to provide those teachers with the support and encouragement they need to stay in the profession. Instead, this bill seeks to amend the Sex Discrimination Act by undermining the very principles it is based on without demonstrating why that is necessary or that the change will make any meaningful difference to educational outcomes. So I say to the minister for education, ‘Do not expect the Labor Party to take you seriously when all you can offer on this important policy question is to take a cheap shot at the Sex Discrimination Act.' This bill was a stunt when it was first debated, and it is still a stunt. The genesis of this bill is a classic example of how this government operates and how quickly it can act when it spots a political opportunity, as compared to a substantive public policy challenge. The bill, when it was first introduced to the House last year, sought to overcome the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's decision to reject an application by the Catholic Education Office in Sydney for an exemption under the Sex Discrimination Act to allow it to offer 12 maleonly scholarships to students undertaking primary teaching. The government wasted no time drafting and introducing this bill, which deflects attention away from the government's neglect of these issues by attacking the anti-discrimination system in this country. The education minister was even quicker to get out there and make as much noise as possible in the hope that a few headlines relating to 12 teaching scholarships would be sufficient for the government to look as though it was doing something about boys' education and attracting men into a career in teaching. Maybe it would relieve the minister of responsibility for developing solutions to the real barriers to getting more men into teaching that have been talked about for years and that were explored in some detail in the Boys: Getting it right report. The speed with which the minister and the government jumped onto this issue makes you wonder what they have been doing while other crucial parts of our education and training system have been falling apart. If only the minister for education had been half as quick to identify the skills shortage as a problem and actually do something about it. Or maybe he could get started on issues like the 40 per cent of trainees and apprentices who do not complete their qualifications and the fall for the first time in the number of applicants to universities. To understand why the ALP is so sceptical of the merits of this bill you just have to at where it came from and the timing of the bill. As I said, it was introduced to parliament early last year at around the same time that the Catholic Education Office in Sydney was advised by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that its application for an exemption under the Sex Discrimination Act had been refused. Interestingly, it was also around the same time that the then Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, took the opportunity in a speech at the National Press Club to highlight the problems facing boys and young men in our society and particularly in our schools. All of a sudden, the government found itself being called to account for its inaction in an area it liked to claim as its own. But, instead of engaging with the opposition in a meaningful and constructive debate about the reasons for boys' comparative underperformance in education and what can be done to better meet their needs, the government immediately grabbed the HREOC decision and with this bill tried to turn the debate into one about the Sex Discrimination Act rather than the government's failure to address the real issues. That is the background to this bill, and that is why we are so sceptical about its merits and the government's motivations. As speaker after speaker has said in this debate, the Labor Party quite rightly regards this bill as a political stunt. For the purposes of this debate, let us give the government some credit and pretend that there are no politics behind this bill. Let us have an objective analysis of the bill. What does it seek to do? Will it achieve that purpose? What are the implications of the bill? First of all, the bill seeks to amend the Sex Discrimination Act to provide a permanent exemption for the provision of genderspecific scholarships that can be offered to students in a teaching course. These scholarships must be designed to address gender look imbalance in teaching, in particular the shortage of males in preschool and primary teaching, to improve educational outcomes for boys and to provide both girls and boys with suitable male role models. As with any bill, it is fair to ask whether the initiative proposed will achieve what it sets out to do. Will providing male-only scholarships lead to significant numbers of additional male teachers in our classrooms? Of course, the answer to that question is no. That was the message that came out loud and clear in the evidence put to HREOC in the Sydney CEO case and in submissions to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's inquiry into this bill and to the House of Representatives inquiry into boys' education. Whether you read the HREOC decision, the Senate report or Boys: Getting it right, is clear that men are choosing not to enter the teaching profession for a number of reasons, none of which have anything to do with any real or perceived discrimination within the profession and none of which call for the provision of male-only scholarships as a solution. Time and time again submissions to HREOC and the parliamentary inquiries made the point that men have other choices open to them and turn away from teaching for a number of reasons including the status of teachers in the community, child protection issues and the pay and conditions of teachers relative to other careers. Nowhere in the speeches I have heard from the minister or other speakers in this debate has it been explained just how the male-only scholarships and the undermining of the Sex Discrimination Act address any of those factors that deter men from a career in teaching. Where scholarships have been offered they have clearly not been enough on their own to overcome those other factors. Again, I point to the article in the Australian on 15 March showing that the 12 scholarships offered by the Catholic Education Office did not attract sufficient applicants to fill even those scholarships. On the bill's stated aim to increase the number of male teachers: there is no evidence that amending the SDA to allow for male-only scholarships will lead to more male teachers. Of course, the whole point of this exercise is supposed to be about the educational outcomes for students, particularly for boys, and the explanatory memorandum to the bill presumes that more male teachers equals better educational outcomes for boys. Let us see whether this bill is going to achieve those better educational outcomes. Again, this is not supported in the evidence presented to the various inquiries into this it matter. The overwhelming response from participants in those inquiries was that it is the quality of the teacher that counts rather than the gender of the teacher. The submission to the Senate inquiry from the Australian Council for Educational Research stated: ... the quality of teaching and learning provision are by far the most salient influences on students' cognitive, affective and behavioural outcomes of schooling-not teacher gender. Dr Ken Rowe from ACER backed that up in his evidence before the inquiry when he said: ... it does not matter a hoot whether or not the teacher is male or female; it depends on the quality of the teaching and learning provision in the classroom. ... providing teacher training scholarships for persons of one gender is missing the whole point. We want high-quality people regardless of their gender. That was the approach adopted by the House of Representatives committee when it recommended in Boys: Getting it right that the Commonwealth government provide a substantial number of HECS-free merit based scholarships for equal numbers of males and females to undertake teacher training. In its response to the inquiry's report the government rejected that recommendation on the basis that it did not believe that a scholarship mechanism would be likely to make an impact on the gender imbalance in schools. The Catholic Education Office, on the other hand, have picked up that idea and were granted an exemption by HREOC to offer a total of 24 scholarships, 12 male and 12 female, to students taking up a teaching course in 2005. The CEO are to be congratulated for their approach to this matter, because it is obvious that for them it is all about attracting quality teachers. Sure they want more male teachers, but they have acknowledged that it is quality not simple gender balance that counts. Unable to fill the 12 scholarships available to male teaching students this year, the CEO were adamant that there was no question of lowering standards just to fill the quota of places. So the measures in the bill will not increase the number of male teachers, and there is no evidence that the ratio of male teachers in our schools is a factor affecting the educational outcomes of male students. This is sounding very much like the reasons that HREOC gave for rejecting the application from the Catholic Education Office in the first place-they could not demonstrate that the scholarships were necessary or that they would be effective. In seeking to override the commission's decision through this legislation the government has offered no new or compelling evidence to convince us on any of those points. This is all about political posturing. I said that an objective analysis of the bill would also consider the implications of allowing it to pass. We on the Labor side believe that it would have the effect of weakening the Sex Discrimination Act by allowing for discrimination on the basis of gender in circumstances which are not acceptable under the existing permanent exemptions for special measures in the act. The bill allows for positive discrimination in favour of men in circumstances where there is no evidence of entrenched discrimination against men in the teaching profession. This was also a major factor in the commission's decision in the Sydney CEO case. HREOC were not prepared to waive the provisions of the SDA when it is clear that men are not deterred from teaching as a career because of any discrimination against them, either in entering teaching courses or in obtaining teaching positions or promotions. In fact, the experience of men in the teaching profession is just the opposite. Although there are fewer male teachers than female teachers across the profession, there are many more men occupying senior leadership positions in schools and education departments. The lack of men in teaching is not the result of discrimination but a choice men make because they do not see it as an attractive career option, for the reasons I have outlined. Amending the Sex Discrimination Act to allow for discrimination in favour of men does nothing to address those issues and undermines the whole purpose of the act, which is to protect against real and entrenched discrimination. For these reasons, the bill does not deserve our support and will not receive our support. The bill is unnecessary and will not achieve the objective of getting more men into teaching. The government is always pointing the finger at the ALP and saying, ‘You vote against these things, but what would you do?' In the lead-up to last year's election we made it very clear what we would do. In contrast to the government, whose response to this serious issue of the lack of male teachers and role models in our schools is to pull this stunt amending the Sex Discrimination Act, Labor developed a five-point plan for getting more male teachers into the profession. It is a plan that is based on the issues raised in the House of Representatives and Senate inquiries into this bill. It is a real and comprehenBass sive policy aimed at addressing those issues. We would start with a national campaign aimed at attracting quality entrants to teaching, targeting men with relevant skills and backgrounds. We would encourage more male mentors to work with schools and parents, including involving fathers in reading to students, using technology, vocational education, music, drama and sporting activities. We would provide incentives for quality teaching, including for teachers who have the skills needed to improve the learning outcomes of boys. We would target improvements in teaching skills for males through the Commonwealth professional development program and in the development of national teaching standards. We would also develop student discipline and welfare programs, many of which would be targeted at boys. Very importantly, we would give schools the resources that they need to provide quality education for all their studentsboys and girls. I think our whole approach to this has demonstrated that the Labor Party are much more serious about this issue than the government. As I said at the outset, I am bemused that the government is persisting with this bill when it has been so clearly demonstrated that it will achieve nothing effective in increasing the number of male teachers and does nothing more than posture on the Sex Discrimination Act, undermining the very important anti-discrimination legislation in this country. For all those reasons, Labor will be opposing this bill and we call on the government to get serious about this issue rather than just play politics.",37
17,Mr RUDDOCK,SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT,"in reply-I thank the members for Jagajaga, Denison, Brisbane, Cunningham, Lingiari, Gorton, Isaacs, Capricornia, Fisher, Bowman, Macquarie and for their contributions to this debate. The government has obviously committed to providing high-quality education for children throughout Australia. We believe that both male and female teachers play an important role in providing high-quality education to boys and girls. The Sex Discrimination Amendment (Teaching Profession) Bill 2004 is a sensible strategy to assist in addressing the imbalance in the number of men and women in the profession, in the interests of providing children with both male and female role models in schools. The bill facilitates that by permitting scholarships for that purpose for persons of a particular gender in respect of participation in a teaching course. If the parliament passes the bill, the government will be leading by example and will commit $1 million in providing teacher scholarships for male students in first-year primary teacher education. The bill is just one of a number of government strategies to either support male teachers or address particular educational needs of boys in schools. It is not a measure that should be seen in isolation. Having heard the debate, I would have to say that the hypocrisy of my colleagues opposite is quite breathtaking. Here is a party whose most recent former leader claimed to be a champion of the cause of providing more male role models to young boys, yet, when it comes to supporting a practical amendment to achieve that, the Labor Party is opposed to it. Here is a party that thinks it is a good idea to put a quota on the number of women who might enter the parliament, yet, when it comes to putting more male teachers into primary school classrooms, it is somehow affronted by that. The picture becomes even murkier when we consider the number of other exemptions that have been granted without so much as a whimper by the opposition. An exemption was allowed, for instance, for the Tasmanian Metro bus service to advertise for femaleonly bus drivers. Several universities have sought to offer women-only courses and academic positions, and the South Australian Trades and Labour Council has offered women-only work experience programs. Given the opposition that we are hearing on the grounds of discrimination, you would think we would have heard protest on those matters, but the silence is clearly deafening in relation to such issues when they are raised. The hypocrisy of this position is even more stark when we consider the actions of the Labor government in Western Australia. In Western Australia, a range of teaching scholarships have been offered to people completing the final year of their degree at a Western Australian university. Male teachers were identified as one of six areas of need for the 2004 year in Western Australia. Accordingly, 37 scholarships were offered specifically to males who agreed to go into primary school teaching, despite the Western Australian government having no exemption for scholarships, I might say, from the Sex Discrimination Act. It is unclear whether an exemption from their own Equal Opportunity Act was ultimately sought, but the Western Australian scholarship information guide specifically sought applications from people who would qualify as, among other things, mathematics teachers, physical education teaches, science teachers and male primary teachers. I understand the scholarships have since been withdrawn. They would not want comparisons to be made when opposition was being mounted here. I think you can see that Labor, at both eral and state levels, has lost sight of portance of this issue for children. When you see the response to this matter, any suggestion that politics is being played on this side of the House speaks for itself. A number of members asked for evidence that the bill would work-the members for Denison, Jagajaga, Cunningham and Capricornia made this request. A number of educational authorities are pursuing strategies for encouraging men into teaching and consider offering scholarships an important category. The New South Wales Catholic Education Office clearly thought that offering scholarships to males was a useful and relevant strategy, which is why it initially went to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to seek an exemption. Similarly, in its submission to the Senate committee inquiry on this bill, the Association of Independent Schools in Victoria indicated that a number of its schools thought offering scholarships was a useful option to get more men into teaching. The Association of Independent Schools of South Australia also indicated that an amendment could assist in increasing the number of male teachers. The Western Australian government, as I have said, has already made such offers, although belatedly withdrawing them when under political pressure. So these are the very educational authorities grappling with this issue every day, who believe that this would be a practical measure. The government wants to give them that option. It has been argued by some that this measure would not be useful. I think that came from the members for Cunningham, Lingiari and Capricornia. The fact is that this bill will not alone solve the shortfall. We have not asserted that. Of course it is correct, but that is no reason to stand against this useful and sensible measure to address the probfed- lem. The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 is the imwithin our jurisdiction, and it has been shown to be a barrier to male scholarships. It is an area in which the parliament can now act. The bill and the government's commitment of $1 million for scholarships to encourage men into teaching complement the other major strategies for addressing the ticular challenge of increasing educational outcomes for boys. Boys education is a priority area for the $159.2 million Australian Government Quality Teacher Program. It includes the provision of $27 million over six years to the year 2008 for boys education. It has been argued that there was no discrimination against men entering the teaching profession and therefore amending the act to address the issue was not appropriate. This view was put by the members for Jagajaga, Gorton, Isaacs and Capricornia. The government do not contend that there is discrimination against men seeking to enter the teaching profession. Our position is simply that there is a serious shortage of males in teaching, especially primary teaching, and that offering scholarships to males is a reletion. vant and sensible policy response among other measures. We need to put the needs of Australia's children first and to encourage a better balance of males and females in the teaching profession to get more males into schools. I note that people have been commenting on these issues. I went recently to a very small school at Brooklyn in my electorate. It is an exceptional school, because it has a number of male teachers. The importance of male role models was acknowledged by the principal and the parent groups that I met with. Obviously, in a school which has a very large proportion of boys amongst its number, boys were benefiting substantially from the wider representation. The member for Brisbane claimed that the measure puts gender ahead of merit. This measure is all about achieving the best quality educational outcomes for male and female school students by bringing the best quality male teachers into the profession, which is not attracting sufficient quality male applicants at this time. The measure is about parencouraging the best quality male applicants side by side with the best female quality applicants. By emphasising the importance of the teaching profession, I think the government will help to attract better candidates overall. There were issues raised about this bill not addressing the real reason men are not entering the teaching profession-namely, the status of the profession. The same members, I think with the addition of the member for Brisbane, were raising that issue. This bill underlines the government's esteem for the teaching profession and, with other measures, its commitment to encouraging more men into teaching. The government has never suggested the bill is a complete solution but it is an important part of the soluIt complements other measures such as the Boys Education Lighthouse Schools initiative and the Success for Boys initiative. Other issues were raised in relation to salaries by the members for Lingiari and Gorton. The government does not employ teachers. It does not determine their remuneration, but it is important that teachers are appropriately rewarded for quality teaching. The Minister for Education, Science and Training was asked about teacher remuneration on 11 March. He said: ... the most important thing that our society needs to do is raise the respect that we have for teaching as a profession and to support that with serious resources for their ongoing training and professional development. He added: I think by any standard most Australians would certainly agree that teachers deserve more pay, a higher level of pay, but I think equally they would expect that professionalism and quality is rewarded. The Prime Minister said that he completely agreed the teaching profession should be a more respected and more rewarded profession. This bill is an important step, as I say, amongst another initiatives to help underline the importance of the teaching profession. It has been suggested that this is an attack on the Sex Discrimination Act. I would like to say that legislative exemptions are not made lightly. In fact, since 1996 the government has added no new exemptions to the Sex Discrimination Act. This is a specific and targeted exemption in gender-neutral terms. It is based on common sense to address an identified problem. For the member for Brisbane, I will comment on the exemption mechanism. He suggested that the exemption mechanism is available where scholarships for males are proposed. The Catholic Education Office case, including the ultimate resolution of the case, showed that the exemption mechanism of section 44 of the act is not a viable alternative if we want to give educational authorities the flexibility they need to address this particular question. It took the Catholic Education Office 18 months to obtain an exemption, which in the end was not the exemption that it had first sought. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission administers the exemption mechanism and has indicated its opposition to male-only scholarships, unless framed in accordance with its preferred approach-that is, that it is coupled with the scholarships females. The government want flexibility in this area and, in our view, it is ridiculous if every single authority that wants to offer male scholarships has to go through the lengthy process with HREOC that we saw in the case that brought this matter to light. Educational authorities need an option which, in our view, enables them to act now. It has been suggested by the members for Denison, Brisbane, Cunningham, Lingiari, Gorton, Isaacs and Capricornia that the bill is no longer necessary. They must have all been reading from the same script. I would like to address this argument by simply acknowledging that the exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act granted to the Catholic Education Office in no way renders this bill redundant. The bill is not directed to the specific case involving the Catholic Education Office but is framed generally to facilitate measures to address the shortage of male teachers Australia-wide. We want educational authorities to be able to act as they see appropriate, and we think this amendment will give them that capacity. The members for Capricornia, Cunningham, Lingiari, Gorton and Isaacs argued that the lower than expected take-up rate of scholarships offered by the Sydney Catholic Education Office demonstrates that the government's proposed measure will not work. The lower than expected take-up of scholarships underlines the challenge of attracting more men into primary teaching. It is not evidence that scholarships cannot play an important part in encouraging interest in teaching. The Department of Education, Science and Training is developing advice for the minister on possible complementary measures such as mentoring and awarenessraising activities that might further encourage young men interested in undertaking primary teaching and enhance the impact of for the scholarships on those taking them up. The member for Brisbane argues that the better course of action would have been to offer HECS-free scholarships for teaching. The government has rejected the proposed HECS-free scholarship mechanism because evidence suggests that HECS is not a major determinant in student choices. However, the government is sympathetic to the reasoning that more male teachers are needed because of the importance of providing good role models, and this bill is an important part of that strategy. In conclusion, the shortage of male teachers in schools is a problem that all sides of the parliament recognise. As my colleague the Minister for Education, Science and Training has pointed out: It will do this country no good if we spend the next decade hand-wringing and clinging to misplaced but well-intentioned ideological purity if we produce a generation of young men who are disengaged, who are disillusioned and who feel ill-prepared for the future. The proportion of primary teachers who are male has fallen to 20.9 per cent and only 18.8 per cent of students training to become primary teachers are men. The government are not content to ignore the problem. We think the education of our children is far too important to be put on the backburner. This bill is just one of a number of strategies that the government are pursuing to address that very problem. It is a very important part of the solution, and for that reason I commend the bill to the House. Question put: That the bill be now read a second time. The House divided.

19,Ms MACKLIN,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Jagajaga) (11.14 am)Labor will oppose the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 and defend the ability of students to protect their own interests. This bill will have two significant impacts. From 1 January next year, any higher education providerprimarily universities-who is receiving Commonwealth support under the Higher Education Support Act will be prevented from making membership of student organisations a condition of enrolment. Frankly, this is basically redundant. Students already have the option of opting out of membership of student organisations, and the fact that virtually none of them avail themselves of this option shows the complete lack of a groundswell among students for this bill. Secondly, the bill prevents higher education providers from making a condition of enrolment payment of any fee ‘for the provision to students of an amenity, facility or service that is not of an academic nature'. So providers cannot make payment of fees for those purposes a condition of enrolment. Enforcement of these policies would become a condition of receiving a grant, with two tiers of penalty available to the Commonwealth. The bill inserts a provision which allows the minister to reduce Commonwealth funding for higher education institutions by $100 per federally funded student place if the above conditions are breached. As the conditions above are to be inserted in subdivision 19D, the fairness requirements, failure to comply could invoke section 19-65 jeopardising a provider's status under the act. If the minister chose to invoke section 19-65, over $5 billion in Commonwealth funding to universities could be lost if they were to ignore these conditions and continue with their current arrangements requiring students to pay a fee to student organisations. Talk about heavy-handed! A very heavy handed method is being imposed on universities by this government. The government is not about to increase universities' funding commensurate to the loss of revenue that universities and student organisations will face if this bill goes through. It is typical of this government's track record: micromanaging, intervening in universities' daily affairs and placing more conditions on declining government support. This is funding extortion on a massive scale. At present every university in the country is free to independently determine whether or not students are to become members of their student organisation as part of the enrolment process and what contribution they will make to these organisations. It is no coincidence that each and every university recognises the benefits of the current arrangements. The current policy on membership of student organisations is good, sensible, practical policy, which is why every university in the country has implemented it. Of course, some students will object to various positions being taken on various issues by their student organisations. Even the Liberal Party would have to agree that unanimity in any democratic organisation is hard to come by. Witness the leadership debate going on in the Liberal party at the moment. However, opposition by a minority over a particular issue is not an argument in favour of this bill. First and foremost, the bill before us will destroy vital campus services that support university students. Health services, child care, sport and legal support services are all hanging in the balance. I just want to talk briefly about the child-care centre at my local university, La Trobe University. It delivers an outstanding service to students who are parents. The La Trobe Students Representative Council has organised a subsidy for students whose children are at this child-care centre. If you are in that increasing band of people who go back to university to reskill and better themselves through education, then my local student organisation will help you do that. They will make sure that you can afford the child care that you need. This child-care centre provides not only subsidised child-care places but also many very flexible arrangements that parents would be very hard-pressed to find at other child-care centres in the area. Without this valuable service-and it will go if this legislation through the parliament-many parents who are students simply will not be able to afford child care and will not be able to afford to stay at university. Around 250 families use this particular child-care centre. So those families will either have to pay through the nose for child care or no longer continue their university studies. There is no doubt that student organisations help keep students at university by offering the necessary subsidies and services that cash-strapped universities just cannot offer. Single parents may suffer the most from the bill before us. They absolutely rely on campus child care to allow them to improve their skills and they would not be able to study without their subsidised support. It certainly makes the justification of the Minister for Education, Science and Training for this bill absurd. He said in parliament on 16 March: ... why is a single mother who is training to be a nurse paying for the canoeing club or the mountaineers? Minister, the single mother is probably only able to complete her training as a nurse thanks to her student organisation's childcare subsidy of 41 per cent. That is the level of the subsidy that is being provided for child care at this university. In fact, her biggest barriers at the moment are not child care; they are much more likely to be the massive HECS debt that she will be hit with when she graduates or the FEE-HELP loan that she will be paying off into her old age because of this government's lack of funding of affordable HECS places. That is certainly leaving students with massive levels of debt. Unfortunately, we have an education minister who just wants to trivialise this issue. He went on the warpath when he introduced this legislation in the parliament to destroy student organisations because-and I am sure all the students around the country have gets heard him say this-their sausage rolls are too expensive and the catering staff did not smile at the minister who was threatening their livelihoods. This minister loves to trivialise critical issues like investment in Australia's education and training by resorting to these hokey anecdotes that sometimes really stretch the truth. At least one vice-chancellor, though-and I suspect he is joined by many others-has seen through the minister's efforts to take attention away from the real obstinacy at the core of this bill. Professor Gavin Brown wrote about Brendan Nelson in ‘Orbiter Dicta', his column in Sydney University's ‘Uninews', on 24 March this year, and he said: He alleges that one can achieve a 30 cent discount and a free bonus smile by shopping around. Perhaps one of the campus food outlets had a bad hair day when his government inspectors visited-or perhaps he made the story up. This was from a vice-chancellor who has probably seen his fair share of student protest against his actions. But this government chooses to ignore the valuable contribution that student organisations make in so many ways. One of those very important ways is the sporting organisations, making vibrant campus life, creating the opportunities for the promotion of health and fitness in the general community, not just for university students, and training generations of Olympians and elite sportspeople. Many prominent Australians were so alarmed at the introduction of this bill that they took out an advertisement in major papers around the country condemning the government's move to destroy university sport. It is this group that has warned the Howard government that attacks on student organisations will be catastrophic for university sport, as well as for the academic and social life on our university campuses. The government thinks it knows better than people like Shane Gould, John Coates, Kevin Gosper, Stuart MACGill, Geoff Lawson, Phil Kearns, Liz Ellis, Phil Waugh and Ric Charlesworth. All of these great Australian sportspeople know what will happen on our university campuses, and they are the ones who are speaking out against this government's legislation because they want to protect the great contribution that sporting organisations, subsidised by student fees, provide on our university campuses. We know that we will lose not only valuable participation in sport and fitness activities that student organisations promote but also the sporting figures that do all Australians proud when they represent Australia around the world. But it is not only sport and it is not only child care; there are so many other services provided by student organisations. Another one is the advocacy services. The government completely ignores the help that individual students get from their student organisations. Students at a particular university were recently examined on material that had not been taught in their course. Individual students had not had any luck getting their marks changed, so they went to the student organisation for help. The student association advocated on their behalf, and the university, after six months of discussion, eventually recognised that mistakes had been made in this particular course and changed the arrangements. This kind of persistent work, practical advocacy by student organisations for individual students and groups of students, happens every day in our universities. The organisations of students go into bat for these students because the student fees allow it and pay them to do so. That is one of the critical advocacy roles that will go if this bill becomes law, because it will not be a profit for anybody else to do it. It is a service that automatic membership ensures at the moment. Unfortunately, it is under dire threat. What is more, if the student organisation does not provide that service, the only other avenue left to students would be to resort to expensive legal representation, which of course the vast majority of students just could not afford. Another example of the willingness of the Minister for Education, Science and Training to say and do anything to get publicity on this issue was when he glibly told Kerry O'Brien on the 7.30 Report: Well, the experience in Western Australia, where voluntary student unionism like this was introduced in 1994, was that these services not only survived, in many cases they actually flourished. What an extraordinary statement! The Western Australian experience shows that the minister is certainly not averse to using what can only be described as Orwellian language, which we have come to expect especially from him. Student representation and services were decimated under this type of legislation in Western Australia, and student services were lost. Let us look at the facts. The legislation damaged services at all Western Australian universities. Edith Cowan University Guild went into liquidation and closed all of its services. Murdoch University Guild was in such a bad financial position that its auditors could not sign off on its accounts and it survived on loans from the university. At Curtin they survived, but only after shedding most representation, welfare and social services. Flourishing, I don't think! This bill is clearly payback to students for daring to criticise the Howard government's massive HECS hikes and its attacks on university students and their families. Students, of course, have just been standing up for themselves and for the students who will come in the future. This government does not like the fact that student organisations regularly and effectively remind the Australian public that, even before the 25 per cent fee hike hit students, HECS fees have nearly doubled since this government was elected in 1996. Since the 25 per cent fee hike was allowed by this government, nearly 30 universities have put up their fees-most of them by the full 25 per cent. The government does not like the fact that student organisations remind the public that it is this government which allows Australians with lower marks to jump the queue and buy a place at university by paying $100,000 or more. A medical degree at Melbourne University today can cost $210,000, despite critical shortages of doctors across Australia. It is this government that has seen the national HECS debt rise to $11 billion. Our graduates are carrying $11 billion in HECS debt. We know also that this government is going to see an explosion in FEE-HELP loans when this new area of student debt blows out to $3 billion by 2008-09. So this government does not like it much when student organisations remind the public that, according to one study, Australia now has the fourth highest fee structure in the world. And what does this government want to do? It wants to shut down any dissent about these issues on our university campuses. Of course, we know that attacking student organisations has assumed the status of a holy crusade for a band of zealots on the other side. I think we are up to the seventh crusade against the humble student organisation. The members opposite have tried every single avenue they could to satisfy their desire for retribution against their enemies in student politics in the 1970s. They have tried very unsuccessfully to hold referenda on university campuses on the payment of fees. They failed in that democratic approach. Next they tried the courts. They were rebuffed in the courts. In 2002 they even went to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission with a challenge to the existing membership arrangements at James Cook University. Once again, the outcome was a setback for those who seek to undermine student organisations. So the only option left is to try yet again for legislative intervention into our universities. So the Australian Liberal Students Federation-always a minority on campuses-has been campaigning to win the support of Liberal parliamentarians to impose their will on students. They cannot win elections on campus, so they come here to the parliament. So here we are again, as we were in 1999 and again last year just before the election when former Minister David Kemp and the current minister moved unsuccessfully to legislate against student organisations. We are back here again, with Liberal students, past and present, attempting to impose their will on students in universities via this parliament. I have to say the minister is showing he is more than up to the task of playing student politics with this blatantly ideological attack on student organisations. This is even more accurate than it might sound article in the Australian reported that the President of the Australian Liberal Students Federation ‘helped education minister Brendan Nelson draft the legislation'. What more evidence do we need that this bill is about nothing more than petty vendettas that originate in student politics? The Liberal Students Federation president went on to say-and you will like this, Mr Deputy Speaker MCMullan: “Our organisation has absolutely no sympathy for the vice-chancellors and university stration ... “These people have been shop stewards in suits for the past 90 years on this. That is the vice-chancellors of our universities! I wonder whether Brendan Nelson got his inspiration from the Liberal Students Federation's views of vice-chancellors and universities when he was drafting his extraordinarily interventionist university reforms back in 2003. I wonder whether the minister has read about some of the support that student organisations have received from fairly high places. Maybe he is not familiar with those views. One view states: “The funding and ... provision of the various student services would be impossible unless there was some requirement to pay a contribution towards them ... The fact that some people object to the way in which some public funds are spent does not mean that they are therefore exempted from paying taxes. Who was that? It was none other than Peter Costello, the federal Treasurer and former student politician, writing in Monash University's publication Lot's Wife, back in 1978. The Treasurer is not alone; he has a senior colleague who agrees with him. Here is what the current Minister for Human Services had to say about the Liberal Party's plans, when he wrote in Sydney University's student paper when he was SRC President in 1986 and when the current Prime Minister was the Leader of the Opposition. Joe at first. A recent Hockey said: “It has taken 120 years of student union membership at Sydney University to provide the facilities we all take for granted. It can all end in one foul political swoop. It will be a ‘foul' political swoop if this legislation goes through. Joe Hockey went on to say back in 1986 that current sporting facilities would be sold and ‘Sydney University Rugby Club would close down'-this is according to the government's Minister for Human Services. So I look forward to seeing adminithese two unwavering men of principle crossing the floor to fight for what they believe in. A similar comment was made on Tuesday, 10 May 2005 in the Queensland parliament by Michael Horan, the former leader of the Queensland Nationals. Mr Horan wrote to the Minister for Education, Science and Training and others in the government in the following terms: I think the Commonwealth government should put in place a way in which universities like USQthe University of Southern Queenslandcan provide within their structure a service fee which they can then use to assist the student to continue providing sporting facilities, recreational facilities, and counselling and support vices. It would seem that people from all sides of politics, particularly the government's side, can see the value of student organisations and have seen that for a very long time-all except those who are falling into line behind the current minister for education. The government have shown that they would love nothing more than to take away from the students of today the terrific opportunities that they had when they were students themselves. So many of the coalition ministers, including the current minister for education, got a free education under Labor governments. But as soon as they got into government they hiked up HECS fees, slashed billions of dollars from universities and introduced full fees of up to $210,000. Now the government wants to do the same with student clubs and societies. It seems that many of the government's ministers were very happy to take student money when it came to subsidising their sporting careers at university. Now that they are out to destroy student services I think it is only fair that they should have to pay back what they took from student organisations when they were at university. That is what they are planning to do to the students of today. They are planning to make sure that these students have to pay the full costs of sporting organisations, so it is only fair that they pay back the benefit they got from the student sporting facilities they used when they were students at their universities. Take the Treasurer, for example. He was very active in student organisations. He was a member of the Monash University AFL club. We figured out that in today's terms he would owe about $5,000. That is how much the Treasurer should have to pay back to that sporting organisation for the benefit he got guild when he was at Monash. If the Minister for Human Services crosses the floor and sticks serup for what he used to believe in he would not have to pay, but if he decides to fall in behind the minister for education and ignore what his real views are about the effect of this bill then the Minister for Human Services would also owe about $5,000 for the time when he was an active member of the Sydney University rugby club. It looks like what he said back in 1986 will be rightwith fees like that, sporting clubs will have to close down or be sold off to survive. I think the Minister for Human Services got it dead right back in 1986, and I certainly hope he will vote with us to oppose this legislation. The Minister for Health and Ageing was also an active member of Sydney University's rugby club. He would also owe over $5,000 for all the benefit he got from that. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations was a member of the athletics club at Melbourne University. There is also Senator Kemp; and the member for Wentworth also got a big benefit, again from the Sydney University rugby club. The rugby club at Sydney University has been very kind to members of this government and given them a lot of subsidised access to their facilities-subsidised access that will not be available to that rugby club if this bill goes through the parliament. All these people should either pay up or, if they have any principles left, oppose this legislation. Lastly, the positive role that student organisations have played in cultivating active citizenship must not be forgotten in this debate. That is true across the political spectrum, as we have seen by the number of people in senior positions of the governmentthe Treasurer, the Minister for Human Services, the Minister for Health and Ageing and the member for Wentworth were all active members of their student organisations and they got a lot of experience when they were in those student organisations that has assisted them to go on and play the role they do in the public life of the nation. We can see that on all sides of politics-but not only politics. Many members of the judiciary, leading figures in the arts and the media, and many public commentators have cut their teeth in student organisations. That experience will not be there for them any longer. If the ideology and arrogant excesses of this government see this bill become law, the positive influence of student organisations on society and democracy will disappear. We will be fighting this legislation, which will be terribly damaging to the services provided to students on our university campuses. We will do everything we can to convince the Senate not to be blinded by this government's ideology and the settling of some very old scores. We will do everything we can to protect student organisations from a government determined to do away with some of the most important services on our university campuses, services that provide so much of university and campus life, services that can make a difference to so many disadvantaged students and services that make sure sporting facilities are affordable. Labor will continue to fight for all of these things against what is just an ideological attack by a government determined to settle a very old score.",47
20,Ms PANOPOULOS,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I have been waiting for a long time to witness today's debate and it is indeed a privilege to be a participant and a supporter of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. Today is an historic day for all Australians who believe in freedom of association for students-voluntary student unionism. The member for Jagajaga just spoke-what a negative, whingeing, miserable member of this House she is. Mr Hardgrave-She's consistent!",53
21,Ms PANOPOULOS,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"True, she is consistent. She makes the assumption that with voluntary student unionism unions will collapse. In other words, she is saying that no student would see any benefit in giving money to join a student union. I think she is very wrong. I think student unions, just like any other association, can be responsive to their members and can determine what sorts of services and facilities their members and potential members would want and offer them. I put down all that doom and gloom to a lot of negativity and scaremongering from the member for Jagajaga. And the experience in Western Australia has proved her wrong. On several occasions there has been an attempt to get legislation through this parliament to give tertiary students, who, by and large, are adults, the right to join or not to join a student association. Unfortunately, on these previous occasions the bill has failed to pass the Senate. But I make a prediction today: this bill will have a very different fate. I have been advised that the bill will reach the Senate in August of this year, when the coalition will have a majority in the Senate. Let me remind all those members on the other side who have been listed to speak against this bill, lest the lessons of history be forgotten, that the coalition majority in the Senate is a legacy that was left to this government by their former leader Mark Latham. So today I rejoice and join with other former Liberal students around the country and around the world who have fought the battle and waited for decades for this day. It is very pleasing indeed to have in the chamber my colleague, good friend and former Liberal student ally the member for Casey, who I believe will be speaking very soon on this bill. I would also like to put on the record that I am very privileged to have been a member, an executive member and president of the longest running Liberal club in this country. I wear it as a badge of honour and I take issue with the member for Jagajaga. It seems that the president of the Australian Liberal Students Federation has really got under the member for Jagajaga's skin. He is just a poor, ordinary student engaged in public debate, putting forward his view that people of his generation at university should have the right to choose. I wonder what the member for Jagajaga has to fear from students who are exercising their democratic voice. She stated that this legislation was driven towards one view, a uniformity of view. That is not the case. Students have the right to express, and do express, all sorts views. They can express extremist views if they like-and we have seen plenty of those, paid for through student funds compulsorily acquired-but they should do it with their own money or money they have raised and not with funds compulsorily acquired from students, many of whom disagree with their arguments and their political campaigns-on which I will have something to say a little later on. We cannot mention Liberal students without mentioning their passion and dedication to the Liberal Party. These young warriors on campus have been the brunt of criticism and ridicule from people in privileged positions such as the member for Jagajaga. But I am proud to say that I was part of a group-and they still have these characteristics todaythat will not be politically blackmailed or intimidated into being politically correct. Our political process in this country would be the poorer without these people who are the true believers in the Liberal Party and who are engaged in the political process out of a conviction of upholding the very basic values and tenets of the Liberal Party such freedom of association. Freedom of association is one of the pillars the Liberal Party stands for. And it is not a freedom to be compromised. You cannot be ‘just a little' compelled to pay for some of the services that members of parliament think students should want to have. That is a choice for them to make. You either trust students to make a decision about what is in their best interests or you do not. It is as simple as that. Some on the other side of this debate are trying to obscure the issue by claiming there should be a compulsory fee for so-called services instead of a general fee that is used for some services and for political campaigns and organisations. The distinction made by the member for Jagajaga is an absolute fraud. Voluntary student representation-for want of of another name-still takes money from students. We only have to look at the example of legislation in Victoria. The misguided belief in Victoria was that this would end the practice of students' money being used to fund political campaigns and organisations with which they disagree. But the legislation failed dramatically to stop students' money from being misallocated by a few student activists. In the year ending December 2004, Monash University collected over $8½ million of compulsorily acquired fees, supposedly for essential services, and 56 per cent of this was spent on administration. At my old university, the University of Melbourne, an extraordinary 72 per cent of compulsorily acquired student money went into profits or administrative costs. These so-called profits can be and have been used to fund political campaigns and to support political organisations with which individual students often disagree. We saw under the Victorian legislation a Clayton's version of voluntary student unionism. We had the absolutely abominable act by the Monash University Student Assoas ciation, after the S11 tragedy, of using student money to produce stickers that read ‘Bomb the White House', a statement with which I vehemently disagree. Had these student activists used their own money, or money specifically raised to pay for their stickers, I would still oppose their argument. They can do what they wish with their own money but not with money they have effectively stolen from students. Across the country, in Western Australia, the Murdoch University student guild occupied the university senate building, causing $12,000 worth of damage. Is this the so-called advocacy the member for Jagajaga holds up as an example of how students should behave? Most student unions unashamedly campaigned against the Howard government at the last federal election, which may perhaps explain the passion with which the member for Jagajaga defends them. We only have to look at the Northern Territory University union, which took out a full-page advertisement in the Northern Territory News urging a vote against my good friend and colleague the member for Solomon. Whatever views one may hold about particular candidates, one thing is for sure: there is no unanimity political opinion amongst students on campus. Some vote Labor, some vote Liberal and some vote for an assortment of other parties. You cannot use student funds in such a blatant manner that can affect the result of an election. We saw another disgraceful example at the 2004 Australian National University open day. They had an effigy of the Prime Minister. It was advertised that the effigy was available for anyone to have a swing at. All this was paid for with funds compulsorily acquired for students. And let not the northern, sunny state of Queensland be left out of some of these disgraceful examples. The University of Queensland's union deserves comment because it has been one of the consistently outrageous wasters of compulsorily acquired union funds. It paid for a women-only surf camp. It employed a researcher to explore the feminist reclamation of an extremely crude word which refers to female genitalia. This so called research is now included in the 2005 union survival guide. What an absolute joke! We do not hear the member for Jagajaga or the Labor Party referring to any of these examples of so-called union services in education. This union from the University of Queensland could not even manage to keep their own union offices clean enough to pass their own workplace and safety requirements. What a joke and what a disgrace. This is the result of lack of accountability when students are forced to pay money and student unions and student union activists have very little, if any, accountability. But first prize for a bold and unprecedented theft of student money must go to my old university-to the Melbourne University Student Union, the extravagant arrogance of the union and the saga that is still unfolding in the courts. In 2001, the student union enof tered into a contract with a company called Optima. The contract purported to bind the university as guarantor for a $44 million apartment complex. Two Labor Club members-the signatory to the contract, Darren Ray, and the student union president, Scott Crawford-kept this contract a secret from the union executive. Of course, the fraud squad and the liquidators eventually moved in. The matter is now in the courts. No doubt we will be hearing from Mr Landeryou, apparently the main beneficiary of this contract, who fled to Costa Rica but who has recently returned. Who is Mr Landeryou? None other than a former Labor club president at the Melbourne University Student Union. When he was president, he so outraged students that he was the first ever student union president at the University of Melbourne to be sacked-sacked by an overwhelming majority of students. I take great pride in having been involved in that campaign, in a crossparty coalition to rid Melbourne University Student Union of Mr Landeryou and his general secretary, Keir Semmens. He was sacked amid allegations of corruption and misuse of power. Under the system of compulsory unionism, political decisions were made to cut funds to organisations that did not align with the Labor club. Bullying and intimidation were an integral part of the arrogance with which the Labor club dominated at the university of Melbourne. Some things never change. Obviously Mr Landeryou could not keep away from his former student union. In recent court proceedings he has been alleged to be the beneficiary of this $44 million contract. The whole affair stinks of Khemlani-esque proportions. Allegations of international money transfers, forgery and phoney directors abound. The close colleagues and friends of Mr Landeryou at university included some of today's aspiring Labor Party politicians, Evan Thornley and Richard Marles-the former contributing to the Labor Party's failed and embarrassing policy of Noodle Nation and the latter being an extremely uninspiring drone of the union movement who is alienating scores of Labor Party members in his often described dodgy attempts at stacking out the seat of Corio. Indeed, some of these Labor student politicians do learn some very valuable lessons on campus using the compulsorily acquired union funds. These Labor Party boys were bullies and thugs then, and nothing has changed. I was at university when these Labor Party boys were arrogantly pushing their weight around on campus. They were political thugs, and by all accounts they continue to be. I say to those in the Labor Party, ‘Do not surrender your party to these sorts of individuals. They will corrode from within what integrity is left.' Instead, what do I find with all these pleas of mine to help the Labor Party become a decent opposition that the Australian people deserve and an integral part of a democracy? We have not only a cheer squad: more than that, we have the pro bono defence team for the disgraced Andrew Landeryou. That is what you will see in this debate. There is a whole list of them. They will come out and defend a system that lets someone like that not only flourish and grow but continue to do so even after he had left university. Perhaps there is still some hope for them. Perhaps if they listened to one of their own on the other side, the member for Melbourne Ports, they would rethink their position. In a very enlightened article entitled ‘Extremists and vice-chancellors', the honourable member said: The power of AUS, for all its bash merchants, could have been dissolved virtually overnight if governments and university administrators had acted to make the decision of any student to become part of it voluntary. He continued: What was required was not any suppression or any fresh coercion, but simply a removal of coercive power from a body which had no entitlement to it. The clarity of the honourable member's observations continued when he stated: It is interesting to consider whether or not the establishment-the governments and university administrations who continued to force students to support AUS-ever wondered or cared what students thought of them and what kind of an image of their own values they were projecting to students at large. Why the establishment seemed so unwilling to permit freedom of association for students, either on individual campuses or nationally (and the one necessarily implied the other), remains a mystery to many ... Indeed, those questions are still relevant and should be pondered very deeply by members on the other side. A debate on voluntary student unionism would be incomplete without a particular reference to the honourable Norman Moore, MLC, former minister for education in Western Australia, one of the few courageous visionaries who ensured that students in that state-70,000 of them-enjoyed freedom of association from about 1995 to 2003, when the state Labor government abolished it. His good work, his preparation and his determination to do the right thing by students us some examples to disprove the doom and gloom predictions of the member for Jagajaga. What did we see? At the University of Western Australia the student union was better focused on student services and student needs. A new system of subsidised textbooks and legal services were offered. So the argument by members on the other side of the House that services would collapse is not only morally bankrupt but also intellectually hollow. They know it is not true. They engage in emotive arguments. The argument they most often put forward is about the sporting elite. Good gracious me! As a Victorian, I was surprised that the member for Jagajaga was such a fan of rugby. She talked on and on about rugby and asked why the government were not listening to Kevin Gosper and Ric Charlesworth, among other sports people. I could pose a similar question. Perhaps if there were a panel of about 12 famous sports people, they could make better leadership decisions in the Labor Party and come up with better policies. But we are the government-elected overwhelmingly by the Australian people. This measure is a basic part of our Liberal Party platform and we will introduce it. Let me say this to those on the other side who claim that rugby teams will suffer. No student going to any university, particularly Sydney University, should be forced to subsidise the rugby team. It has been put to me that many famous and wealthy people, part of the Sydney establishment, were involved in the Sydney University Rugby Club, and that they would not be particularly happy with this legislation. I am not going to be intimidated and I say, ‘Too bad.' You like your rugby club, which competes professionally with other league teams, and stugives dents will support it. Or, if you are so wealthy and influential, you support it. I will not stand aside from something I believe in strongly because a few blokes in Sydney have an emotional attachment to their rugby team. I have campaigned for voluntary student unionism for all my political life, for 18 years. It is something I believe in strongly and something I have fought for, along with many others. I am extremely proud-I did not know how long I would have to wait-of the courage that this government and this minister have shown in doing the right thing by students. We do not live in the Dark Ages any more. We need to take university representation into the 21st century. I commend the bill to the House and look forward to its passage through the Senate, where we will be watching and cheering it on with great happiness.",53
22,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"It is with some pleasure that I stand this afternoon to indicate my opposition to the government's Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. The opposition is determined to raise very serious issues concerning this bill. For the education of the member for Indi, rugby is not a game played just in New South Wales and Queensland. One of our most famous Australians, who represented the Wallabies in rugby, cut his teeth at Melbourne University in the Melbourne University Rugby Club-namely, Weary Dunlop. So rather than having a side debate about the Sydney University Rugby Club, let us concentrate on what this debate is really about. There is a view in Australia that we as a community are not bludgers. We are a community that prides ourselves on a hard day's work for a fair day's pay, and believes in paying its way. That is the crux of this debate. For our gifted young who are fortunate enough to go to university, university does not just offer one of the best education opportunities in terms of a simple focus on education-it also appropriately offers a terrific opportunity for a well-rounded education. We as a community have to focus on developing well-rounded young Australians because they are the future of this nation. That is about guaranteeing that they are exposed to a wealth of opportunities, not just a narrow-minded focus on tuition through their university or TAFE opportunities. For those reasons, I say that, unfortunately, this bill is a prime example of the government's narrow minded intention to stamp out any activities and organisations that do not fall into line with its politics. I know from when we were in government-it does not matter who is in government-that there will be opposition from student organisations to decisions of the government. I think back to the hard decision that the Labor Party made-in over 13 years of very tough decisions-to introduce the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. That was opposed by student unions. They had a view that no young person should make any contribution to the cost of their education. They campaigned in the streets. They campaigned on the campuses. They were often led by representatives of Liberal Party organisations on student campuses who had a view that students should not pay their way. They did it when we were in government in the same way as they are doing it now, when there is an alternative government in place. That is the nature of free speech. It is a part of students' development. They are entitled to have their view in life. But this society has to start fronting up to the fact that, whether this government likes it or not, student unions are not trade unions. I am pleased to say that I have had a history in the trade union movement. There is a wealth of difference between a student union and a trade union. The problem is that the Howard government has decided to crush trade unions-that is a debate for another day. So be it. Alternative governments in the past, both within Australia and beyond Australia, have had a determination to destroy organised labour in Australia. Let us draw a line in the debate. It is about time we also fronted up to the fact that the Howard government is wrong in its view: student unions are not trade unions. The government, unfortunately, does not understand the distinction. The government does not understand that no student organisation in Australia forces students to be a member of that organisation. I once attended university. I chose to be a member of the Labor club. Unlike the member for Indi, for example, I did not concentrate my university days on student politics. Unlike the member for Indi, many of my mates were too busy pursuing part-time work to assist with the costs of pursuing a university opportunity. We came from large families where education was second to no other priorities in those families. The member for Indi had her fun on university campuses and is consumed with student politics. All I can say is that it is about time she got out of her cocoon and actually looked to the broader aspects of life and to the terrific range of services offered on university campuses to young Australians aimed at trying to guarantee that they are given the best opportunities and the most rounded educational opportunities in life. That is why voluntary membership of university student organisations already exists. We also have to deal with a bit of history. The tradition of student unions or guilds dates back to the early 1800s when the original Cambridge and Oxford unions were established as community centres for students. Today they are infamous debating chambers and they stand for the great tradition-and, I believe, the inalienable right-of freedom of speech. From time to time governments change. Student unions, irrespective of who is in government, will find fault with the government of the day. Let them express their views. Let them demonstrate. Let them have their campaigns on HECS, Iraq, refugeeson every issue under the sun. That is part of their personal development. It is part of encouraging them to think and to express a point of view. When you go through some of the leading activists on university campuses you find that, while they may have started with what would be perceived by the government to be a rather radical point of view, as time goes on they sit on the other side of the business fence and are consumed by making a dollar and economic opportunity more than going back to their days of radical university activia ties. As they go through life, they develop different ideas about what is right and wrong. My friends, it therefore concerns me greatly that this government, an Australian government of the 21st century, seems determined to undermine the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of association, not only through this bill but through many other insidious pieces of legislation, particularly the area of industrial relations. The truth is that this debate is taking Australia back to the Dark Ages. That is because we have a government at the moment that is not consumed with the big picture but consumed with insidious little issues on the way, based on their particular hatreds or the pet subjects that they want to settle scores on. That is also reflected in the nature of the budget that they brought in this week. So let us make sure that, in thinking about this bill, we try to take a picture of Australia as a leading nation in the 21st century in the free world. Unfortunately, we have a government with no vision for Australia's future-a government that is squandering a once in a lifetime surge in world economic growth driven by the resource boom and once in a lifetime terms of trade, by failing to invest in Australia's productive capacity, skills, training and infrastructure to underpin and guarantee our future growth. Unfortunately, rather than investing in Australia's productive capacity, this government cannot see beyond driving economic growth by fuelling consumption through tax cuts to the big spenders. I have no problems voting against a tax cut for myself. I do not consider that someone on about $108,000 per year, someone like me, is entitled to a tax cut while a childcare worker, a nurse or a maths or science teacher gets six bucks. Nor do I consider it appropriate that someone who is going to get highly rewarding superannuation payment from the Australian taxpayers is entitled to a further increase in that entitlement by abolishing the superannuation tax surcharge. I think I am doing all right, unlike a lot of the constituents that I represent in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. Let us get our priorities right. Let us start working out how we can create a system that in encourages people, through wages and tax incentives, to want to be child-care workers, nurses, maths or science teachers, bricklayers, boilermakers or welders. Those are our priorities. Those are the bottlenecks that are going to hold back Australia's economic growth sooner rather than later. But they are not the priorities in the current government's approach to economic management. They are driven by a narrow-minded debate about hatred of student unions. What is that going to do for Australia's economic future? Nought. It is going to make no contribution at all to Australia's productive future. Let us get our priorities right. Let us investing in our productive capacity. Let us start trying to work out what we have to do to invest in our future skills and infrastructure development. Let us make sure that we actually reward hard working low-income Australian families, who struggle to live from day to day let alone week to week. Those are the people who are the engine room of economic growth in Australia-not politicians, who are not entitled to a wage increase or an improvement in their superannuation entitlements, which are the real priorities of the current budget that is being bated in the House. It is no wonder, therefore, when you think about this being a major priority of the Howard government's agenda, as expressed by the member for Indi, that we have our minds off the fact that economic growth in Australia is slowing. We have our minds off the fact that the budget predicts a permanent downgrade in expected future growth rates from 2008-09. That is what we should be debating at the moment: how we meet that challenge as a community. It is also no wonder that, despite the extraordinary surge in Australia's terms of trade to their best level in 50 years, Australia has experienced the longest run of trade deficits in our history. Those are the real facts. When do you hear the Treasurer talk about those issues as priorities? He does not want to talk about them because they mean actually having a bit of leadership and making a few hard decisions-just as Labor, with its priorities to create opportunities for young people in education, developed the HECS system when in government; just as Labor did something about traditional apprenticeships, because we need the most skilled work force in the world, where well-rounded young Australians can meet all challenges. What is the government's response? It has increased start HECS and, if you are dumb and rich, you can get to university, but encouraging university activities is not a priority. Despite record demand and record prices and a rate of export growth at just two per cent, down from 10 per cent when this government came to power in March 1996, it is no wonder that Australia's current account deficit is now 6.5 per cent of GDP, higher than at any point in 50 years. They are the real facts; they are the economic statistics behind the challenges that confront Australia at the moment. This is what happens when de- you drive the economy with unsustainable consumption instead of productivity. That is what happens when you have a government that focuses on petty issues like crushing student unions rather than the real debate that confronts Australia. It loses sight of the big picture and the real issues. This bill is a prime example of the Howard government's mean-spirited and smallminded approach to Australian public policy and what we as a community should see as our priorities. The bill, and it is interesting, will make Australia one of the only countries in the OECD not to charge fees to support student services at university. What types of services are we talking about? Firstly, there are sporting clubs. I do not care whether it is cricket, hockey, rugby, Aussie rules or whatever. What is wrong with encouraging students to participate in sporting activities at university? Nothing whatsoever. There are health and fitness clubs, medical clinics, debating societies, housing and accommodation, social clubs, arts activities and student welfare. If you are a young person coming from a country area to a foreign campus in a capital city, unless you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth and went to an elite boarding school in a capital city, you need this type of assistance when you arrive in an area unknown to you. You need these services to assist you in the adjustment to university life. They are also places where lifelong friendships and deep relationships are forged on many fronts. They are places where many young people have their first exposure to a diverse community. People come from all over the country and, indeed, from all over the world-from rural centres and cities, from all kinds of socio-economic and political backgrounds and with all kinds of skills and interests. It is about the Australian way of life. In essence, they are places of socialisation where we mature as young adults and develop a sense of place in the nation and the world. They are places to encourage new ideas and dreams. The new ideas first hatched on these campuses will shape and develop kindred spirits and help us as a nation to mature and nurture our place in the world. Student unions are about our future leaders. Our elite athletes and artists will be covered and developed on university campuses. So I am going to vote for a wellrounded education. That is why I am pleased to oppose this bill. I do not care what university students campaign for or against. That is the nature of freedom of speech. They have campaigned against us in the past when we were in government and, when we form government in the future, without a doubt they will campaign against us again, just as they campaign against the current government. They were on the streets during the last election campaign. They have been on the streets about Iraq. I tell you what: we copped a hiding from some of those student unions about our position on Iraq too-so what? They are entitled to their view about life. It is about freedom of speech and association. Let us front up to the fact that the real debate is about allowing university students to participate in a vibrant non-academic lifein sporting clubs, in the arts, in debating and in many other social activities. Do not deny students these opportunities by being meanspirited. Encourage and cultivate them. We are all big enough to cop criticism; we cop it at home with our own kids. I have two kids at university. They certainly do not agree with me about everything, in the same way that I had debates with my father about decisions he had to make when he was in government. That is the nature of freedom of speech and we should be encouraging and fostering it. For students, campuses can be daunting. That hand of friendship through clubs and associations is important in assisting students to adapt to university and make new friends, some of which are long lasting. It is reflected on the other side of the House: many long friendships are established at university-not just in the Young Liberal club but also in sporting activities such as the rugby club at the University of Sydney. I am proud that we disachieved that, irrespective of the views on the other side of the House. Students with special needs, like single mothers, will suffer if we do not face our responsibilities to encourage and foster these services. These students rely on access to good-quality, convenient and affordable child-care services, to medical clinics, to assistance in obtaining part-time work and to assistance in finding accommodation. It is our responsibility to assist these young people. It is our responsibility to invest in their future. The Australian Labor Party, in its opposition to this bill, is not driven by ideology; we accept the role of student unions. Let them criticise the government of the day. I think it is terrific to have such a fertile bate in the Australian community. By encouraging these services we can guarantee university students a well-rounded education. Let's encourage them to fully participate in the community life of their universities. Without compulsory fees, these services will be significantly reduced and it will be harder for our young people to participate and develop themselves through university life. It is about services and facilities; it is not about ideology or a mean-spirited approach to education in Australia. I am proud to stand in opposition to this bill. We are not talking about trade unionism; we are talking about services needed by ordinary young Australian men and women, and by those who come to Australia from overseas to study, to assist them in developing and educating themselves.",57
23,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"After listening to the bizarre and rambling dissertation of the member for Batman on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005, I have heard some arguments from the Labor Party that I have never heard before. Somehow mateship and friendship in Australia are totally reliant on compulsory unionism. I have never heard such a ridiculous proposition. Bizarre claims were also made about the right to protest. No-one cares about what student unions do as long as they do it without forcibly acquiring the money of every other student to do it, which seems to be the point that the previous speaker misses entirely. Whether he misses it deliberately or through utter ignorance, I fear it is the latter. This debate sums up so much about the difference between this side of the House and the other. Simple matters of freedom, choice and conscience are difficult and complicated questions for the Australian Labor Party. Mr Gavan O'Connor-What about the dethree-year-old behind barbed wire at Villawood? You talk about freedom!",62
24,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"The member for Corio seeks to interject. I would have thought that he would be a secret supporter of this bill. Compulsory unionism at Melbourne university has brought forth Richard Marles, who is about to steamroll him in Corio. I would have thought that the member for Corio would have been very happy with the recent developments with Mr Landeryou-but I will come back to that later in this debate. I am very glad that the next recipient of corrupt Labor student unions is in the House to speak on this bill following me. This legislation is simply about the principle of freedom of association-the principle that students going to university should be able to choose whether they belong to an organisation or not. Through the industrial relations reform agenda of the government, we have introduced voluntary membership to unions against the wishes of those opposite. Campuses remain the last bastion of compulsory unionism. That fundamental principle, the freedom to decide whether or not to belong to a union, is one that those on this side of the House have always stood up for and will always stand up for while those on the other side of the House have always opposed it. In a choice between the right of someone to choose to belong to an organisation, the Labor Party will always subjugate that right because they will always do everything they can for their union mates. They have always been opponents of freedom of association for a number of reasons-not just philosophically but also pragmatically because they rely on the funds that compulsory membership brings. It brings a great deal of money to the Australian Labor Party, as a previous speaker, the member for Indi, pointed out. Unions contribute massive amounts to Labor coffers. Where compulsory unionism still exists it means, in frank terms, that workers have their money taken against their will. Part of that money is donated to the Australian Labor Party against the will of workers. With the opposition of the Labor Party we have forged many improvements in Australian workplaces. This bill, which deals with voluntary membership of student organisations, is not a simple or radical bill; it is a bill that simply says: if students wish to join a union they can, but they will not be forced to join a union if they do not like the services it offers; they will not be forced to join a union to fund the bizarre and wasteful excesses of student unions. Aside from addressing important issues of freedom of choice, this bill exposes another great hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party, particularly from the opposition's lead speaker, the member for Jagajaga, who has spoken today-and has bleated it persistently since this bill was first introduced-of her so-called concern for the financial burdens that students on Australian campuses face. It is beyond belief that members opposite can say on the one hand that they want to relieve financial burdens on students but, on the other, oppose a bill which will abolish the only compulsory up-front fee that is charged to all students. Unlike HECS, the fees charged by student unions must be paid in full and must be paid up-front. There is no allowance for deferred payments whatsoever. And being up-front, these fees are a far greater burden on low-income university students. On that point I want address the misrepresentation of a previous speaker by a member on the other side who said that perhaps Liberal students on campuses did not understand many of the burdens of students because they had not had part-time jobs. I can tell him that the member for Indi, whom he made that accusation about, worked part time all through her university career. I worked a night shift as a part-time cook all the way through university to fund my way through. That is precisely one of the reasons why so many students object to having their hard earned earnings taken by a student union that wastes them or, in the case of Melbourne university, goes bankrupt. By virtue of the fact that those opposite, such as the member for Corio, mentioned nothing of the excesses of student unions, I say to them: ‘You support them.' A compulsory student union has engaged in fraud and mismanagement of the highest order and members of the Labor Party are appearing before court, but the opposition comes into this House and carries on like a parrot and addresses none of those issues. I say to the people of Australia: the members opposite, by their silence, support the very fraud of those student unions that we have seen at Melbourne university. The union fees charged are grossly inequitable. They pose a barrier. We are saying that, if unions offered good services that students wanted to pay for, they would have no trouble attracting members. Those opposite fear student unions might have trouble attracting members because of the very behaviour that the member for Indi outlined in her contribution and the behaviour that I have already alluded to and will allude to further in this contribution. For decades student unions have been grossly unrepresentative of the student population. The previous speaker from the other side spoke of how healthy it is to have a debate, how healthy it is to protest. No-one cares what a student union of leftists does: no-one cares if they dye their hair green and roll down the gutters outside Melbourne university-no-one cares less. What they care about is having to fund it. Why should every student on every campus have to fund every Labor Party loop? That is the only point. If what they were protesting about were so good, people would join that union voluntarily in droves, but this is something that completely eludes those opposite. The member for Indi outlined some of the very examples of the wastefulness of student unions. She spoke of the Monash Student Association printing stickers, paid for by every student forced to belong to that union, saying: ‘Bomb the White House'. How ridiculous! Every student was forced to pay for that sticker-something those opposite, including the member for Corio through his silence, obviously support. The fact that the member for Corio is silent is something that would almost make the front page in this place. I think he is reflecting on where a former Melbourne student union president is right now. What part of Geelong is Richard Marles in as we have this debate? What part of Corio is he in? Which street is he driving down? Which factory is he recruiting members from? That is what the member for Corio is thinking. That is what he is reflecting on today as we take part in this debate. I would to say to him: think again; vote with us on this bill-it is in your own interests. The member for Indi outlined some of those examples of wastefulness. We have had recently the best one that absolutely nails the pathetic case put forward by those opposite. That is the University of New South Wales guild that actually used compulsorily acquired student funds to have a $600 prize for the campus that brought in the most protesters against this bill, so even against this bill they had to use compulsorily acquired student funds to pay for protesters. This is something you would see in the Eastern bloc. It is absolutely ridiculous but those opposite somehow manage-I do not know whether they practise in the morning putting on a straight face before they come in hereto defend this rubbish. They are more than happy to do it. These student protests are not the expression of the beliefs of students on campus. They are just a cynical attempt by student leaders to try to trick the public into believing that there is some sort of dissatisfaction on campuses with this bill. Last year the same students led protests against the government's introduction of higher education reform. They have done so in the past; they will do so again. Some of the most conclusive proof of just how biased these student unions are while not representing students is how in the last election the National Union of Students spent $250,000 of their money campaigning against the Howard government. They did not spend any money campaigning against anybody else. They just decided that with the compulsorily acquired funds they would campaign for the Labor Party, so no wonder you get those opposite defending the indefensible. The ALP claims that it supports the plight of university students, but it is happy to sit back and let $250,000 of compulsorily acquired money from students-those who work in the part-time jobs that the previous Labor speaker was talking of-just be taken away and given to the ALP. Of course you can see why they are prepared to defend the indefensible. These are the sorts of outrageous ways in which student unions on Australian campuses waste the hard earned money that they acquire from students. These are the things that Australian students are forced to fund against their will, just to to get protesters get an education. But potentially even more damning than such offensive campaigns is the serious financial mismanagement that the member for Indi spoke about that occurs with these compulsorily acquired funds. Last year we had the example-and it is very much up in lights now, and the member for Corio would be very familiar with all the principal players-of the collapse of the Melbourne university student union, with the university forced to expend hundreds of thousands of dollars in a corruption probe with concerns raised about the signing of many controversial contracts following the election of a bor Party aligned administration. Many of the wrongdoings of these characters have been exposed in great detail. We have had this cat and mouse chase with Mr Andrew Landeryou, who left the country and has come back and is now operating a web site, I believe, on which he is going to tell all on the Labor Party-so that is one to log into every day, member for Corio-about everything that has been going on in the Labor Party to do with this deal. But the bottom line is you had the member for Jagajaga worrying about student unions not existing under voluntary membership and worrying that if you actually gave people a choice they might not join. She was very worried that student unions might not succeed. With compulsory membership at Melbourne university the union collapsed! That is the absolute hypocrisy of it. I say to the member for Boothby that I am worried that they actually do not see the irony in this. If I thought they went back to their offices and thought this was a bit of a tough gig-trying to defend this indefensible, corrupt, criminal behaviour-but they would do it, that would be one thing. They are ignorant. I think they have an absolute morality gap on this sort of thing. The investigation is ongoing. We are sure that will unfold in great detail over the ing weeks and months. But what did it all mean for those students at Melbourne university, those students who paid that compulsory fee of $382? What it meant was that the union which forced them to join against their will took their money and sent itself broke. What did they get for their money? Where was this greater good that those opposite speak of? The member for Jagajaga went out of her way, as did the previous speaker, the member for Batman, to criticise the Australian Liberal Students Federation. Let me say quite openly: I was a member of the Australian Liberal Students Federation and, yes, I Lawas a president of the Melbourne University Liberal Club-and proudly so. What I say to her is that without the Australian Liberal Students Federation and the Julian Barendses and the Rohan D' Souzas of Melbourne university, this scandal would never have been uncovered. The Australian Liberal Students Federation are the only organisation that have acted in the interests of all students. Without their actions, without their investigative work, this corruption would still be going on today. So, rather than criticise them, those opposite-if they genuinely believe they have the interests of all students at heart-would be praising them. Only by passing this bill can we grant students genuine choice about whether or not they wish to join a student union. All we are saying is that we will give students the choice. They have choices everywhere else. That is a big problem for the Labor Party. The students are 18. They can choose what car they drive, they can choose where they work and they can choose what university they go to, but clearly those opposite believe, in some condescending way, that they are not capable of making a choice about whether or not to join a union. We say that if they are old enough to vote and old enough to go to a campus they can choose whether they buy a comproduct or not. They can choose whether they are going to join the union. That is what we are doing: we are giving them a choice that they should have and that they should have had years ago. Those opposite do low-income students an extraordinary disservice in failing to let them have that choice. The problem for those opposite, as I said at the start of the speech, that allowing choice and freedom of association is abhorrent to them because it would expose student unions-the sorts of people that come up through the Labor Party ranks and the sorts of people that the member for Corio is familiar with-to the reality of the outside world. The real fear is that it would force student unions to offer services students want. This was the experience in Western Australia. Those opposite do not have to fear what would happen under voluntary student unionism: you know. As the member for Indi said, it was introduced in Western Australia and none of the doomsday predictions eventuated. Student unions lowered their fees and offered better services. None of the dire predictions of the student unions or, might I say, the vice-chancellors came true. Rather, we saw what common sense would naturally predict. We saw a voluntary regime where unions could charge what they wanted. They started to provide services to students that students actually wanted and, far from reducing services, the evidence is that they increased them. They provided voluntary union guild loans, which had not previously been available, and the list goes on. None of this should be a surprise. Our modern economy-the member for Batman also tried to address this in his rambling, rolling dissertation-runs on the basis of choice. The government does not prescribe what goods consumers must buy. It allows them to make an informed decision, and that same process is needed with respect to compulsory student unionism. In concluding, this debate says a lot about the differences between this side of the House and the other. The Labor Party love to mouth words about freedom of speech and of choice and about students' rights, but the thing you can always rely on with the Labor is Party is that, if there is a choice between an individual's personal rights and the Labor Party's collective self-interest, it is always the latter that prevails. The Labor Party's primary objective is to look after themselves. That has always been the way and the students of Australia ought to know it, and they ought to know it in this debate. The Labor Party will always abandon individual interests in favour of their own collective self interest. It is a pleasure to speak in this long overdue debate. It is a pleasure to speak on it after the member for Indi, who worked so hard for voluntary student unionism in the time. I was with her on campus, and after the member for Boothby, who did the same thing in South Australia. This is a bill that should have been passed decades ago. The fact that compulsory student unionism still exists on university campuses, which hold themselves out to be bastions of freedom, is a sorry reflection not just on that collective roadblock opposite but on the university administrators and vice-chancellors who, for reasons of convenience, sit happily by as willing and meek shop stewards. This bill should be passed and should have been passed decades ago. I commend it to the House.",62
25,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I rise today in full and total opposition to the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. Members opposite have been trying to kill off student organisations in Australia for years. Anti-student organisation legislation has been moved in this place on numerous occasions and, to the credit of the senators involved, those bills received the treatment that I believe they deserved. In the past, bills like this have created a convenient opportunity for Liberal and National MPs to make anti-student union speeches safe in the knowledge that no real damage would be done. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said today. In a very short while-in fact, on 1 July-the coalition will gain control of both houses of parliament and bills like the one we are debating today will become reality. I was listening with interest to the previous speaker, the member for Casey. He said it was about time we had this debate. Let me tell him and others that I had the privilege of participating in exactly the same debate back in March 1999 in this very place. At the time, there was great consideration of a higher education amendment bill and we arguedvery strongly, I believe-to reject the bill, and it was rejected. In recalling that particular debate, I have had a little look at the Hansard of March 1999. The member for Bruce, on our side, made a great contribution to that debate at the time, and I have no hesitation in referring to it here today. I recall it for the benefit of members. I find it interesting, considering the speaker who just addressed the House and the considerations that he was putting forward. I want to refer in part, if I may, to part of the speech that the member for Bruce delivered. He was lifting these words out of a publication that had appeared some years earlier on the issue of compulsory unionism. He said that the article was not recommending the abolition of it. His quote from the article went on: ... since the various student unions do have a positive contribution to offer to student welfare and student education they should be supported by all those who profit from them. It seems reasonable that all those who do profit should make some contribution in return. The funding and therefore provision of the various student services would be impossible unless there was some requirement to pay a contribution towards them. The fact that some people object to the way in which some public funds are spent does not mean that they are therefore exempted from paying taxes. The fact that there are some political donations made on behalf of SRCs and AUS. that may be abhorrent to some people who have contributed union fees does not mean we should therefore create a situation whereby all activities including those that are profitable to the people concerned are financially penalised by voluntary payments ... the facilities of student unions are only practical on the basis of compulsory contributions ... The member for Bruce pointed out very carefully that those words were uttered by the current Treasurer when he was in the student movement during his days at university. I think it is a good idea to remember how people can be convinced to change their minds, but one wonders how we can ever believe anybody when words like those are said so stridently. Student organisations have been a part of campus life in Australia for the better part of a century. I understand that when Bob Hawke was a student the then peak national student organisation, the National Union of Australian University Students, had Liberal Party members and Liberal Party sympathisers on the national executive. Whatever the differences between student advocates and the government of the time, until now no Australian government has had the arrogance to really seek to destroy student organisations. Now student organisations are facing extinction at the hands of a government caught up in outdated ideology. I would like to use my time here today to address some of the arguments used by the government to justify their attacks on Australian students and to talk about some of the ramifications of the passage of this bill. A common argument used by coalition MPs and right-wing commentators is that compulsory union fees are a breach of freedom of association-that is, students are somehow forced to accept the services pressed upon them by their student association. At one point someone even took that argument to the Victorian Supreme Court. Unsurprisingly, the case was rejected. The court found that if you choose to attend a university you choose to accept the conditions of enrolment at that campus, including the payment of fees to the relevant campus organisation. When people say that student organisations make an essential contribution to the university experience they are not just defending their former classmates but stating a fact recognised by the Victorian Supreme Court. Another fact ignored by the freedom of association argument is the democratic nature of student organisations. If the on a particular campus want to reduce the amount of money that each member pays, they are free to do so through their own processes. If students at the University of Canberra, for example, decide that they no longer want their own campus based organisation, there is nothing to stop them taking the decision to wind up their association. Conservative politicians love to use the word ‘freedom' when attacking student organisations because it is the only argument that sounds vaguely credible. Student organisations provide myriad services to students on campus. Members opposite try to use the political activities conducted by student organisations to support an argument in favour of destroying them. Forget for the moment that an opinionated student population could be considered a positive side effect of having a decent education system and that student politicians are democratically elected, these organisations provide much more than the political advocacy that is sometimes seen on the six o'clock news. Student organisations provide support so fundamental to campus life that it is often taken for granted by some of their members. These organisations distribute information on local transport arrangements, employment opportunities and ways of avoiding drink spiking-a terrible problem amongst the young at the moment. Counselling, and suicide and rape prevention programs are examples of services provided and paid for by student organisations. Other examples quoted by ACT universities include advice on Centrelink programs, legal advice, health advice, financial advice, rooms where young women can congregate and discuss issues, sexual harassment contact officers and self defence classes. They also provide subsidised food and coffee, and photocopying, students printing and faxing facilities. When I mention those issues, I cannot help but reflect upon the Minister for Education, Science and Training being absolutely obsessed, during the opening of this debate some weeks ago, with the price of sausage rolls. I felt that that was a bit of an insult. I am sure that the provision of services by student associations through universities in this country goes far beyond the level of the price of a sausage roll. I found that comment quite demeaning to the whole debate. Under the current system, many campus organisations provide on-campus advocacy services for students. In practice that means that if a student feels that he or she has been unfairly treated they can seek advice from their student association. Here in the ACT if a student at the University of Canberra thinks they have been discriminated against or harassed, or if they need help dealing with the university bureaucracy for any reason, their student association is there to help. They have a full-time advocacy officer employed to ensure that students' rights are maintained. Office bearers at the Australian National University Students Association earn less than the minimum wage they would receive at MCDonald's or Woolworths. Despite this, anyone who has walked through the main courtyard at ANU during their O week market day will know that the lack of remuneration has not dampened their spirits at all. They have sailing, rugby and hiking clubs. They have debating, law, literary and Baha'i societies. The lists are long but comprehensive and it is voluntary for whoever wishes to join any one of them. ANU students organise political debates between Labor and Liberal parliamentarians. Latter year students volunteer as mentors for campus newcomers and ANU Students Association representatives mediate between students and faculty representatives during disputes. To take away their student associations is to take away all these services and more. The services and advocacy provided to Canberra students by Canberra students affect the entire university experience. Attacking those organisations will deny future students the experiences enjoyed by many of the members opposite. Let us look at this in a more purely politiprotesters cal sense. In their eagerness to write off dent organisations as one-eyed, left-leaning organisations, government members are offending a great number of conservative students who will suffer alongside Labor, Greens and Democrats, and anyone else for that matter, voting students at universities. That is why I believe student organisations are finding support in some unlikely places. The Victorian state branch of The Nationals has recognised the effect this legislation will have on rural campuses and their surrounding areas, and it has rejected this legischaracter lation, comparing the collection of student union fees to government rates and taxes. Coalition members and senators from rural areas would do well to consider the contribution that regional campuses make to local economies. Student organisations provide services, infrastructure and jobs in many rural areas. As their funding is cut, so too will be the services they provide and the jobs associated with that service provision. The Nationals senator elect Barnaby Joyce was quoted in the Australian on 27 April this year, refuting previous claims that he planned to support VSU and declaring his opposition to the bill in its current form. If that report is accurate, he is to be commended for having the courage of his convictions. When the coalition government authorised Australian universities to raise HECS fees and introduce up-front fee places, many student organisations reacted by organising protests. The protest events were designed to register students' opposition to increased fees and up-front fee places and could not have endeared their organisers to the campus vicechancellors. Despite this the Group of Eight universities and the Australian ViceChancellors Committee, both populated by the same vice-chancellors who faced student just last year, have publicly destuclared their opposition to government interference in the collection of student fees. In a press release issued last July, the ViceChancellors Committee described the government's decision not to proceed with a bill remarkably similar to the one we are debating today as common sense. In a press release issued in December last year, the Chair of the Group of Eight said: Any move by the federal government to dictate the purposes for which universal student service fees may be collected and disbursed will interfere in the autonomy of universities and damage the of the cultural, social, sporting and learning environment of the university. That pretty much sums it up. Interfering with the collection of fees is an unwarranted, unwanted intrusion on the part of the federal government and will hurt the university environment in many ways. If the Minister for Education, Science and Training thinks he knows more about the value of student organisations and their contribution to daily life on campus than the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, he is more arrogant than anyone could have guessed. The students do not want this bill, the versity vice-chancellors do not want this bill and some of the more level-headed coalition parliamentarians really and honestly do not want this bill. At the federal level this bill has failed before, and if common sense prevails it will fail again. Reference was made by the previous speaker to the situation in Western Australia. While anti-student union legislation has a habit of failing at the federal level, VSU has been tried at the state level, with disastrous results. Conservative governments in Western Australia and Victoria brought in antistudent union legislation during the 1990s and their student populations paid the price. Under VSU, Curtin University in Western Australia was forced to drastically reduce the level of support provided to students. Emergency loans, subsidised catering and rape referrals are just some of the services that were cut as a result of that policy. To their credit the Gallop and Bracks Labor governments repealed the state VSU legislation and, thanks to the support of organisations like NUS, campus organisations managed to weather that storm. Under the legislation being debated today, the attacks on student organisations will be on a national scale. There will be no support from sympathetic organisations in other states because everyone will have the same problem. Students nationwide will pay the price for coalition ideology, and the experience of going to university may never be the same. Far from being unique to Australia, universities all around the world recognise the need for student run organisations. Fees charged by Australian student unions pale in comparison with our international competitors. The highest fee charged by an Australian student organisation is between $500 and $600, which is about a quarter or a fifth uniof some of the charges faced, for example, by equivalent universities in the US. Australia has the dubious honour of being one of a very small minority of countries that questions the need for student organisations. International students contribute approximately $1.7 billion per year in tuition fees and charges, and approximately $5.9 billion per year to the Australian economy overall. In exchange for the fees charged, student associations and unions provide much needed support for international students. Moving away from home can be stressful enough for domestic students, but international students face added pressure from cultural and language barriers. Threatening the services and support provided by student organisations can only diminish the appeal of Australian university places, which is one thing that we do not want to do. If Australian campuses lose the funds provided by international students, it is unlikely, given its recent track record, that this government would cover any gap created in that way. There will be less funding available and students will suffer. The arguments put up in support of bills like this over the decades, and this matter has been debated on so many occasions in the past, are based on outdated ideology and without any vision for the future of education in Australia. We have heard members opposite try in vain to argue that universal student unionism is in violation of the principles of freedom, and we have heard members give their highly unflattering opinions of student politicians. What we have not heard is how this legislation is going to help students or contribute to a positive university experience. I have outlined just a few of the positive contributions that student organisations currently make to campus life, but nobody has said how taking away services and removing student advocates is going to help anyone. I have never heard of a student wishing away the information or advocacy services provided by their student association or union. I would be surprised to find a student who did not appreciate advice from an older student mentor, and I would be shocked to meet a student who received help from their student association with a successful academic appeal yet remained ungrateful. I refuse to believe that the Liberal and National caucuses are united behind such a bloody-minded attack, and I call on members opposite to exercise their consciences and vote down this bill. I would like to again refer to words the current Treasurer wrote some years ago. He said: The fact that some people object to the way in which some public funds are spent does not mean that they are therefore exempted from paying taxes. The fact that there are some political tions made on behalf of SRCs and AUS that may be abhorrent to some people who have contributed union fees does not mean we should therefore create a situation whereby all activities including those that are profitable to the people concerned are financially penalised by voluntary payments. I could not have put it better myself. I suggest that those opposite make the time to reflect upon the words of the current Treasurer when he was giving that opinion some years ago now on the right to have voluntary union fees in universities in Australia.",66
26,Dr SOUTHCOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"There is a romantic nostalgia today about university unions. I think of that scene in the 1981 British film Chariots of Fire where a young Harold Abrahams is at his university orientation. He avoids the spruiker of the Fabian Society; he joins the Gilbert and Sullivan Society; and he is of course the star recruit of the Cambridge Athletics Club. But this picture of extramural life has about as much to do with Australian students today as other aspects of the University of Cambridge in the 1920s. When universities were almost exclusively populated by full-time undergraduate students fresh out of school, compulsory union fees were accepted as a part of university life. However, today, higher education has changed dramatically so that there are more part-time, mature age, external and overseas students than ever before. The Dawkins reforms of the late 1980s mean that many universities are now spread over a number of campuses and students on outlying campuses cannot possibly access the main union building or union services. People now take crossinstitutional courses, and they often get a bill for union fees from two universities. Is it really fair to slug an external student a fee for union services when they may never donavisit the campus? At Deakin University, for example-in the member for Corio's electorate, perhaps-37 per cent of students are external students. Most of them will never visit Geelong-not to study, anyway. They cannot possibly access the university services. Is it really appropriate to expect a mature age student or a part-time student who attends lectures in the evenings after work to pay for services when they have no time or interest in participating in campus life? Like many in this debate, especially the previous speakers the member for Indi and the member for Casey, I can claim a long standing interest in the issue of university union fees and the campaign for VSU. It was the issue which drew me into politics. As President of the Adelaide Medical Students Society in 1989, I was able to achieve half union fees for clinical year, off-campus, medical, dental and agricultural science students at the University of Adelaide. I did it with the support of the University of Adelaide Liberal Club and the students themselves. The argument then, as now, was that students who cannot possibly use the services should not have to pay for them. We have all heard of the financial problems that university unions will have under VSU. Currently, there is obviously a bit of fat in the system. Last year, during the sixweek period of the federal election campaign, the National Union of Students spent over $75,000 on broadcasting electoral advertisements, over $40,000 on publishing these electoral advertisements, nearly $50,000 on producing campaign material like how-to-vote cards, posters or pamphlets and just under $90,000 on direct mailing. That is over a quarter of a million dollars of students' money being used in a federal election campaign. This is hardly core business of student unions. This is hardly student services. To emphasise the point, the mailing address for the electoral return for the National Union of Students is care of Trades Hall, Victoria. Locally, in my electorate of Boothby, students' funds are being funnelled to party political campaigns. I have received a leaked memo which showed that the Union Board of Flinders University on Monday, 7 June last year resolved: That the Union, jointly with SAFU (Students Association of Flinders University), request SOC (Student Organisation Committee) use its small projects fund to contribute $8,000 to a cross camseat. pus 2004 Federal Election material fund with information on the importance of preferencing the Coalition last. That resolution was moved by a staff member of a South Australian Labor senator. When you can do things like that, when you have control of student funds, it takes the work out of fundraising. This shows that student unions have been captured by the Labor Party and they are not representative of the general student body which funds their activities. Last year's minutes of the National Union of Students SA executive show that they established a federal election committee, and the SA President, Ms Meagan Hackett said: I am asking each campus student union and /or association to donate money to this campaign, to ensure that education remains one of the most topical election issues … According to Ms Hackett: The Flinders University Union has so far committed $6000 while UniSA will donate between $3000-6000 as well. Committee members included representatives from all three universities. I also have a copy of a letter which was sent out to voters in the seat of Hindmarsh from the National Union of Students. Far from making education topical, the direct mail campaign was directed against the Liberal candidate in Hindmarsh and urged voters: ‘Don't let Simon Birmingham and John Howard take away our future.' Mr Albanese-That's what you're doing. Very perceptive.",71
27,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,The member for Grayndler will cease interjecting.,72
28,Dr SOUTHCOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,Hindmarsh was won by 108 votes. Student funds diverted to the campaign may have made a difference in that Mr Albanese interjecting,72
29,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,He will respect the chair as well.,73
30,Dr SOUTHCOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Unions will have fewer resources for these sorts of activities under voluntary student unionism. But I have a sneaking feeling that, faced with a choice between counselling and paying money to the federal election campaign, student funds are still going to find their way into the eral election campaigns in 2007, in 2010, in 2013 and so on. Since the introduction of the tertiary education charge in 1986 and the introduction of HECS by the Hawke Labor government in 1988, student rallies have traditionally been against fees. The recent National Day of Action was the first student march I have ever seen which was in favour of fees. Not surprisingly, it was very poorly attended. The member for Casey talked of the University of New South Wales offering students funds to actually encourage people to bring along people to the march. In George Orwell's Animal Farm, the revolutionary call to arms for the animals was ‘Four legs good, two legs bad'. It seems that the message from recent student marches has been ‘Union fees good, HECS fees bad'. In other words, whether the fees are good ones or bad ones all depends on who receives them. A dollar from a student going towards their HECS fees is bad. A dollar from a student going towards their union fees is very good. This point is emphasised by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Committee's report into the 1999 VSU legislation, which gave the bill a resounding recommendation. That committee suggested that opponents of voluntary student unionism then, as they are now, were guided by their vested interests in union administration and party affiliated student bodies. Australia is a nation leading the world in developing a cultural environment free of discrimination. This freedom encompasses diversity on all grounds, including race, sex and colour. However, discrimination on one ground still exists within our education system-the compulsory nature of membership of a student union. Membership of any assofedciation should be the free choice of every individualMr Albanese-Like the AMA.",73
31,Dr SOUTHCOTT,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"The Australian Medical Association is a voluntary association. Its has as its members about 50 per cent of medical practitioners. You would be much closer to the Doctors Reform Society of Australia. Membership of any association should be the free choice of any individual, but this is critical when the organisation is, by its very nature, political. Despite claims to the contrary, students have no option to conscientiously object to the activities of their student unions. They cannot withdraw. As it stands, all students are required to be members of their respective student unions on campus. For example, I know personally of a student who was threatened with disenrolment and forfeiture of his place in law for not paying his union fees. There is compulsion at the university level; there is compulsion at a national level. Each university is associated with the National Union of Students, and they pay a fee of $5 per student to the NUS for each enrolled student, regardless of whether they wish to join. This is the same NUS who spent $250,000 of student money in last year's federal election campaign. One argument we often hear in favour of compulsion involves comparing a union fee to government taxation. I am sorry to break the news, but university unions are not a fourth level of government in Australia. Freedom of association is a fundamental right, one which is implicit in our Australian way of life and guaranteed to us under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The rest of the Australian community is bound by these logical and rational principles of dom of association. In some areas, such as workplace relations, this House has itself legislated to enact such freedoms-for example, the 1996 Workplace Relations Act, which gave the idea of freedom of association the status of a basic human right in tralian law. Another argument which supports voluntary membership relates to the activities of the unions. The forced contributions of students often go to blatantly political causes. Historically, the Australian Union of Students supported extremely divisive issues. In the 1970s, the AUS supported radical proPalestinian Liberation Organisation resolutions. They passed resolutions saying that marriage was a form of prostitution. They gave money to the Shining Path guerrilla movement in South America. We had compulsory student unionism but, led by people like the Treasurer and the health minister, campuses disaffiliated from the Australian Union of Students because they were so far removed from and so unrepresentative of the opinions of students. At a campus level, the problem is that these political escapades on issues which divide popular opinion are just not the domain of organisations whose members are not members of their own free will. The successor of the Australian Union of Students, the National Union of Students, regularly engages in similar escapades, as election return I have previously mentioned demonstrates. As an example, recently the National Union of Students spent compulsorily acquired student funds on protesting the government's immigration policy at the Baxter detention centre, regardless of whether students agreed. Individual student unions or guilds have been associated with protests that have left substantial damage bills, such as the free- $11,000-worth of damage inflicted on the Murdoch University Senate building. The president of that student guild, who was in his 12th year of study at the time, claimed that the protest was not organised by the guild, yet he conceded that both he and other Ausguild members were present. This is not the type of behaviour which should be subsidised by students at large who have no choice about whether they pay for it. In Victoria, as we have heard, the Melbourne University Student Union was wound up early last year. This happened under the compulsory unionism regime. After the VSU legislation comes into force from 1 January next year, if a university union fails because of mismanagement or some of the misadventures we have seen, we will be told: ‘It is all due to VSU.' None of it will be due to the responsibility of the administration. But the Melbourne University Student Union was wound up after a student housing lease deal went bad, exposing the union to losses of up to $40 million. Several matters were referred to the police, and the liquidator recommended investigation into corporate governance issues such as falsification of records and conflicts of interest. Their financial records show expenses such as $213,000 on legal fees in 2002. Furthermore, in the Age of 26 July 2003, Darren Ray, the 2002 union president, admitted winning his election by the ‘proving that the union paid for an axe used in a rampage by a minority of students who wrecked the office of the Vice-Chancellor.' These are not the expenses that give value to students for their union fees. Forced membership has created a culture of economic inefficiency. Voluntary student unionism will unleash powerful market forces on the student services sector, which will provide better, more efficient, greater value services to students at a lower cost. Currently, under the climate of coercion, students pay substantial up-front union fees of around $300 but up to $500 in New South Wales and receive no choice in the services provided to them. Quite obviously, different students place different demands on student services. Some students are heavy users of all facilities, while some students use few or none of the services on offer. Clearly, this cross-subsidy is inefficient. The end result substantial overuse of many services, many of them subsidised out of students' pockets. This is the classical free rider problem in economics. Free market forces are the key to efficiency, greater welfare and a more sensible allocation of available resources to students. A user-pays system will always be more efficient in the long run and will be more beneficial to students, despite the protests of those who gain the most from a system which compulsorily acquires fees and allocates benefits. If a group of people wish to pool some sources to collectively partake of products and services then there should be no legislative proscription on this. Similarly, there should be no legislation which allows the compulsion of people to be such members. Historically the idea of a voluntary communal effort has worked quite well. Although largely forgotten, in the early 20th century friendly societies provided excellent service under this concept. People would of their own volition undertake to be a member of a friendly society, pay a fee and gain the benefits of communal products and services in certain areas. In Australia this was once well evidenced by friendly societies facilitating the delivery of medical and pharmaceutical services. They were the catalyst for networks of regional hospitals and friendly society pharmacies. The key difference is that it was voluntary. You opted to join; you had a choice. Importantly, only the people who derived value from such services were members. Those who did not wish to participate were never compelled to do so. That is very different from the situation with student unions today. I would like to address the issue of sport. It is an issue close to my own heart. All of my family have had a big involvement in university sport-intervarsity and so on. Voluntary student unionism should not be an is obstacle to playing sport. It should not be an obstacle to successful university games, successful intervarsity competitions or even Australia's gold medal haul at the Olympic Games. There are really two issues here: participation and resources. Does Kevan Gosper really believe that our budding Olympians will only participate in university sport if they are compelled to do so? Does he really believe that these people who are so motivated that they will go all the way to the pinnacle of their sport need to be compelled to join their union and that otherwise they will re- spend university life sitting on the lawns drinking a milkshake? Come on! That is the East German, Soviet style model of mass participation. On the issue of resources, we need to remember that at many universities the sporting grounds are provided by the university, not by the union. Moreover, most university sporting clubs compete in competitions against non-university clubs whose only revenue is the funds they raise themselves. The issue of child care is emotive. In my state of South Australia there are three university child-care centres. At the University of Adelaide over 58 per cent of all child-care places are used by staff. Only 16 per cent are used by students of the university. Why should the general student population subsidise child care for staff of the university? The Waite Campus Children's Centre on the Urrbrae campus of the University of Adelaide in my electorate is situated at a facility that is primarily research based. As such, only a very small group of undergraduate students has ever used child care at this ity. In 2003 the University of Adelaide embarked on a misadventure of allocating childcare places to be managed by the student union. They actually lost the government benefits for these places, which was a disaster for students and showed why unions should not politicise child care. Child care is an important issue. It should not be addressed through compulsory student unionism. We have allocated over $8 billion over the next four years for the child-care benefit and the Child Care Support Program. The government recognises child care as an important issue, and the suggestion that only university unions can have a real effect on the affordability, availability and quality of child care is preposterous. It is time to subject student unions to the same conditions under which individuals, small businesses and corporations in Australia have thrivedthe strongest force for efficiency and best practice that the world has ever known, the dual concepts of freedom and choice. (Time expired)",73
32,Ms GRIERSON,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I am extremely happy to oppose the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. I am even happier to do so, having heard the first three speakers on the government side, and I am very pleased that it will be opposed at every stage of its passage by the Labor caucus. I had no idea just how precious the people on the other side of the House are. I did not realise that they spent all of their university education time fighting battles in student politics and apparently losing. According to them, those past defeats have to be put right, and every university in the country is going to feel it. They just do not get it. Universities are not there just to turn out units of production facilfor the corporations they speak about so wisely. Universities are not there just to turn out Liberal politicians. Universities remain, and have to remain, the guardians of knowledge, the bastions of freedom of ideas and freedom of ideals. They have that purpose and they must retain it. This is just one piece of legislation in a suite of legislation that basically wants to diminish and undo the roles that universities have taken on, roles that Australians are rightly proud of. Our universities have been incubators of ideas and knowledge. We are not a huge country; we do not have great population size and we will never have market size or proximity to bigger markets. We have always had to compete on knowledge, on our cleverness, and unfortunately under the Howard government cleverness is something that is not nurtured. It is something the government want to diminish on all fronts, and I guess this bill is just another of those fronts. This bill seeks to prohibit higher education providers from requiring students to join associations or to pay fees on enrolment that do not relate directly to their courses. In other words, universities cannot assist student organisations to collect those compulsory fees so that they can provide important services and amenities. Interestingly, not surprisingly, if those universities breach this legislation in any way they will be fined to the tune of $100 per student. Just imagineand I am sure Lord Nelson imagines this all the time-if universities were to fail this ideological impost of his, the government would be able to rip out another $5 billion from university funding. That is some stick, but that is what is happening. This government's long standing ideological obsession with student organisations over the past 25 years is well known. It rests on some ability to say that this is another form of political unionism. Antiunionism is something, but it is also anti-intellectualism worse kind. It opposes freedom of ideas and freedom of expression of ideals that run counter to its rather limited set of ideals and ideas, which are, of course, user pays, survival of the fittest and move delivery of every government service to its private sector mates. This legislation is just another attempt to bully universities and students into this government's miserable agenda. It has an appalling record in higher education. This is now the fourth attempt by this government to ban automatic membership of student organisations, having had its legislation knocked back in 1999, 2001 and 2003. But it keeps trying. This latest move comes in the wake of the government winning a majority in the Senate to take effect after July this year. Here we have a government drunk on powerpretty drunk this week, I would have thought, if the corridors of power are any guide-determined to flex those unchecked muscles by bullying universities and students into submission. It is working on its hit list. It is payback time. Look out Australiastudents are first. This government tries to hide its dogged pursuit of student organisations under the guise of this wonderful word ‘choice'freedom of choice-arguing that universal membership of student organisations compromises freedom and civil liberties. It is an infringement, it says, of the freedom of association. Individual choice is an important part of democracy, but the whole plank of civilised society rests on a simple principle: individuals all contributing so that the whole may benefit. Democracy comes with responsibility for all. That is what student unionism implies. It says that you have a responsibility to help others. It is a pretty simple principle. Fortunately in Australia. I think it is one most Australians are proud of. But we have to move to a new way of of the thinking, apparently. The Liberal government's thinking is: survival of the richest. It is some sort of new approach to Darwinian processes. I reckon it would make a good PhD topic, actually. It was the survival of the fittest. Now it is the survival of the offspring of the most wealthy-a new selection process put in place by the Howard government. Silencing dissent is another goal. This legislation certainly is an attempt to silence student organisations, because they have been successful in highlighting the antistudent, antieducation and antiknowledge policies of the Howard government. Students dared to criticise the Howard government's massive HECS hikes. No wonder. I despair when I think of when my daughter will be able to get around to having children. She has to pay that HECS debt back. She has to work, as she did throughout her studies as well. This bill is political retribution against student organisations that have opposed decisions made by the Howard government to cut billions of dollars from university funding, to double the HECS fees over the past eight years, to allow increases up to a further 25 per cent, which 30 universities, I think, have taken on, and to allow the student to staff ratio to increase by more than 30 per cent. These policies have allowed universities to enrol students paying $100,000 and up to $200,000 in some universities while students with better marks miss out on places and to slug students with bigger HECS debts, adding to the $11 billion of already-owed HECS debts. But the obsession goes on. It has been going on for a quarter of a century, so I guess we have to see it through. Young Liberal students apparently could not get the numbers on campus, so they have asked their parliamentary mates now to force their will upon students. Current membership arrangements are not, as it is claimed by the Liberal Party, an infringement of the freedom of association. That has been tested by High Court cases and by the ACCC, but that is not good enough for the government. This legislation, they think, will achieve a great deal. Fortunately the Group of Eightthe AVCC-similarly noted their disappointment that the minister and the government have chosen to ignore their strong support for a compulsory service fee. They argued that to introduce this new legislation on the premise that these fees represent the last bastion of compulsory unionism is akin to using an elephant to squash an ant. Students fees fund much more than a small number of elected representatives. Penalising universities that seek to levy a compulsory fee for health services, for example, will be a watershed in the history of higher education and may forever change the sense of campus community that has a long and proud tradition in this country. I congratulate the universities. When they are under extreme pressure to deliver financial imperatives imposed by this government and to deliver an agenda that I know many of them find unpalatable they show some courage. I am pleased to say that those sentiments were endorsed recently by University of Newcastle Vice-Chancellor Professor Nick Saunders, who also stated on the public record that voluntary student unionism would result in a depletion of services and facilities for students on campus. Heaven help us at Newcastle University, because he knows our university cannot pick up the bill for those services. Most people, with the exception apparently of those sitting opposite, understand that student organisations make a valuable contribution to university life and provide vital services and support. Those services include child care, free employment services, advocacy and welfare services, free legal advice, health services, interest-free loans, subsidised catering and facilities and also services that help students stay at university and finish their degrees. But student associations do have a very important role, more so today because universities have changed under this government. We see higher student-staff ratios, more online courses, tutorials with over 100 students in them and lecturers being required to take on greater course loads and administrative duties, while still desperately trying to maintain their research presence and outcomes. Those things have had a big impact on universities. Student associations now take on more dispute resolution, conflict resolution, students who have to appeal against grades, failure of the university to perhaps recognise students' special needs, harassment cases and intimidation claims. Those are the sorts of things that student unions also provide. I am proud that one of my daughters was president of a student union. I know what hard work she did. I also know that the work was very challenging. For her to represent students to the university council and university senior staff was very difficult. But that work has to be done, and those are some of the important services that student associations provide. I have heard this government say, ‘Why should poorer students have to pay compulsory student fees?' I am really sick of the reverse classism that those opposite use. This paternal benevolence and patronisation of lower income families really gets my blood boiling. The Minister for Education, Science and Training says ‘Why should boilermakers pay for the sons and daughters of lawyers to go to university?' It is because they want their sons and daughters to go to university too. Get real! Our country has been built on each generation aiming higher and improving its outcomes through knowledge and training. I find the minister's comment offensive in every way. At the University of Newcastle there are many students who are the first in their family to go to university. It remains a university where the majority of students still come from families that have not had that experience. They need these services more. They rely very much on support from student organisations. It provides the orientation and support that these students-and, as the member for Boothby pointed out, the increasing number of overseas students who now attend universities-need. Let me say something about those overseas students: the University of Newcastle would love to have more international students, but the reality is that it is very hard international students. Many of them are also working. Some at the University of Newcastle are spending half of their day driving to and from Sydney to work and then trying to fit in their studies. It is a reality that it is harder for students in regional universities: the labour markets are thinner. Remember that over 50 per cent of students at universities like the University of Newcastle now are part-timers. Many are part-timers because they are out trying to work for a living and to pay their HECS fees. It is just an appalling situation. But student organisations do create the vibrant campus life that makes universities the interesting and exciting places they should be. Student organisations are also part of making a university degree a fulfilling experience and a more holistic one, which, I really believe, turns out better young Australians. So, sorry, Minister, your unrelenting attacks on student organisations do threaten to change so much more than ‘the price of a sausage roll'. But we are not surprised you continue to patronise the Australian people and trivialise universities. I have not seen any aromatherapy or belly dancing courses lately, but apparently the Minister for Education, Science and Training has. He gets around, that's for sure. That brings me to regional universities. Regional universities really do know that student unions are part of the whole fabric of our community. The services that they provide are important to strengthening our community. In particular, we have heard about sporting facilities. Newcastle University Sport, NUSport, for example, was recently awarded the Newcastle City Council's commitment to participation award for their contribution to sport in the whole Hunter region. I have taken representation from them that the delivery of their services to the university for and to the region will be seriously compromised if this legislation passes. I do not think this government has much idea of just how universities are woven into regional economies. One result of this legislation will be rather savage cuts to student sports organisations. Scholarships will be cut, subsidies to sporting clubs that promote fitness and participation certainly will be cut and some facilities will be closed forever. Let us be realistic: student facilities provided for universities do benefit the whole region, as regions do not then have to provide all of them. It is a shared responsibility, and it is one that has worked very well. The University of Newcastle is facing some financial problems. We are doing it tough. We have had $120 million in funding ripped out of our university since this government came to office, and we have had a period of direct assault on our university. The outcome, no matter what, is that 450 jobs will have to be shed. It is proposed that they be shed over one year. Why not do it over three years? We just do not have the money. It is time that the government took seriously the problems at the University of Newcastle and supported its call for some financial assistance that would allow it to phase in that restructure over three years and not over one year, thereby alleviating considerable pain to a regional economy. The University of Newcastle is not alone in its struggle to survive financially. RMIT and the University of Western Sydney are also posting deficits. Yes, it is hard to suddenly change the whole culture to respond to financial accounting standards. Deputy Speaker Baldwin knows that there are some rather major government departments struggling at the moment to reach acceptable financial accounting standards. But the root cause of our problems is definitely a fall in government funding. The federal government used to contribute 90 per cent of university revenues 25 years ago. Now it contributes only 40 per cent. Such savage cuts to funding and subsequent cuts to staff numbers have had an enormous impact on the University of Newcastle. At a community meeting in Newcastle last Saturday, 7 May, organised by students, it was resolved to put the following demands to the federal government: one, that the government does not pass voluntary student unionism legislation; two, that the government funding to tertiary public education be reinstated to the 1996 level so that excessive job and course cuts need not occur at the University of Newcastle; and, three, that the universpin-off sity's regional status be reinstated. We have got a problem with regional status. We are not allowed to have it; apparently we are not entitled to it. Wollongong is, and we are pleased for Wollongong, but we are also desperate in our region to make sure that those community based and regional programs that enable students to have a second chance and gain access to university will be funded. We actually have the highest number of second chance programs in the country. We provide more of those opportunity programs. We also provide courses from New England across to the coast, up to Port Macquarie and down to the Central Coast; but, no, we are not regional apparently. We have a proud history at the University of Newcastle, and it is one the House deserves to be reminded of. We are No. 9 on the research table. We are a university that has one of the best medical faculties in the country. We have some extremely wonderful and successful relationships with the community-Hunter Medical Research Institute; Newcastle Legal Centre; ResTech, a research and development partnership with Ampcontrol; Family Action Centre's Engaging Fathers program-and the university's Professor Graeme Jameson has now been made a laureate professor. He is one of the top 10 researchers in the world. We are a highachieving university and we are proud of our students and staff. We are proud of their achievements now and we want that to continue. That is why we oppose this legislation. At the heart of this is the real agenda of this government. This legislation is not just an attack on students and an attack on unionism or associations; it compounds the onslaught by this government on higher education. It is an onslaught that will be felt in my region very sorely with the loss of 450 jobs, with a of another 150 jobs. Five hundred jobs in a year? The university is going to be hit hard. Mr Deputy Speaker Baldwin, those people come from your electorate as well as my electorate. I ask you, on the record, to make sure that you ask the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education, Science and Training to look favourably on our regional economy, on our knowledge infrastructure and certainly on our university. This legislation is anti freedom of thought. It is an attack on ideas and ideals. It attempts to erase the dissenting voices of students, those critical minds and critical voices that we need. When I say critical they are critical of us here; they are critical of everyone and everything to some extent. That is part of the role of learning. Learning is about improving, understanding, testing and finding new ways. That is how the solutions to the problems of now and the problems of the future are found. I oppose this legislation.

33,Mr SECKER,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"What a very interesting speech we have just heard from the member for Newcastle. She has come up with an answer that I do not think any survey in the world's or in Australia's history has ever come up with: students are only studying part time because they have to work part time to pay off their HECS fees. For a start, they would not be earning enough working part time to pay off HECS fees, so it is an amazing claim to make in the first place. In actual fact, they are probably working part time to pay off their compulsory student union fees-not their HECS fees. What an amazing claim made by the member for Newcastle, who is not staying around to hear the object of ridicule. The member for Newcastle seems to think that this argument is about attacking unions, or even attacking student associations, when it is nothing of the sort. The whole basis of this legislation freedom of speech, freedom of action and freedom of association. The member for Newcastle, in her feeble rebuttal of these core rights, seems to think that students have a responsibility to compulsorily support each other, even if they cannot afford it. We know that many of them cannot afford those few hundred dollars that they need to pay for those compulsory student fees. I rise today to give my support to the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. In seeking to amend the Higher Education Support Act, the government is looking to afford university students the same rights that they enjoy outside the university environment inside the university environment. These amendments will ensure that from 2006 students in Australia are not forced to become members of a student association or to pay fees for nonacademic student services. Compulsory student unionism has been an issue of concern for the Liberal Party for some 25 years. The Labor Party will claim that this is just another bone for Liberal students and their supporters and that we are opposed to compulsory student unionism purely because of the word ‘union'. As I said before, it is not about unions or student associations; it is about compulsion. Just as we, on this side, do not like to see compulsory unionism out there in the normal work force, we do not like to see it inside universities either. History and common sense show this is not the case. The Liberal Party has been continually fighting for VSU-that is, voluntary student unionism-and will not stop fighting for it until we can guarantee students the freedoms enjoyed by the rest of Australian society. VSU first emerged as a policy of the Liberal government during Malcolm Fraser's time as Prime Minister. Although it was not put to the House, it planted the seed and we is have seen Liberals, Liberal students and the general student population across the nation lobbying for VSU ever since. Early in the first term of the Howard government, the coalition floated VSU legislation. It was hotly contested by the National Union of Students and the Labor Party, who were unable to see the benefits VSU would deliver to the student population. It was subsequently rejected by the upper house, to the dismay of many students and Liberals nationwide. We are back here in 2005 fighting for VSU because we believe students are capable of making decisions for themselves. We are not opposed to compulsory student unionism because of the word ‘union'; we are opposed to it because of the word ‘compulsory'. Compulsory unionism in the workplace is all but gone. With the workplace relations amendments before the House this week, the underhanded, devious compulsory unionism we have been witnessing through the charging of bargaining agents fees to non-union members will also be a thing of the past. I had the pleasure to speak on that in the House yesterday. However, apparently our higher education facilities-those institutions that house our future professionals, academics, tradespeople and leaders-believe that they should have the right to force free-thinking individuals to join a union. These institutions are where young Australians develop their moral, ethical and personal values systems. I ask: just what are we teaching them through compulsory student unionism? Those on the other side of the House will argue that we are trying to rid universities of unions, that we are trying to prevent students from having a voice at university. This could not be further from the truth. We have no problem with university unions. What we have a problem with is students being forced to join university unions. We want to give students a choice on whether or not they join a union. University unions as they presently operate do not represent the student body at large. Student elections generally have a dismal voting turnout, which means that the student council represents a very small percentage of the student population. Further to this, there is very little consultation with the studentsany action is usually the decision of the student council alone. In my opinion the lack of support shown for student elections is the student body speaking up. They are saying: ‘We don't care about the student union. We consider it irrelevant to our studies and we consider it irrelevant to our daily lives.' If majority of students feel like this-and we know they do; just look at how many vote in the student elections-why should they be forced to pay a fee for representation that they do not need, want or use? At the moment the policy of our higher education institutions can only be described as ‘no union fee, no education'. Currently Australian students are unable to enrol in their university course unless they pay a union fee of anything between $100 and $600. Enrolment is completely dependent on a student's ability to pay this fee. What choice do they have? Furthermore, if they do not pay this exorbitant fee, some universities block their students from accessing their results, from using the library and from graduating. A student can be 100 per cent dedicated to their studies and achieve excellent results, and yet the student union will stand in their path and say they are not eligible to graduate until they cough up their money. Perhaps I am a little too matter-of-fact about these things, but I would have assumed that if you have done the hard yards you deserve the reward at the end regardless of whether or not you choose, or in many cases are financially able, to pay excessive union fees. I had the same experience myself. When I went to university as a mature age student in 1990 to do my economics and politics degree, the first thing I found out was that if I did not pay the student union fee I would not be able to graduate, I would not get my results and therefore I would be wasting my time. Can anyone say how that is fair? I do not think anyone could possibly suggest to anyone that that is fair. The fact that I would not have had access to those results I think is just one of those crazy suggestions that have been put out there to enforce people to join their unions. The Labor Party's key argument for opposing the higher education support amend the ment bill 2005 is that it will cause vital student services, clubs and societies to fold, destroying vibrant university life. This is absolute rubbish. I would reason that if the services, clubs and societies in question are important to the student body then they will be supported and they will remain. What is wrong with the students paying their subs for these groups by choice, just as they would if they were members of any other group outside university? When I was at university I played cricket for my local team, for my local town. That is where I actually paid my subs. But I still had to support the university cricket team, even though there was no way that I was going to be playing for the university cricket team. So I was actually paying two lots of subs but playing for only one group. There are many students in that situation; and others do not have the time. When I went to university I did a full-time course in two days. I was there every minute of the day, basically, doing my studies. I did not have time to spend, even to join the Liberal club, believe it or not. I did not have time to spend at the bar, play sport or to take up all the other services. So I did not feel the need to actually pay for them. But if I had used them. I would have been quite happy to pay, just as anyone else does in normal life. If they require a service it will be supported either by those who choose to join student organisations or by those who pay for the service they require. Those organisations that do a decent job in representing students' interests will have student support. What these amendments will mean is that by 2006 student organisations will no longer be able to rely on union funding-they will have to function in the real world. What a better way to teach young people. They will need to attract members by offering students something they want, enjoy and need. Students will voluntarily support these organisations and they will thrive if they are doing their job. This change will benefit the students. As we saw in Western Australian universities, under VSU services became more focused on meeting student needs and less focused on meeting union needs. More importantly, perhaps, is the fact that at present there are many students at university who do not and cannot access the services offered by student unions, as in my own case. I know that when I was at university as a full-time and part-time student I did not have a minute in a day to spend enjoying the services provided by my hard-earned dollars. I, like so many other students, had many commitments outside the university. I was serving in local government, running my farm and trying to spend time with my family as well. So I did not have time to use those services, and I certainly was not an orphan in that regard. I have spoken to a lot of young people from my electorate of Barker, which is a rural and regional electorate. Almost without to fail, they have expressed their annoyance at being forced to pay union fees for services they cannot use. Some of these young people are doing it tough. In order to further their education and study at university they need to move to Adelaide or, in some instances, interstate. They have to pay for rent, they have to pay for food and they have to pay for all their other associated living expenses. To do this, many students need to work in part-time jobs or cut back to part-time university hours-although not, as the member for Newcastle suggested, to pay off their HECS fees, which they would not have earned enough to pay in the first place. Those who have full-time university contact hours have to rely on Youth Allowance or the support of their parents. When do these students get to use the services provided by their unions? They do not. But at South Australian based universities they are still expected to pay between $273 and $362 in student union fees. To a student on Youth Allowance living away from home, that is a lot of money. Unlike our taxation system, the amount you pay has absolutely nothing to do with the amount you earn or your ability to pay. The Labor Party is also running the line that VSU will mean the end of political activism. It should be obvious that compulsory funds are not all that is needed to make political activism possible. Where there are passionate, strong-minded people there will be activism. Just as political parties, community groups and lobbyists manage to carry out their political activities without compulsory funds, so too will university groups. However, VSU will give these university based groups a focus. It will cause them to focus more carefully on campus-specific issues-issues that are of far greater benefit to the student population as a whole than some of the issues being pushed by unions today. We are bringing in VSU through these amendments because it is clear that compulsory student unionism is a violation of students' rights to freedom of association. In the themselves. Workplace Relations Act 1996 the government gave expression to this freedom as a basic human right. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 will simply bring higher education into line with the rest of Australian society. There is absolutely no reason students should not be afforded this basic freedom. Not only is freedom of association a right upheld by this government; it is a part of accepted international law. Article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. No one may be compelled to belong to an association. That is really quite a simple statement, and gets straight to the heart of why we need to put an end to compulsory student unionism: compulsory student unionism is a violation of human rights. Apparently, though, students should not be given the freedom to associate as they choose. Apparently, the Labor Party does not think our students are capable of making their own decisions. I find this incredibly bizarre given that in the eyes of the law we consider them capable and responsible for their own actions. They have the right to vote in federal, state and local government elections, they make decisions every day in relation to their lives outside of higher education and they are able to raise and support families. Yet the Labor Party say that they do not know what is best for them. They say that student unions are best able to determine what is best for students. I say that is absolute rubbish. It has been proven time and time again by the decisions students make outside the university that students are more than capable of deciding what is best for However, I believe there is another reason the Labor Party so strongly supports compulsory student unionism, and it has to do with money and power. We are all aware that the National Union of Students, the peak body of student unions, openly admits to being a supporter, both financially and politically, of the Australian Labor Party. It is in the ALP's best interest to support causes put forward by their financiers, without so much as a second thought for those the causes will impact on. We see this in the ALP's relationship with trade unions. Services are important, but there are many things which are union funded that cannot be used by the average student. The Labor Party and the student unions are not telling us that these student union fees which are ‘only in it place to provide support and services to students' are the same fees that pay for the facilities, air travel and allowances of union officers. I am afraid I fail to see how that can be of benefit to the student population in general. It would seem that, if you are not a member of this exclusive little club, if you do not spend every waking hour at university or if you are a part-time or external student, you will benefit very little, if at all, from ting your hard-earned cash into your student union. We are putting this bill forward to ensure that universities can no longer charge students for these non-academic services, and the student population will thank us. Importantly, the amendments to the higher education bill also include mandatory penalties for breaching the government's VSU policy. As we can well appreciate, it is pointless for the government to put forward this bill for the benefit of students without including measures to ensure that the changes are upheld by higher education institutions. There is nothing ambiguous about the changes or the penalties that will come into effect in 2006. There is no reason that higher education providers will be unable to act in accordance with the new amendments and, as such, the consequences for non-compliance are not discretionary-providers will comply or they will be penalised. I am very proud of this government's commitment to freedom of association and the commitment of the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, to voluntary student unionism. These amendments will give students these basic rights within higher education institutions and will allow them to enjoy simple freedoms. I only hope the Labor Party can look past politics, power and money and do what is best for our students.",81
34,The SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Order! It being 2 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA Ms Vivian Alvarez",85
35,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question putis to the Prime Minister. Why couldn't the government find Ms Vivian Solon for two years, given she is still with the Catholic nuns she was handed over to on her second day in the Philippines after being deported? Does the Prime Minister agree with the statement of Father Mike Duffin, the Catholic missionary who found her, that ‘if the government says they don't know where she is, it's a bit hard to believe'?",85
36,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Clearly, the circumstances of this case, on the available information, appear very sad and it will be a matter of sorrow and regret that this lady, who appears to be an Australian citizen, has been deported. I can report that discussions are currently under way with the person in the Philippines, involving the Australian consulgeneral, and offers, if it is her wish, to return to Australia with government support have been made. In the meantime, as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has indicated, this matter has been  results of that inquiry, not only in relation to this issue but also in relation to Cornelia Rau, are available, the government will then consider what further steps should be taken in what appears on the face of it to be a very sad and unhappy circumstance. Budget 2005-06",85
37,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer advise the House how hard working Australian families will benefit from this budget? Are there any alternative proposals?,85
38,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Paterson for his questions and I can advise the House that hard working Australian families will benefit from this budget when income tax cuts are passed through this parliament. Income tax cuts are due to come into effect for every Australian income tax payer on 1 July 2005. Thresholds will be changed at the upper end; rates will be cut at the lower end. In order to get those income tax cuts in place by 1 July 2005, legislation has to pass the House of Representatives and the Senate to enable the Commissioner of Taxation to publish the schedule so that employers know how much to take out and know to take out less after 1 July 2005. I am asked whether there are any alternative proposals. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian Labor Party are going to vote against these income tax cuts. If they are able to vote against these income tax cuts, they have the capacity to delay an income tax cut to every Australian taxpayer. I am very confident that, when the new Senate assembles after 1 July, the new Senate will pass this law. They will not defeat this income tax cut. What they are able, at most, to do is to delay this income tax If you ever wanted any evidence at all that Labor stands for higher taxes, you are getting it from the Leader of the Opposition now. I am pleased to see that not everybody in the Labor Party supports the Leader of the Opposition in his tactic of opposing income tax cuts. According to the Australian Financial Review today, one member of the Labor Party described this tactic as insane. According to the article ‘Labor divided over tax cuts' in today's Australian, one long-serving Labor MP has said, ‘We've blown our brains out.' Mr Laurie Ferguson was interviewed on the way into the parliament today and was asked these questions: JOURNALIST: Should Kim Beazley be opposing the Government's proposed tax cuts …? LAURIE FERGUSON: I think Kim and Wayne Swan will be handling that. JOURNALIST: What do you think though? LAURIE FERGUSON: They will be handling it ... JOURNALIST: Do you think you are setting yourself up for a political death? LAURIE FERGUSON: I think they are handling it ... They are handling it. That is precisely the problem: they are handling it. The income tax cuts have been supported by Geoff Gallop, the Premier of Western Australia, who in fact said that these cuts could only be introduced because of the good work of the Western Australian people. They have been welcomed by Kevin Foley, the Labor Treasurer of South Australia. According to the ABC radio in the Northern Territory, Clare Martin has told Labor's two Northern Territory members not to oppose the cuts. ‘That is the federal budget, and I would not be opposing tax cuts,' Clare Martin said. If the two Labor members from the Territory do not oppose the tax cuts that bill cut. can go through the Senate, Australians can have the tax cuts that they deserve and they ought to be delivered on 1 July. Mental Health Services: Detention Centres",86
39,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that nine expert mental health groups, including the Royal Australian and New Zealand colleges of psychiatrists and general practitioners, have today issued a plea for the government to establish an independent mental health panel to assess and monitor the mental health care provided at all detention centres? Is the Prime Minister aware that Labor has called for mental health services in detention centres to be provided by independent professional practitioners for more than three years? Will the Prime Minister now act on this expert advice and finally implement Labor's plan?",86
40,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I understand and respect the comments that are made by mental health experts. We always take them very carefully into account. I have indicated, in relation to both the Cornelia Rau incident and the latest case that was the subject of the first question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, that we first must establish the facts of what occurred. When we have the results of that inquiry the government will then be in a position to decide whether further examinations, further inquiries or further investigations are needed. I can assure the House that the government take these issues very seriously and we are as concerned as other Australians are to ensure that, first of all, we get to the tom of what exactly happened in both cases. Then we will be in a more soundly based position to take decisions on action for the future. Employment",87
41,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer outline to the House the results of the April labour force survey? What do these figures indicate about the strength of the Australian economy?,87
42,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Bass for his question. The monthly labour force figures for April were released today and they showed that employment increased by 6,900 people in April. More importantly, they showed that the number of full-time jobs in April increased by 39,100 and that was offset by a decrease in part-time positions of 32,200. The consequence is that the unemployment rate remains at the lowest level in 28 years, at 5.1 per cent. More than that, this is the 21st consecutive month that unemployment has been below six per cent and the fifth consecutive month that it has been at 5.1 per cent. More important than that, the participation ratethat is, the participation in the work forceis at the highest level on record, at 64.5 per cent. Since this government was elected in March 1996, 1.6 million new jobs have been created in Australia. There are more Australians in work than ever before. The participation rate is the highest recorded. Now is the time to reform the welfare system to encourage more people into the work force. People never had a better chance of getting a job in the last 28 years than they had in the month of April in 2005. This indicates that the Australian economy continues to grow. There are still further reforms that have to be put in place to improve its capacity. But I think all botAustralians today will welcome the fact that job creation has been strong and unemployment low in the month of April. Immigration",87
43,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister concur with the comment made by his Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in Senate question time: ‘The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs does an excellent job'? Does the Prime Minister believe that deporting a mentally ill Australian citizen, engaging in a two-year cover-up of this and then failing to find the deported citizen should be described as ‘an excellent job'? Will the Prime Minister now concede that a royal commission must be called?",87
44,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to the government's response to this matter, I can only repeat what I said in the answers I gave to the honourable gentleman's first two questions. As to what the minister said, I would like to see the context of her remarks before responding explicitly to the question of the Leader of the Opposition, except to say this: generally speaking, the department, as all departments do, works very hard for the elected government of the day. As to the particular circumstances of this case and the Rau case, I refer the honourable gentleman to the answer I gave to his first two questions. Budget 2005-06",87
45,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the Deputy Prime Minister advise the House of the benefits for regional and rural Australians of reforms introduced by this government? Are there any alternative approaches?,88
46,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. There is no doubt that the seven million Australians who do not live in the major centres of the country, those who live in regional Australia, benefit from the government's tax reforms, presumed only, of course, that they are passed. They will give real cash-in-hand benefits to people in regional Australia and that will benefit average everyday workers in regional Australia-farm labourers, carpenters and electricians. I can provide an example-a butcher from the electorate of Groom. He has been in contact with my office. This butcher is not a wealthy Australian and he does not purport to be. He has a wife and two young kids and he works 40 hours during the week at a normal rate of $22 an hour, for a package of about $45,000 a year. But he is trying to get ahead and he has been doing a bit of overtime on Saturdays. He noted that he is basically on 30c in the dollar now, which is a lot better than what he was on under Labor, when he was paying 43c in the dollar on the old scales back in 1999. He also goes on to say, ‘I hear all this talk about the proposed changes only being worth $6 a week to me.' He says: ‘They're not; they're worth $31 a week to me. They are really worth having. They will make a difference and I would very much like to have those tax cuts.' I suspect that story is being told all over regional Australia as people shake their heads in absolute and total disbelief and, I would think, total bewilderment at the proposal by those opposite to oppose these measures. Indeed, I think country people everywhere will be wondering whether there is anything that is good for regional Australians that the Labor Party are actually prepared to support. Is there anything at all? They oppose not only the tax cuts; they oppose Roads to Recovery, they oppose Regional Partnerships and they oppose Sustainable Regions. They oppose everything. There is a very interesting question that must be asked of some particular members in will this place. There are not many regional members in the federal parliament from the Australian Labor Party. But there are some: the member for Capricornia, the member for Hunter, the member for Richmond, the member for Ballarat and the member for Lingiari. The questions that have to be asked are: will they all be in here tonight, which way will they vote and will they then go home and explain to their constituents that they opposed tax cuts for workers in regional Australia? In particular, it has to be asked whether the member for Lingiari will personally explain to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Clare Martin, why he opposed her recommendation that they get on with the job and pass the tax cuts. Budget 2005-06",88
47,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and it concerns his 16th budget. Can the Prime Minister confirm that for a family with a $200,000 mortgage the latest rise in interest rates will cost an additional $32 a month, $8 a month more than the tax cut your 16th budget gives to average-income earners?",88
48,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can certainly confirm to the Leader of the Opposition that the family he referred to is more than $500 a month better off as a result of the lower interest rates under this government. I am very happy to confirm that. I can also confirm that that particular family will be better off as a result of the tax cuts that the Leader of the Opposition is trying to block. I am not surprised, at this question time, by the sombre demeanour of those who sit behind the Leader of the Opposition-they are more attentive than usual to their electorate correspondence during question time-or by the restrained enthusiasm they have demonstrated as the Leader of the Opposition has asked his question. I think that one of the more amusing press statements on the budget was one that came out this morning from my friend the prospective leader of the Australian Labor Party, Mr Bill Shorten. He endorsed our policy in black-and-white when he said: The top marginal income tax rate thresholds should be raised to create a competitive tax system. He put out a statement yesterday saying that the AWU rejects the Prime Minister's budget claims. That is a pretty extraordinary example. All I can conclude is that on the subject of taxation relief, given what Mr Shorten said, he has already as a prospective leader of the Labor Party learnt something from the current leader of the Labor Party, and that is the capacity to walk both sides of the street on the one issue. Economy  is to the Minister for Trade. Would the minister inform the House of action the government is taking to further the international competitiveness of the Australian economy? How does this help Australia's exporters?",89
49,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Forrest for his question. Coming from Western Australia, he knows how important it is to have a very strong domestic economy as a platform for Australia's exporters. To make the most of global market opportunities we have to work off a strong economic base in Australia, and that has been the absolute focus of our government since 1996. In this year's budget we continued our commitment to strong, sustainable growth that provides further opportunities for Australia's exporters to benefit from a strong economy. It is a budget that delivers an $8.9 billion surplus; it forecasts three per cent growth in the GDP; it forecasts a seven per cent increase in export volumes-not values, but volumes; and it also delivers about $1.8 billion worth of tax relief to enhance the competitiveness of Australian businesses-in particular, Australian export businesses-including the abolition of the three per cent concessional tariff on imported business inputs. The budget also delivers $21.7 billion worth of personal income tax cuts to help create a more competitive fair, productive and work force. These reforms build on previous reforms that we have introduced. We need to recall the tax reform package that also delivered a $3½ billion tax benefit to exports. You would recall, Mr Speaker, that in the tax reform package we took $3½ billion worth of embedded wholesale sales tax burden off the back of our exports. You would also recall that back then those measures were opposed all the way by the Labor Party and by the Leader of the Opposition in his previous incarnation. Ultimately they were passed and, of course, we know the results have been significantly beneficial to Australia's export industries. We get a sense of deja vu this week. This government is proposing significant tax cuts to improve the competitiveness of Australia and, again, they are being opposed by the Leader of the Opposition in his latest incarnation. He will never learn. We have continued to prove the benefits of a strong economy for Australia's exporters-a strong, competitive and efficient economic base to compete in the global marketplace. This budget is all about taking that further and doing more. But, shamefully, the Leader of the Opposition is going to continue to oppose these measures, as he has done for years and years and years. I believe we will ultimately win this debate. The Australian people want these tax cuts delivered. There are many members of the Labor Party backbench who also want them. There was an article in the Daily Telegraph headed ‘Kamikaze Kim: Labor blocks cuts'. There was an article in the Australian in which there was a comment from a Labor Party MP who is obviously a former union official. The article states: One critic of the decision said Labor was likely to cop a backlash from middle Australia. “I was a union official for many years,” the MP said. “You don't knock back a pay rise.” I think the millions of Australian workers who want this pay rise would agree with him and would want the opposition to support the government in delivering these tax cuts.",89
50,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Why does the government,90
51,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,90
52,Mr SWAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I want the organ grinder. Why does the government oppose an increase in the minimum wage from $12 to $13 an hour for an employee on $24,000 a year while at the same time supporting a tax cut of $65 a week for an employee on $120,000 a year?",90
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am delighted that the member for Lilley has asked me a question about real wage increases. It gives me an opportunity to compare the performance of the Australian Labor Party when it was in office with the performance of this government. I will come back to the minimum wage case in a moment. The record will show that, in the 13 years of Labor government, real wages in this country rose by 2.9 per cent. That same record will show that in the nine years of the coalition government real wages have risen in this country by no less than 14 per cent. When I opened the successful campaign for the election of the member for Greenway in the last federal election, I had the great pleasure to say that the proudest boast I could make to the people of Western Sydney was that under this government we had delivered lower unemployment, lower taxation and lower interest rates but higher real wages. That is the record of this government. As to minimum wage cases, the member for Lilley will, I am sure, be aware that the government has always argued a fair and reasonable position at minimum wage cases. We have never taken the view that there is never a case for some increase in the minimum wage. What matters to Australian workers is what they actually get, and what Wages they have got under this government is manifestly more generous than what they ever got under you. Budget 2005-06",90
54,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister advise the House of measures in the budget which improve the health of Indigenous Australians?,90
55,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Pearce for her question. She has shown a long-term commitment to Indigenous health. I can take this opportunity to reassure her and all members of the House that overall this has been a good budget for health, with 98 separate measures and $3.3 billion worth of additional spending over the forward estimates period. Importantly, there is $170 million more for Indigenous health. That is important and necessary because, quite tragically, Indigenous people have a life expectancy some 20 years below that of the wider Australian community. In particular, there is $40 million more the Primary Health Care Access Program. That should mean four new clinics in Indigenous communities and an additional 50 health care workers, doctors and nurses. There is an additional $102 million for the Healthy for Life program. That should mean an additional 200 health professionals in Indigenous health clinics around the country, particularly targeting child and maternal health and chronic disease management. And there is $9 million to supply unsniffable petrol to an additional 23 Indigenous communities. Overall, Indigenous-specific health spending will be 21 per cent more next year than this year. Indigenous-specific health spending is up. Since 1996, it has more than doubled in real terms. I should take this chance to mention that Indigenous health has been a particular interest of the retiring president of the AMA, Dr Bill Glasson. I want to express in this place my appreciation of the leadership that he has shown over the last two years.",90
56,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Prime Minister. Why since 1996 has the government opposed, in total, minimum wage increases of $44 a week or $2,300 a year for an employee on $24,000 when it now proposes a tax cut of $65 a week, over $4,000 a year, for an employee on $120,000 a year?",91
57,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The national wage case positions that have been taken by the government have been based on its assessment of what is good for the economy and good for the employees of this country. Even for the member for Perth, the evidence is on display today: the lowest unemployment rate in 28 years. How can any Labor spokesman on workplace relations have the hide to ask questions on things like that when, under this for government, not only has unemployment fallen but real wages have risen? This government, the Howard government, is not only the best friend that Medicare has ever had; the Howard government is the best friend that the workers of Australia have ever had. We have delivered. We have delivered jobs to Australian workers. We have delivered tax cuts to Australian workers, and we want to deliver more, but you are trying to stop us. We have delivered lower interest rates to Australian workers. We have delivered a future to Australian workers that was never even dreamed of under the former Labor government. We will continue to take approaches to the management of the national economy that are designed to promote fair outcomes for lowand middle-income earners. I refer the member for Perth to the recent research of NATSEM which showed that, under the tax and payments policies of this government, the bottom 60 per cent of Australian families have been left in a much betWages ter position. When you compare every group, you find that they were better off under the policies of this government than they had been under the policies of the former government. Of all the things this government has achieved, there is nothing I am more proud of than the fact that the average worker has been looked after. The average Australian worker is better off. That is why those workers voted in their thousands against the Australian Labor Party at the last election. It will always be the commitment of this government that we look after the interests of the working men and women of Australia. Budget 2005-06",91
58,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House how Australia's national security is being strengthened by measures in the 2005-06 budget?,92
59,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Herbert for the question and for the interest he has in security measures. I note that for his constituents in Townsville this is a particularly significant issue. This budget is yet another example of the determination of the government to continue to enhance the security of our nation and of the Australian people. We have provided over $67 million over four years to develop biometrics for border control, to provide Australians with highly secure and reliable passports. Australian passports will be leaders in the world. We have provided nearly $100 million over four years for security enhancement to our embassies, bringing our total commitment across all agencies for that particular purpose since 2002 to around $1 billion. Obviously, the government places the highest priority on the safety of the thousands of Australian and foreign visitors to our missions abroad, as well as the safety of the people who work in those missions. Indeed, the security measures we had put in place at the Jakarta embassy saved many lives in September last year, when that embassy was bombed. We are also providing in the budget a further $22 million over four years to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS, to boost the collection of intelligence on the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and also to ensure that Australia can play a significant part in the strategy of our allies and our friends, particularly in the region, to encourage joint action against international proliferation activities. We have also provided $9 million over four years to ASIS as part of an additional package of $40 million to a range of agencies-which will be coordinated by my department-to boost regional cooperation in the fight against terrorism. I note that since 1995-96 this government has increased expenditure on the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and lifted it up to be an organisation we can be proud of, representing and promoting the interests of Australia. We have increased spending by 130 per cent in real terms. We do take its work very seriously. It is worth noting that, since financial year 2001-02, the government has committed over $5.5 billion to national security issues. This budget should remind Australians that this is a government that is determined to take the fight to its enemies. Budget 2005-06",92
60,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister explain how it is fair that Australians who go onto the sole parent benefit after 1 July 2006 will immediately suffer an income drop of a massive $44 a fortnight when their child turns six, even when they are trying as hard as possible to find a job? Prime Minister, is it not true that from July next year sole parents who are doing absolutely everything they can to find a job still automatically lose $22 a week as their child's sixth birthday present?",92

64,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Small things amuse small minds, Mr SPEAKER - very much so. At least the member for Sydney has asked a question which is relevant to a reform in the budget, and I am very grateful that she has. provides me with an opportunity to explain the rationale of the changes. We believe that it is better to be in work than on welfare. We believe that we should provide encouragement and incentive for people to transfer from welfare to work and we believe that the way our program has been structured it will achieve that goal. The calculations are that more than 180,000 people will find employment over the forward estimates period as a result of these measures. We believe that the $2 billion which the government is investing over the forward estimates period to provide training and assistance for people to move from welfare into work and to assist people who might otherwise have been on the disability support pension is a very good investment not only in the future of the economy but in the futures of the people involved. There is no future in a welfare policy which provides incentives for people to remain on welfare rather than to go into the work force. That is the rationale of the policy and I think it is a policy that has been widely supported by the Australian community. NA",93

66,Mr KEENAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Can the Attorney advise the House of the governIt ment's commitment to bring about generational changes to the family law system? Can the Attorney also outline measures contained in the budget to assist families with relationship difficulties before and after separation?,93
67,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting Ms Gillard-You're the man to know about generational change!,93
68,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I also know about the value of experience. I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I know that, as a new member, he has a very real interest in the plight of Australian families. He seems to be more aware than members opposite of the very significant investment in the family law system contained in the budget-almost $400 million committed over four years. It will create a new system, a new culture; it will help hundreds of thousands of families through relationship difficulties. It is comprehensive and it is targeted at every stage of relationships: pre-marriage, with counselling and educational services; early intervention, with over 100 services to keep families together by helping them to resolve difficulties before they become insurmountable; and immediately after separation, with $188 million in family relationship centres to help separating families before conflict becomes entrenched. For when contact arrangements break down, it quadruples contact orders-programs to help separated parents where conflict is entrenched. There are also 30 new children's contact servicessafe houses for handing over children The important changes that are contained here will also help people resolve their disputes before having to involve the courts of Australia. It is an area in which there is too much litigation and not enough mediation. We want to change the culture of family separations. We want to stop people fighting in the courtrooms instead of sitting down and working these issues through. The major initiative here is the network of 65 new and innovative family relationship centres, which will be the front door to the new family law system. It has associated with it a number of other significant benefits: an outreach program for servicing rural families, some for the first time; a national family telephone advice line; and family resource centres will be established, not only in capital cities but also in major regional centres. These measures have been very warmly welcomed. The major organisations involved in dealing with family relationshipsCatholic Welfare Australia, Family Services Australia and Relationships Australiayesterday put out a statement congratulating the government on its commitment to supporting family relationships. I want to quote people from two of those organisations. Frank Quinlan, Executive Director of Catholic Welfare Australia, said: We support a less adversarial Family Law System and the Family Relationships Centres proposal seems to go a long way towards meeting this aim whilst ensuring the children involved are protected. Children's welfare must be paramount Sarah Lees, National Manager of Family Services Australia, said: This is the outcome we have been looking for. For years the industry has been speaking as one voice, the voice of the child and of the family. This budget is an indication that we have been listened to and Australian families have been listened to ... Budget 2005-06",93
69,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister explain how it is fair that disabled Australians who apply for government assistance after 1 July next year may receive $77 less per fortnight than people with the same disabilities who are already receiving benefits? Prime Minister, isn't it true that, after July next year, a person who has a terrible accident and is confined to a wheelchair may receive $77 less than a person withMrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 100 and to the fact that the member opposite is trying to draw a hypothetical, which makes the question quite out of order.",94
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Sydney will get to her question.,94
71,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, isn't it true that after July next year a person who has a terrible accident and is confined to a wheelchair may receive $77 less than a person with equivalent disabilities, even when they are trying their hardest to find someone who is prepared to employ them?",94
72,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Sydney has completely misrepresented the government's policies. Anybody who is unable to work will continue to receive the disability support pension. The implication in the honourable member's question is wrong. The second observation I would make is that I think there is wide community support for a ... policy that endeavours to ensure that people who are, in any common understanding of the term, unable to work, continue to receive in full the disability support pension. That is our policy. But for those who are able to do part-time work it is not unreasonable, on an entirely prospective basis-and that is the policy-to adopt a different approach in relation to those people. That is the common understanding of the policy. That, in plain language, is what the policy means. I think it is a policy that not only is good for the community but, more importantly, is good for the people concerned. Budget 2005-06",94
73,Mr WOOD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education. Would the minister inform the House of how initiatives in the budget will address the nation's training and skills needs?,95
74,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for La Trobe. We are glad he is here; he is a very strong member for that wonderful part of the eastern outskirts of Melbourne. I have been out there. I have seen how effectively he is working with his local community, and we want him to keep it up too. Well done to you. The budget, he will be pleased to know, delivers all of the government's election commitments extremely well. In fact, $1.4 billion in new initiatives will provide for skills needs. It is the biggest ever commitment to the vocational and technical education sector by any government. In total the Howard government's 10th budget delivers $10.1 billion over the next four years. The government is offering more than $4.9 billion to the state governments of Australia, provided they are effective in the use of their funding for the institutes of TAFE and, of course, private training providers. We want to see a change to the system. We have another 116,400 places on offer at the moment and we want to make certain it is no longer simply the doctors and lawyers of Australia that can travel from one state to another and practise their professions. We would actually like to see the plumbers and the electricians being able to do the same thing. It is ridiculous: if you are a hairdresser trained in Queensland today, you are not allowed to cut hair in New South Wales. Can you believe that? It has only been in recent months that a hairdresser trained in Victoria has been able to cut hair in New South Wales, provided they are over the age of 21. Can you believe that?",95
75,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I don't have to worry about that. It doesn't bother me, mate!",95
76,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No Victorian hairdressers are touching the Prime Minister's head, but these are the sorts of things which are real in Australia today. Three hundred and fifty-one million dollars over the next five years will establish 24 Australian technical colleges. Mr Albanese-Where are they?",95
77,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are in areas with skills needs all around Australia. You know what, the member for Grayndler reminds me that the Labor Party offered zero dollars over zero years for the same sort of approach. Five hundred and twenty-six million dollars over four years will extend the entitlement to youth allowance, Austudy and Abstudy for new apprentices. An extra 31,500 pre-vocational and training places will be provided over the next four years. After 1 July, $120 million will be provided for $800 toolkits for use by apprentices on the successful completion of the first few months of an apprenticeship. It will then belong to the new apprentice after 12 months. One hundred and six million dollars will be provided for scholarships via two $500 payments for new apprentices who complete the first and second year of a new apprenticeship in a trade within the area of skills needs in a the small or medium business. These are real commitments and real dollars-a record commitment by this government to the important area of Australia's skills needs. Budget 2005-06",95
78,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, given your 16th budget is designed to put 190,000 welfare recipients into the work force, why has the government only promised 84,000 child-care places?",95

What does the Prime Minister expect the kids who cannot get an after-school place to do? Is he happy he is creating a new generation of latchkey kids?",96
82,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will ignore the last part of the question.,96
83,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would have thought it was self-evident that, if you expect-and it is a projection made by the Treasury-some 180,000 to enter the work force over a period of time, not all of those people would have children in need of child care. Many of them would have children who do not need child care. Quite a number of them would not have children. The calculation has been made on that common sense basis. Budget 2005-06 Miss JACKIE KELLY (2.48 pm)-My question is addressed to the Minister for Workforce Participation. Would the minister inform the House of how the additional services announced in the budget will help Australians find work?",96
84,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. She is somebody who, like most members in this parliament, is keen to see people who are of working age and who have a work capacity get back into work. This government knows that people who are coming off welfare and into work and who do have a work capacity lead much better and more fulfilling lives, not just for them but for their parents. It is part of the reason, of course, that in this country we have an unemployment rate at a 27-year low. The Howard government is investing almost $400 million in helping parents back into the work force, which includes 137,000 employment preparation places. We are helping people through the Job Network system by providing training and support to those who most need it. In the budget this week, this government announced that people with disabilities will be the beneficiaries of an investment of $555 million to help them get back into the work force, with over 100,000 places in employment services for job seekers with disabilities, including over 20,000 places for disability open employment services. Places for vocational rehabilitation required by those people will be delivered by this government. The very long-term unemployed are also beneficiaries of this government's program, with over $360 million provided to help the long-term unemployed back into work. As the Prime Minister said earlier in question time, this government is a great friend of those people who are looking for work, and will provide them with the opportunities. Budget 2005-06",96
85,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My next question is again to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister explain why his 16th budget provides only 202,670 training and employment support places when there are 1.3 million Australians on disability support pension and parenting payment? Why is there only one Job Network place for every seven parenting payment recipients? Why do 600,000 parents have to fight with 65,000 mature age unemployed for only 12,300 vocational training places? Mr Dutton-That's a lie!",96

88,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, given the severe shortage of training places provided, isn't your 16th budget really about moving people from welfare to welfare, not welfare to work?",97
89,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Could I say, with all due respect to the member for Sydney, that she and other members of the opposition should try and make up their minds regarding the government's decision, to use the parlance, to grandfather existing disability support pension beneficiaries. There are some 700,000 of those. They are not required to meet the obligations, or they will not be subject to the same test. Self-evidently, therefore, a comparison of the total number of people receiving benefits and pensions with the total number of training places made available represents a total misunderstanding-deliberately I suspect-of the government's policy. On the one hand, the opposition are saying that there is something wrong. They said it on the night the Treasurer brought down the budget. They said it then that something was wrong and unfairMr Costello-It wasn't reformist enough.",97
90,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My colleague reminds me that it was not reformist enough. In other words, what they were implying for that audience, the financial community audience, on budget night was that they were not being tough enough: they should apply this new regime to those still on the disability support pension. But now they are running a different line. They are up here trying to say, ‘This over here doesn't equal that over there.' Obviously, this over here does not meet that over there. This over here is not meant to meet that over there because they are two entirely different cohorts. I just say again that, if you are on the dismentia. ability support pension, you are not affected by the new rules. Self-evidently, it will take many years for those coming onto the disability support pension or applying for it for the first time to reach the stock of those who are already on it. Can I say to the member for Sydney that she should go back and carefully read the Treasurer's announcement. Budget 2005-06",97
91,Mr BAIRD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Ageing. Would the minister advise the House of the support the government is providing for senior Australians in the 2005 budget?,97
92,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cook for his question and note his interest in these matters. The Australian government recognises that, with the ageing of the population, there will be an increasing demand for health and aged care services, which is why the Australian government has more than doubled funding for health and aged care. In aged care there has been a 140 per cent increase since 1996. Along with the measures announced by the Treasurer in the area of health, $3.3 billion worth of initiatives, senior Australians will welcome the extra funding in aged care. Building on the $2.2 billion package delivered last year, the single largest investment in aged care by any government at any time, this budget delivers a further $528 million in specific aged care services. We all know that the prevalence of dementia will increase as the population ages. This government is delivering a further $320 million in funding on top of the $2.6 billion that we already invest to ensure that people who are living with dementia, their carers and their families can receive appropriate support by way of earlier diagnosis, more training and education for aged care workers and more places for people living with deIn this budget we have also increased funding for carers. These people carry out the very demanding role of caring for older Australians. On top of the $100 million we already invest in carers support, a further $208 million in support for carers is contained in this budget. This will enable people who are employed to place their loved ones with day centres that will have longer hours. There will be more weekend respite and more overnight respite. This budget also includes funding for up to 1,700 nurses who will be focusing on aged care over the next four years. But the budget is not just about health and aged care. There is also financial support for seniors with initiatives in the Medicare levy threshold and the senior Australian tax offset threshold, in relation to the seniors concession allowance and the seniors utilities allowance. Because of the strong financial management of the Australian economy, this government can deliver real outcomes, real services and real support for older Australians.",97

103,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Sydney proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The unfair welfare changes contained in the 2005 Budget which make life harder for the neediest Australians, and which fail to tackle the need for real welfare reform. I call upon those members who approve of I the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",98
104,Ms PLIBERSEK,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I arrived at work today to find this letter from Nancy in my email: I am writing regarding Peter Costello's budget delivered last night. Once upon a time, being a mother and raising young children to be good and proud adults was considered a worthwhile job, and a job worth doing. It seems today that being a mum is a dirty word. I have 3 children, 2 in high school and a toddler. I now have to consider the option of putting her in child care and leave the family home to work out side. Why are women not given the choice. I believe that women who do work out side the home have every right to do so, but I also think that we should be given the choice of what is right for our families. When we went back for our 3rd child, it was under the agreement that I would be there for her, during the day, before school and after school (when the time comes, as I was for my other children) She is now not going to have that option, because being a mum is no longer good enough. I would hope that the Labor party will condemn this budget and support mothers (single or other wise) to have the options and choices that they rightly deserve. Doesn't that say it all? Since when has ‘mother' become a dirty word? This government talks about choice for mothers and choice for parents, and in this budget it shows that has always been empty rhetoric. When it comes to tax cuts, we know who is going to benefit most once again from this budget. No wonder the backbench of the Liberal Party were cheering on Tuesday night: they are going to do very well out of this. Unfortunately, their constituents are not going to do so well. How can a budget that delivers 45 per cent of tax cuts to the top 10 per cent of earners be considered fair? There is no fairness in this budget: there is no fairness when it comes to the tax cuts and there is no fairness when it comes to welfare reform. How can a budget that delivers a $2½ billion superannuation surcharge tax cut to people earning over $100,000 a year be considered a fair budget when so few people are paying the superannuation surcharge? When we look more closely at the welfare reform measures, we see there are two great unfairnesses. The first is that there is for the first time a two-tier system for parents on parenting payment and a two-tier system for people on disability support pension. How can it be right that two different people with the same disability or with the same caring responsibilities receive two different payments, depending on when they went onto benefits? The unfair changes contained in the 2005 budget make life harder for the neediest Australians and they fail to deliver on the real need for welfare reform. For months the government has been trumpeting its plans for welfare reform. The centrepiece of this budget was supposed to be about moving people from welfare to work. Those of us who are concerned about the poorest Australians were watching very carefully, hoping, in a triumph of optimism over experience, that this government would invest in the child care that these parents needed and in the training that these parents needed and help them find work. What a sad disappointment it has been. What a huge letdown. What a tragic waste. What a wasted opportunity this budget is. When it comes to tax cuts, with $22 billion to spend, it is mindboggling that the tax cuts for the lowest paid Australians are so low. The government says that it believes in the rights of all mothers to stay at home and look after their kids, but this budget makes it clear that it is only married mothers who are allowed to stay home and look after their kids. Why is a woman who stays at home and looks after her children called a homemaker? She is employed in domestic duties. She is rewarded with family tax benefit part B because this government says that it believes in choice for stay-at-home mums. But if her husband dies or leaves, suddenly that changes. If she is doing the work of two parents because her husband has died or left her or is violent and has driven her and the kids from home, then suddenly she is a bludger. The government's rhetoric about women is: ‘It's great to be a homemaker and we'll give you tax cuts to stay at home. What's more, we'll make child care so expensive and so hard to find that it's not worth your while working.' But if the father of your children leaves or dies or you cannot live with him and you cannot find work overnight, then suddenly you are a bludger. The Prime Minister pretends that he values the work of ing children, but this budget shows that he does not. The Treasurer is out there encouraging us to have more children, but if women do their bit for our declining population and then end up alone they get treated like shirkers and bludgers. Labor believes-and this government used to say it did-that the most important job of any parent, partnered or not, is looking after their child. Some parents choose to combine this with working outside the home; some do not. Many would dearly love to but cannot. When I grew up, my mum was there every day after school with a snack and a question about how my day had been and what had I learnt at school. I choose to work and I cannot offer that lovely experience to my children. But for this government to tell mothers that they are not allowed to make that choice because they have no man to support them beggars belief. It would be nice if single parents had more choices. It would be great if they could simply choose to engage in fulfilling part-time work between 9.30 am and 2.30 pm and then run home to pick up the kids from school. But where are the jobs for these people? The Howard government has done nothing to increase the number of permanent part-time jobs. New jobs are mostly casual, meaning parents cannot plan child care. They cannot knock back shifts either. Who is going to care for the kids at irregular intervals and short notice? Casual jobs are insecure. How can parents who have a responsibility to put food on the table week after week be expected to give up social security benefits and start paying for child care, transport and all the other work expenses for a job they could lose tomorrow? The government has not supported a claim before the Industrial Relations Commission for the lowest paid casual workers who have been with an employer for more than a year raisto request permanent part-time work. With permanent part-time work these parents could plan their child care. They would know how much was going to be in the pay packet at the end of the fortnight. It would make it possible for those parents to combine work and family responsibilities, but does this government support that? No way. It is not interested in helping; it is just interested in punishing. The government will not provide incentives to employers or even show any moral leadership in offering work during school hours. Most Australians at some point in their lives rely on government benefits or receive a payment to help them make ends meet. For most the period is short and the amount is modest. Welfare recipients are not a breed apart; they are not a separate species. They are our neighbours, our sisters, our parents and our children, and this government has relied on false stereotypes of teen mums and bad backs to justify these cuts. The reality is different. Over 64 per cent of single mothers are working or looking for work, and most would love to be in the work force if we gave them the help with training and child care that they need. Their children are the poorest in the land. They are already missing out on meals and school excursions. Make no mistake: this attack on mothers is an attack on their children. It is also worth noting-and I note with a sense of shame-that, under this budget, two single mothers get two different payments and are subjected to two different regimes depending on whether they go onto benefits before or after 1 July 2006. This applies to disability support pensioners as well. They will be required to undergo regular updates on whether they are still disabled. There are two different regimes. A parent whose youngest child is over six and who already receives the sole parent pension will continue with the same entitlements and burdens as they have currently, but an Australian whose marriage breaks up and who goes on the sole parent pension after 1 July 2006 suffers an income drop of $44 a fortnight when their child turns six years old. It is incredible that two parents who do the same work at home and face the same barriers to employment will receive two different benefits. I am sure that the government, in the name of streamlining, simplicity and efficiency, will decide sooner or later that disability support pensioners, who receive two different levels of benefits-$77 a fortnight differentshould receive a streamlined payment, and you can bet your bottom dollar that it will not be the higher payment that everyone receives; it will be the lower one. This budget's other great lack is that it does absolutely nothing to provide the child care or the training that these parents need to re-enter the work force. The government has made much of the 84,000 out of school hours care places that it has provided. We heard the figures today. There will be 190,000 extra people moving into the work force and 35,000 people are already on waiting lists for those out of school hours care places. Where are the extra places coming from, and what does the Prime Minister think those extra kids are going to do? They will go home to empty houses. They will be a new generation of latchkey kids. When it comes to training, the government has done nothing to help with the training needs of welfare recipients. Many of them have not finished high school. They need training to be employable, to make them attractive to employers. Everyone agrees on that. At the same time that the government is talking about sending people back to work, it has turned 400,000 young Australians away from TAFE and universities. At the same time as we have a skills shortage, it has turned 400,000 Australians away from TAFE and universities. There is only one Job Network place for every seven parenting payment recipients. What are the others going to do? They will suffer the punishment and they will suffer the cuts to their benefits, but they will receive no help, no aid. When it comes to disability support pensioners, again it is only cuts the government has in mind. We should not be surprised, though: it is a Liberal budget. It is a budget for the wealthy, the natural constituency of the Liberal Party. No wonder there was cheering and clapping here the other night from all those people up there in their black ties and cocktail dresses, the backbench of the Liberal Party here-all on over $100,000 a year. They are doing really well out of these tax cuts. They are doing really well out of the cuts to the superannuation surcharge. Let them go home and explain it to the people on minimum wages in their electorates. This government has accused us of class warfare, but this budget makes war on the poor. It is a budget that does so much for so few and so little for so many. It benefits the minority at the expense of the majority. As I said, 45 per cent of the tax cuts go to the top 10 per cent of earners. The superannuation surcharge of $2½ billion goes to a minority of high-income earners. It goes to only one per cent of women workers, incidentally. These tax cuts are the most unfair proposed by any government in recent history. It is the same government, mind you, that has opposed every pay increase for workers on the minimum wage since it came to government. This government is happy to give tax cuts to its wealthy mates, but it will oppose to the death any wage increase for workers in the hospitality industry who are turning down beds in great big hotels that government members are happy to spend the night in. If the government had its way, the poorest workers in this country would be $45 a week worse off than they are at the moment. Let's put a human face on this: Louise from Victoria, a single mother with four kids, still has three living at home studying. She does not drive a car. She cannot afford it. She ran a small business from home designing mirror frames. She is terrified by this attitude to single mothers and she is offended by the stereotyping. She knows that the lack of apprenticeships means that her kids cannot get jobs. She does not have a husband or a father for her kids. She does everything for herself. Why does she deserve to be punished? (Time expired)",99
105,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (3.15 pm)-Nothing illustrates better the total lack of intellectual and sustained thought and policy development of the Australian Labor Party than its response to this budget. Amazingly, in the last two days when we have debated matters of public importance in this place-a debate which is conventionally led by the opposition in this House-we have not seen at the dispatch box, leading the debate on behalf of the opposition, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition or the shadow Treasurer. They seem to have gone missing in action. As I said, nothing so clearly demonstrates the total lack of policy development and the total lack of an intellectual core to the Australian Labor Party, which in its past has better and more fully represented the workers and others in Australia. We have just heard from the member for Sydney a concoction of inaccuracies, of which there are so many I am not sure I would have time to list them if I set out to do so. Let me just take a number of them for a start. She said that there are no incentives for employees in this particular budget. Wrong. She said that there is a limit on the numbers in relation to the Job Network. Wrong: the Job Network remains uncapped for people about whom she was speaking. She said that the government has opposed every pay increase in the Industrial Relations Commission. Wrong. Mr Adams-Every time!",102

109,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If the opposition wants to come in here and argue to the people of Australia that it has a policy position which it wants to advocate to them and if it wants to persuade them that it is an alternative government, then it ought to at least put accurate facts on the table. The package of Welfare to Work is a $2.6 billion package which will increase economic participation of people in this country. It recognises that every Australian of working age has the right and deserves the opportunity to participate in Australia's We are here on a day on which the unemployment rate is once again at 5.1 per cent and on a day when the Australian Bureau of Statistics has revealed to us that there are more Australians in jobs than ever before in this country. Significantly, 286,200 jobs have been created over the past year, almost 72 per cent of which have been full-time positions. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has measured an increase in full-time employment over the past month. Whenever else but on such a day and in such circumstances would it be opportune to try to bring about some reforms which would give those people who have been locked out of the economic life of this country the opportunity to particitragedy pate in it? We do not, for one moment, walk away from this policy. This is a policy that says to sole parents and to those who are capable of working, ‘We will look at your ability and your capacity rather than as we have done for so many years in the past'-and it seems the Labor Party still want to do this‘continue to concentrate on disability and incapacity.' Where is the bravery of the Labor Party? The member for Lilley in 1999 said, ‘Labor wants to ensure that our system of social security is not encouraging dependence.' Where is the bravery of the Labor Party? And what does the Labor Party stand for when it seems to be arguing now and during question time that somehow these reforms have gone too far and are so tough? The Leader of Opposition on AM yesterday morning was asked in relation to his response to the budget: One of the centrepieces of this budget is the welfare changes. Mr Costello last night mentioned the genuinely disabled, suggesting perhaps some on disability pensions now are shirkers. What do you think? The response from Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, was: prosperity. Well, they squibbed reform ... Which way does the Labor Party want it? Mr Lyons interjecting",102
110,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Lyons will remove himself from the House under the standing orders. The member for Lyons then left the chamber.,103
111,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Was the Leader of the Opposition correct yesterday when he said, ‘They didn't go far enough; they squibbed reform,' or is the Labor Party right today when they say that somehow this has gone too far? Which side of the road is the Labor Party walking on today? This is the great of what was once a great political party in this country-namely, the Australian Labor Party. Those who made it a great political party in the past must be turning in their graves to see what we get as an opposition today. On top of that, the party that have traditionally, historically, represented the workers of Australia come in here and say that they will oppose tax cuts, including tax cuts which will reducing the 17 per cent rate-the lowest rate of tax threshold in this countryto 15 per cent. That is a rate which applies specifically to the working men and women of Australia. And the Labor Party, the great historical party of the workers of Australia, come in here and say, ‘We are going to oppose those tax cuts.' No wonder in the last election, and in the elections before that, the working-class men and women of Australia, looking to the interests of their families and those that they support, have walked away in their droves from the Australian Labor Party. This is a reform which is timely. It is timely because we have a situation where we have more people in jobs in Australia than ever before. It is timely because the unemployment rate is at 5.1 per cent and because we have the opportunity now to say to people in Australia that the best form of welfare, if we can appropriately bring it about, is to give a job to as many people in this country who are capable of it and who want one. Even Andrew MCCallum, the President of ACOSS, acknowledges that the best form of welfare is a job. That is what we are on about. We had a lot before from the member for Sydney about sole parents. I ask rhetorically: is the Labor Party seriously suggesting that we should imagine that a typical single parent, aged between 30 to 39, raising a child or two, usually as a consequence of divorce or separation, does not have the same aspirations for herself and her children as every other Australian? Why does the Labor Party take the view that we should condemn that woman to, on average, 10 to 12 years on welfare, that we should make her family one of those families in which 800,000 kids are growing up in a jobless household? Why does the Labor Party imagine that those people do not have the same aspirations as other Australians? And why does the Labor Party suggest that we should not do something about a social situation which will mean that the chances of those children being on welfare in the future are greater than they would otherwise be? We do not seriously entertain the proposition that has been put forward by the Australian Labor Party. We will not condemn people in those circumstances to not having an opportunity to participate in the prosperity of this nation. As I said, all Australians should be able to contribute according to their ability to the economic life of this country. This is where we are starting from. It is about participation. It is about looking at people's ability and their capacity to work, rather than saying that someone who in the past was put on a disability support pension has basically been condemned to a dead-end payment-the reality for many people. Over the last couple of months, the Minister for Workforce Participation and I have spent quite a period of time consulting with disabled groups and other representatives of welfare beneficiaries around Australia. One of the things they said to us was that they have the same aspirations for a job as anybody else and that they would like some assistance with that-and this package has assistance in it. We heard complaints about additional child care. There is provision for more than 84,000 additional child-care places in this package. I remind the House that the 84,000 additional outside school hours care places in this year's budget are more than the total provided by the Australian Labor Party when they were last in government. There were crocodile tears from the member for Sydney before about these reforms-reforms which are aimed at giving people an opportunity to participate in the economic life of this country. We have made a deliberate policy decision that, if people do have the capacity to work, we should treat them in that way. We have been generous about it-for example, for sole parents waiting until their youngest child turns six and providing an additional transition period of 12 months to those who would go onto the benefit in the next year or so. I remind the House what other countries do. In Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Norway-one of the so-called socially progressive countries of Scandinavia-Switzerland and Denmark, lone parents on benefits are required to look for work when their youngest child is three, not six. And in the past these countries have had governments equivalent to those of the Australian Labor Party in this place. We are giving people the opportunity to participate in the work force of this country and, when the immediate requirements of their preschool aged children have passed, we will encourage sole parent beneficiaries to look for work and will put them on newstart allowance. We have been generous about newstart allowance not just for sole parents but for all recipients of newstart lowance where we have made the taper rate operate in a way that retains more of people's income. These are positive measures. You would hardly imagine, listening to the member for Sydney, that this is a $3.6 billion package of expenditure-this is not a savings measuredesigned to increase the work force participation of those who unfortunately are presently locked out of the economic life of this country. On top of that, not only does the opposition oppose giving these people and their children a better chance, looking at their capacity to work and doing something about them achieving their aspirations-that is what they were telling the Minister for Workforce Participation, me and all others in the coalition-but the opposition is opposed to the tax cuts in this budget. In the time that I have been in this parliament I do not recall an opposition that has been so inept in its response to a budget. Where are the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer? Not only are they missing in action-we might see something of the Leader of the Opposition tonight-but, essentially, they are seeking to deny Australians billions of dollars worth of tax cuts. On one hand, they complain about the minimum wage and, on the other hand, they say they are going to block the tax cuts. How absolutely ridiculous a position is this for an Australian opposition? It would deliver obvious advantages and benefits to the men and women of Australia and their families. Why is the Labor Party so opposed to giving Australian workers and their families more money in their pockets? Why is it saying, ‘While we control the Senate in this place, we will vote against'-presumably with the assistance of minor parties-‘a benefit which would flow otherwise from 1 July to the al- families and workers of Australia'? The Australian Labor Party was once the great party of the workers of Australia. All one can conclude from this debate is that the party which once represented the workers of Australia has abandoned them. The friends of the workers of Australia are on this side of the House.",103
112,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This budget shows how woefully out of touch this government is with the challenges and struggles of making ends meet for millions of Australians. Everyone in this House thinks that work is better than welfare. Everyone in this House believes that if it is possible for someone to work then they are better off than being on welfare. But where the opposition and the government differ, and differ bitterly, are over the means of achieving that outcome. The government have just discovered welfare to work disincentives. They have only just found out about them. They have only just accepted that what Labor has been arguing for years is right-this government must do something about welfare to work incentives-but in their implementation of that program they have shown their callousness and their disregard for the needs of millions of Australians. In this budget we see three things: first, a clear indication that this government is out of touch with the needs and challenges of people on a disability pension and a parenting payment; second, a continuation of their ideological obsession with punishing instead of helping people get back into the work force-we have seen that since this government came into office in 1996; and, third, a continuation of this government's favourite tactic. This government loves the fact that people on a disability pension are being portrayed in the community as shirkers. Their favourite tactic is the dog whistle. We have heard that the Treasurer's favourite headline, out of all the headlines that been written about this budget, is that of the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday: ‘Workers 1, Shirkers 0'. We saw the picture of the Treasurer reading that headline with a huge smile on his face-not untypically, with a huge smile on his face. Well, somebody has got to say it: not everybody on a disability pension is a shirker. Not every single parent is a shirker. It would have been better if one of the members of the government could have come into this House and said, ‘Hang on a minute, that's not right; not everybody's a shirker,' but not one of them has said it. Not one of them has had the guts to come into this chamber and say, ‘There are people on the disability support pension and there are single parents who are not shirkers.' In fact, the vast majority are not shirkers. They are people who have been dealt a hard blow in life and deserve this government's support, but the government are happy to see them portrayed as bludgers and shirkers. That is a national disgrace. We saw this in 1996: this government came into office and abolished a range of programs which helped people from welfare to work-Jobstart, the national training wage, New Work Opportunities, Landcare and Environment Action Plan and job skills. They slashed all those and what did they create? What did they replace them with? It was Work for the Dole. What did Work for the Dole contribute? There was no training and a worse result in getting people from welfare back into work, but it was an excellent result in portraying unemployed people as shirkers. This government is at it again with welfare to work policies which do not produce results but which do portray poor and disadvantaged people in the community as shirkers. Let me turn to some of the practical ramifications of this year's budget in relation to welfare. As the honourable member for Sydhave ney said, from 1 July 2006, people applying for the parenting payment will receive the current entitlements until their child turns six. From then, they will receive a so-called enhanced newstart allowance, which will involve an obligation to work at least 15 hours a week. The taper rate for this enhanced allowance will be 60c in the dollar instead of 70c. But what is the biggest obstacle for single parents wishing to transfer to work? The answer, of course, is child care, particularly out of school hours care. This government has announced 84,300 new out of school hours places. At first glance that sounds impressive, but the devil is in the detail. Firstly, the majority of these places will not come on line until 2008. Half the funding for these places is not available until 2008-09, but of course the welfare changes come into effect in 2006. So there is a very significant lag. I am not sure what the single parents who are transferring from welfare to work are meant to do for two years while these places are coming on line. That is just the nub of the problem. We already have a shortage of out of school hours places as it is. As we speak, there is a shortage of over 30,000 places across the country, so of those 80,000 new places more than 30,000 are going to be taken up just fulfilling the shortfall that is currently there. That is not taking into account all the people whom this government is trying to move from welfare to work and is not creating anywhere near enough childcare places. I have seen this in my electorate. We have seen after school hours care centres close. Just last year we saw the Smithfield West after school hours centre threatened with closure. It was only through a community campaign and cooperation from the local council and other child-care providers that we were able to keep that open. Talking to the mothers and the fathers who relied on that centre for their after school hours care brought home to me just how important it was for parents, both in family situations with two parents and in those with single parents, and how much they rely on after school hours care. There is a national crisis in after school hours care and the government have done nothing about it. Even now, the places they are creating will go nowhere near meeting the new demand that they will be creating. In addition, the government have made some quiet changes to the JET scheme for sole parents which will reduce the incentives for sole parents to move from welfare to work. So not only have they done nothing; they are actually making it worse. They have quietly introduced changes in this budgetthey have not gone out and talked about them. They have changed the JET scheme to say that sole parents with disabled children should not be able to go into long-term ing to get them back into the work force-a callous budget-cutting measure which goes against the grain. It goes against everything the government are meant to be achieving, against all their rhetoric, and yet they stay quiet about it. I talked before about the enhanced newstart allowance and the taper rate of 60 per cent. They call it the enhanced newstart allowance-I am not sure where it is enhanced from. It is true that the taper rate for the normal newstart allowance is 70c in the dollar. But what is the taper rate for the parenting allowance? The taper rate for the parenting allowance, up to $146 a fortnight, is 40c. So, by moving people from the parenting allowance onto the newstart allowance, they are again reducing the incentives from welfare to work, again going against the grain of all their rhetoric and their promises. Again we see the devil in the detail. What support is the government providing to people on the disability pension to transfer from welfare to work? In fairness, as the member for Sydney has outlined, there are some vocational training places, but again they are sadly inadequate. There are not many-600,000 parents have to fight with 65,000 mature age unemployed for just 12,300 vocational training places. This is not a proper plan to help people off the disability support pension. It is a way, however, to transfer people from one form of welfare to another. If a disabled person is classified as being able to work 15 hours a week then they will be moved to Newstart. This means that a disabled person will be $77 a fortnight worse off, even if they are doing everything they can to find a jobeven if they are applying for every job they can think of, even if they are struggling in their wheelchairs with public transport to get to job interviews, even if they are doing trainwhatever is possible to get a job. Mr Fitzgibbon-Shame!",105
113,Mr BOWEN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"‘Shame!' is right. This is a very sad result indeed. We must do more to help people on the disability support pension back into work, not just punish them. The Prime Minister showed a sad lack of understanding in question time. More in pity than in anger I say: a sad lack of understanding of the needs of people on the disability support pension. The Brotherhood of St Laurence has said: The Treasurer said that welfare to work changes are meant to encourage unemployed people and part-time workers but they are only penalising people and acting as another disincentive to The Prime Minister said the other day that this government was an enlarging government. It is not; it is a punishing government. It is not interested in enlarging the lives of people on disability pensions and sole parents who are struggling and trying to get back into work. If it was, it would be doing something for the current disability pension recipients. It would be creating incentives for them. It would be giving them support to get back into the workplace. But those people, as the Prime Minister said, are grandfathered. There is no support for them, no encouragement for them and no training places for them. They are left out in the cold. We have an obligation as a parliament, as a government and as a society to look after those who have been dealt a hard blow in life. We have to extend a hand to them and help them back into the work force-not punish or penalise them for the circumstances they find themselves in. This is a punishing budget from a punishing government. It should hang its head in shame for this outrageous budget. (Time expired)",107
114,Ms LEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Farrer-Parliamentary Secretary (Children and Youth Affairs)) (3.39 pm)-It is a pleasure to talk on this matter of public importance in the House today following the excellent budget delivered by the Treasurer on Tuesday night. I would like to quote Winston Churchill, who said, ‘We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.' I think that statement underpins the philosophical differences that we are seeing come through this debate on both sides of the House. ‘We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.' The opposition are concerned only with what people need, from their point of view, to get-what handouts, what entitlements, what benefits and what welfare. But on this side of the House we are asking peowork. ple: ‘What can you contribute? How can you make a life by what you give and in so doing find happiness?' That is an important philosophical difference that we have really seen come through clearly in this MPI. The first speaker wove the usual web of nonsense and inconsistencies-I am not allowed to call them lies. The second speaker continued with the same sort of rhetoric, putting words in our mouths-‘shirkers', ‘bludgers', ‘struggling in wheelchairs to get interviews', ‘a punishing government'. These are not words that the government use. Do not put words in our mouths. How can this be a punishing government when we are spending $3.6 billion with these measures? And we are spending for the next eight years to encourage training and opportunities to move people into a real place in the real economy. This centrepiece of the budget attacks the very real problem of intergenerational welfare. I want to explain where the need comes from, because obviously members opposite have not worked it out. The proportion of working age Australians receiving income support payments has risen from one in 20 in 1974 to one in five today. In June 2004 there were some 2.7 million income support recipients aged between 16 and 64-over 20 per cent of all working age Australians, most of whom rely on income support for the majority of their incomes. We are talking about a group of people affected by intergenerational welfare whose long-term life chances are being lost to them. As the Prime Minister said in question time, it is in the interests of this government that we look after the interests of the working men and women in this country. As Minister Andrews, who spoke earlier, said: we must give people the opportunity to participate in the working life of this country. Welfare is a safety net, a very good safety net, but it is not a way of life and nor should one see it as that. It is better to be on work than on welfare, and we need to encourage the transition from welfare to work. Again let me highlight where the need comes from with a couple of figures from the recent past. The number of Australian families with children under the age of 15 who had no parent in work increased from 280,000 in 1986 to 390,000 in 1997. About three-quarters of the parents in these families were not in the labour force. Among the quarter who were unemployed, perhaps 40 per cent had been unemployed for more than one year. But what we see now is that around 690,000 children live in households where no parent works. I think that is one in five one in seven Australian kids growing up in a household where no parent works. There has been a substantial increase in the extent of income support dependence and worklessness in this country. At an OECD conference in 1996 Professor Esping-Andersen said, ‘We face a crisis of polarisation if the losers of today are losers for life, and if they pass their underprivilege on to the next generation.' I do not think government wants to stand by and see underprivilege being passed on from one generation to the next. This is about finding portunities for young people to have a ‘real place in the real economy'-I think I am quoting Noel Pearson when I say that. If we look at the American experience we see that growing up poor increased the probability of long-term poverty in adulthood by three times for poor blacks and eight times for poor whites. The daughters of welfare recipients were more than twice as likely to receive welfare themselves than the daughters of nonrecipients. The member for Sydney should take note of that point. In Australia we have not yet completed similar longitudinal studies, but there is evidence that the anyexperience is comparable. The lowest participation rates were found among young people from families with no parental employment, and that should come as no surprise. We must support parents who have the greatest responsibility of all-to care for, provide for and nurture their children. I have got into the habit of checking from time to time the web site of the Australian Greens. Prior to the last election it was with great concern that I realised that people who held these views managed to put them on the national agenda in this country. It is with a sense of relief that I have now realised they will not be able to do that after 1 July. I want to touch on the Australian Greens, and I hope or none of their ideas find their way into this debate. They have an idea that we should have a universal guaranteed adequate income scheme with the following characteristics: everyone gets a particular amount of money, no-one has to pass an activity test and no-one pays tax under a certain level. Everyone is somehow supposed to find an adequate wage in that scheme. I am really pleased that after 1 July this this year we will have an opportunity to do what has not been legislatively possible over the last nine years. I think what has come op- through today is that Labor is scaring the public with this nonsense about parents being forced to work. It is all very well to stand here and trot out the rhetoric, as the member for Sydney has done, about mums having to go back to work and not being able to be at home after school. I share that concern with her. My mum was not there when I got home from school either, but she certainly demonstrated to me a model in which you work hard, get where you want to in life and try your best. It is something that women in this place should all understand. The member for Sydney gave the example of a constituent who sent her a fax in which she said she is going to be forced to go to work and will not be home when her children come home from school. What the member for Sydney should do is inform her constituent of the facts, which is that if she is currently receiving sole parent pension she will be asked when her youngest child turns six to look for 15 hours work a week, which is about three hours a day. I am confident that, should she be able to do that, she will be able to be at home at least some of the time when her children get home from school. It is the responsibility of the opposition to educate their constituents. This is a new and important measure and it matters a great deal to the future of this country. So, please, give them the facts. I say to those who are reading about this debate and trying to get to grips with it that they should contact members of the government and we will give you the facts so that you can understand how it will affect you. I want to touch on some of the remarks that members opposite have made on this subject. This welfare to work measure hinges around mutual obligation. Senator Penny Wong said: Mutual obligation is the touchstone of Labor's approach to increasing work force participation. … It is our view that government should be doing everything possible to help unemployed people who are reasonably able to work to find work. That is obviously a situation where everyone wins. It is good for the individuals concerned, good for the community … The subject matter of the MPI today is that we are not doing the real work. We have not heard from the opposition what their ideas on this are, but we do know that they support mutual obligation. The Leader of the Opposition has said: Labor supports mutual obligation where people are capable of working; and the government provides them with the opportunities they need to find and keep work. He has also said: To increase work force participation, our tax and welfare systems also need to provide greater incentive and reward for effort. The member for Lilley has said: What this country needs is … real reform which puts incentive into the system … So where is the real reform? I guess we will have to wait until tonight to hear what is said, but I hope what we hear in the opposition leader's budget reply tonight centres on the facts and does not use this ridiculous rhetoric that we have heard today. On welfare to work in general, the member for Lilley has said: Labor recognises that encouraging people to move from welfare to work is a policy objective in its own right and one of the most important we can have. We want fewer people on welfare and more people in work. We could not have put it any better ourselves. The Minister for Family and Community Services, Kay Patterson, has responded to the further scaremongering about child-care places by the member for Sydney this morning. I encourage the member for Sydney to catch up on those few facts as well and, importantly, to understand that the number of long day care places is uncapped and is constantly increasing. Since 1996 the number of places has increased from 168,000 to over 229,000. The member for Sydney falsely assumes that no formal care is availit is able for parents employed in shiftwork when in fact family day care very much has those options. (Time expired)",108

116,Mr SNOWDON,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I am pleased to be able to make a contribution to this debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. This bill is the last of those implementing the government's Backing Australia's Future package. It is quizzically named Backing Australia's Future, because it is far from ing that. Instead, it is yet another attack by the Howard government on the ability of Australians to access education. The bill's purpose is to prevent higher education providers from requiring students to join student associations. In other words, students will not have to pay fees to assist their student association when they enrol in their courses. The government claims that this is necessary to ensure freedom of association. However, it is clear to us that the real intent this legislation is to knock out another voice that opposes government policies. Freedom of choice, speech or association is the last thing the Howard government wants in our higher education system. In effect, this bill not only attacks students but also attacks universities. It is not only students who say that they need student associations; the universities themselves have told the government that these institutions are needed on campus. Under the preposterous guise of freedom of association, the government is using this bill to destroy students' services, students' rights and students' support networks. The bill is the latest in a series of measures the government has put forward to damage the higher education system and distort it into one based on privilege over merit. The Backing Australia's Future package has seen a rise in the HECS fees charged by universities of up to 25 per cent from 2005 and has paved the way for full fee-paying domestic students where privilege rather than merit will guarantee a university place. The government has made universities harder to get into and too expensive for many Australians to access. Now it will also seek to abolish the remaining vestiges of student support on campus. All of this has been done in an attempt to silence student criticism of the terrible mismanagement of education policy we have experienced under this government. This is do- political payback of the cheapest and lowest kind. We already know that existing provisions allow students to opt out of associations, but this bill will prevent higher education providers from collecting fees for student associations. The Trade Practices Act 1974 contains provisions that ensure a student's rights to freedom of association should they object to joining a student association. This right has already been tested by the Australian Competition and Consumer of Commission. This bill is unnecessary in achieving the government's supposed goal of freedom of association. That right already exists. The real intention behind this bill is ideological. In 1997 we saw the Howard government rip into unions with masked guards, military recruits and dogs on the docks. We are going to get another round of that after 1 July. Now it is happening again through this witch-hunt against student representation. This is all a vain effort to silence any opposition and criticism of the Howard government's changes to education policy. The government is punishing all those who dare to speak out. So one-eyed is the government's dogged pursuit of unionism that it is willing to destroy student associations, which more closely resemble service and welfare support organisations than unions. To their credit, students have long been involved in the political process and political activity. They have been effective critics of governments for decades. The previous governments of which I was a member, the Hawke and Keating governments, were confronted by student opposition often-just as John Howard's successive governments have been. In the face of reforms pushed by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, reforms which strip the ability of ordinary Australians to access education on academic merit rather than on their financial position, students have to put up a fight. It is clear to me that this bill is political retribution a means of neutralising public comment on the government's education policies. If this bill becomes law, students will have paid a heavy price for standing up for themselves and standing up for others. They will have lost important support that many rely on at one time or another in their studies. So determined is the coalition to gag students while creating a privilege based education system that it has even managed to write a flaw into the bill-the catch-all prohibition of any fee that does not relate directly to the course. Let us consider the consequences of that. It will prevent universities from gathering student association fees. It will also prevent them from collecting parking fines, library fines or accommodation charges at halls of residence. Of course, none of these are directly related to university education courses. Surely even this government must recognise that this bill will result in a massive erosion of the facilities and capacities on university campuses. The government seems willing to let universities crumble and decay. That is the ultimate impact of this exercise. A cost saving it will not be. It will be a penalty on all Australian students at all Australian universities, whether or not they are the sandstone universities or the newer regional universities like the Charles Darwin University in my own territory, the Northern Territory. Of course, that is a very young university and can ill afford the cuts in services which will automatically flow from the government's decision to prevent the university from raising the student association fees. The government may not see the value in student associations but, on this side of the House, their role in the universities is clear. It is worthwhile looking at some of the functions that are carried out by a small regional university like ours in the Northern Territory. University associations administer sports associations and sports facilities. I was a and is member of the student association here at ANU when I was a student and was on the sports council. We had the responsibility of administering and managing all the sports resources of the university. That included the gymnasium, the grounds and all of the things that the students were using as part of the union fees in the sports arena. All of these will now be threatened. The reduced capacity of student associations to provide comprehensive services as a result of this measure will mean that many of the clubs and societies which are currently run at universities and financed through the student associations will no longer continue. Charles Darwin University has a gymnasium and various sporting clubs: athletics, soccer, the various football codes, badminton, basketball, netball, cricket, triathlon, hockey, ju-jitsu, karate, sailing, TaeKwonDo, Ultimate Frisbee, volleyball, water polo and capoeira. In the students union they have special interest groups: the Social Workers Club, the Indigenous Students Association, the Engineers Club, the Maths Club, the Psychology Students Association, the Law Students Association, the IT Club, the Labor Club and-dare I say it-the Liberal Club, the Baha'i Society, the Fellowship of Christian University Students and the Japanese Animation Club. There is a students' rights advocate, who is funded through the students union. The function of this position includes advising of rights under the CDU student charter, helping students deal with issues with their faculty, failed grades, exclusion, disciplinary hearings and special consideration, helping international students with study visa and liaison with the department of immigration, support for mature age students, other advocacy and assistance with external bodies, including assistance with youth allowance, Austudy and Abstudy, accommodation assistance, employment assistance, participation in annual events such as Orientation Week for both VET and university students, Troppo Week at the commencement of second semester, Youth Week, Indigenous Day, International Day, Harmony Day, Darwin Pride Week, Charity Pancake Day, the National Campus Band Competition, the National Tertiary Art Prize, the Movie Club and Deck Chair Cinema, cocktail parties, ‘big barbies' and even a pub crawl, and the Litchfield Day Trip. It may sound trite, but these are all essenThe tial activities on the university campus. Yet the government seems to think that, somehow or other, these things will continue once it removes the right of universities to charge students association fees. Most of the sandstone universities will have built up significant reserves and their capital costs would have been sunk many years ago, but the smaller universities do not have those luxuries. Since 1996, when the Howard government first appeared here in the parliament, the government has removed $6 million a year in recurrent funding from Charles Darwin University alone-$60 million over 10 years. Last year, this government raised HECS charges by 25 per cent and opened the door for ‘buy your future' $200,000 university degrees. Now students pay GST on books. Universities like Charles Darwin cannot suffer long the penalties which have been imposed upon it by the Howard government. The successive charges which have been placed upon that university because of underfunding by the Commonwealth are causing that university distress in the way it is able to fund courses and provide student services. And now we have another shot. Under the process the government has put in place we will see the capacity of the university to provide for the student associations and the activities of the student union-which I have just outlined-severely undermined. The involvement of the university students in the community of Darwin will be handicapped. I do not believe this measure is something many Australians will support. It compounds, in my view, the cynical approach of the Howard government-attacking the rights of universities to raise these charges when it knows that the universities themselves oppose the measure. Professor Di Yerbury, President of the Australian ViceChancellors Committee, on 16 March stated: Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee rejects the government's underlying premise that students are forced to be members of student organisations. Students already have the option not to be members. I made this point clear just moments ago. She continues: It is a bit like council rates-not everybody uses all the services, but rates in a community are compulsory. I do not think that is a bad analogy-it is a very good analogy, in fact. That is how these charges should be seen. Professor Yerbury continues: We see this legislation as somewhat heavyhanded. John Mullarvey, the chief executive of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, said on 17 March: International students view education in Australia as a holistic experience-an education combined with an invaluable life experience underpinned by the students services offered on campus, such as general support and pastoral care, as well cial and sporting activities ... I am certain that domestic students should share this view of their time at university. It demonstrates clearly that a comprehensive involvement at the level of higher education means that you should be able to access these services. But that will be threatened and undermined if the government has its way. I mentioned earlier the role of student sports associations. We know that a number of prominent Australians placed advertisements in the major daily newspapers on 19 April this year expressing concern that the introduction of this anti-student organisation legislation would destroy sporting activities at universities, which have encouraged and developed many athletes at the elite level. Among the signatories were Charlesworth, a former member of this place who was a Sheffield Shield cricketer, an Australian representative hockey player and the coach of the great gold medal winning Australian women's hockey team; Shane Gould MBE; John Boultbee; Ric Charlton; David Clarke; John Coates; David Coe; Kim Beazley; Bruce Collins QC; Peter Crittle, a great rugby player; Phil Crowe; Roger Davis; Rob de Castella; Gary Flowers; David Gallop; Phil Harry; Richard Lee-and the list goes on. These are not people of want who just go out and pay for an advertisement of this type simply because they want the exercise or because they want to participate in this sort of activity. It shows their real concern about the impact of this legislation upon the ability of universities to provide the full range of services to their students. Importantly, these people understand, as I do from my own experience at university, the value of the sports services that are provided by university campuses and the fact that they are a very strong training ground for sportsas so- men and women who go on to earn higher honours as Australian representatives. It seems to me that we are throwing out the baby with the bathwater here. This is such a short-sighted thing the government is doing. It is penalising good, young Australians for going to university. It has penalised them already by the enormous increase of 25 per cent in HECS charges. Now it is saying to them: ‘We don't believe that these services are essential to your education.' I say they are. And I say that it is in the national interest to ensure these services are provided at universities. Of course the Commonwealth government will not tip into the till to cover the losses that will be incurred as a result of this legislation. There will be no additional finance coming from the government to help these Ric university activities-no way. But it is all about ideology. It is all about the government's abhorrence of students having a voice. I am reminded of Kent Rowe, President of the Charles Darwin University student union. In a statement he made on 16 March this year he said: The Howard government is irritated by informed organised criticism of his anti-student policies student organisations, so now he wants us to shut up. The legislation his government introduced in parliament today is designed to do just that. What kind of government bans students from making organised political comment? He gives three examples: Soeharto, Indonesia 1978. Deng Xioping, China 1989we all remember thatand John Howard, Australia 2005 By contrast, universities in virtually every country in the OECD including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand charge compulsory fees to support student services at universities. Australia will be the exception if this proposed legislation is passed. Some governments just hate informed, organised opposition, and John Howard's government is one of those. I do not believe that Australians will be able to hold their heads up with any great pride as a result of this legislation. They will, like me, be very concerned about its impact upon campuses across this nation. They will, like me, be concerned about the ability of students to provide services for themselves and their colleagues. They will, like me, be concerned about the ability of student associations to actively promote and advocate students rights. They will, like me, be concerned about the impact this will have on the ability of student associations, and student bodies generally, to be actively involved politically. I am most concerned about this and believe that it will be a day of great shame if and when this legislation becomes law. (Time expired)",112
117,Mr BARRESI,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. Like the bill debated yesterday on bargaining agents' fees, it goes by to the heart of values in Australian society: freedom of choice and freedom of association. Before I go on with what I had planned to say, I want to go back to something that the member for Lingiari alerted the House to-that is, his time at the ANU. He was a member of the student union. He remembered with fondness the services that were delivered by that student union body and where the money was going. I was at the same university. In fact, if I look at the age range of both of us, I think our time may have overlapped slightly towards the end of the member for Lingiari's time and the start of mine. I remember the absolute outrage from the students on the campus about where that money was going. I remember the protests that took place when we found out that the money during those days was going to support terrorist organisations overseas. It could very well be that money was going to services within the university, but it was also going to questionable organisations overseas. If the member for Lingiari was part of the student body that made the decision to send money to those overseas terrorist organisations based in Libya, then he should hang his head in shame for the part that he played, because it certainly did not receive the support of the student organisation when I was there during the early to mid-seventies. This bill is about freedom of choice. It is about freedom of association. What makes these fundamental freedoms all the more relevant in this case is the fact that they relate to the very people we are currently training as the future leaders of our society. At present, freedom of choice and freedom of association do not apply to membership of student organisations or the payment of compulsory general service fees at universities. This situation is simply unacceptable and it keeps the higher education sector out of line with the general community. As mentioned, the Howard government has breathed much needed life into the industrial relations sector by introducing freedom of choice and association through our workplace relations reforms. This bill seeks to introduce these freedoms to students in the higher education sector. Why shouldn't students enjoy the right to choose something that now exists in most workplaces across Australia? The union movement only represents 17 per cent of the Australian private sector work force, and membership is falling. Why is it falling? Because people do not understand and do not accept the value of what the union movement purports to give them. The same applies on campuses. Workers refrain from formally contributing their voice to a union; the situanature tion is mirrored in Australia's universities, where a pitifully low voter turnout to student elections reflects a high level of apathy amongst students towards their unions. Before the pros and cons of voluntary student unionism can be effectively debated, one point needs to be made: student unions, guilds and associations are not industrial ions. I accept that. But, unlike in industry, students are not engaged in employment with the university and, hence, do not derive an income from their role at the institution. dent unions are formed to represent students at the various administrative bodies of the university and to provide student services. Additionally, student unions manage their associations and the windfall that they receive straight from the pockets of students. Higher education funding reform has been a highly topical issue in this chamber over recent years. To our universities, the Backing Australia's Future reforms are a sensible response by the government to the cause of greater financial liquidity for students. The reforms recognise that Australia's universities need greater and quicker access to funds if they are to continually develop into worldclass education centres. Prior to the reforms of December 2003, universities were limited to the terms and finances of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. The same cannot be said of our student unions across Australia. Compulsory student union fees are upfront payments collected prior to the commencement of an academic semester. In most cases, the fees are collected by the university under the guise of a general service fee or student association fee. The majority is then directed straight into the coffers of the student union. The most unfair aspects of these fees are the conditions that payment or, in some cases, non-payment entails. The compulsory of the fees ties into student access to vital university services such as libraries, computer laboratories, the internet and other online services. There is no one standard model for student unions and associations in Australian universities. Essentially, a student organisation is in place to be representative of the student and reflective of their needs. In un- some cases, the representative role and the wider student union role are clearly divided. It needs to be made clear that this bill is not designed to belittle the need for student Stubased organisations. In most cases, student unions and associations offer important student welfare services in areas such as careers and housing assistance, employment services, medical facilities, counselling and advocacy. Additionally, these associations control commercial student facilities on campus and coordinate clubs, societies and student media. However-and this is where we differstudents can choose whether to utilise most of these services during their time at university. The same cannot be said about paying quite a large sum of money to access those services. To illustrate the point, I draw the attention of the House to Deakin University, located on Burwood Highway, just outside my electorate. It is a very good university with a growing reputation for its academic standards. During recent years, Deakin University has charged a general service fee in excess of $250 for full-time undergraduates. As with most institutions, the major beneficiary of these fees was the student association-in this case, Deakin University Student Association, or DUSA. Despite the obvious financial potency of DUSA, the organisation's annual student elections generated a meagre voter turnout and a low level of interest from students for office-bearing positions. Of the 90 DUSA positions on offer across the university's three campuses, a staggering 27 remained vacant after the 2005 campus elections. This is hardly a healthy representative democracy at work. The problems evident in this are a lack of an accountable structure for the association's funding and a clear lack of incentive to increase the level of student resentation. Accurate voter turnout figures for student elections are hard to locate. ever, I have heard informally that as few as 600 students out of the tens of thousands attending Deakin actually voted in the DUSA elections. I am not using this opportunity to criticise DUSA's services or Deakin University generally; many of my constituents, staff and, notably, community volunteers within my electorate received their education at Deakin. But it has been drawn to my attention that the compulsory up-front, no-questions-asked method of fee collection can really put a strain on students. In their wisdom, many academics at Deakin University recommend that full-time students work no more than 15 hours per week when supporting their studies. For the average full-time student working 15 hours or less per week, up-front fees totalling $240 can create a real problemeven more so when they perceive they are getting no value from that fee. Abolishing the compulsory component of student union fees is one of the things that has been hotly debated in this parliament since 1999. This has had real relevance for tertiary students within my electorate as it complemented legislation passed by the Victorian Kennett government in June 1994. The Victorian legislation at that time had given the Victorian education minister power to specify which student services could require a mandatory fee. In this case state legislation created a window of accountability for student union fees. Sadly, however, this legislation was amended by the Bracks Labor government in 2000. The amendment removed the list of allowable student services, paving the way for student fees to be used for publications and often extremist political activities. The Bracks government demonstrated the time-honoured Labor tradition of placing the repconcerns of the union movement, which controls its purse strings, ahead of the interests How- of the students. Premier Bracks, himself a former student union president in the early 1980s of what is now the University of Ballarat, is part of this attempt to wind back those needed improvements in union representation and fees introduced by the Kennett government. Interestingly, the total take-up in compulsory fees at the University of Ballarat in 2005 will be approximately $1.14 million. Like many of his Labor contemporaries, the Victorian Premier's political upbringing was peppered no doubt by socialist undertones of obligatory economic distribution. Mr Burke interjecting",116
118,Mr BARRESI,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I am glad you are amused by that. Many of the members opposite may argue that the intention of this legislation to increase student fee transparencies is ideologically driven. I would like to argue that the Labor Party's opposition to such moves is done in collaboration with the vested interests of the student union movement and against the interests of the students in general. Therefore, I ask the members opposite: how do you justify forcing students to pay up-front fees? This question was put before the parliament in 1999, when we debated the Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill. That debate generated some memorable cynicism from the opposition. I recall at the time a cynical comment by the member for Wills, who stated: For the Liberal side of politics, voluntary student unionism is a combination of an ideological wet dream and political payback. Only the member for Wills can use that kind of expression. However, this argument is questionable when, while calling for an abandonment of the legislation, he acknowledged that a responsible government should ‘allow students to decide for themselves what they want from their student organisations'. That is exactly right. Surely it stands to reason that offering some choice in the payment to, and participation in, the student union is a key tenet in giving students such an opportunity. Abolishing student fees pulls the rug of complacency out from under student organisations-organisations that fail to effectively represent students; organisations that fail to target their efforts towards assisting students and instead promote political agendas that are out of touch with the overwhelming majority. Voluntary student unionism has generated its own sense of history in this House in recent times. Throughout Australia the pros and cons of the issue have been largely debated. A key comparison is often drawn between the Victorian model, which I previously mentioned, and the Western Australian model of the same period. Under the Victorian model, the university could prescribe a list of conditions for which a general service fee could be used. However, the changes did not include voluntary payment of fees. When VSU was introduced into Western Australia, the changes were far more pertinent. The detractors claimed that the effects of VSU reduced student services. What actually occurred was a shift towards a more targeted form of service delivery. I had an opportunity at the time to see that service delivery and the effect of the VSU legislation in Western Australia when I visited the Edith Cowan University campus in Perth. Sadly, the re-election of a Labor government in Western Australia denied the chance for the voluntary system to have a long-term effect. We have seen two attempts by state governments to introduce VSU and, on their losing office, the Labor governments reversed those attempts. Yesterday, this House debated the merits of indirect fees for employees when enterprise bargaining agreements take place-and I participated in that debate. The key ethos of that debate was the immorality of charging an indirect fee to people who choose not to be a member of a student union. While we cannot directly associate workplace relations with students, the same principle of choice should apply to student associations. Earlier in this debate, members on this side of the House highlighted the recent track record of the financial mismanagement within the University of Melbourne student union, or MUSU as it is often known. The liquidation of this once all-powerful organisation more than anything highlights the need for a greater level of accountability within these associations. It became evident towards the end of 2003 that the union had become embroiled in questionable property deals with a little-known development firm. Unbeknown to students at the time, MUSU had made arrangements to pay tens of millions of dollars to the firm to invest in apartthis ments. A very significant fact in this alleged scandal is that many involved were heavily aligned with the right of the ALP. One should not imply that the mismanagement resulted solely from political affiliation. It is very evident, however, that the alleged kingpin of this scandal is ALP figure Andrew Landeryou. He has now returned from hiding overseas to face trial. The courts have recently heard that Mr Landeryou was behind at least two controversial leasing deals struck between the union and private companies in the year before the union collapsed. He will face court and no doubt the processes of the judicial system will take place.",118
119,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Did the member for Deakin mention that the matter was before the courts? If you did, it is sub judice and you should withdraw it.",120
120,Mr BARRESI,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not sure but to be on the safe side I will withdraw it, just to make sure that we cover ourselves.",120
121,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,I thank the member for Deakin.,120
122,Mr BARRESI,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"A truly democratic, voluntary system will continue to permit and encourage politically active students from across the spectrum to run for office. The added accountability of having to encourage students to join will add to the role. If dent association offers good value for money services, it will attract members. It tive that student union executives work to effectively manage their finances. Under the current system, the compulsory fees do not provide an additional incentive for the University of Melbourne student union to effectively manage their estimated total take from students of $10.6 million in 2005. It is important to highlight the need for bill. Our universities are full of hard working students. Many students turn up on campus to attend classes, use the academic facilities and focus on their studies. It is simply unfair that every student should be forced to pay for many services that they choose not to use. In Victoria this year over $51.54 million in compulsory fees will feed the coffers of the various student organisations. While this is not a bad thing in itself, provided that each student utilises the pool of services, we cannot be sure that this will be the case. More importantly, there is the compulsion side of it, rather than making it voluntary. Let us run through some of the funding for the various universities in Victoria and what they will be receiving from compulsory student union fees: Deakin University-just on the outside of my electorate-$4.28 million; La Trobe University, $5.87 million; Monash University, $13.4 million; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, $11.2 million; the University of Melbourne, $10 million; the University of Ballarat, $1.14 million; the Victoria University of Technology, $3.16 million. These are large sums of money. At the end of the day, this bill is about making sure that we protect students from the practices of student union bodies who have had their skill level and experience to manage the money effectively questioned. It is also about the fundamental freedoms that all of us in this place often talk about and this time have an opportunity to uphold: a stufreedom of association and freedom of choice. That is what this bill is about. I is imperacommend the bill to the House.",120
123,Ms HOARE,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I rise this afternoon to speak against the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. The Howard government and the Liberal Party have always been opposed to student unionism and student activism. In fact, given the changes this government have brought in recently to higher education, we on this side of the House say the government are plainly against students. The bill arises from a determination by this government to thwart anything associated with the concept of unionism. They hate unionism. They hate solidarity and all that it stands for. In the case of voluntary student unionism, the Tories cannot see past the word ‘union'. We have heard many contributions today from members of the government, including the member for Deakin, that have referred to and made comparisons with workplace relations legislation. That emphasises this ideological bent. This is not the first attempt by the Liberal Party to introduce voluntary student unionism. It has been trying desperately to do so for years. The first real attempt was in Western Australia in the 1970s. Other models have been introduced but have failed to silence students. Student organisations have repeatedly voiced their opposition to Liberal Party attacks on students and universities. The Prime Minister is attempting to silence student organisations because they successfully bring to public attention the antistudent policies of the government. Students have campaigned strongly against the cutting back of billions of dollars of federal funding for universities and the doubling of HECS fees, plus the latest increases of up to 25 per cent that just about every university across this country has accepted, increases in class sizes and university fees for the dumb and the rich. There is a lot of history here. The Liberal Party has been out to quash student organisations for more than 25 years. I wonder how much of this stems from current members of the government who were so unpopular as students because they were Liberals that they could not garner any support from their fellow students in elections. When considering the background to this legislation, we should consider that some past and present members of this parliament and major party organisers came up through the ranks of student organisations, including Kim Beazley, Peter Costello, Chris Ellison, Bob Hawke, Michael Kroger, Tony Nutt, Michael Yabsley and Julia Gillard, to name just a few. Conservative politicians have identified politically orientated student organisations as ripe ground for the propagation of successful and career politicians. Despite the fact that some key and very influential people in the Liberal Party were largely introduced into politics and completed their apprenticeships in these political student bodies, more and more from the progressive side of politics emerge. This attempt and those previously to introduce voluntary student unionism have been designed with the motivation to stunt the growth and learning opportunities of non-conservative activists. The government argues that this legislation is designed to protect the right of people to choose not to belong to an organisation if they choose not to for whatever reason, be it political or otherwise. However, Mr Deputy Speaker, I think you will find that most student organisations will allow any student, on the basis of conscientious objection, to refuse to be a member of their organisation. I know that is the case with organisations at the University of Newcastle. The basis of the student's decision cannot be made on the grounds that they object to the payment of their membership fee. However, they can choose not to have that fee passed on to the student organisation. The compulsory nature of the fee structure upon enrolment does not permit a student to opt out of payment. Instead they are required to pay the fee, and in many cases organisations will allow the equivalent cost of membership to be contributed to a recognised charity of their choice. I think that if we conducted a poll of Australians as to whether they wanted the taxes that they pay to be contributing to the salary of the Minister for Education, Science and Training, many of them would choose to opt out. At this point I think it is important to cuss the precise role of student organisations in student life. Members would be aware that the vast majority of students attending university are there to get an education and do not bother with the political side of student life. However, student organisations still play a vital role in their studies. Being a student without strong financial support from parents and family is pretty tough. This government has made it harder and harder. One of the fees that is paid by students, certainly at the University of Newcastle, goes towards providing subsidised services and facilities on campus. In its attempts to close dissent among students, the Howard government is putting at risk vital services and facilities students, making things harder yet. I would like to spend a little time on the provision of services in universities. I draw my examples from the work of the University of Newcastle Union. This is not a politically active organisation. It is an organisation that provides excellent services and facilities for the students of Newcastle university and charges a fee each year to provide essential services and an environment to make life as a student enjoyable. The union's web site details the benefits of membership: - 15% discount on food within UNU - 10% discount at all UNU Shops - 12.5% discount at all UNU Bars - Internet Access - Clubs and Societies subsidies - Highly subsidised and FREE entertainment The union is not an organisation driven by profit motive. It receives concessions under the taxation laws in recognition of this fact. The organisation exists for the benefit of its members. The provision of services and activities that students want and need is a clear objective of the unions and should never be put into a position of compromise. The discounts offered to members, the clubs and dis- societies, the activities and the support of other aspects of university life are all examples of ways in which the union successfully contributes to the personal, social and cultural development of the students of the University of Newcastle. It is worth noting that, in the event of the withdrawal of a large level of membership fee income through the provisions of this legislation, many of these aspects of the organisation's activities would be jeopardised and would be likely to be severely limited. The reason for this is clear. Students are hard up for funds most of the time. The Howard government has added to these burdens and if there were an opportunity to opt out of a for membership fee then most students would take advantage of that. Under voluntary student unionism, many student organisations will become unviable. Many services and activities will dry up because they are not commercially viable, and a great aspect of student life will disappear. However, those services will still need to be provided. We will see businesses come in and replace existing services and charge market prices, which will be a major disadvantage to students. At many TAFE campuses around the country, private firms operate and provide the catering services required by students. There are large firms operating on numerous campuses. These firms are obviously profit driven. There is nothing wrong with that-they are operating a business that requires a return on their investment. However, choice is limited in order to keep costs down. Items are generally expensive and the length of time one can expect to wait to be served can be considerable. There is a captive market at many university campuses and private service providers are only too keen to take advantage of this. This draws an important distinction between the approach of student unions and that of a private provider. While many student organisations have outsourced particular catering functions, it cannot be expected that a private business which is set up to provide a return for an investment is going to consider the needs of students ahead of profits. On the face of it, the commercial operations of a student organisation may appear to be an attractive proposition for a private interest. Closer examination shows the captive market largely only exists for six months of the year and the need to establish necessary infrastructure would diminish the viability of any expected return. Only an organisation like a student union can properly maintain the services, facilities and activities that it provides for all its members. Proponents of voluntary student unionism will have you believe that the fundamental need for fees and the subsidies they provide to services and facilities that do not necessarily turn a profit cannot be justified because there are unsubsidised, off-campus alternatives to virtually all services and because there are ordinary shops within walking distance of every Australian campus. We recently heard the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, talking in this place about how much cheaper the sausage rolls are off-campus. Minister Nelson should take himself up to Newcastle university and explain to the students there where the shops are that sell these cut-price sausage rolls. The University of Newcastlelike other non-metropolitan campuses, I would think-is isolated from any shops. It is not within walking distance. The entire case of regional universities must be considered separately from metropolitan based campuses, which have different situations and concerns. Then there is the argument of competition. Proponents of voluntary student unionism will say that a student organisation having a monopoly over the provision of services is detrimental to the needs of its consumers or students, as it offers little in the way of choice. For those metropolitan based campuses, where students are able to walk from the union building to off-campus services, this must surely allow for that competitive edge that is considered so necessary. This cannot be applied to most regional campuses though. This legislation is misguided. The government may want to nip in the bud aspiring progressive student political activists, but the collateral damage is the enormous added disadvantage such a move will place on the vast majority of non-politically active students. This is a disgraceful piece of legislation. It should be opposed, and the government should be condemned for it.",120
124,Mr HENRY,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Hasluck) (4.44 pm)Freedom of association is one of the most fundamental freedoms enjoyed by Australians, and I am sure that there are very few within this House today that would disagree with that sentiment. It is therefore somewhat surprising, although I must admit not entirely surprising, that the Labor Party should oppose the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. It was certainly interesting to listen to the comments of the member for Charlton in her speech to the House just now regarding the Liberal Party's view of student activism and student unions. She used the emotive word ‘hate' extensively in her opening remarks, but I think it is those who sit on the opposition benches, the members of the Labor Party, who are the real haters in this House and in this parliament. Labor hates that individuals might have the freedom to choose what organisation or association they might belong to-if such individuals choose to belong to any such associations. In fact, in our communities today workers are deserting unions in droves-they are certainly voting with their feet-and I think it is the same with students: they have no great desire to belong to student unions. It is an absolute nonsense to say that the Liberal Party or the government is opposed to students. Indeed, many students are fully supportive of the initiatives of this government because they, too, stand for freedomfreedom of association and freedom of choice. This bill does not limit freedom of association. It does not seek to abolish the student union movement; nor does it in any way impact on students' rights to join and contribute to their student unions. It requires that this membership should be a conscious choice of the individual student. This is hardly an outrageous expectation. The key word here is ‘choice'. Essential to, and at the heart of, the concept of freedom of association is the right to choose to belong-or, indeed, not to belong-to a union. The government is not anti student unions. Students should be, and indeed are, free to organise and develop representative structures. Nothing in that regard will be changed by this legislation. What will change is that students will be entitled to choose to do so rather than be compelled to do so. Compulsion, by its very nature, removes choice, and the idea that students should be forced to a student union that might have little relevance to their individual beliefs, interests needs is therefore objectionable to many people, including many students that I have spoken to over the years. It is more objectionable when those students are required to hand over anything from $100 to $600 for the privilege, without having a say on how the money is spent and without taking into account the individual's ability to pay. Nor does that requirement take into consideration whether the student is in full-time or part-time education or whether they have a need for the student union services that are provided. In Western Australia many students are disaffected by the political nature of their student unions. Indeed, they are disaffected with the student union office holders that are meant to represent them. An article entitled ‘Shades of racism in campus race' that appeared on 3 November 2004 in the Inside Cover column of the West Australian newspaper helps illustrate this point. It describes the election of an African student to the office of union president and the attempt of the incumbent office holder to prevent him from taking up the role. Despite his being democratically elected, it seems that the idea that a foreigner could be the president of the student guild dismayed the acting president sufficiently for him to involve the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in an effort to prevent the elected student taking office. Such practices bring that student union into disrepute and it is no wonder that in many cases students would prefer not to support or be associated with its activities. The government is absolutely committed to the principles of freedom of associationand to doing something about it. In that context, it is my belief that students have the right to unhindered freedom of association, join as well as to choose the services they want and the causes or organisations they wish to or support. It is absolute anathema to us that students who disagree with the current compulsory nature of student unionism should be in a position whereby they face the very real prospect of expulsion from a university or even the withholding of their examination results. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Upfront Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 seeks to address this issue and remove what is, in my view and the view of many in my electorate, an inequity long overdue for change. It will mean that from next year, 2006, voluntary student unionism will exist throughout Australia, and I for one warmly welcome that development. Essentially, at the core of this bill are very important provisions. Firstly, the bill requires that higher education providers should not make it compulsory for students to become members of student organisations or to pay fees for services and amenities that are not of an academic nature. Secondly, the bill provides that this prohibition on nonacademic fees should not apply to goods and services that are considered essential to the student's course of study provided the student also has the choice-there is that word again-of purchasing those goods or services from an alternative supplier. This legislation will ensure that students, as a condition of enrolment, are no longer forced to pay for goods and services that they have absolutely no use for and, at the end of the day, often can ill afford. Membership of student unions will be optional and universities will no longer be able to charge students for services they do not use or want. Optional membership of student unions would be meaningless if students were still compelled to financially support student organisations through the levying of a general services fee. If that were the case, the question would have to be asked: where would the pressure come from for student guilds to adapt and become more relevant to the people they are meant to serve? In this context, general services fees can be regarded as a form of compulsory association by another name and I therefore welcome the fact that this bill addresses this important issue. In a West Australian newspaper article entitled ‘Student groups condemn move to cut guild funding' which appeared on 17 March 2005, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Australia, Mr Alan Robson, made an assertion that amenity fees should not be abolished because students that were required to pay them did not have to join the student guild. Mr Robson's assertion misses two the point entirely, which is that students should not be made to pay for campus facilities they do not need. Services funded through the general services fee should be run efficiently and competitively. They should meet the actual needs of students and, this being the case, they would, in my opinion, best be provided for on a user-pays, cost-recovery basis, much as happens for services provided by commercial and voluntary organisations throughout the wider community. To ensure compliance and adherence to the two requirements imposed upon them, the bill provides for mandatory penalties for higher education providers breaching the voluntary student unionism policy. Those penalties include a reduction of the basic grant to be paid to the higher education establishment that equates to $100 for every Commonwealth supported place allocated to the provider. It is, therefore, a bill with teeth and one that higher education providers will ignore at their peril and with an eye only to the impact on their bottom line. The effect of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 will be to achieve a number of important outcomes. It was the 17th century European philosopher and Oxford academic, John Locke, who said that the great purpose of law is not to abolish or restrain but to help preserve and enlarge freedom. This bill achieves that high ideal by establishing and enshrining a student's right to freedom of association. It embodies choice and introduces competition to an environment where none existed before. This means that student unions will have to ensure that they remain relevant to their membership and provide services that students need, want and value. Surely such a desirable outcome has to be welcomed by all parties. In essence, students will, of their own volition, join organisations that demonstrate they do a good job of representing the interests of their membership. And, of course, student unions will be able to recruit new members by offering relevant, value for money services to students that are prized by them and can be sustained in the long run. In essence, the bill encourages student unions to enter the real world, rather than continue to be closeted in a world where they exist as a fait accompli, irrespective of their performance and relevance and without any need to be seen to provide value for money. So under the bill a student body has the potential not only to survive but to thrive by being free to recruit members and offering services to students that are valued by them. Of course, those with a vested interest will oppose the idea. After all, you do not have to work particularly hard to ensure you meet the needs of your membership, if membership of the student union is compulsory. Student guilds and others will argue that valuable community facilities, particularly in regional Australia, will be lost. They will argue that the services lost as a result of untary student unionism will put an extra financial burden on universities and that the quality of their educational experience will be diminished as a result. They will argue that student unions are an essential part of university life. In my considered view, these arguments really do not stack up when examined in the cold light of day. I ask the House: is it really reasonable to force students-who most of us would agree are hardly swimming in surplus cash-to subsidise recreational and other facilities for the broader community? In my experience, few students, certainly in the electorate of Hasluck, have the resources to pay for services unconnected to their academic pursuits which, at the end of the day, are not relevant to their personal interests or to the activities they wish to pursue. As the situation stands today, many students are not even aware how their money is being used. I also contend that those regional universities in a position to share campus facilities with their local communities are well placed to spread the cost in a way that is not always available to metropolitan campuses. If facilities are valued by students and local communities, with each contributing to their operating costs, I do not believe that it will automatically follow that voluntary student unionism will have a detrimental impact on those facilities. Nor do I accept the assertions made in the media that voluntary student unionism will damage Australia's ability to win medals at the Olympics and other major sporting events. There is no basis for suggesting that services that are relevant and of interest to students will not continue to enjoy their support and to thrive. Voluntary student unionism does not mean the death knell of student unions or their contribution to university life. Far from it; as I have said, services that are valued by stuvoldents will continue to receive student support. Many sporting clubs and voluntary organisations exist throughout Australia because they offer mutually beneficial services to their membership. There is no compulsion involved and really there is no reason to suppose that university campuses should operate any differently. Individuals on campuses will band together in pursuit of common objectives just as they do everywhere else in this country. I accept that during the period from 1995 to 2002, when Western Australia embraced voluntary student unionism, as a result of the introduction by the state government of the Voluntary Membership of Student Guilds and Associations Act, some services ceased to be provided. However, the reality is that this situation reflected the change and new requirements placed upon student guilds to focus on the services most likely to be valued by their members. Students had a choice to join or not to join and many services that were initially impacted upon recovered over time as they changed and were adjusted to more closely fit with the needs of the students. I and many students in Western Australia regard it as extremely unfortunate that in 2002 the Labor controlled state government saw fit to overturn the legislation on voluntary student unionism through the introduction of a so-called amenities fee. An opinion piece in the West Australian newspaper described this practice as an egregious denial the right of choice and association, as well an inevitable infringement of students' rights. Quite rightly, in my view, the writer points out that the vast majority of students attend universities primarily to undertake academic courses and further their career prospects. So there can be no justification for hindering them from doing so by demanding payment of fees that have nothing to do with their courses. The article goes on to assert that any university that makes the payment of such amenity fees a condition of enrolment contributes to the diminishing of tertiary education. There can be no excuse for holding the future of our young people to ransom in such an unnecessary, unwarranted and unwelcome way. If student guilds are providing essential services for students, they should be able to attract members without any need for compulsion. If they cannot do so, it means that today's student union movement has, in essence, little relevance to its membership and therefore you have to ask the question: does it deserve a place on university campuses? I do not believe that this is the case and I therefore suggest to this House that there really is no need to enshrine student guilds as enclaves of unwarranted compulsion. Make no mistake about it: the move to reintroduce compulsion in Western Australia, which means that every student has no choice but to pay around $100 or more to fund the student guild, was a very definite and unwelcome step backwards for the rights of students who are once again forced to pay an up-front fee for something that is totally unrelated to their academic studies. Interestingly, though, it seems that the WA student guilds may have learnt a valuable lesson during Western Australia's period of voluntary student unionism. In an article entitled ‘Student guilds in survival bid' that appeared in the West Australian on 3 November 2004, of the then University of Western Australia as guild president was quoted as saying that strategies were being discussed to make sure better provisions were made for the onset of a return to voluntary student unionism. From my point of view such pragmatism is certainly very welcome. It is unfortunate, but fairly predictable, that the Labor Party does not seem to share that pragmatism. It seems to me that at both a state and federal level Labor is determined to oppose the right of students to exercise choice and also deny them their fundamental right to freedom of association. Opponents of this bill must surely recognise that students should not be made to pay for services they do not want. I have heard the argument put forward that by legislating for voluntary student unionism the government is in effect making an assault on academic freedom. In my view and the view of most reasonable people, the student's right to freedom of association by far overrides the right of a university or higher education provider to ride roughshod over it. The concept of academic freedom does not give the university the right or indeed the justification to interfere in the lives of their students in a way that is outside their mandate. This government is committed to the principle of freedom of association, and this bill will finally give students that right, which is already enjoyed by the wider community. On that basis I support this bill and I commend it to the House.",123
125,Ms CORCORAN,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Isaacs) (5.02 pm)The Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 is designed to prohibit compulsory student unionism. Firstly, it will prevent higher education providers, mainly universities, from making membership of a student organisation a condition of enrolment. Secondly, the bill will prevent higher education providers from making a condition of enrolment the payment of any fee that is not directly related to a course of study. The government has a long standing commitment to prohibit compulsory student unionism in universities. One cannot help but wonder if the term ‘union' is the thing that is the real problem here. The use of the name ‘union' in association with students at university has been described as a historical accident. The earliest student organisations evolved out of the Oxford and Cambridge debating unions that were founded around 1815. These organisations grew and developed wider roles, but the name stuck and has since been adopted by other universities. Student organisations can be better likened to local councils-everyone pays for the provision of services and the services are available for everyone to use. On campus services provided by student fees go towards such things as student study spaces, free computers, free room hire, advocacy, representation, legal advice, student development opportunities, email addresses and access to sport and recreation facilities. The argument put in favour of this legislation is that current arrangements impinge on a student's right to freedom of association. That argument has been put to rest by many authorities including the full court of the Supreme Court of Victoria in Clark v the University of Melbourne and by the full court of the Supreme Court of South Australia in Harradine v the University of Adelaide. The full court of the Supreme Court of Victoria held: The essence of the University's powers is that they are powers of self-government affecting only those who choose to become members by enrolment ... they cannot touch anyone who does not voluntarily bring himself within their reach. The full court of the Supreme Court of South Australia said: The suggestion that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is at all relevant to the issue here is not sound. In the Adelaide case it was also said that Adelaide University Union is a body providing services to members of the university. The learned trial judge noted that a student union is ‘not a union of the kind well known in the industrial and commercial world'. He went on to note that a student union is a ‘club providing facilities for eating, sport and other activities'. It is clear that a student union is not a union in the industrial relations sense at all. There is also the argument that students are forced to pay fees for services that they will not use and that their fees will be used in activities, particularly political activities, that the student disapproves of. The current Treasurer of Australia has put paid to that argument. He commented on the issue of compulsory student union fees way back in his Monash University days. He said: The funding and therefore provision of ... services would be impossible unless there was some requirement to pay a contribution ... He also said: The facilities of student unions are only practical on the basis of compulsory contributions. Those are the Treasurer's own words! In fact, the Treasurer went on to qualify his statement and illustrate it with an example. He said: The fact that some people object to the way in which some public funds are spent does not mean that they are therefore exempted from paying taxes. Treasurer, you are absolutely right. In our society we all pay taxes and share the costs of the use of services and resources, and a university is no different. The Minister for Education, Science and Training is mistaken when he says that students should enjoy the same consumer rights enjoyed by other Australians. Citizens of a democratic country generally do not have a choice about where their particular tax dollar goes. This so-called freedom of choice is an illusion. If such logic were applied to taxes, people could refuse to pay for roads they do not use and so on. The way to direct where our taxes go is through the appropriate ballot box. Simply making the tax or fee voluntary is a nonsense. We do not do it for government taxes. We do not allow doctors to opt out of paying their medical registration fees on the grounds of freedom of association. We do not allow teachers to opt out of paying registration fees. Last year many vice-chancellors were in Canberra, and MPs and senators were invited to meet with them informally. I took this opportunity to ask a number of vice-chancellors about this bill. The response was unanimous and slightly bemused: the bill is nonsense, it should never have been introduced and it certainly should not be supported. Swinburne University of Technology, my old stamping ground, has written asking me not to support this bill. I will read some of their letter: One of the main outcomes of this Bill will be to significantly reduce the range and quality of services (including academic, cultural, sporting and social services) offered to university students within Australia. It will also diminish the facilities and environments in which they are studying. This will further threaten the Higher Education export market (currently worth $8 billion), as Australia becomes less attractive to overseas students, leaving room for competitors from other countries to take market share. There are, however, further issues connected to the Bill which need to be addressed. The first is that the Bill confuses two separate issues-that of the general service fee (GSF) which is levied on students at all universities to pay for a range of amenities and services, and that of compulsory student unionism. These two matters are separate and need to be managed appropriately. Swinburne goes on: The next is that the name of the Bill is somewhat misleading. In Victoria, in accordance with the Tertiary Education Act 1993, there are no Compulsory Up-Front Student Union Fees to abolish. Victoria does not have compulsory student unionism and certainly at Swinburne, Student Union membership is an individual choice, and not linked to enrolment. Under the Bill, the general service fee (GSF) is swept away and Swinburne will effectively lose $4 million in resources per year and risks not being able to provide critical services to our students. Activities such as student advocacy, orientation, transition and mentoring programs, on-line support services and infrastructure and facility support are currently provided by GSF funds, which complement and enhance our students' studies. If this bill passes, the result will be a reduction in services offered by student organisations across our university campusesservices such as student employment services, child care, welfare services, orientation and transition to university, student loans, accommodation services, subsidised meals and access to sport and leisure activities. All these services are important to the well-being of our students. It is obvious that not all students will use all the services all the time, but that is not the point. The services are there for students to use if the need arises or if they choose to do so. Student associations have traditionally nurtured the future leaders of this country. Many members from both sides of this House were involved in their student union or association. Beyond fostering leadership, student associations hold activities and functions that allow diverse groups of people to meet and socialise. People who attend university come from regional areas, interstate and overseas. The transition from high school to university leaves many students feeling vulnerable and isolated. The university or post high school years are very important to a young person's future. It is where they begin to shed their adolescent skin and shape and mould themselves into well balanced, knowledgeable adults prepared and able to contribute to our society. Student associations allow individuality to develop, and foster an appreciation of differences. They cultivate an atmosphere of tolerance and allow students a chance to excel in their academic and social lives. I will read a letter I received from a constituent who is determined to see this bill fail: I am writing to you to voice my opposition to the Federal Governments proposal to prohibit universities from collecting a compulsory general service fee (GSF) from universities for services supporting students. As a former student of La Trobe University (Bundoora campus) I have been through the tertiary education process where GSFs are compulsory. I believe I speak on behalf of the majority of students when I say that I would not have experienced many of the benefits I did without the subsidies the university has provided through the GSF system. I continued my sporting career throughout university as it was made affordable to me. In fact I still play soccer for La Trobe University (now unsubsidised of course) despite not being a student for the past nine years. The life time friends which are made by being part of a social club plus the social and business skills learnt along the way are invaluable. None of this would have happened had GSF been voluntary as I strongly believe that the funds would not have been available to continue to run these clubs and activities. Please ensure the general service fees remain compulsory so that the quality and diversity of the tertiary experience continues. This bill is all about silencing student organisations. It is about retribution, plain and simple, because student associations dare to speak out against funding cuts to universities-funding cuts which have led to increased class sizes and to 20,000 qualified students per year being turned away from our universities. Turning away qualified students is a waste of our most precious resourceour own abilities and talents. This bill is about retribution because student associations do not want students paying an extra 25 per cent for HECS and they say so. This bill is about retribution because student associations do not want to pay full fees for undergraduate courses and they say so. Student associations understand the importance of access to education for all those who are interested and qualified, not just for those with deep pockets. The government knows all too well that university students can see straight through the recent changes in university financial arrangements and can understand very clearly the destructive nature of them. Students know that this government is intent on wrecking the future of many of our young people by denying them access to a university education. In destroying the future of many young people the government is also putting at risk the future of our society. We need all the skills and resources we can muster to thrive into the future. To deny a tertiary education to those students with the capacity and the desire for further education is to waste our resources both on an individual basis and on a community basis. The Minister for Education, Science and Training has said that if this legislation is passed students will be better able to manage their own financial affairs. That is an absolutely outrageous claim to make, given that he and the federal government are not really concerned about the welfare of our students, considering the havoc they have wreaked upon our higher education system. This bill does not enjoy the support of those at the coalface. Every university and peak university body in the country has given this bill the thumbs down. This bill is all about the government annoyed at a body speaking out against government actions. The government cannot control the voices of our students so it is intent on silencing them. It is trying to do this by removing student unions. It is worth noting in passing that the government is so afraid of collective student action that it has produced a very second-rate piece of legislation. A consequence of this bill-and it is probably unintended-will be that universities will no longer be able to issue fees for things such as parking and library services. To summarise: supporters of this bill are trying to get rid of student unions for ideological reasons. I make the point that student unions are not the same as industrial unions and that the government's obsession with unions is blinding it to the reality of what student unions really do. The government argues that compulsory student fees force some students to pay for services they do not use. Once again, I cannot do any better than to quote the current Treasurer when he was wearing another hat and explained that provision of services would be impossible without a requirement on all students to contribute. Every part of this bill is awful-not merely from an ideological perspective but from a functional and practical one. I will not be supporting this legislation.",128
126,Mr MICHAEL FERGUSON,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"It is turning into a long day of debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Upfront Student Union Fees) Bill 2005. Many speakers have preceded me and, looking at the speakers list, I see there are many yet to come. I do not want to sound snobby about this but there is a lot of interest in this bill from both sides of the chamber. I rise to strongly support this bill. I am proud to support this bill. I believe in freedom of association; anyone in this place who opposes the bill clearly does not. For all the rhetoric we have heard, this bill is not based on a narrow political ideology; it is not wedge politics; it is not returning favours to any sections of the community. This government does not do that-unlike our opponents when they have had the opportunity to be in government. This legislation is based on a simple mainstream belief that is held by the peoples of every free nation around the globe, and that is that everybody should have the freedom to associate with people or organisations of their own choice and nobody should be forced to associate with people or organisations against their will. So this issue is really about quite a simple principle, and one which I am somewhat surprised we are contesting and debating here today. I cannot see how people can stand up and proudly oppose a bill that contains a measure that simply seeks to enact this belief. My party, the Liberal Party, is guided by firm principles. Some 60 years ago the organisation's founders set down ideals which today would cause us to stop higher education providers-that is, universities-from forcing their students to become members of student organisations or at least from forcing them to pay fees for services and amenities that are not of an academic nature. We are talking about paying for things that do not necessarily relate to the purpose of attending a university. We are talking about fees and charges for services that are not essential to obtaining a higher education. Today I have been respectfully listening to some of the comments from members of the opposition who strongly oppose this bill. Some of the arguments being used-I think, to defend the indefensible-are very difficult to accept for anybody around Australia who is able to listen to the broadcast of this debate or read it later in Hansard. How can you describe child care as an essential service? Child care is an important service for a lot of people. It has been important in the past for my family. But, in the context of a university education, you simply cannot say with very much credibility that it is essential. Of course it is important for many; but, like the sporting examples we have heard of, such as the rugby club at Sydney University, it is not an essential service. It is important for those who need and want to enjoy campus life in that way but there is no defensible reason for the entire body of students to be forced against their will to subsidise and pay for those services for other people. I think the previous speaker is one of the Labor Party's better advocates, because she argues in such a respectful and dignified way. But I still think it is difficult to defend her opposition to the bill. She said that this bill is retribution against students who have protested against this government in the past. It is true that student organisations around Australia have very loudly protested against many of the important reform measures that this government has introduced over nine years, including the GST, industrial relations and issues that have nothing to do with campus life. However, the Howard government, and I as an individual, have no problem with people protesting and expressing their opinion on any issue. In fact, this legislation will do nothing to water down students' ability to collectively organise, if that is their wish, and protest on any issue they like, providing that it is done in a law-abiding way. Forcing people to pay is a breach of basic human rights. The previous speaker compared university fees to taxes. Federal and state taxes are applied to everybody in the Australian community. We all pay taxes in accordance with the same rules and we may often think to ourselves that we are paying for services and government spending that we do not use or want. The argument being applied by the previous speaker was that university fees that would go to student organisations could be viewed in the same way and therefore there is a good reason why they should be compulsory. With respect, this argument is totally unsustainable. You are comparing an educational institution with a sovereign, elected government-so there the comparison ends. No university should be ascribed the status and the ability to make decisions on behalf of other people that belong to a government. Every person should have the right to choose the goods and services they want and the causes they are prepared to support. I would like to make it clear again that I am not opposed to student organisations. They can be an exciting form of democracy in which students are able to represent their members, the students, and to undertake advocacy-and even, if they are able to do so using the resources they do have, to provide services which will benefit their members. The passing of this bill will not stop or impede that sort of voluntary activity. In fact, I would argue today that this bill actually reinforces it and encourages a form of student engagement which is far more dynamic and meaningful-voluntary and loyal membership. If I were the head of an organisation and I had the choice between having a membership of people who were paying toward the costs of that organisation and a membership of people who perhaps had no choice as to whether or not they contributed to the running costs of the organisation, I would feel very much as though I were leading an organisation that had a very reluctant membership in the latter case. There is not a status in that; there is certainly not much pride; and there is zero dignity in it. I would rather lead an organisation that had a membership of people who were committed to the central causes that made that organisation exist in the first place. I would rather have a membership of people who believed in the need and the legitimacy of that organisation. It is almost like an arranged marriage as things are-two reluctant partners stuck with each other and forced to make it work out as best they can. As we should all know as mature adults, a good, healthy marriage-a healthy relationship-is where there is mutual affection and mutual loyalty. Student organisations will always be free to recruit members and offer services to students. If the students want them, they will buy them. If they want those services but perhaps can find a better deal elsewhere, they should be able to choose them and buy those without being told where to purchase. Conversely, if they do not want those services, if they do not need them, if they are not a part of their academic program at the university or higher education provider, they should be excused from paying for them. I say here today that the National Union of Students is totally out of touch with this nation's student population. I represented the University of Tasmania's Launceston campus as a delegate to the NUS in the early 1990s. I was in a distinct minority by choosing to be an independent. Most others were disturbingly close to-or active members of-the Australian Labor Party and some others were close to that ragtag group of Democrats and, when that disintegrated, really became followers of the Greens. While the odd protest against the government of the day was quite normal, to be expected, it was really an annual event. The union tried to rally its members to always put the Liberals last at elections. It was in reality a Trojan horse for the lot of Labor Party. The arrangement between the Labor Party, unions like the NUS and campus guilds, unions and associations is one of the best examples we have today of mutual obligation-even before the advent of the Howard government and our social compact. Labor needed the union-and, let us face it, the union needed Labor. Both consequently totally lost touch with the real world. They have lost touch with real students and they have totally lost touch with the real needs of students. I can see again today evidence of how true that still is today. I again say to my Labor colleagues that you are defending the indefensible so long as you stand in the way of freedom of association, whether it be in schools, clubs, churches, businesses, trade unions or university campuses. To stop a student or an individual person from having that innate right to choose whom they will associate with is indefensible and to be condemned. I would also say that the National Union of Students is far too closely aligned to the ALP and the Greens-parties that say they fight for the people's best interests. I do not believe that this is the case. They want to force people to pay student union fees-with or without their support, permission, involvement or loyalty. As most tertiary education students in this country will tell you, money is very tight and every purchase is a very considered and careful decision. Cashstrapped students need to have the flexibility to spend their money on what they want to spend it on. Let us face it: if students really believe that services that university unions, guilds and associations have on offer to their members are worthwhile, they should be free to purchase them, not forced to do so. If students actually believe that university union services are worthwhile, they will willingly pay for them. Equally, if they are worthwhile, the student unions should have the courage to market them and to take the same business decisions that every other commercial entity around Australia has to take: to market their product, to run a proper business plan, to not run and offer services and spending that are wasteful and to try to meet their market-in the case of universities, to try to meet the needs of the students in relation to whom they have an excellent marketing opportunity, a captive audience, to whom they can advertise their various wares and services. Student union presidents who claim that they will be shut down with legislation obviously have no confidence in the services they provide. Without naming the person, I want to mention that quite recently I received an email from an advocate for stopping voluntary student unionism. I had to be quite honest and blunt and say: If services provided by student unions such as yours are valuable services for students, then dents will naturally be willing to choose them and they will pay whatever chargeable fees are set by your union. I then asked: Are you firm in your opinion that providing this choice to students will cause you to shut down? If so, perhaps you may agree that it is unreasonable to force students to pay for a service or organisation that is, in your own words, unsustainable. Good on him for writing to me. At least he had the courage to make his claim. That email was the only opinion that I received in my office-by email, post or fax-that actually came from a student who resides in my electorate. And I have two higher education institutions, with some thousands of students, in my electorate. So I am not opposed to student organisations. I have been in one. I just want to see value for money. Figures compiled in 2003 looking at compulsory student union fees around the country showed the national average for 39 institutions was $280, which are substantial funds for a young person or a mature age student to have to find at the beginning of the university year when there are also various other expenses such as accommodation, textbooks and levies payable for the courses they have chosen. I am very amused also with some of the claims that we heard from the member for Melbourne Ports earlier today, which somehow said that the Howard government, in wanting to introduce this bill and see it carried forward, was attacking freedom of speech. So we see that member doing something which I think is unreasonable in an argument-that is, playing off these two important principles of freedom speech and freedom of association. But the two can validly be upheld: we are not choosing freedom of association over freedom of speech, because this government believes that we can have both and that we should have both and stuthat a student, irrespective of what their political or life views might be, ought to have the right to join a union if they want to and the right to not join a union if they do not want to. Also, whether or not they are a member of a union or an organisation that represents students, they should have the right to freedom of speech. Nothing I do in this chamber will diminish that freedom that I believe in. I want to draw the House's attention to some material from the National Union of Students. Again, that is an organisation that I used to be a member of. On 22 April a posting on their web site claimed: As with all regressive changes to the Higher Education sector, the impact of Voluntary Student Unionism legislation will not fall equally on students. The person who wrote the article concerned has not put their name to it, but it is an official document from NUS. It further states: Student organisations are of specific and direct benefit to women students in a myriad of ways, therefore attempts to destroy them hit women particularly hard. Viva la revolution! This will liberate women on campus and give women more choices because they will be able to choose to pay for union membership if that is their wont, and if that is in their best interests they can do that. This government will be doing something for those women students by providing them with a choice that they do not have today, but which they will have as soon as this bill, which we have presented so often in this parliament, gets passed in the Senate. The NUS web site also said that around 350 students attended the activities held on the University of New England National Day of Action and found out more about the implications of the VSU legislation currently before federal parliament. The NUS web site has a picture of a poster which advertised the event and told everybody to come. In two photographs associated with this story you can perhaps see the number of people who were there, which looks like a couple of dozen, not 350. This is further evidence of that union's inability to engage in this debate in a cognisant and sensible manner. The NUS also supplied protesters with suggested chants that they could use on the National Day of Action on 28 April: ‘VSU no way, we are going to fight it all the way.' That is a good one. ‘VSU is not a choice. It destroys the student voice.' ‘VSU is not a choice. Give the students back their voice.' And the ripper, which I think really goes to explain the purpose of the National Day of Action and, indeed, the purpose of this unall ion: ‘Unions yes, Liberals no. VSU has got to go.' My time is about to expire, so I thank the House. I commend this bill to the House and I call on Labor and members opposite to withdraw their fanatical opposition to this bill and to support the rights of the people they were put here to represent.",131
127,Mr BEVIS,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"The government's official spin on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005 is that it is somehow related to civil liberties, human rights and freedom of choice. In fact, the bill has little to do with any of those things. Every now and then government members let slip what is indeed the real motivation behind this bill when they launch into their typical tirade about student guilds, student unions, student councilshowever they are named-on university campuses daring to be involved in public debate and public comment, usually taking a position contrary to that of the Liberal Party of Australia. For that they have been condemned and for that they are being punished now. I want to refer to a very interesting letter I received which outlined some concerns about this bill. I challenge members opposite to listen to me read the letter and to identify where it came from. The letter said that the: ... proposal to reduce already inadequate Commonwealth support for the University is an unwarranted interference in the affairs of the University. If promulgated in its present form, the legislation could do irreparable damage to the University and particularly to its international competitiveness. That was a letter from the Chancellor and the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland. Who is the Chancellor of the University of Queensland? It is Sir Llewellyn Edwards, former leader of the Liberal Party in the state of Queensland, former Deputy Premier to former Premier Bjelke-Petersen. It was also signed by the Vice-Chancellor, Professor John Hay, a well respected academic. Llew Edwards, one of the high priests of the Liberal Party in Queensland, understands clearly the implications of the madness of this government's legislation if it is enacted. He understands the impact on the university and on the services available for the staff and the wider community at the university and he thinks that is more important than the blind Liberal dogma that we have witnessed here in this debate and seen evidenced in the contribution of a number of members. The letter from the University of Queensland's Senate is illustrative in a number of respects and I want to refer to a couple of other passages in it: The Senate of the University of Queensland is very strongly opposed to the Commonwealth Government's alarming proposals in relation to voluntary student unionism and compulsory student service charges. That is the first sentence. Let there be no mistake where Llew Edwards and the Senate of the University of Queensland stand. They are strongly opposed to these proposals. Later on the letter sets out some of the important services and functions that the various student bodies perform. Many of those things have been covered during the debate today. The letter also refers to the important role that those student bodies play in the educational development of the students as part of their university life. If time permits, I may return to quote some of that letter. They also note quite correctly that student clubs and societies are a part of the great tradition of Western universities. I have seen in other material the comment that, if this legislation goes through, Australia will be the only country in the Western world to have outlawed these compulsory student fee payments. I have endeavoured to get that checked on a number of occasions. I have not been able to determine absolutely that it is accurate, but it does appear to be the case. Certainly, as Llew Edwards and Professor John Hay point out, it is the tradition in Western universities for there to be compulsory student organisations that the students participate in, not just for the delivery of important services but as part of the development of those people at universities, not all but many of whom are transiting through life from youth to adulthood and will be leaders of our community in years to come. That is important. If Llew Edwards, one of the high priests of the Liberal Party in Queensland, can understand that, it beggars belief that few on the government side either cannot comprehend it or, if they do comprehend it, fail to have the intestinal fortitude to stand up and do something about it. The letter that I received from Llew Edwards that I was quoting from has in fact been sent to every member of the federal parliament from Queensland and to the minister. The parliamentary secretary at the table, the member for Petrie, no doubt has a copy. I am sure she has read it and I look forward to her contribution to this debate, answering the letter from Llew Edwards and explaining why he, as one of the senior, respected political figures in Queensland-and a senior Liberal figure to boot-has got it wrong. I suspect the parliamentary secretary is not about to give up her job and cross the floor to vote with us on this, so she may like to enter the debate and explain to us why the people of Petrie should find themselves lost in this debate. It is not just the Liberal Party in Queensland that is led by people who understand the importance of student services on campus. Not that long ago, on 29 April, I was interested to note a statement from the leader of the opposition in the Queensland parliament, the leader of the Queensland National Party, Lawrence Springborg. The Courier Mail reported on that day: Queensland Nationals leader Lawrence Springborg has broken from conservative ranks to call for major changes to the Federal Government's voluntary student unionism legislation. The article quoted him saying: I think there is a strong case for a compulsory levy otherwise genuine student services will fer, particularly in regional areas ... That is Lawrence Springborg, the leader of the National Party in the Queensland parliament and the leader of the opposition in the Queensland parliament. So we have here two prominent Queenslanders, leaders in their own right of conservative parties, the Liberal Party in the case of Llew Edwards and the National Party in the case of Lawrence Springborg, both coming out publicly and saying that this government's approach with respect to compulsory fees at university is wrong and, worse than that, is damaging to the life of the university. Indeed, the University of Queensland, in the letter from Llew Edwards, went on to point out that it is going to create problems for them as they endeavour to market themselves to students overseas because the services provided by these student guilds and bodies are often regarded as essential by overseas students and those who pay for the overseas students to come here. They are concerned that the University of Queensland will be placed at a disadvantage when those students look around the world because, unlike the rest of the universities in the Western world, they will find that these services are not available to students here in Australia if this legislation goes through. Why is that the case? We need look no further than the comments of some opposite when they were in a different life. Treasurer Peter Costello no less, when he was at university, was not only an activist in his student association but also the president of it. He was the president of the Monash Association of Students. He wrote an article about the threat to universities should compulsory charges be removed. This is what Peter Costello wrote in that article: The funding and therefore provision of the various student services would be impossible unless sufthere was some requirements to pay a contribution towards them. … … … ... the facilities of the student unions are only practical on the basis of compulsory contributions ... That was no less a person than Peter Costello, the Treasurer of Australia today, when he was president of the Monash association-when he was actually at university, involved in an association and understanding on a day-today basis the services they provide and the way those services are funded and operate. That is the view he had then. He is quite silent about it these days. He has his mind set on other activities at the momenthe is trying to topple the Prime Minister and have a bit of generational change within the Liberal cabinet room. But when he was the president of the student guild at Monash University, he made no bones about this issue. He made it clear that, without the compulsory payment, these services would not exist. That reinforces the concern that people like Llew Edwards and Lawrence Springborg have raised. These are not people whom government members can characterise as left wing radicals or unionists trying to bring down the world as we know it. If you listen to some of the nonsense from people on the other side, they would have us believe that university student guilds were hotbeds of anarchy. It is a fairly amusing thing for those of us who were involved in student politics, and I have to confess that I was very active in student politics as well. There are people on both sides of this chamber who were. Unlike Peter Costello, I hold the views about the importance of those organisations that I held then. Like Llew Edwards and Lawrence Springborg, I appreciate the importance that they provide on campus for a whole range of reasons. This is not the first time John Howard and his government have sought to introduce legislation such as this. A similar-probably identical, in fact-piece of legislation was introduced into this parliament in 1999 which evoked the same negative response from all of those involved with universities, and by that I do not mean the student guilds and unions that those opposite want to lambast. One university union went bankruptyes, that happened. We can talk about companies that go bankrupt. Does that mean we should close down the operations of boards of directors around the country? We can talk about company directors that are behind bars because of their improper behaviour. Does that mean we should be taking drastic action to close down corporate Australia? The simple fact is that there are going to be some people who want to bend rules and cut corners. That happens everywhere, but please do not pretend in this debate that they are representative of the student guilds and unions around Australia. That is such a fallacious argument-it does no credit to those in the Liberal and National parties who have raised it. Let me go back to when this issue was raised in 1999. Who came out then to oppose the legislation? There were people like Sir Gerard Brennan, the former Chief Justice of the High Court, and Steve Monaghetti, the well-known Australian Olympian and marathon runner. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee opposed it, and I believe they are opposed to it on this occasion. Not only were people outside the parliament on the record as opposing it; in 1999, at least, there were a few Tories in this parliament who were willing to stand up and publicly criticise itpeople who today are silent. Mr Murphy-Name them.",135
128,Mr BEVIS,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"I am invited by my friend the member for Lowe to name them, and I think I should. In 1999 those people on the government benches for the Liberal and National parties who thought that this was a bad thing and said so publicly were: Ian Macfarlane, the member for Groom, now a minister; Kay Hull, the member for Riverina; Joanna Gash, the member for Gilmore; and a member who is now an Independent, Bob Katter, the member for Kennedy. So members of the Liberal and National parties were saying publicly that this was the wrong tack to take, it would damage the role of universities, it would damage the services available and it would diminish the experience of students as they progressed through tertiary education. I wonder what has happened to people like Ian Macfarlane, Kay Hull and Joanna Gash these days-not a peep out of them. At least people like Llew Edwards have the intestinal fortitude and integrity to stand up and publicly say this is the wrong thing to do. There is even Lawrence Springborg from the National Party. You do not hear me saying too many positive things about the Queensland National Party, but at least the Queensland National Party are led by someone who understands that his constituents are going to be hurt by this. A couple of weeks ago I spoke at a rally against this proposition on the campus of the Queensland University of Technology. I made the point then that it is really bewildering to see the National Party jumping off the cliff like lemmings on this issue. They have done it on other things; there is no reason why they should not do it on this. It is not passing amusement that they are referred to these days as ‘Liberals in gumboots', but their constituents are actually seriously affected. One of the critical services most student guilds and unions provide is accommodation and other support for people who are moving into the area of the university. They might be moving from, say, the outskirts of Brisbane into the city and need assistance with accommodation or job placement. They might need to know where there are doctors who bulk-bill, because most university students do not have a lot of cash. They may need other counselling support and services. Because they are away from their home base, they may need some advice on the operation of their university and, from time to time, advocacy support if things go wrong. One of the groups that use those services more than others are, in fact, the people from the bush who come to the city for their tertiary education. Lawrence Springborg is smart enough to understand that. You would hope that cocky corner on the other side of the House could wake up before the vote occurs and realise that their constituents are going be adversely affected if they mutely sit on their hands. But I would have to say that, given their performance on a number of issues-not least of all the sale of Telstra-we will see the National Party trot along with the Liberal Party and support this bill. During this debate, members on this side of the House have referred to the idea of mutual obligation and the fact that it is not uncommon in our society for people to be obliged to make a contribution if, indeed, they receive a benefit from an organisation. We would not be here as a parliament and a government if we did not subscribe to that principle, because it is on that basis that we tax people whether they like it or not. It is on that basis that state and local governments for tax people whether they like it or not. I have listened to comments from government members who are critical of that. There are a few lawyers on the other side of this parliament. I just wonder what they say about the compulsory fees they have to pay to their law societies. Should that be the next bill we introduce? If this is about freedom of choice, civil liberties and human rights, why is it that we tolerate a situation where lawyers have to make a contribution to an organisation whether they want to or not? Because there is a good reason for that: it ensures a standard; there is a collective benefit. As a society we accept the view that, if you get the benefit, you should make a contribution. There was another very good comparison made, I think by one of the student union activists in an article recently, which perhaps was better than those already made in this debate. It is the situation that applies in Queensland, and perhaps elsewhere, of the ambulance levy. I think people would agree that the ambulance service is an essential service. Our society could not really function in a civilised manner without it. In Queento sland, until quite recently ambulance contributions were voluntary. As a consequence, the ambulance service was dramatically underfunded. So you would go to your shopping centre on Saturday and there would be a chook ruffle or a chocolate wheel, and the ambulance guys would be out there trying to raise a few bob to make sure they had equipment for their ambulances that, frankly, are an essential service. The Beattie government, quite properly, put an end to voluntary contributions. They said: ‘This is an essential service and we are going to place a levy on people to cover it. Everyone will make a contribution, which will guarantee an appropriate level of resourcing for the ambulance service.' We heard some of the same arguments then from people in the community. Frankly, I supported that decision by the Queensland government. Everybody should be making a contribution to the operation of the ambulance service. None of us particularly want to be in a situation where we need it, but it is proper that we all make a contribution to it. Today I do not hear anyone in Queensland arguing the reverse of that. I do not hear anybody hopping up to say, ‘We should abolish that because really it is a question of freedom of choice, human rights and civil liberty.' The argument before the parliament today is about something far broader. It is not about the things that the government have put forward in the debate. It is in fact this: John Howard and this government will not tolerate dissent; they will not tolerate alternative voices in our community. We have seen it in the rhetoric of those opposite when the emotions start to run high The student unions happen to be the latest group in the firing line for that; they are not the first people encounter it. It has happened to the environmental groups. It has happened to social groups who have had their funding cut or threatened. It has happened to church groups who dare to complain that the welfare system in this country has got worse. It has happened to the ABC-they were being bludgeoned to death by this government. Now the government are directing their weaponry at the student unions, because they erate voices of dissent and alternative thought. That is fundamentally wrong and is one of the most insidious things this government have done since they came to office. I oppose this bill wholeheartedly. It may well be that the bill will go through after 1 July, but it will be at great cost to universities throughout Australia. If people opposite do not want to listen to Labor members, they should listen to the wise heads in their own Liberal and National parties on this issue.

130,Mr BEAZLEY,HIGHER EDUCATION SUPPORT,"Our great country is about to enter the second decade of conservative rule. History will mark 1996 to 2006 as the Liberal-National government's decade of deception: year after year of lowering the ‘truth' bar, then deliberately crawling under it, with one common theme-the government deceive and Australians pay. But this year we have learned why the government to have been so deceitful. We uncover their motive with each new economic indicatorwith one of the highest foreign debt levels in the world, with a record current account deficit, with household debt rising and rising-and with the tragedy of a government that turns away tens of thousands of Australians from TAFE colleges whilst the Treasurer makes a virtue in his budget speech of importing skills from overseas to make up will not tol- for the difference. Sadly, we are learning the truth. They have squandered this chance to make Australia secure for our children and grandchildren. They have surfed a wave of prosperity but left the tough decisions to future generations. When we hoped they would get better, they got worse. Tuesday's budget centrepiece is an injustice of the highest order. Instead of leading Australia through reforms the OECD and Reserve Bank, among others, tell us we ought to have, instead of preparing Australia for the next phase of growth by investing in training Australians and in infrastructure like roads, rail, water and ports-and in tax reform which encourages people into the Australian work force-the budget savaged the weakest in our society and contemptuously dismissed those nurses, teachers, tradesmen, labourers-the people raising our families, 80 per cent of our taxpayers, seven million Australians, the engine room of Australia. They received no tax cuts last year or this year and in the next three they get a derisory $6 a week-nothing to encourage those out of the work force into it but for a minority a tax cut which, for the first time in my memory, takes those of us in this parliament out of the top tax bracket with 10 times the reward of our fellow Australians. If you think anyone here of Labor principle would vote ourselves a $65 weekly tax cut when the people who put us here get $6, you have got another think coming. It is not leadership to cheer this through. What leadership means is that when you are confronted with something like this you stand up and fight. That is what we will do. I will do so in the context of a budget of lost opportunity. It comes at a time when Australia is enjoying its highest export prices since Don Bradman retired from captaining Australia half a century ago. The minerals boom that underpins our economy has nothing to do with the policies of this government. Good fortune has added $40 billion per year to our national income. That is the equivalent of a $7,000 bonus for every Australian family, every year. But a responsible leader looks out to the horizon, sizes up the future threats to the nation and prepares it for risks. Before the budget, the question for Australia was: what would we do with this singular opportunity? Would we invest it in something that lasts? Would we take this extraordinary opportunity to repair what is broken in our nation? This is a question of our values: what and who would come first in our Australia? This budget has failed the Australian people because it fails to act upon urgent challenges facing the nation. It does nothing new to ease our chronic skill shortage. It does nothing new to fix our ports and roads. It does nothing new to support research and development. It does nothing new to support our universities. It does nothing new to solve the water crisis. It does nothing new to lift our exports. Fairer tax reforms But before I get on to those matters, I want to deal with the first order of business: taxation. Tonight I am drawing a line in the sand with John Howard on Australian values and the sort of country we want to be, a line between us and this government, which says someone earning $500,000 a year deserves 10 times the tax cut of an Australian earning $50,000 a year. A lot of Australians think that John Howard's tax plan is terribly unfair. I will expose it for what it is and oppose it for what it is. I will not accept criticism from a greedy government for standing up for the seven million Australian taxpayers who were tossed the tax cut scraps from the tax cut feast enjoyed by so few Australians. The Labor Party will be the last line of defence between John Howard and his desire to divide the Australian community-reward some and punish the many. The Treasurer got a big cheer from the Liberal Party backbench on Tuesday night when he announced a whopping big tax cut on their super, and he got a huge cheer when he announced that these same politicians would be exempt from the top income tax rate. He was offering them a massive tax cut. Here was the Treasurer, using the nation's public finances to gain the support of his colleagues for a tilt at the leadership. It makes no sense to skew tax cuts towards those who have already enjoyed the greatest gains from our recent prosperity. Tonight I am going to set out a tax plan that takes the government's proposed tax changes and turns them into a genuine reform of the tax system that delivers benefits across the income tax scales with fairness. The government should raise the threshold where the 30c rate cuts in from $21,600 to $26,400. It should implement a welfare to work bonus that would provide an effective $10,000 tax-free threshold for people earning up to $20,000 per year. This is what encourages people who are on welfare into the work force-when you are not trying to punish them. The tax plan should avoid delivering any fiscal stimulus while the economy stays in the red zone of a potential interest rate rise in the second half of 2005. There is simply no benefit in giving families a $6 a week tax cut if that tips the Reserve Bank over the edge into raising interest rates. After all, one interest rate increase will raise monthly mortgage repayments for a $300,000 mortgage by $48-almost twice the size of that $6 weekly cut. These changes should take effect from 1 January 2006. In addition, from 1 July 2006 the government should raise the threshold where the 42c rate cuts in from $63,000 to $67,000 and raise the threshold where the 47c rate cuts in from $80,000 to $100,000. This package would deliver a tax cut of up to $9 a week for those earning up to $25,000double what the government is offering. It would deliver a $12 tax cut for those earning from $25,000 to $70,000-double what the government is offering. It would preserve the government's tax cut for people earning from $70,000 up to $100,000. We recognise that people on around $80,000 are not rich, but politicians on $105,000 and over are doing all right. This package would deliver $40 to people who earn $105,000 and above-one-third less than what the government is offering; a much fairer outcome. A worker or single-income family on average weekly earnings will over the next four years gain $1,248 in tax cuts from the government. How much from Labor's plan? $2,184 in tax cuts-about $936 more under Labor for middle Australia. A dual-income family on $85,000 will over the next four years gain $2,496 from the government. How much under Labor's plan? $4,368 in tax cuts-about $1,872 more under Labor for middle Australian families. I say to those in government: you have a choice. Make yourselves richer or make seven million Australians who put you in here richer. The whole proposal could be delivered for around the same cost as the $24.1 billion cost of the government's changes over the budget period. Welfare reform This budget's welfare changes were touted as a significant reform that would raise work force participation rates and assist people to transfer from welfare to work. But the government's approach to welfare reform does little to increase welfare recipients' capacity to work and nothing to encourage employers to take them on. Instead of seizing the opportunity to bring these Australians into the productive economy, it shifts them from one welfare payment to another. Let us put this in perspective. We are actually talking about people who typically live with poor vision or hearing, possibly suffer from episodic mental illness or endure chronic physical pain. These are some of the most disadvantaged Australians. They are not a breed apart; they are not a separate species. They are our neighbours, our siblings, our parents and our friends. A genuine effort to help get them into paid work involves taking practical steps to make it easier for employers to hire people with disabilities. Welfare recipients often require training and are not job ready. The lack of affordable child care is also a major barrier to them working. The government is offering only small child-care and training measures in this budget that do not do enough to address the real challenges of getting these Australians into lasting work. In practical terms, the main impact of the package is to shift disability support pensioners and sole parents onto the dole, where the government will save up to $77 per fortnight. Once again, the government has taken the low road, the easy path. The 2005 budget: a squandered opportunity I have dealt with disincentive to work in our tax and welfare systems by proposing a genuine tax reform plan. But to secure our prosperity we need to lift Australia's capacity for the next phase of growth. Commentators agree this budget fails to do that work. The ANZ Bank has said ‘it could not be said that this is a great reforming budget'. It also that the budget is ‘light on spending to relieve infrastructure constraints' and ‘There now an increased risk that rates will be lifted again'. The budget should have seized an historic opportunity to invest in Australia's future and confront the long-term threats to the economy. What Australia's economic commentators are urging from this government is national leadership on infrastructure. That means investing in our economy's growth capacity-building a highly skilled work force and an advanced, competitive economy. Australia's greatest asset is not its mines, its stock markets or its buildings. It is our people: hard working Australians. And nothing gives us better prospects for long term productivity and prosperity than investing in working Australians. We also need to keep the nation's infrastructure in good repair. Our transport and communications networks must be up to scratch so that Australian businesses can seize opportunities for growth and investment. We must also address enormous challenges in other parts of the national infrastructure: the crisis in our inland rivers, rising salinity problems in our soil and gaps in our energy infrastructure. And we need a modern industry agenda that embraces the potential for innovation, business investment and growth from ratifying the Kyoto protocol, encouraging clean energy and cutting greenhouse emissions. We also need a broad program of reform to rebuild our national competitiveness. We need to strengthen our national competition laws. We need, once and for all, to resolve the bickering between Commonwealth and state governments, to improve efficiency and reduce duplication. We need to relieve the burden of regulation on small business and we need to simplify the mind-numbing comsaid plexity of our tax system. Before it introduced its tax reforms, the government inheris ited a tax act of about 4,000 pages. It is now 7,000. You do not paginate the tax act anymore; you weigh it. Australia needs a government that is up to the reform challenge, that can lift the hood on the economy and get stuck in and fix things up, just as the reformist Hawke and Keating governments did in the eighties and nineties after inheriting a weak, uncompetitive economy from the Fraser-Howard government in 1983. The Howard government: tinkering, not delivering The Howard government has talked for nine long years about reform, and it has held scores of inquiries and published dozens of reports about reform. But its record of action has never matched the rhetoric. It is a government that tinkers on the edges. It walks around and kicks the tyres, but it does not lift the hood and get its hands dirty with real reform. Look at the record. Who remembers now the great savings debate of the 1997 budget? Mr Costello said that it would increase savings, reduce our reliance on foreign debt and raise the speed limits to growth. Six weeks after it commenced they scrapped it! And since then the household savings ratio has plummeted to below zero and foreign debt is astronomical. This week's budget quietly announced a permanent downgrade to Australia's future growth prospects. Who remembers the great crackdown on top end tax avoidance that was promised alongside the GST in 1999? Mr Costello claimed that it would clean out the rorts. Labor supported the cuts in corporate tax and capital gains tax, on the basis of Mr Costello's undertakings to deliver those reforms in full. Mr Costello even signed a piece of paper saying he would deliver them in full but his signature on that paper was worth nothing. Who remembers Mr Howard's flamboyant promise in 1996 to ‘cut red tape for small businesses by 50 per cent'? There was a review, a report, a big launch and a blaze of publicity. But instead of getting relief from compliance burdens, small businesses found they had to become tax collectors for the government when the GST and the business activity statement were introduced. And this year small businesses are burdened with another heavy load: the red-tape nightmare of superannuation choice. Once again, the government decided that all the paperwork would land on the desk of the small business owner. Worse still, the government's legislation actually imposes a jail term of up to two years on small business owners who answer an employee's question about the super funds they might choose. This Treasurer has form. He brings in the brass band to trumpet his big solutions but when you look back on his legacy you realise he is little more than a clanging cymbal, a hollow drum, a loud percussive nothing. The government is not up to the reform challenge The problem for Liberal Party politicians is that the actions most needed to address our economic challenges do not fit their ideological prejudices. Instead of questioning their own prejudices and putting them to one side they deny the problems. They cannot accept that there are substantive economic reforms that require real leadership from the public sector. But the big wave of economic reforms that shifted Australia from an overregulated, insulated economy to an open market economy are already in place. We do not have to relive the 1980s and 1990s. The next wave of productivity growth is not going to come from the kinds of one-off reforms made in the eighties and nineties. The next wave of productivity growth will come from our long-term investments in our work force and in our infrastructure. Today's challenges therefore call for active public sector involvement. Just as Labor abandoned its prejudices in pursuit of reforms such as tax and labour market reforms in the eighties, now the Liberal Party needs to break out of its ideological straitjacket and start putting Australia first. In those days, the nation's economy required a historic shift to integrate Australia with the world economy, phase out protectionism, overhaul the tax system, create a modern productivity based system of workplace agreements, and scale back regulation. We put those reforms in place. They were not popular, and the Liberal Party opposed many of them. They opposed intergenerational reforms like introducing an assets on pensions. They opposed compulsory national superannuation, the greatest single step in building retirement income security for all Australians. They opposed tax reforms that restored fairness and equity-even our efforts to end those long boozy business lunches that executives enjoyed at taxpayers' expense. They were lazy on reform then and they are lazy on reform now. In place of dispassionate reform that develops far-sighted solutions to our economic problems we get silly ideological indulgences like Brendan Nelson's voluntary student unionism. In the long term, Australia will not be able to escape the effects of the government's wilful neglect. We need a government that gives priority to the long term over the short term. It means the government putting the nation's interest ahead of its own political interest. I believe that government has a responsibility to invest in the wealthgenerating machinery of the economy. We need specific, immediate action to address the long-term erosion of work force skills and infrastructure. Skills Rebuilding the nation's skills is an immediate and urgent need for our economy. The government's only initiative on skills this year is an increase in skilled migration-an extra 20,000 skilled migrants in this budget. Meanwhile, the government is turning away almost 40,000 Australians from TAFE each year. Since 1997, the government has turned 270,000 people away from TAFE colleges, while bringing in 180,000 skilled workers. Labor's priority is different: train Australians first and train Australians now. Trade completion bonus The government should move immediately to address the national skills crisis. I would start with the appalling drop-out rate in apprenticeships. Currently, 40 per cent of test people in new apprenticeships drop out before completing their training. We need more tradesmen and women and fewer apprentice drop-outs. The government should move immediately to introduce a $2,000 trade completion bonus for traditional apprentices who complete their training. The first $1,000 would be paid halfway through their apprenticeship and the second at its end. This would immediately encourage more Australians to complete their training in areas of critical skill shortages, instead of forcing businesses to wait until 2010 for the first qualified apprentice to emerge from the Howard government's technical colleges. Trade Apprenticeship School Incentive Scheme The second step the government should take immediately is to dramatically increase the number of school based apprenticeships in traditional trades. Last year, just 11,400 school students commenced apprenticeships-70 per cent of these were not even in areas of skill shortage. We could make a real dent in the skills crisis by allocating an additional 4,000 training places in our schools for years 11 and 12 students-that is 2,000 at each level. We also need to give schools extra support to participate in this scheme. I would provide a 50 per cent ‘skill shortage loading' for school based trade apprenticeships. This additional funding of $1,750 per student apprentice would help schools build their capacity to offer the school based apprenticeships, such as by creating links with local employers. This approach reflects a difference in values between the Prime Minister and me. I think it is irresponsible for the Prime Minister to tell young Australians to drop out of school. Unlike the Prime Minister, I understand the difference between low-paid, casual and part-time work and a real skill and a real career. To be an electrician, to be carpenter, to be a tiler, to be a person with a substantial career means you can marry and you can have a family. You do not go on the treadmill of life but have a real career. Young people who leave school early, as urged by the Prime Minister, are twice as likely to become unemployed as people who finish year 12. Employers want their apprentices to finish school so they have broad based skills to make them better equipped for working life. Infrastructure The third major reform challenge that requires immediate action is the repair of our nation's infrastructure. Organisations like the OECD and the Reserve Bank have called for national leadership and have identified this as the missing factor in the development of Australia's public and private infrastructure-national leadership, not blaming the states. If I were Prime Minister tonight, I would provide clear national leadership on infrastructure planning. I would marshal the expert advice on the extent of infrastructure problems, how to fix them, and how we plan for the roads, railways, ports and communications networks of the future. Mr Howard behaves as though we do not need action, just talk. In the past year alone, the government has commissioned eight separate, sporadic and ad hoc infrastructure inquiries. That is why Labor would set up a national infrastructure council to be known as Infrastructure Australia. With input and representation from the private and public sectors, Infrastructure Australia would provide ongoing advice to all Australian governments-Commonwealth, state and territory-on the adequacy of what infrastructure we have and to develop a blueprint for the future. Infrastructure Australia would be a standing item on the agenda of the Council of Australian Governments, and would provide a regular reports to that body. I cannot understand why the government remains deaf to the calls from business for such a body. If we get the policy settings right-through the establishment of Infrastructure Australiawe can unlock investment in roads, rail, ports, communications and energy networks. This will lift the speed limit of the economy and be a strong foundation for Australia's future prosperity. Future fund I believe the private sector has a major role to play in the financing and building of infrastructure, but some parts of our infrastructure cannot operate commercially and must be provided by the public sector. The Treasurer has indicated that the proceeds of asset sales and budget surpluses will be moved into a future fund. I support this measure, but I have a different set of priorities as to the use of its dividends. The Treasurer asserts that the assets will be in a locked box for 15 years. But let us see how long it will be before John Anderson's Nationals crowbar that box open and boast about it as they fritter away the assets around the countryside-they have form. The Treasurer says the Future Fund will offset the pressure on the budget from the costs associated with population ageing. He is actually talking about a couple of Commonwealth Public Service superannuation schemes which have been abolished and which were reasonably well handled anyway. When talking about the ageing population, he is really talking about paying superannuation to retired Canberra public servants, who are, as I said, covered well enough as we stand. But the best safeguard against the ergenerational risks to the economy is to put the economy on a path of higher productivity and faster growth. Labor has a different and better plan for a fund for the future, a fund to help rebuild Australia. Instead of the government's future fund, Labor would establish its Building Australia Fund, and allow the income streams from that fund to be applied for infrastructure purposes. This would lay our foundation for higher growth rates. Higher productivity and higher growth are the best and only ways to lay a strong foundation for the future. That is the right way to use the budget surpluses that would go into that fund. It is the right way to ensure that impediments to growth in the Australian economy are properly removed. Anyone who thinks for one minute that the National Party would not get their hands into that locked box is a victim of the triumph of hope over experience. To be heckled by this bunch with the record they have developed on regional rorts is pretty rich. Conclusion A budget exposes a government's priorities. It determines the way ahead for the nation. It is an open window on a government's soul. So, with this budget, who comes first in John Howard's Australia? The members of parliament in this place who get a windfall gain of $65 per week, or the men and women who clean their offices and get just $6 per week? Of course, the Prime Minister will instantly dismiss Labor's stand for the seven million forgotten Australian taxpayers and say that it is populist, opportunistic and Labor Party class warfare. But I say it is just that we have different priorities and different values. If this were the budget speech and not the reply, the rebuilding of the Australian economy would commence tonight. The engines int- of reform would hum again. We would begin again to lay the foundations for a better Australian future, one that depends not on the good luck of a mining boom but on the skills of working Australians and the strength of the nation's infrastructure. Labor stands for a better deal for working Australian men and women and tonight one thing is clear: if ever this country needed a Labor government, it is now. Debate (on motion by Mr Abbott) adjourned. House adjourned at 8.02 pm NA The following notices were given: MR GEORGANAS to move: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) since the abolition of the Commonwealth Dental Program waiting lists for dental services have increased by over 30 per cent; (b) an increasing number of Australians are unable to afford private dental treatment and are waiting up to 5 years for dental care; (c) older Australians, in particular, are at risk of poor health and a diminished quality of life as a result of long waiting lists and the lack of affordability of private dental services and private health insurance; (d) the working poor, ineligible for health care cards and unable to afford private health insurance, are either postponing essential dental care, or risking high interest health credit products to access essential dental care to avoid further work absence; (e) poor dental health can contribute to deterioration in overall health and can lead to premature admission to nursing homes or even death; (f) oral health issues are often divorced from mainstream health issues even though there is a strong link between poor dental health and health problems such as diabetes, stroke, heart disease, endocarditis, and nutritional deficiencies; (g) the postponement of dental treatment has led to an increase in the demand for emergency dental care, exacerbating ongoing preventative treatments which provides greatest long term benefits to both the community and the Commonwealth budget; and (h) early intervention is important for maintaining a healthy and quality lifestyle and reducing future burdens on the health system; and (2) calls on the Government to: (a) recognise Ben Chifley's vision when he amended the Constitution in 1946 to recognise dental treatment as a legitimate medical treatment; b) acknowledge that existing policies, as highlighted by the House of Representatives Inquiry into Long Term Strategies for Ageing Over the Next 40 years, “fall short of providing access to preventative dental care”; (c) reinstate a Commonwealth dental program, and adopt Labor's Australian Dental Care plan; and (d) work cooperatively with the States and Territories to ensure that services are delivered to the most vulnerable in our community, including the elderly and the working poor. MS BURKE to move: That this house: (1) notes that there has been an increased global trend for companies to relocate various parts of their operations to locations outside of the country where the service is being delivered a practice often referred to as off-shoring; (2) notes that the practice of off-shoring has seen jobs and skills lost from the IT and finance sector in Australia and that Deloitte Research predicts that 15% of all financial sector jobs will be moved off-shore by 2008; (3) recognises that participating in the global economy may deliver lower costs for local consumers and companies, however it must be done in a transparent and equitable manner; and (4) calls on the Government to act now, before the flood of jobs offshore sees Australia losing out, by: (a) ensuring privacy protection for consumers; (b) providing consumers with a “right to know” so that service providers disclose the country of origin which provides their services, equivalent to country of origin product labelling; (c) developing a national skills base that is suited to the changing needs of the economy; (d) providing assistance in reskilling displaced workers; and (e) ensuring employees of the country where the jobs are relocated are also protected by ILO Labour Standards. MS KING to move: That this House: (1) recognises that: (a) symphysis pubis dysfunction (SPD) or pelvic instability in pregnant women can affect 1 in 36 pregnant women; and (b) the condition can be debilitating with symptoms ranging from pain in the front and back of the pelvis, to difficulty walking, bending or straddling and an inability to carry out many daily activities; (2) congratulates the newly formed Pelvic Instability Association for its work to raise awareness of this condition; and (3) urges the Government to: (a) further promote awareness of pelvic instability in pregnant women; (b) fund Australian-based research into its incidence and guidelines for treatment and rehabilitation; and (c) provide assistance to the Pelvic Instability Association in supporting women with this condition.
