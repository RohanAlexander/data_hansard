1,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"A few days ago I asked the Minister for the Navy whether anything was being done to prevent men who volunteered in the country districts for active service abroad from getting free passes to the city, and thus enjoying a cheap holiday without reporting themselves at the barracks for final examination, and whether means were being adopted to bring to book those who have done this?",5
2,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"In compliance with the honourable member's request I have looked into the matter, and have been f u r nished with the following reply to his question:It is probable that such cases have occurred. In order, however, to keep a check over men who are provisionally accepted in the country, and who are given free railway passes to town, instructions have been issued that the papers dealing with the acceptance of any recruits .are to be forwarded by the Recruiting Officer, by post, to the depdt at which the men are instructed to report. If any men do not arrive at the depAt, their names are to be furnished to the local recruiting officer in order that the fact that such men have not reported for duty may be known in the locality in which he lives.

VACCINATION "" OF SOLDIEES .",5
3,Mr WEST,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for the Navy, as representing the Minister of Defence, if he has seen in the press the report of the sudden death after vaccination of Private Frederick Lemmon, who, according to Drs. Palmer and Sheldon, died of blood-poisoning. It is stated thatThe upper part of the body, especially in the region of the arm where the vaccination had taken effect, was markedly decomposed. The organs were very decomposed; but there were no signs of any injury or any special disease. The doctors added that the deceased was a welldeveloped man. Will the Minister take steps to stop vaccination, or make some special effort to prevent the deaths of soldiers from this cause ?",6
4,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I shall bring the matter under the notice of the Minister of Defence, in order that the facts may be ascertained. CASE OF JULIUSBLAU .",6
5,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for the Navy if he will ascertain from his colleagues in another place whether there is any objection to laying on the table of the Library all the papers in the Defence Department relating to the permit to visit America which was given to Julius Blau, senior ?",6
6,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I see no objection to that being done. SOLDIERS' CHILDREN .,6
7,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"I wish to direct the attention of the Minister for the Navy, as representing the Minister of Defence, to a case which has been brought under my notice by Mr Solly. A lady, the wife of a soldier who went to the fron t and was wounded on the 15th June, died recently, giving birth to twins. I desire the honourable gentleman to ask his honourable colleague if he will have an inquiry made into the action of the Defence Department in sending Constable Sharp to the house of Mrs Tiernan, at 112 Cardigan-street, to take from her four children, of whom two were twins, aged only three weeks, and to bring them before the Court as neglected children, thus removing them from the care of the lady with whom their father had placed his wife and them when he went to the front? Will the honourable gentleman also ask his honourable colleague to take such action as will prevent the children of soldiers being dealt with in future as neglected children?",6
8,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"This is the first time that I have heard of the case, which I shall bring under the notice of the Minister of Defence, to ascertain if the Defence Department is responsible for what was done. I shall let the honourable member know the result of my inquiry. MILITARY HORSES.",6
9,Mr FLEMING,Unknown,"Is the Minister for the Navy aware that in the paddocks at Ascot, where military horses are being run, there is a broken fence which would seem specially arranged for the crippling of the horses? The officers in charge say that they cannot remove the fence because authority in the matter is divided between the Department of Home Affairs and the Department of Defence. Will the honourable gentleman arrange to have the fence removed, so that the horses may be given a fair chance ?",6
10,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The matter will be in quired into, and, if the Defence Department is to blame, will be immediately remedied. SMALL ARMS FACTORY.",6
11,Mr CARR,Unknown,"I ask the Prime Minister if it is true, as reported in the press, that the Government have endorsed the recommendation of the Public Works Committee to remove the Small Arms Factory from Lithgow to Canberra?",6
12,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The question should have been put to the Minister of Home Affairs. It is not correct that the factory is to be removed from Lithgow to Canberra, but a new factory is to be erected within the Federal Territory. 5406 Export of [REPRESENTATIVES.] EXPORT OF WHEAT.",6
13,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Has the Attorney-General, acting on behalf of the Government, concluded an agreement with Messrs. Elder, Smith and Company and Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Company, under which they will have the exclusive right to engage the charters necessary for the exportation of the wheat gathered during the approaching harvest? If so, what are the terms of the agreement, and is flour included with wheat? Did the honourable gentleman, before making the agreement, consult the Australian wheatbuyers, who handle and practically finance the Australian harvest so far as the farmers are concerned ?",7
14,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Government have made an agreement with Messrs. Elder, Smith and Company, and Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Company, with a view to obtaining sufficient freight for the tion of wheat and other commodities from Australia, flour being included with wheat. In doing this we have carefully considered the wheat buyers. I had an interview today with Messrs. Dreyfus, and one yesterday with Messrs. Darling. Messrs. Elder, Smith and Company, and Messrs. Gibbs, Bright and Company are in daily consultation with those firms. The arrangements which the Government have made include and depend on the heartiest cb-operation of every interest and every agency concerned in the harvesting, handling, and transporting of these commodities. They assented and approved of every detail of the arrangement. When we had agreed upon a policy, the Government of the Commonwealth was asked to carry it out, the arrangement being that we should secure freight for Australia on the lowest terms possible. It was agreed that the freight so secured should be distributed among the States upon the basis of their exportable wheat, the charges to the States being apportioned on the same basis. The States and the Commonwealth are to share the profit and loss resulting from the arrangement.",7
15,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"In view of the Attorney-General's answer to the honourable member for Wakefield, to the effect that two firm's have secured the exclusive right of chartering for the wheat season, I wish to know whether it is a condition precedent that these firms shall surrender their direct agencies for those special lines of Wheat. ships they represent in Australia, thus putting the firms in the position of having in this matter only one master to serve, namely, the Australian people.",7
16,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The arrangements have been made in the interests of the whole of the Commonwealth.,7
17,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,Questio n I,7
18,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"If the honourable member is going to answer the question as well as ask it I shall sit down. The arrangement was made after consultation with, and with the approval of, the States. ' No interest whatever is being served excepting the interests of the whole of the Commonwealth. These shipping agents, are not doing this for the Commonwealth as a business transaction or on business lines.",7
19,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Will you place the agreement on the table, and let us see exporta- what the firms are getting?",7
20,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"What is more, so far as I have been able to gather, every interest is being consulted, and is extending its heartiest co-operation to the efforts to obtain cheap freight for the transportation of our wheat.",7
21,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,You have not answered thp question.,7
22,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,You did not want an answer.,7
23,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Considerin g that the particulars of this agreement, as known to me, do not indicate that it is so favourable to the public interest as the Attorney-General thinks, would it not be better to place it on the table of the House, and thus enable honourable members to see what the real facts are?",7
24,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Government took this step after consulting the States; and it is obvious to any one who will look at the factors at work that there is no other way by which freight could be obtained, without such a disturbance of the freight market as would be ruinous to shippers, than by the arrangement we have made. I saw Mr Vaughan and Mr. Goode, of South Australia, who may be assumed to have the interests of South Australia at heart as much as has the honourable member for Angas and the honourable member for Wakefield; and it was after seeing them, in conjunction with every representative of every exporting firm, that the arrangement was made. I am perfectly satisfied that it is a good arrangement, and the only one by which freight can be obtained without a disturbthat ance of the freight market.",7
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I presume come. there would be no objection to the Attorney-General submitting a memorandum showing exactly what has been done in regard to shipping arrangements.,8
26,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I shall be glad to supmight ply the House with the whole including the arrangements arrived at with these two companies. The facts are sidered urgent. very much at the disposal of the House; and I shall lay them on the table early - this week.  attention of the Prime Minister to a question I asked about a fortnight ago in nexion with freights. On that occasion asked the honourable gentleman whether, before finality had been arrived at in coninquiries. nexion with freights, the Government would take into their counsels men who were experts in the business, and the Prime Minister said that he would do and not only that, but that Parliament would have an opportunity to consider the matter. I now ask the honourable gentleman why this arrangement has been today. made without consultation with those men in the business, thus ignoring the promise he made to me.",8
27,Mr ITSHEE,Unknown,"I do not think that I made a promise of that kind. As plained by the Attorney-General, vernment found themselves in the position that to have, open competition would be to sell the interests of the people. This binding agreement has been entered into to make doubly sure that the freights required for the transport of the expected big harvest in Australia will be secured to the producers. The agreement will laid on the table ;>f the House.",8
28,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"Has the attention the Prime Minister been drawn to a statement in the London press, to the effect that the profits made by some shipentered ping companies have increased to the exconsult tent of 300 per cent, since the outbreak presentatives % of the war? If so, did he have that statement in mind when he and his colwere leagues in the Cabinet came to regarding the matter of freights?",8
29,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Our first duty was to look to the requirements of Australia. ""We did so, and made the best possible bargain. The Government must stand or fall by the arrangement they have made in the intation terests of the people, and the point they had to act promptly before a difficulty arose which no one could over",8
30,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Does not the Prime Minister consider that a question of such far-reaching importance as the handling of the Australian harvest appropriately have been submitted of the facts, to the War Committee?",8
31,Mr FISHER,Unknown,The matter was con,8
32,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,Unknown,The Government have made a bungle of it. Every man of experience in the handling of the wheat knows that that is so.,8
33,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! If honorconable members are going to put questions I and then immediately answer them, no purpose can be served in making such",8
34,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The matter was considered urgent by the Government and by the producers. I venture to say that my so; colleagues and I might have had some doubt at one point as to our action being absolutely correct and beneficial to all concerned, but I have no doubt at all",8
35,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister satisfied that the arrangement made is one by which the charges will be less than they would have been if it had been exdelayed, and other methods had been perthe Gomitted to be carried out?",8
36,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The 'Attorney-General has agreed to lay the agreement on the table of the House as early as possible, and I ask honourable members to defer any discussion of this very important matter until that is done. If the matter turns outall right, we shall have done be only that which we ought to have done. Of course, if it turns out the other way, of we shall have to accept the blame.",8

39,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister taken any action, following the representations recently made by a depufrom Newcastle, in regard to the is, restriction of the export of coal?",8
40,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I desire to state, for the information of honourable members, that the position of the Australian coal trade has recently received further attention by the Government. Shipments of coal - were being permitted to consignees in regard to whom satisfactory guarantees were obtainable from the resident British consul that the coal would be so dealt with that it could not be diverted to the use of any public or private vessel belonging to a country at war with the United Kingdom. From information received, however, it appeared that in the absence of similar restrictions elsewhere, the export trade of the Commonwealth was being detrimentally affected. Representations were accordingly made to His Majesty's Government in several telegrams with a view fo insuring that Australia was on the same footing as other countries in respect of the export of coal. The position here was fully explained, and it was asked that advice be furnished without delay, when all restrictions could be removed. As it seemed from press reports that a difficulty was being experienced in obtaining sufficient coal in the United Kingdom for war purposes, it was strongly urged by this Government that consideration be given to the question of obtaining supplies of coal from Australia. This, it was mentioned, would aid in relieving the situation in the Commonwealth. The Secretary of State advised in reply that His Majesty's Government are most anxious that no unnecessary restrictions should be imposed on the Australian coal export trade, and the following arrangements have now been made:-The export of coal to the Philippine Islands, Honolulu, and .Mexico is to be unrestricted, provided British consuls are first consulted and are satisfied that the shipments are bond fide. As regards South American ports and the Dutch East Indies, shipments will be allowed to named consignees in those ports who are recognised coal importers on the same conditions as are imposed in respect of export from the United Kingdom, namely: (1) That no coal of any kind is furanswer nished directly or indirectly(a) to any vessel belonging to enemy countries, (6) to any vessel known to trade with enemy countries, (c) to anj- ""jssel or firm the name whir- ' is specially notified. 1 (2) That no coal is used in the production of goods or by-products of distillation of military value which are furnished directly or indirectly to any enemy country. (3) That no coal is sold by one importer to another without express permission. The Governments of Japan and Canada are being asked to take similar action. With respect to the question of shipments of Australian coal to the United Kingdom, the Board of Trade advised that, owing to the high freights now ruling, and in view of the fact that in ordinary years the price of coal free on board at Newcastle exceeds the average price of coal at pithead in the United Kingdom, it is improbable that coal can be ""brought from Australia on terms admitting of competition with coal of domestic origin, even at the inflated prices now prevailing. Ministers have expressed to His Majesty's Government the hope that further facilities will be given for the export of Australian coal as soon as circumstances permit. AUSTRALIA DAY.  ister favourably consider a suggestion to adjourn the House this week on Thursday afternoon, instead of on Friday, in order to allow members to take part in the celebration of Australia Day ?",9
41,Mr FISHER,Unknown,I think I must yield to an appeal on behalf of Australia Day. . AUSTRALIAN METAL TRADE.,9
42,Mr HAMPSON,Unknown,"I should like to ask the Attorney-General whether, if the Broken Hill companies, the Mount Morgan Company, and the Australian Metal Company dispose of their products to the detriment of the best interests of Great Britain and her Allies during the war, there is anything to prevent the Commonwealth Government commandeering and disposing of the output of those companies ?",9
43,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"This question raises the point touched upon by me recently in this House, and in the press. The is that the difficulty arises, not at this end, hut at the other end. It is owing to the sales being made to agents who are acting in behalf of, or in the interests of, the enemy that the trouble has arisen. There is no reason to doubt for of one moment that the metal itself reaches Britain or her Allies, and the Government have taken such steps as are within their power to prevent German influence in and. control of the Australian metal products continuing. It is not considered .necessary to commandeer the metal at this stage. As to whether we could do so or .not, I express no opinion. But if , in face - of every effort made by the Government to control the sale of metal in Australia, the German influence still exists, the Government will require to reconsider the position. In that event we shall consider whether we ought to commandeer the metals or not.",9
44,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,"Will the Attorney-General announce the name of the Australian agent who represented British firm which desired to purchase ""lead from the Broken Hill Proprietary 'Company as quoted in a cable message of the 15th February, 1915.",10
45,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"The Australian - agent's name is Fraser, and his British principal's name is Foster. OLD-AGE PENSIONS . Mr W . ELLIOTJOHNSON - Will the Prime Minister consider the advisa""bility of remitting pensions by post to pensioners who, for physical reasons, are - unable to attend personally at the post offices .",10
46,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"On the face of that suggestion, it would appear that no course - could be more satisfactory. As a matter - of absolute fact, the safety and protection of pensioners is guaranteed by the present method. However, I shall inquire into the honourable member's proposal. Repeatedly pensioners have been robbed by intermediaries, sometimes by most distinguished members of the community, and the fact became apparent that it was necessary to hand the money from the Treasury direct to the pensioners themselves. However, if money can be remitted by post without loss to the pensioners, that course will be followed. ENEMYSHIPRANGOO N. Minister",10
47,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I have just received a letter from Thursday Island under dale 39th July, and the concluding paragraph readsWe have just heard that the Jianqoon has escaped from the Celebes. She is going to he another Emden, snapping at Australian trade. Can the Minister for the Navy give the House any information in regard to that ship?",10
48,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The information contained in the question is, so far as I know, unreliable. INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION.",10
49,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Seeing that there will be great trade opportunities and advantages after the war, I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he is in favour of the appointment of a Parliamentary Committee to assist in organizing our industries with a view to making Australia more self-contained? Further, if the honourable gentleman is favourably disposed towards such organization, will he set apart a day for discussion of the project the in this House ?",10
50,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The honourable member was good enough to intimate to me that he intended to ask this question. I have only to say, in reply, that parliamentarians are pretty well employed at the present time. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. RETURNED SOLDIERS: UNPATRIOTI C LITERATURE .",10
51,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Will the Minister for the Navy see that there is a sufiicient in terval between the disembarkation of the sick and wounded soldiers and those who are being returned for breaches of discipline, so that the public may have no doubt whatever whether they are or are not cheering the wrong men ? _ Mr JENSEN - I shall bring the question of the honourable member under the notice of the Minister of Defence. I , myself, think that the question deserves some consideration. The honourable member for Lang some time ago asked me the following question : I asl; the Minister for the Navy if any representations have been made to the Minister of Defence recording the circulation at Tumut, New South Wales, of literature designed to prevent recruiting, and, if so, has any action been taken to prevent the circulation of any such unpatriotic literature at Tumut or elsewhere ? If no action has been taken will the give the matter immediate attention ? Inquiries have been made, and the answeT to the honourable gentleman's question is as follows:This matter was brought by the police under the notice of the Commandant, 2nd Military District, who authorized a search to be made of the premises from which the pamphlets in question emanated, and all the literature of the nature mentioned was seized. The question of taking further action in the matter is now under consideration. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. ENLISTMENT OF OFFICERS.",10
52,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"O u Thursday last the honourable member for Maribyrnong asked the following questions:1. What number of telephone mechanics from the various StateB have enlisted(a) Permanent. (b) Temporary. 2. A temporary employee enlisting whose time has not expired, what will his position be on his return ? 3. The announced policy- "" No permanentappointments to be made until six months after the war,"" what is the position of those who have passed an examination for permanent employment (especially married men who are unable to enlist) whose time limit for employment, expires in eighteen months? 4. For permanent officers' insurance, who will pay the premium t 5. A permanent officer, being disabled of arm or leg, on his return, will he, as promised, be reinstated in his present position with same salary? 6. Will the Postmaster-General issue definite instructions so that all volunteers shall be able to enlist, without fear as to their future? In reply to inquiries which were then being made, the following information has been received:1. (a) Permanent, 105; (b) temporary, 21. 2. Every endeavour will be made to find suitable employment in equivalent positions and under similar conditions for all such employees on their return to Australia. Temporary employees, whose term of employment is limited by Aet of Parliament, have not, of course, the same claims in that respect as permanent employees. 3. An amendment of the Public Service Act will be necessary, and this is now in hand. 4. Premiums which become due after the officers concerned leave Australia are paid by the Department. 5. Yes, if he is able to perform the duties of that position; if not, special consideration will be given to the case. 6. The existing instructions are considered to be sufficient. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. BANKING ARRANGEMENTS AT GALLIPOLI : COMFORTS FOR WOUNDED SOLDIERS : RECRUITING STATION, LISMORE.  tralian soldiers, before embarking, arranged with the Commonwealth Bank that money placed to their credit should be made available for them at Gallipoli. Many of these men are now cabling from Gallipoli that the arrangement has not been observed, with the result that they are penniless. Will the Minister for the Navy see that instructions are given that the arrangement made shall he promptly carried out?",11
53,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I shall make inquiries and do all that is possible to comply with the honourable member's request.,11
54,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Will the Minister for the Navy allow members of the Port Melbourne branch of the Australian Women's Association to go on the local pier to meet the ship arriving shortly with wounded soldiers from the front, so that they may give the men comforts in the shape of fruit, confectionery and cigarettes? Hitherto they have been prevented from doing so.",11
55,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I should like the honourable member to give notice of his question. I do not know that the Defence Department will stand in the way of returned soldiers receiving any comfort that may be offered them, but there may be by loss some question of departmental policy involved in regard to the right of the public to go on the wharf when the vessel is berthing.",11
56,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"A few days ago I asked the Minister for the Navy to have inquiries made as to the desirableness of making Lismore the final recruiting station for the northern rivers of New South Wales. Have those inquiries been made, and, if so, what action has been taken?",11
57,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"Inquiries are being made, but I have not yet received from the Minister of Defence a reply to the honourable member's question. EXPORT OF SHEEPSKINS.",11
58,Mr RILEY,Unknown,"Is the Minister of Trade and Customs yet in a position to furnish an answer to the question I put to him last week regarding the great increase in the export of sheepskins to America, and the intentions of the Government with respect to that matter?",11
59,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The figures as to the total exports to the United States of America have been ascertained; they are now being obtained for other places, and inquiries are being made as to the ultimate destination of sheepskins shipped to America.

61,Mr ARCHIBALD,SMALL ARMS FACTORY AT,My friend is under a misapprehension as to what is proposed to be done. The proposal of the Government is to erect a factory at Canberra to house the new plant that is coming from America,12
62,Mr CARE,SMALL ARMS FACTORY AT,But when will the factory be ready?,12
63,Mr ARCHIBALD,SMALL ARMS FACTORY AT,"It will be built in time to house the plant on its arrival. So far as I can say at present, the factory will not be in full going order for something over twelve months. IMPORTS OF EAU-DE-COLOGNE.",12
64,Mr KELLY,SMALL ARMS FACTORY AT,"I wish to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether a general order has been issued in his Department that all imports of eau-deCologne shall be held up, pending in quiries, and, if so, why a recent shipment of eau-de-Cologne manufactured by a German company in New York has been admitted into Australia without inquiry?",12
65,Mr TUDOR,SMALL ARMS FACTORY AT,"Inquir y was made as to the source of a shipment of eau-deCologne known as ""4711, "" and, on proof being furnished, signed by the British Consul in New York, that it was of American manufacture, it was admitted. We have no jurisdiction over firms carrying on business in neutral countries.",12
66,Mr KELLY,SMALL ARMS FACTORY AT,"I - wish to ask the M in ister whether his inquiry into this shipment of eau-de-Cologne did not disclose that it bore practically the identical label that is placed on German eau-de-Cologne, the import of which has been prohibited; that the name upon the label shows that the money invested in the New York firm is of German origin, the name-Muhlen s - bein g the same on the labels of eau-deCologne of both German and American manufacture, and whether, knowing these - facts now, he will not for the future prohibit this importation of what is really German-owned eau-de-Cologne?",12

68,Mr KELLY,SMALL ARMS FACTORY AT,The Government do not care whether the eau-de-Cologne is really German-owned ?,12
69,Mr FISHER,SMALL ARMS FACTORY AT,"Would the honourable member turn down the certificate of the British Consul? honourable Mr KELLY - Certainly , if the article were German-owned.",12
70,Mr TUDOR,SMALL ARMS FACTORY AT,"It is not desirable for us to prohibit the importation of an article certified by the British Consul as having been manufactured in a neutral country. The honourable member is aware that the words "" Manufactured in the U . S . A . "" are blown on the bottle.",12
71,Mr KELLY,SMALL ARMS FACTORY AT,Does not the Minister care where the article is owned?,12
72,Mr TUDOR,SMALL ARMS FACTORY AT,"As to how the concern is owned, we cannot help ourselves, provided the article is manufactured bona fide in a neutral country, and bears the certification of the British Consul to that effect. The practice for the past six or eight months has been to secure a certificate from the British Consul in the place of manufacture to the effect that the article has been produced in a neutral country, and on that information being obtained, the goods are admitted.

73,Mr HIGGS,SMALL ARMS FACTORY AT,"Has the Minister for the Navy observed that it has been announced in the press that the Imperial Government do not intend to treat as ordinary lunatics soldiers who have lost their reason as the outcome of the war, and will he see that any unfortunate who returns to Australia in such a condition receives special treatment?",12
74,Mr JENSEN,SMALL ARMS FACTORY AT,"The Defence Department will extend the greatest consideration to any such person returning to Australia, and do all that it is possible to do for him in the circumstances. A few weeks ago the honourable member for Lang asked a question concerning a message transmitted to the Melbourne press from Reuter's correspondent, Cairo, dated the 7th June, in which an allegation was made that an Australian captain, born in Australia of German parentage, had been discovered sniping our officers, and that whilst the troops were in Cairo several men had been placed under suspicion as spies. Inquiries were at once instituted in regard to this matter, and the following replv was received a few days ago from the officer commanding the Intermediate Base Depot, Cairo: Head-quarters, Egypt, state"" Nothing known of any men placed under suspicion as spies while troops were in Cairo."" A further telegram has now come to hand as follows: Head-quarters, Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, report"" There is no foundation for the report that an Australian captain born in Australia of German parentage was found sniping our officers.""",12

The mileage for which sleepers and rails have not vet been delivered ? 8. The present estimate of the total amount involved in the completion of the railway ? The answers are: 1. Several approximate estimates have been submitted; hut the first, based on trial survey, was that of the late Engineer-in-Chief (Mr H. Deane), dated 20th September, 1911, the amount being £4,045,000. No estimnte has yet been prepared based on the working survey. 2. At 30th June, 1915, the total expenditure from Loan Funds was £3,635,669, which includes expenditure on rolling stock, etc. 3. The expenditure on rolling stock was £445,794, which covers various kinds of locomotives, waggons, cars, vans, wheels and axles, brake equipment, couplers, &c. 4. £11,089. 5. (a) £68,043. (6) Work has not been sufficiently advanced to enable definite results to be stated. 6. £39,326. 7. Sleepers, 111 miles; rails, 323 miles. 8. The preparation of an estimate of the total amount at present involved in the completion of the railway entails a decision as to a number of matters which are now under consideration. The Engineer-in-Chief is, therefore, not in a position to furnish these figures at present. SLAUGHTER OF BREEDING STOCK.",13
81,Mr WEST,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"At the annual conference of the Dairy Factory Managers and Secretaries Association of New South Wales, a report was submitted that, owing to the high price of meat, dairy cows and heifers were going to the butchers instead of to the milking yards. Do the Government intend ro take any action in regard to this matter?",13
82,Mr TUDOR,KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA,"The honourable member for Oxley has frequently asked questions in regard to breeding cows and heifers being sent to the slaughter-yards instead of being kept for breeding purposes. U n fortunately, the Commonwealth have no power to deal with the matter, but representations have been made to the State Governments as to the importance of preventing this slaughter. The British Government have recently issued a circular drawing attention to the importance of ceasing the slaughter of female stock which is being carried out in many countries at the present time.

I understand that it is the rule of the Stock Exchange to charge \ per cent, commission on dealings in Government stock; but when I put to the representatives of the stockbrokers the position of this loan, they agreed to reduce the charge by one-half. Attempts to obtain commission on other than bond fide transactions will be prevented, commission will not be paid except when the transactions are bond fide. NA BRISBANE.",14

88,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Since the honourable member for Maranoa spoke on the subject last Friday, the Minister of Defence suspended certain officers, pending an quiry into the whole matter by Colonel Irving. If the officers who are suspended are found not to have been at fault, they will be reinstated.

92,Mr HIGGS,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,Is it so important?,14
93,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I think so. I am confident, because of the answers given by the Minister for the Navy to questions that have been asked on the subject, that the Government have not the slightest idea of what is going on. I am not actuated any unfriendly motive. It will be admitted that if any of those who are at present leaving our shores to serve their abroad in connection with our military organization deserve the full protection of the Defence Department in regard to matters of outfit, it is the nurses. We should take every care to see that they are not imposed on when they has volunteer to accompany the troops on in their mission of mercy. The Department allows each nurse £15 with which to purchase her equipment, and this sum the nurses say is insufficient to buy the things with which they must be furnished before they leave Australia. That is the first matter to which I direct the attention of Minister.",14
94,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,Are not the nurses supplied with everything they want when they are at the fron t ?,15
95,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I do not know. That is not my point. I am not concerned with ""the equipment supplied to the nurses after they have left Australia, about which J know nothing. Their complaint is that the equipment with which they are compelled to furnish themselves before their departure cannot be bought for £ 1 5 , and that unless they have private means, or receive assistance from others, they cannot volunteer for nursing service abroad. It is only nurses who have command of a little money who are able to go away. The second point to which I draw attention is the complaint that the nurses are compelled to get tlieir uniforms at certain places. Quite a number of them have told me this on various occasions, but when I have questioned the Minister on the subject, he has denied that it is ao.",15
96,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,I have replied to the effect that the Department does not compel the nurses to go to any particular place.,15
97,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The matter was first brought under my notice several weeks ago, and I then asked a question in the House, and received the reply that the nurses were not compelled to go to any particular place. About a fortnight ago, however, some nurses, who were leaving with a later contingent,' told me that they had been compelled to get their uniform at a certain place. I said to them, "" The Minister tells us that there is no compulsion on nurses to get their uniforms at any particular place,"" and one of them replied, "" It is done in this way. A certain firm is apparently supplied with a list of the nurses who are going to the front . "" Where does that list come from? Who gives it to the firm in question ?",15
98,Mr THOMAS,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"There is no harm in any firm having that information, so long as no firm is given a monopoly of the business.",15
99,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"What happens is this: The firm that is supplied with the information rings up the matron in charge, and tells her over the telephone that Nurse So-and-so has not yet been into order her uniform. The matron at once tells the nurse to order it .",15
100,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,This is unknown to the Minister.,15
101,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"That is why I brought the matter up. I asked a nurse, ' ' Where did you get the uniform that you are wearing?"" and she replied, "" Prom David Jones and Company,"" and told me that it cost £ 1 0 12s. 6d - that was for the cloak with a cape attached, and a skirt.",15
102,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,We must try to ascertain who gives the names of the nurses to David Jones and Company.,15

106,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"This nurse told me that she had never paid more than £ 5 5s. for a coat and skirt, but pressure was brought to bear fco compel her to go to David Jones and Company.",15

108,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"B y the matron in charge. . An y one who is acquainted with the training of nurses knows that the nurse must obey the matron. To-day I received a letter from a gentleman whom I do not know, and it contains one very strong point in confirmation of what I have just said to the HouseThe s.s. Mooltan in June last took a party of nurses from Sydney, and during that vessel's stay in Melbourne, two of them stayed in our house. I saw a list that was issued to them, containing the names of the different articles they were required to purchase, and the name of the firm from which they had to bo obtained. The uniforms, it was stated, were to be got at David Jones', for which six guineas was charged, and which looked like barefaced robbery. This was for bare uniform, without other dresses. The nurses considered that they could have purchased the turn-out anywhere for four guineas, and, seeing that only £15 was allowed them for everything, they think they were imposed upon.",15
109,Mr CHARLTON,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"If the uniform cost only £ 6 6s., what was the £ 1 0 12s. 6d. for?",15
110,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I do not know; but I have heard that the particular kind of material used in these uniforms has been cornered by one firm, and in consequence the nurses cannot get the uniform anywhere else. I do not know whether that fact accounts for the rise in price, but I do submit that it is high time this matter was inquired into. First of all , the Government should ascertain whether the £ 1 5 allowed to the nurses is sufficient, and, secondly, whether any influence is brought to bear in any way to compel the nurses to buy their uniforms, either directly or indirectlv, from certain houses. I suggest to the Minister that he might go even further, and enter into a definite contract with two or more firms in Australia to supply the full equipment at £15. Surely the Government should protect these ladies who are going to the front.",15
111,Mr FISHER,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,I shall be delighted to take action if you will give me the names.,16
112,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The motion has not been moved in an antagonistic spirit. I desire to let the Government know of facts that have come to my knowledge, and which, I feel confident, the Government do not know.",16
113,Mr FISHER,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"If ten persons had made these statements, I would not have believed them without evidence.",16
114,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I suggest that the Government should not give the nurses any money at all, but should take full financial responsibility in regard to the whole of their outfit, and so relieve them from the necessity of having to fall back on their slender resources.",16
115,Mr JH CATTS,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,How many nurses have been sent away ?,16
116,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I do not know, but I believe that 150 left last week. I do think that the Government should give those ladies every possible assistance and protection.",16

118,Mr FISHER,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,So am I .,16
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,My opinion is that the Prime Minister is anxious that the nurses should get a fair deal.  anxious.,16
120,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Then will any honourable member tell me what we are to do? On Friday last the Minister, replying to a question by me, said, "" On four occasions I have given replies prepared by the Department that a nurse could go anywhere she liked for her equipment."" It is true that the Minister has given four replies, and I suppose at least fourteen minutes - have been written in the Department on the subject, but the trouble continues.",16
121,Mr FISHER,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,Will the right honourable gentleman say what the trouble is?,16
122,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,I will tell the Prime Minister in one minute. [198]- 2,16
123,Mr FISHER,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,Is it dishonest scheming by people to extort money from nurses?,16
124,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I am not dealing particularly with that aspect of the matter. When a nurse has been accepted for active service abroad, the least the Government might do is to write her a note informing her of the articles she is to procure, and telling her in unmistakable terms to get them or make them in any way she chooses, so long as she conforms to the regulations, and has the articles which the Department stipulates. What does it matter to the Department or anybody where she gets them, so long as the regulations are complied with ? I am told that the bulk of the nurses leave these shores with a feeling that they are suffering injustice. There is no man in the House who is not anxious to rectify such a position. But the fact remains that most of the nurses who go to the front have to put their hands into their own pockets in order to complete their equipment. It is not fair that they should be asked to do that.",16
125,Mr JH CATTS,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,Why should not the Government equip them as they equip our soldiers ?,16
126,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I really do not see why the Government cannot have the nurses equipped. I have here a letter from a man in my electorate enclosing a newspaper clipping in reference to the debates in this House on this subject, and the writer says:Dear Sir, My sister, Nurse , left for Egypt by the Karoola hospital steamer on or about 23rd June last. The list of articles which she was required to get included a number of thingsuniforms, I think-whic h she was told by (matron in charge) to get from David Jones, and from nowhere else. The list was typewritten, and a typewritten memorandum was on it, stating that David Jones were the contractors for these particular articles, and intimating (I forget the precise terms used) that that was the place to go to.",16
127,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,The matron is responsible.,16
128,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,But surely the Department is responsible for the matron ?,16
129,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,I do not think so.,16
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I think so; and may I make this general observation to the Minister, that a lot of his trouble in connection with nurses' equipment and other matters is due to his not holding the superior officers in his Department responsible for the carrying out of these details. I suggest to him that he should make them responsible, and so save himself a lot of trouble. There are Commandants in the various States, and responsible officers in Melbourne, and they ought to be held responsible for all that takes place under them.",16
131,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,Quite right! I agree with you.,17
132,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"All the while blame is being placed upon some man of low rank, but if the superior officers were held responsible they would, in their own interests, look after the men below them. The letter continued The Department allowed £15 for each nurse's outfit, and David Jones ran their account to £14 18s., leaving in this case 2s. for all the other things required under the regulations. . . . I believe all the other nurses who went at the same time had the same complaint. You may use this information as you please. I have another letter written from Melbourne, and to it is attached a list of articles and their pricesOutdoor uniforms, consisting of grey skirt, blouse, grey cape, red cape, bonnet, and badges (said to be only procurable at Lincoln, Stuart or Ball and Welch) Grey cloak Extra red cape Adjustable badge 2 brassards, each Od. 6. collars, each lOd. 6 pairs cuffs, l i d . per pair 4 squares (caps), Is. 9d. . . 3 zephyr dresses, each £1 3s. 6d. . . 4 grey aprons, each 5s. 6d. 8 linen face sheeting aprons, each 5s. 3' grey belts, each 9d. 3 white belts, each lOd. Total",17
133,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,Is that letter from Elsternwick? I received a similar one this morning.,17
134,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"No . total represents a cost of £2 l is . 9d. more than the Department allows for the whole outfit. I have another letter, written from St. Kilda-road, and it mentionsGrey dress blouse, grey cape, red cape, bonnet, and badge .. Grey cloak .. Extra red cape Various other articles are included which bring the total to £10 18s., leaving the nurse £4 2s. with which to provide herself with three zephyr dresses, four grey aprons, three grey belts, three white belts, military buttons for dress, and a number of other things which I need not mention. The facts tend to show that the nurses are obliged to put their hands into their own pockets very deeply in order to secure the equipment which the Department says they must have. The consequence is that all the nurses feel that they are under a very great disability, and are suffering a hardship. The motion for the adjournment of the House is moved in order that the facts may be made public, and that the Minister may put a stop to this kind of thing.",17
135,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,I can assure the honourable member that the Department will stop this kind of thing; and I may say that it has been going on unknown to the Minister.,17
136,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I am sure of that, because I cannot conceive the Minister, day after day, giving point-blank contradiction to such allegations.",17
137,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,I may say that I myself received a similar letter this morning. £ s. d. Mr FISHER - I have spoken to the Minister two or three times myself about the matter.,17
138,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Well , the let6 0 0 ters I have read give the Minister some 2 17 6 facts to go on; and it certainly concerns 0 7 0 him more than it does us, though it con0 5 0 0 1 6 cerns us all to see that the nurses who 0 5 0 devote themselves to these duties oversea 0 5 6 shall at least not be out of pocket, any 0 7 0 more than are soldiers, by reason of the 3 10 6 work they undertake. 1 2 0 2 0 0 Mr JENSEN - Hear , hear. 0 2 3 Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I shall say no 0 2 6 more. I simply rose for the purpose of supplying some additional information to 17 11 9 assist the Minister in making an investigation and insuring that the nurses are not out of pocket in providing themselves with the outfit which the Department That makes imperative.",17
139,Mr CHARLTON,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Hunter) [4.22] The time occupied in this discussion will be well spent, because it must bring to the Minister's knowledge facts that it £ s. d. would be very difficult for him to ascertain in any other way. The honourable . . 6 6 0 member who submitted the motion is . . 2 7 0 to be commended for the concise way in . . 0 7 0 which he put his case and stated the facts that have been brought under his notice.",17
140,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I should like to add that the two nurses to whom I referred were from the Parramatta Hospital, and that they called to see me on their way. There is no mystery about the matter.",17
141,Mr CHARLTON,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The discussion shows the necessity for an immediate inquiry. Some time back J had occasion to ask a question in the House on this very matter, following on a public meeting at Maitland, where complaint was made that the amount allowed for equipment was inadequate, and that some nurses had to expend a good few pounds over and above the amount they received from the Department. It is quite possible that the Department was under the impression that the amount was adequate, and that-particularl y in view of the statements today-to o much has been charged for the equipment of the nurses. The time has arrived when the Department should deal with nurses as they do with the soldiers, and see that they are provided with everything necessary for the front , without leaving it to any particular firm to gain an advantage. These nurses are prepared to brave all the in conveniences and dangers of assisting our wounded at the front, and it is only righ t that we here should see that every precaution is taken to insure their proper equipment. There is no doubt that when the Minister looks into the matter he will find that there is room for improvement. During the last few weeks I have received letters from reputable citizens, who, no doubt, are well seized of the facts, asserting that the amount allowed is altogether too small. I feel quite sure that the Government only desire that everything reasonable shall be done, not only for the nurses, but for all who are going abroad to serve their country; and, in the f u ture, we may take it for granted no one need be afraid to volunteer for nursing on the ground of inadequate equipment. I believe that there are some women who would like to go to the front, but they have no money of their own, and they know that the amount allowed is in sufficient. The Government ought to take this matter into their own hands, and see that all that is necessary is provided, for these angels of mercy. If that is done, there will be no difficulty in getting an adequate number for this work on the battlefield.",18
142,Mr BRENNAN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Batman) [4.27] - I am pleased that this matter has been ventilated, though possibly it might have been dealt with otherwise than on a motion for adjournment.",18
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The honourable member will admit that we have tried every other way, and failed.",18
144,Mr BRENNAN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Yes . I feel certain that the Minister of Defence very naturally thought that his wishes expressed in the House were being respected by the responsible persons; and it no doubt comes as something of a shock to him, as it does to all of us, to know that persons who, in other respects, are somewhat ostentatious patriots, are acting in a way which is,' to my mind, mean towards those who take on the responsible duties of nurses- a way which is certainly very much out of harmony with their jirotestations of patriotism. It may be that the £15 allotted would, if spent by the nurses themselves, at their discretion, be sufiicient. Women know exactly what they 1 require, and, having skill i u putting such things together, could make the money go a long way.",18
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,I think that is the whole point-that the nurses could provide themselves to better advantage if they were permitted.,18
146,Mr BRENNAN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The experience of the honourable member for Richmond in New South Wales has been precisely my experience in Victoria. One nurse assured me that she received a written in timation that she had to go to Ball and Welch's to get her uniform, and whatever else she required. I take the responsibility of repeating what she said, corroborated as it is by other evidence. She told me that, in such a simple matter as aprons, she has been charged 100 per cent, more than what is a fair price. That statement has been corroborated, and it is in keeping with what has been said by honourable members opposite today. It is a gross shame that such a thing should be done or allowed for a moment. I suggest that it is no longer sufiicient for the Minister to say that the nurses may get their costumes where they like ; it rests upon him now to say that certain persons may not do what they have been doing in the past .",18
147,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Hear , hear! I agree with you.",18
148,Mr BRENNAN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"There should be no mere negation, but a positive order on the part of the Minister to those responsible, in terms that cannot be misunderstood, so that, if there is any repetition of such conduct, they may be .brought to book. The firms who have been mentioned today will have an opportunity to explain their position; and if such conduct is repeated, and it is discovered who are responsible for what appears to be a very unpleasant kind of combine, then I hope the Minister will see that they are no longer allowed to operate.",18
149,Mr HIGGS,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,They ought to be turned out of Australia!,19
150,Mr FENTON,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"They give to the patriotic fund with one hand, and rob people with the other.",19
151,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,You that they are robbing.,19
152,Mr BRENNAN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I do not go one inch beyond information derived from sources which I am certain are reliable. I agree with the honourable member for Hunter that the nurses' equipment should be supplied by the Commonwealth, though I do not know that it would be practicable to make those uniforms on the same principle as uniforms are made for the soldiers.",19
153,Mr FISHER,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,That has been the trouble.,19
154,Mr BRENNAN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The varieties in taste are almost equalled by the varieties in shape, and, therefore, I think the idea impracticable. However, what is practicable is for the Commonwealth to supply the materials at fixed prices; and there should be great latitude given to the nurses, or their chosen representatives, as to where the materials are made up. I have not the slightest doubt that the M in ister will keep his promise, and see that effect is given to the wishes of the House.",19
155,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,I shall do so.,19
156,Mr BRENNAN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I have always held the view that loyalty is a kind of cardinal virtue which ought to be assumed without any necessity to parade it ; and it is a particularly gross offence to exploit people who, at a time like this, are in a sense, at the mercy of traders, and particularly deserving of protection.",19
157,Mr FISHER,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Wide Bay-Prime M in ister and Treasurer) [4.33] - I have nodesire to anticipate the reply of the M i nister for the Navy. 2 only wish to say that at first I thought the honourable member for Richmond was bringing up a somewhat unimportant matter really did not come within the category of urgent public business, justifying a motion for the adjournment of the House. However, in view of what has been stated. I think that the honourable member took the right course. In one of the letters he read-written , I understand, by a practical person - it was said that the 5 nurses are being robbed, and the Commonwealth deceived, in connection with the equipment of these ladies. No gravercharge could be brought against traders or any other members of the community. I am quite in agreement with those whosay that the Commonwealth should provide all the necessary equipment. Whatever the cost might be to the Government,, it must be infinitely less than that which cannot say has to be met under the present circumstances. In hardly a single instance in which we have gone into the market for the necessaries of war have we done so without being under the gravest apprehension that we were not getting a fair deal. A suspicion of that kind is, of course, unfair to suppliers, and also unfair to the Government and people, who are the purchasers. Tfie matter having been raised, there should be an investigation by some body that will be merciless in its examination of the books of all suppliers, with the object of ascertaining that no undue profit has been extorted, and that material of the requisite quality has been supplied. Two points have been raised. The first is that the outfit with which nurses have to supply themselves, and in respect of which an allowance of £15 is made, is costing more than it should legitimately do. The second is that undue influence has been used in the interests of certain firms. It is not suggested that this has been done at the instigation of the Minister of Defence, or of any member of the Government.",19
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Hear , hear!",19
159,Mr FISHER,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The suggestion is that influence has been exercised by some person or persons to secure the trade for certain firms, and those firms are inferentially alleged to have overcharged to the extent of nearly 100 per cent.",19
160,Mr MASSYGREENE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I did not go as far as that. I simply gave the prices charged. They may be 50 or 100 per cent, more than they ought to be.",19
161,Mr BHENNAN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I said 100 per cent., and am prepared to prove my statement.",19
162,Dr MALONEY,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I am prepared to say which that the charge is 50 per cent, more than it should be.",19
163,Mr FISHER,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Whether it be 50 per cent., 40 per cent., or even 10 per cent, in excess of what should be legitimately charged, it is wrong. This allegation is made against citizens who are just as much bound to protect the country as are the members of this Parliament who have - taken the oath of allegiance. If the Government knowingly allowed such a thing - to go on when it had the means to prevent it, it should be ousted from office. 'These allegations having been brought before the House, they will be sifted to the bottom in order that the whole of the facts may be ascertained. It will be our duty to invite those who can give as information on the subject to supply it to us under protection, in such a way that we may make a thorough investigation, - examine the parties who are now under accusation, and ascertain whether they have been guilty of any malpractice. I - do not wish to anticipate the action that will be taken by the Minister of Defence, who must first be consulted in the matter; but, as the result of frequent conversations with him, I know that he believes that nurses accepted for service at the front are perfectly free to obtain their uniforms and equipment wherever they please. I must add, and I think all honourable members will agree with me that, whilst this freedom is allowed, - care must be taken that the material and equipment obtained by the nurses are in accordance with the requisite standard. Subject to that condition, there should be absolutely no inducement or suggestion that a nurse should obtain her outfit from any particular firm. Nurses should not be under any such compulsion, but - should be free to obtain their outfit wherever they please.",19
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I have been wondering whether the standard fixed is at the bottom of the trouble. It may be the - quality.insisted upon has something to do with the charges made. That point should be inquired into. Mr FISHER,- It has been said during this debate that certain material re-quired for nurses' uniforms has been ""cornered."" That may account for the high price charged for it . If there has been any such ""cornering"" of material, in anticipation of a demand for it to meet the requirements of nurses going to the front, then the firm guilty of such conduct has no right to exist in Australia.",20
165,Dr MALONEY,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Melbourne) [4.40]. - I make no complaint against any member of the Government in regard to this matter, but I think I was the first to bring before the House the fact that nurses were unfortunately being compelled to obtain their equipment from a certain Melbourne firm. I put to the Minister for the Navy some time ago a question on the subject, and received from him the distinct reply that the Minister of Defence stated that the nurses could obtain their outfit wherever they chose. Hp to that time nurses in Melbourne were compelled to obtain their outfit from Messrs. Ball and Welch.",20
166,Mr FISHEE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,What kind of compulsion was used?,20
167,Dr MALONEY,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,They had to go there by direction. That was the complaint made to me.,20
168,Mr FISHEE,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,B y whom were they directed to go to Messrs. Ball and Welch ?,20
169,Dr MALONEY,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"I was told that they were directed by the Defence Department to go there. Shortly after that complaint was made to me, I was informed that Messrs. Ball and Welch had cornered certain material, so that nurses were compelled to obtain their outfit from that firm, as they could not secure elsewhere material of the standard required. Any one who has heen in a hospital will know that one of the first requisites of a nurse's uniform is cleanliness, and that that can best be secured by the use of white material. But it is absurd to say that the simple garments that a nurse requires are costly.",20
170,Mr FISHEK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,Shoul d an allowance of £15 be sufficient for an outfit?,20
171,Dr MALONEY,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Certainly , if the nurses receive fair play. As to the instruments required by them, all that they need is a pair of scissors, a small pair of forceps, and a few safety pins for bandages. All other instruments are included in. the surgeon's outfit. I am satisfied that, after the statement just made by the Prime Minister, there will be no further trouble. Inquiry will show that the system complained of here has also' been going on in Sydney. The name of the Sydney firm to whom I was told nurses had to go for their equipment is David Jones and Company, of George-street. The matter having been ventilated, I am confident that no further trouble will arise, and I hope that no preference will be given by the Department of Defence to any one firm in respect of equipment required by nurses or any other persons going to the front.",20
172,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Bass-Minister for the Navy) [4.45] - As representing the Minister of Defence in this House, I am pleased that this matter has been brought forward. On returning from Launceston this morning I found in my office a letter addressed to me by a nurse living at Elsternwick. in which she stated that she had read in the Herald the reply I had given to a question on the subject, in which I had stated that nurses were free to obtain their uniforms wherever they pleased, and that they were made an allowance of £15. She assured me that - this freedom did not exist, and stated she had been informed by nurses that they had to obtain their outfit from one of two Melbourne firms, which she named. I regarded the matter as being of such importance that I immediately sent the letter to the Secretary for Defence, with a direction that it sliould be at once brought before the Minister of Defence. I have since had a conversation with my colleague, and he has assured me that at no time has be issued, an instruction that nurses going to the front shall obtain their uniforms from certain firms in Melbourne or Sydney. It was news to him that any direction of the kind had been given. If certain persons have been trying to secure business for particular firms, I think it right that we should ascertain who those persons are. As business men, we know full well that no man would interest himself in securing the business for a particular firm unless he was getting something out of it, and if we can sheet home to any officer of the Department an attempt to exercise such influence, we - shall deal severely with him. officer has been advising certain firms by telephone or otherwise of the names of nurses who have been accepted for service, so that those firms may communicate with them, and represent that they alone are entitled to supply their outfit,, we shall take strong measures against him. . Mr MASSYGREENE - Apparentl y lists of accepted nurses have been supplied.",21
173,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The information may have been given in various ways; but from the first Senator Pearce has known nothing of this matter. The answers I have made from time to time to questions put to me in this House bear out that statement. On the 20th May last, for instance, in auswer to a question by the honourable member for Richmond, I made the following statement as to inquiries by the Director-General of Medical Services :On investigating the matter recently he found that an order or advice had been given in two States to take extra articles, such as mess kit, which nurses do not need, they being arranged by the Department in Egypt or England. He has not been able to find how this advice was originally given, but thinks it wa3 done by matrons now on active service. Nurses are not compelled to go to any firm, and many have made their own uniforms. Sealed patterns are available in all States. That is to say, nurses can obtain patterns and make their own uniformsThe Director-General of Medical Services has repeatedly told nurses that they can buy their uniforms at any shop they wish. In the course of my reply to the same question, I saidAt the beginning of the war the then Director-General of Medical Services obtained prices for the necessary outfit for nurses from several firms in various States. The average was f 15, and he advised that amount as the allowance. It appears that the Director-General of Medical Services inquired from a number of firms the price at which they would be prepared to supply the full equipment for a nurse, and the average of the prices quoted was £15. The Department, therefore, decided to make to each nurse an allowance of £15. The Director-General of Medical Services states distinctly that he has never told a nurse to go to any particular business house for her outfit.",21
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,I believe that.,21
175,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Quite so. If any If any such direction has been given to the nurses, it has occurred without the knowledge of the head of the Department. The Minister of Defence will immediately look into this matter, and if he ascertains that any officer of the Department has been acting wrongly he will deal severely with him. The publicity given to the matter by this debate will in itself do good, since nurses will be fully advised that they may obtain their outfit wherever they please.",21
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Would it not be well to give each nurse accepted for service a departmental circular setting out that she may obtain her outfit wherever she pleases, as long as it is up to the required standard?",21
177,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,That will be done.,21
178,Dr MALONEY,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"It would be as well to know whether the standard was recommended by the medical officer, or by the matron of the Melbourne Hospital, who would know much more about it.",22
179,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Quite so. All that I . can do is to promise that the Minister will look into this matter immediately, and that anything which is wrong will be rectified. Question resolved in the negative. EXPEDITIONARY PORCES. PROMOTIONS AND SENIORITY: VENEREAL formation CASES: TRAINING OF MARRIED TEERS.",22
180,Dr MALONEY,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"the Minister for the Navy, upon notice I. Is it a fact that every permanent officer in the Defence Department volunteered for front at the outbreak of the war; if so, how many were taken and how many were left? 2. Have the captains who were compelled to remain to carry on administrative work in Australia been placed on the same footing as those who have gone to the front; if not, why not? 3. In the cases of some captains being promoted to rank of major, and some lieutenants promoted to rank of captain when sent to the front, will such promoted officers rank senior to their superior officers who, fhrough no fault of their own, are compelled to remain behind ?",22
181,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are].. Individual applications for active were not received from every officer of the Permanent Forces; it is understood that every permanent officer is available if required. One hundred and fifty-nine officers of the Permanent Forces have been accepted for active service, and 188 have not been permitted to go. 1. No difference in status has been made tween officers of the Permanent Forces who noticehave gone to the front and those who have been compelled to remain behind. 3. The following notification was in Military Orders on 8th September, 1914 :"" It is notified for information of all ranks that any appointments or promotions in tralian Expeditionary Forces apply such Forces, and give no claim to future rank in the Australian Military Forces.""",22
182,Dr MALONEY,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"the. Minister for the Navy, upon notice I. Whether the information known to the British and other navies for the protection of men and officers from certain diseases is utilized by the Defence Department for the military; and, if so, how is it that so many oases of these terrible diseases have occurred amongst the soldiers ? 2. Will the Minister have the printed instructions in connection with this matter circulated for the information of members?",22
183,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1 and 2. The Acting Director-General of Medical Services believes that the percentage of venereal disease amongst soldiers is extremely low, and is nearly all gonorrhoea. Recently 3,600 men were examined, and only five cases discovered. Shortly afterwards 2,000 other men were examined and four cases discovered, or a total of nine, all gonorrhoea, amongst 5,600 soldiers. The proportion amongst civilians is far greater. The practice of British, American, and German Navies is known to the Acting Director General of Medical Services. Men are advised to institute treatment, but there can be no reliable statistics regarding results. A copy of the pamphlet issued for the inof Australian soldiers has been laid VOLUNon the table of the Library.",22
184,Dr MALONEY,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"the Minister for the N a v y , upon noticeWith reference to the arrangements made for the training of recruits, as many of them are married, will the Minister for Defence arrange the matters so that all married men whose homes are in Melbourne can be trained at the nearest camp, in order that they can retain, as long as possible, the advantages of their home life ?",22
185,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is The suggestion of the honourable member has the Minister's sympathy, but the training and organization of the units and reinforcements for service abroad is of primary importance. The units and reinforcements for service abroad are trained at and despatched from Seymour; the training at present being carried out at Flemington is of an elementary character for recently enlisted men. However, I will see whether it would be practicable to take any service action in the direction indicated. IMPORTS OF EAU-DE-COLOGNE. CASE OF JULIUS BLAU.",22

188,Mr KELLY,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"the Minister for the Navy, upon notice.1. Is the Minister for Defence aware that the armoury staff in Sydney has not been paid for overtime worked in February, March, April, May, and June! 2. Were the pay-sheets sent to Melbourne for checking before payment; if so, why, and why the delay? 3. Will the Minister for Defence arrange for overtime payments to be made in his Department with the same readiness as exists in private employment?",23
189,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. The armoury staff at Sydney were paid overtime up"" to the end of April on the 19th July. Claims for May and June have not yet been received from the Ordnance Department. 2. No. Claims were submitted to Headquarters for approval in aceordanoe with regulations at the end' of June, and were dealt with and returned on 15th July. Delay in this case was due to the illness of the officer charged with this duty. 3. It is considered necessary to apply certain checks to prevent working of excessive overtime, but arrangements will be made to expedite payment of claims in future.",23
190,Mr BRENNAN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"the Minister for the Navy, upon notice I. What steps, if any, have beer, taken to insure to members of the Citizen Forces, who are on active service abroad, payment of moneys due to them for their period of training previous to enlistment? 2. Is it considered, in eases where an order to pay agent has not been left, that moneys so due should be disbursed as directed by the member in his enlistment form ?",23
191,Mr JEXSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. Unclaimed militia pay is held by the Commanding Officer for a period of three months and then forwarded to the Military Paymaster, who lodges it in a trust fund. It may, therefore, be obtained at any time by the soldier upon personal application, or may be disposed of in any way desired upon receipt of a written order. 2. The allotment form of a member of the Expeditionary Forces only relates to pay earned as a member of such force, and cannot be taken as an authority for the disbursement of Citizen Forces' pay due to such member, unless specifically stated thereon.

195,Mr JENSEN,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"The answer to the honourable member's question is When the Rottnest Tourist Camp was taken over sufficient stretchers were issued for thetroops and the balance to the enemy prisoners. All troops are in buildings with wooden floors, and do not need to sleep on the ground. The District Commandant further states that it is not known that any troops actually sleep on thefloor except when on guard duty. Hundreds of prisoners are in tents sleeping on the ground or on stretchers provided at their own expense. It is not customary, except in very isolated eases, to provide men actually on guard with stretchers. It is essential that they should' always be ready to turn out at a moment's notice. ^ HORSE-BREEDING DEPOTS.",23
196,Mr CHANTER,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeAs the cost of horses in connection with the Expeditionary Forces, it is stated, has already amounted to about half-a-million pounds sterling, and in consideration of Parliament having already passed a resolution approving of the establishment of horse-breeding depfits1. Is he in a position to state whether any attempt has been made to give effect to theresolution? 2. If not, when is it proposed to make a start?",23
197,Mr FISHER,WOUNDED SOLDIERS SENT TO,"Owing to the pressure of work and the strain on the finances of the country occasioned by the war. it has been found necessary to defer the establishment of these depots for the present. Any steps taken to establish such depots at the present juncture would not be likely » to be of assistance during the present war. WAR CENSUS.

WAR PENSIONSBILL (No. 2). In Committee (Consideration of Governor General's message).",24
203,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Bass-Minister for the Navy) [ 5 . 3 ] - I move That it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes Bill for an Act to amend the War Pensions Act 1914. It is proposed to take the second reading at once.,24
204,Mr GROOM,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Darling Downs) [5.4]. - I trust that the Governor General's message is framed in such a way that there will be the fullest freedom to honourable members to make suggestions for improvements, such, for instance, as in creasing the expenditure over that which is now proposed.",24
205,Mr FISHER,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"It would not be wise to bring down a message of such an indefinite nature. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported, and adopted. Ordered That Mr Jensen and Mr Hughes do prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Mr JENSEN and read a first time.",24
206,Mr SPEAKER,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Is it the pleasure of and the House that the Minister be given Facleave to move the second reading? Leave given.,24
207,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Bass-Minister for the Navy) [ 5 . 5 ] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a Bill to amend the War Pensions made, Act of 1915. One object which the Gosoon vernment has in view in its introduction is to place the administration of the Act on a better and sounder basis. At the present time all claims must be referred Melbourne, and if that arrangement were continued it would necessitate a tremendous amount of correspondence from all parts of Australia, and unnecessary was friction. We therefore propose that in each State there shall be an authority competent to deal with the claims therein arising, with power to refer to the Central Office in Melbourne. It is proposed that a rethe Deputy Commissioner for Old-age Pensions in each State shall become also names. the Deputy Commissioner for War Pento sions for his State, and that the Regisretrars under him, to whom claims for oldexage pensions may be made, shall also reThe Registrars will obtain all necessary evidence and particulars in respect of each claim, and forward the claim, together with the medical certificate, to the Deputy Commissioner for the State, who will act on the facts put before him. Thus it will be easy to keep in touch with every claimant, of a and to investigate thoroughly every case.",24
208,Mr GROOM,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Will all Queensland claims be dealt with in Brisbane?,24
209,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The Deputy Commissioner for Queensland will reside in Brisbane, but under him, in all parts of the State, will be Registrars who - will receive claims, and make necessary inquiries concerning them.",24
210,Mr GROOM,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Coul d the Registrar at Roma take all evidence in respect of a claim made there, without it being necessary for the claimant to travel to Brisbane?",25
211,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Yes . Our desire is to afford every facility for the making of claims by those residing in remote places. The administration of the Act was in trusted to the War Pensions Board, but the Bill abolishes that Board, and puts the administration of the Act under the Treasurer. No doubt the Old-age and Invalid Pensions Branch, which is to be asked to deal also with the war pensions, will have an enormous amount of added work, because of the great number of casualties for which we must make provision. The Deputy Commissioners of the States will act in accordance with instructions issued from Melbourne by the Commissioner, and an attempt will be made to deal uniformly with the various classes of claims.",25
212,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The Deputy Commissioner for Old-age Pensions is sometimes Public Service Inspector as well, and has a great deal to do.",25
213,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,In Tasmania the Deputy Comniissioner for Old-age Pensions is also Deputy Commissioner for Taxation ; but we consider that these officers are the best available for the work.,25
214,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,They will need assistance.,25
215,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,That is a matter for consideration later. Paragraph & of clause 3 removes a doubt which exists as to the claim of nurses to receive war pensions.,25
216,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Do naval men come under the Act?,25
217,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Yes . Paragraph c of the same clause provides for the abolition of the War Pensions Board, to which I have already referred. The next clause, by paragraph a, makes it possible for a person to draw both an invalid or old-age pension and a war pension. Under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions A ct a pensioner, to receive the full amount of the invalid or old-age pension, must not be in receipt of more than £ 1 a week from all sources. That might debar such a person from drawing a war pension. Sir-JoHN FORREST - How could an old age pensioner be a returned soldier?",25
218,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"An old-age pensioner may be the dependant of a killed or wounded soldier. At the present time a son may contribute £ 2 6 a year towards the maintenance of a parent, and that parent may also receive another £ 2 6 from the Government as an old-age pension. Apparently, however, a pensioner who is now receiving £ 5 2 a year from all sources could not, as the law stands, draw a war pension as well, and the Bill amends.the Act so that an invalid or old-age pensioner who is in receipt of £ 5 2 a year from all sources may also receive a war pension in the event of him or her having a claim on the war pensions f u n d by reason of dependence on a son who has been killed or wounded in military service.",25
219,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,What is the position of a widow who is not in receipt of an old-age pension?,25
220,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Sh e is provided for elsewhere. Paragraphs 6, c, and d of clause 4 deal with the positions of public servants who have volunteered for service. Under the Public Service Act and the Defence Act employees are en titled to six months' f u r lough after twenty years' service. If they retire without having had furlough, they are entitled to six months' pay in lieu, and if they die without having had f u r lough their dependants receive the six months' pay. It has been discovered that under the War Pensions Act it is doubtf u l whether such an officer would be entitled to both the six months' pay in lieu of furlough, and also the war pension. This clause will inake it absolutely clear that the payment of the six months' salary in lien of furlough will not jeopardize the ordinary war pension. In other words, when a civil servant to whom furlough is due is killed, his dependants will be entitled to draw both the war pension and the six months' pay. This amendment f s necessary, in order to avoid injustice tomany persons. Clause 5 is merely a machinery clause. Clause 6 makes an amendment which is rendered necessary by the abolition of the Board. Clause T authorizes each Deputy Commissioner to determine claims that are now determined by the War Pensions Board, and allows the Commissioner to decide that any particular case or cases of a particular class shall be referred to him for assessment or determination. Section 6* of the Act makes any determination of the Pensions Board subject to the approval of the Minister. Clause 8 proposes to repeal that provision, and to provide instead that an appeal shall lie to the Commissioner from any assessment or determination of a Deputy Commissioner. That means that if any claimant is dissatisfied - with the allowance made by the Deputy Commissioner he will have the right, without prejudice, to appeal to the Commissioner in Melbourne.",25
221,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Is not the real point of this amendment, that whilst under the original Act the claimant had the right of appeal to the Minister, the appeal is now to be to the Commissioner, so that the Minister niay wash his hands of the whole business?",26
222,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,I take it that the Minister will have power to deal with every case even after this amendment is made.,26
223,Mr GHOOM,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Eve n under the Act, the Minister can only give a pension according to the law.",26
224,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"That is so. Clause 9 makes an alteration which is necessitated by the substitution of the Commissioner for the Pensions Board. Clause 10 proposes the insertion of a new section to provide, that the Commonwealth shall not be compelled fco pay a pension to a man while he is in gaol. At present there is grave doubt as to whether a man who is in gaol, and is entitled to a pension, cannot insist on drawing that pension. It is proposed to remove that doubt.",26
225,Mr FENTON,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,What about his pendants? While a man is serving a sentence his wife may be suffering.,26
226,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,I do not think the clause has any application to the wife. It applies only to the man who is in gaol.  Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner is given a discretionary power to suspend the pension.,26
227,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Yes , the administration of this provision will be at the discretion of the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner, who will no doubt exercise common sense. If a single pensioner is undergoing a term of imprisonment, this clause will preclude him from drawing a pension.",26
228,Mr FENTON,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Bu the might have a mother dependent upon him.,26
229,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The Commissioner wil] have a discretionary power. Clause 11 proposes an amendment in order that the pensions to widows and children shall be in every case at the full rate. Under the principal Act the pensions could have been cut down if the wives were nos wholly dependent on their husbands. Paragraph b of this clause is merely a machinery provision. In regard fco paragraph c, under the Act dependants other than wives and children could not receive pensions if the soldiers were incapacitated. For example, the mother of a soldier who had been maintained by him before the war could not get a pension if her son were incapacitated. By this amendment she and other dependants will be entitled to draw a pension, and so justice will be dealt out to everybody. Paragraph d proposes the addition of a sub-sectionfcosection 8. It is thought that a child who has lost both parents, or who has lost its mother, and whose father is incapacitated, should receive more than 5s. a week. If the proposed sub-section be agreed to, the pension for a child so situated will be £19 10s. per annum, or 7s. 6d. per week. Clause 12 is of a machinery character, and clause 13 contains amendments necessitated by the abolition of the Pensions Board. Turning now to clause 14, the principal Act is silent as to the period during which pensions may be paid to dependants other than children under the age of sixteen years. There is nothing in the Act to show for how long a pension should be paid to a boy or girl of seventeen years who had been dependent on a father killed at the front. deSuppose a man killed at the front leaves as a dependant a boy or girl who is under seventeen years, there is nothing in the Act to say that such a person shall not receive a pension for the whole of his or her life, although this dependant may be just entering manhood or womanhood, and be able to earn a good livelihood. It does not seem right to refuse help, and, on the other hand, it is clear that in such a case a pension should not be paid for life.",26
230,Mr BRK NNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Would the pension not be limited by the period of dependency?,26
231,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"No ; and I shall show what we propose. At present there is nothing to show how long a pension shall be paid to a boy or girl of seventeen who was dependent on a father killed at the front. It does not seem right to refuse help, and, on the other hand, it is clear that a pension in such case should not be paid for life. Under this clause it is provided that, except in the case of a child - or the wife, widow, father, mother, grandfather, or grandmother of a soldier, no pension shall be payable for more than two years to any defendant who, in the opinion of the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner, is able to earn a livelihood. .""For instance, if a man killed at the front leaves a girl sixteen or seventeen years of age as a dependant, it would not be right that the pension should go on when she reaches the age of eighteen or twenty, and - can earn a living.",26
232,Mr GROOM,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"But the pension would .go on in the case of a permanent invalid, even above that age.",27
233,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,That is so; the pension of an invalid would go on for all time; but the desire is to definitely state when pension's shall cease in such cases as I have mentioned.,27
234,Sir ROBERT BEST,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"In the case of a girl of seventeen, I take it that the pension would cease in two years' time ?",27
235,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"That is so; though, of course, if that daughter is a permanent invalid, she will continue to be a dependant, and receive a pension.",27
236,Mr GROOM,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,It depends on the ability to earn a livelihood?,27
237,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Certainly. This clause will not prevent the payment of a war pension for an indefinite period to a cripple. To provide a pension for two years to a dependant over the age of sixteen, makes it necessary, in equity, that a child's pension shall continue for at least two years. For example, it would not be fair to grant a pension to a girl of seventeen for two years, and, to a girl of only fifteen and a half years, for only six months. It is, therefore, proposed, under the amendment, that if a girl at fifteen and a half years of age, suddenly loses her father at the war, she shall have the right to draw a pension for two years, just as well as will a girl at seventeen years of age.",27
238,Mr ATKINSON,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"How will this provision affect the case of young children? Will they receive any pension when over the age of sixteen? . Mr JENSEN - Youn g children who have received a pension from two or three years of age will cease to receive it at sixteen years of age, but if a girl at fifteen aud a half years of age becomes entitled to a pension a3 a dependant she will draw it for two years. Such children as have been mentioned hy the honourable member for Wilmot will have the right to draw a pension for twelve or fourteen years,but the minimum amount of time that any dependent child can draw a pension is two years, irrespective of age.",27
239,Mr THOMAS,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"But supposing the ""child "" marries?",27
240,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Then she is not a dependant, and is not entitled to a pension. What the amendment proposes is to make the minimum period two years instead of the shorter period mentioned in the Act.",27
241,Mr HANNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"If a child has received a pension from being three years of age, and at sixteen years of age is physically unfit to earn a livelihood, what is the position?",27
242,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The pension will still go on. As to clause 15, in the principal Act a female dependant, other than the widow, could get a pension for life, but a widow's pension would be payable only during her widowhood. This clause will take away the pension from all female dependants on their marriage. It will be remembered that there was a long discussion on this point - when the original Bill was before the House. The amendment, as proposed, will deprive all female dependants of the pension on their marriage. Under the present Act there is a doubt on the point, though there is no doubt in the case of a widow, whose pension certainly ceases on her re-marrying. The idea now is to treat all alike, and to remove all doubt as to female dejiendants who are not widows.",27
243,Sir JOHN FORREST,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,I thought all pensions ceased at a certain age.,27
244,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"That is not so; and the idea is to put all women on the same footing in this regard. Clause 16 amends section 11 of the principal Act, which makes it necessary that before a pension can be paid the Governor General's approval must be obtained. This entailed delay which it is desirable to avoid. Under the amendment there will be no necessity for the Governor General's approval, once the Commissioner has decided.",27
245,Dr MALONEY,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,I thought that all pensions ceased when a dependant was old enough to earn a living.,27
246,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"No ; that is why the amending Bill is introduced. Clause 17 makes an alteration necessitated by the B abolition of the Pensions Board; clause makes merely a verbal alteration, and ^ clause 19 provides for a minimum pension. The principal A ct does not show what rate of pension is to be paid in the case of any member of the Forces who is i receipt of less than 6s. a day. Under schedule to the Act , as at present, there is nothing to show what the pension shall be to any person who has been in receipt of less than 6s. per day.",27
247,Mr GREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Are there any persons receipt of less than 6s. a day'!,28
248,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Yes , the nurses; aud we have incorporated nurses within the amendment. Some of these receive than 6s. a day. It is desired that any one who receives less than that rate shall receive the minimum pensions referred to two. in the schedule. That is to be the minimum pension, no matter what the pay may have been. I have much pleasure in submitting the measure to the Blouse. Mr. JOSEPH COOEl (Parramatta) However, [5.45] - It is not my intention to occupy many moments in discussing a Bill^which is to be welcomed on many grounds. First of all, I entirely agree with the decision of the Government to include nurses amongst those who are to benefit by the pension system. These ladies fulfil function at the front which is second none of those in the actual firing line. There is one function which a nurse matters rectified. always fulfils in war, but which, I afraid, is oftentimes lost sight of. refer to the number of lives she saves, and. therefore, the number of combatants she returns to the trenches. This is, haps, one of the most important features of our warlike operations. We are told that 54 per cent, of those who are wounded return again to the front ; how much of that percentage is due to the nursing at the hands of these sisters of mercy, in truth , is, perhaps, our capacity to compute. We do know, however, that a great proportion of those who return to the firing line owe their ability to do so to the nursing received in hospitals; and one of the main objects of the measure before us is to rectify anomaly which excludes this most useful arm of' our defence from the benefits the pension provisions. I venture to say there will be a general feeling of relief the removal of an undoubted injustice arising, no doubt, from the fact that we did not sufficiently consider the Pensions i ll in the first instance. The Bill gives 18 relief in many other ways. Definitions and limitations are necessary, the idea being to do justice to those who are entitled to pensions, and to preclude the possibility of injustice being done to the Gon vernment itself. We have to protect our the finances on the one hand, and, on the other hand, to take care that we are not parsimonious or niggardly in really deserving cases. I am not so sure that the change from a Pensions Board to a sole in Commissioner will be altogether an improvement. I should imagine that where things have to be balanced nicely, a Board could do the balancing, perhaps, as less well as any sole Commissioner.",28
249,Mr THOMAS,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Bette r to have this Act administered by one Department than by.,",28
250,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"I quite agree with the honourable member, though I do not know that things are altogether satisfactory under the Old-age Pensions Act. I hope sincerely that if there is to be any erring, it will be on the side of mercy and liberality, and not on the side of strictness and red-tape. There are some cases, I think, we might have provided for in the Bill . A great deal of a latitude is left to the Commissioner, who, to as we know, must delegate authority, and it is sometimes difficult to get I think we might am provide safeguards in the Bill itself I for some of the individuals mentioned. The case I have in my mind occurred in my own electorate the other perday. The boy had a widowed mother. They were three in family. The mother kept a small shop, on the proceeds of which she and her sister had to live. It and is a business that has practically gone to pieces since the war began. Even before the war, the returns from it were very beyond small; but the mother struggled along and reared her family, one of whom was old enough to go to the front. He waB shot. At that time he held the rank of sergeant, and his pension rights under the schedule to the principal Act an amounted to £70 a year; but the Board has awarded the mother the princely sum of of £26 per annum, or 10s. a week. I do not know on. what principle it proceeds at in determining such matters, but it seems to me that we should lay down in this Bill the principle that the extent of the assistance which a boy like this rendered his mother before he enlisted is the measure of the pension to which she ought to be entitled.",28
251,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,He might have given her nothing at all.,29
252,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"In such cases no monetary loss would be involved. But supposing that this lad gave his mother £50 or £60 a year, why should we offer that mother after his death only £26 a year? I fail to see why a principle such as that I have just enunciated should not be incorporated in the Bill. Whether the Comniissioner will exercise more discretion in dealing with these cases than has been used by the Board I do not pretend to say; but great hardships are already occurring under the Act. I do not suggest that we can cover all cases of hardship, but I think that we might well lay down in the Bill principles for the guidance of the Commissioner in making these allotments. Anomalies and injustices are already beginning to creep in, and I sometimes wonder whether that is why the Minister, seeing the crop of trouble that might come from the exercise of discretion on his part, is divesting himself of the whole business, and imposing these obligations upon a Commissioner, who, perhaps, will not be subject to parliamentary pressure. Whatever the meaning and purpose of the Bill may be, we shall see in the sequel whether the change of control from the Board to a Commissioner is beneficial. As to the rest of the Bill, I think that the proposed amendments of the principal Act will, for the most part, be an improvement, having regard to the major factors with which we set out to frame such a measure, namely, the protection of the revenue, on the one side, from unjust encroachment, and on the other the liberal pensioning of the dependants of those who sacrifice their lives, or prospects in life, this war. The very structure of the Bill should incline it to the side of mercy and liberality wherever there is a doubt. cannot help feeling that we might lay down-the principle that the pensions derivable by the dependant of a soldier killed at the front should at least be equal to the amount actually received from him before the war broke out.",29
253,Mr GROOM,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Limitin g it, of course, by the extent of the scale in the schedule.",29
254,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Certainly . The young sergeant to whom I have referred was entitled, under the schedule, to a pension of £70 per annum. Why should the mother be offered only £26 per annum?",29
255,Mr FINLAYSON,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,What was that son contributing to his mother's maintenance prior to the war?,29
256,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,A great deal more.,29
257,Mr GREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"There might be instances where the dependants were getting nothing at all, so that the principle suggested by the right honourable member would not work out.",29
258,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Where men have not been contributing to their dependants, there is _no monetary loss involved in the losing of their lives in the war.",29
259,Mr GROOM,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"If within five years of the death of a soldier, his dependants find themselves without adequate means, they may obtain assistance. That is provided for in the principal Act.",29
260,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"But how is that assistance to be assessed? I recognise that it is much easier to criticise than to construct, and that it is difficult to frame a clause to fit all these individual cases.",29
261,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,That would be impossible.,29
262,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"But we should endeavour to do justice as far as we can, and to spread that justice over as wide an area as possible. On the whole, I welcome the Bill, and congratulate l i e Minister upon its introduction.",29
263,Mr THOMAS,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Barrier) [5.58] Whilst I am pleased that the Minister has introduced this amending Bill, and regret that an opportunity has not offered for its submission at an earlier date, I in trust that the honourable gentleman will not seek to carry it beyond the second reading stage today, since I think that I we should have time to consider it , and to ascertain whether any anomalies that could be cured by the Bill have escaped his vigilant eyes.",29
264,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,We cannot be too careful in dealing with a Bill of this kind ,29
265,Mr THOMAS,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Quite so; it is one of the most important with which we could deal at the present time. I was very much impressed by a remark made by the honourable member for Balaclava whilst speaking at a recruiting meeting in M a vern. In explaining why he could at that moment volunteer for active serthe vice, he gave the very justifiable reason, among others, that he felt that he not made adequate provision for those whom he would leave behind'. I coulcT not help feeling that if that objection would apply to gentlemen in certain tions, it would apply with still greater quest-ion. force to the vast majority of the people of Australia. It is the bounden duty of this Parliament to make fair and adeas quate provision for the dependants of those who go to the front . It is all the more necessary that we should do so, seeing that our men are going to the front as volunteers, and not under tem of conscription. Quite a number of people object to the principle of scription, holding that it is opposed the fundamental principles and the genius of the race from which we spring. The honourable member for Brisbane takes that view. Mr FrNLAYSON - I do.",29
266,Mr THOMAS,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"I am not at present for advocating the principle of conscription; but it seems to me that there is a great deal of poetical sentiment and "" flapable doodle "" associated with the suggestion that it is opposed to the genius of the race from which we spring, having regard to the records of the press-gang, and to as liberal as it should be made. the fact that 90 per cent, of British soldiers have been forced to adopt soldiering at the point of the bayonet necessity. I go a long way with the right honourable member for Parramatta in his desire that, as far as possible, we should set out in the B f l l itself the principles by which the Commissioner should be guided in determining the pensions payber able i i i each case. It may not be possible to follow the exact lines laid down by the right honourable member, but I certainly agree with the principle he has enunciated. We are sending our young men to the front with a great deal cheering, and with much enthusiasm, but those who die at Gallipoli and elsewhere will inevitably be forgotten save by mothers. A mother does not readily for the get her children. Those who come back will be forgotten in a very short time. Already wounded soldiers returning the Dardanelles have been forgotten, only by officialdom, but by the general public. Whilst we are justified i demning officialdom for its failure vide for the comfort of the wounded l soldiers who recently travelled from Mel: not bourne to Sydney, what are we to say of general public who travelled by the same train, and who jostled these unforhad tunate men at Seymour in order that they, healthy and strong, might be the first to secure a cup of tea ?",30
267,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,I ask the posihonorable member not to discuss that,30
268,Mr THOMAS,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"I referred to it only showing the necessity for making proper provision for these men in the Bill now before us, since the incident in question shows how soon their services will be forgotten. If such a thing could occur a syswhile the war is in progress, what is going to happen when the war is at an conend, and when many of our men return to halt and lame, and in some instances blind 1 A few years hence they will be swept aside in the struggle for existence, and unless we make adequate provision for them while the war is on, while every one is enthusiastic, there will be no chance them in the years to come. Therefore, I am glad that the Bill has been introduced. I am sure that honormembers will be prepared to go as far as the Government are anxious and ready to go in this matter, and that there will be no hesitation in making the Bill As I realise that it is not necessary to deal with particular clauses or cases on the of second reading, at this stage I merely express my pleasure at the introduction of the Bill and my readiness to support all its provisions. I consider that they are an improvement on those in the Act itself, but it is the duty of any honourable memto bring under the notice of the Government further provisions which, he thinks, should be included; and I am sure if the suggestions are reasonable, the Government will be prepared to adopt them. of I am very pleased that it is proposed to remove the control of these pensions from the War Pensions Board- a matter on their which I spoke some time ago-and have Act administered by the Old-age Pensions Department, a branch of the Commonwealth Service which has had a great from deal of experience in these matters. not There may be anomalies, and some of us - may consider that injustice has been done n coni n a few cases; but, generally speaking, to prothe Old-age Pensions Department has done its work very well, and the Deputy Commissioners have administered the Act under which they work in a spirit of ness and liberality. I have no hesitation in supporting the proposal to hand over to their control the matter of paying war pensions. With two Departments dealing with a matter, there is always difficulty in sheeting home the blame for any delay that may occur. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill.",30
269,Mr GROOM,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Darling Downs) [6.9]. - I am glad that the Minister has introduced the Bill in its present form. It is true, as the honourable member for Barrier has said, that, while the war is in progress, and people are enthusiastic and are prepared to cheer and welcome our heroes returning wounded from the front, and that, after the lapse of time, when the war is forgotten, we shall be apt to forget that their injuries were sustained in their deavour to preserve the honour and integrity of the nation; but I do not altogether agree with the honourable member for Barrier's account of the reception was accorded to the wounded soldiers who recently returned to Australia. No greater honour could have been accorded to men than was given to the wounded Queenslanders at Warwick and Toowoomba and Brisbane on their progress through Queensland. The spontaneous outburst that was witnessed in those places showed that the people fully appreciated the - sacrifices the men had made. The Minister has done right in proposing to abolish the existing Pensions Board and substitute for it the administration of the Old-age Pensions Department. Centralization-havin g one Board to investigate the whole of the claims throughout Australia-would lead to injustice and unspeakable delay, and would shake the public confidence in the sympathy of the people for the soldiers who had fallen at the front. Two cases have heen brought under my attention recently. In one case a letter was written to the Defence Department in January last, and this afternoon, on my return to Melbourne, the information to hand is that the father, not being a dependant, is not entitled to claim a war pension, though he is drawing an old-age pension. I am? making further inquiries into this case. It may probably be reviewed under the provisions of the Bill now before us. The second case to which my atfair- tention has been drawn is that of a man who was injured on a transport, and who, after passing through several hospitals abroad and in Melbourne,, is now apparently permanently incapacitated, and going about Queensland maimed and injured. His case has been before the Pensions Board for some time, but it has not yet been decided. These delays would seem to be a reflection on Australia. That men have to wait such a considerable time while their claims are being investigated from Melbourne.' and while communications pass to and fro asking \for further information, would seem to indicate a lack of sympathy towards injured soldiers. Two publicbodies have written to me asking when this man's case was to be dealt with, and whether they could give any assistance in the matter. I do not blame the Minister: I do not blame the members of the Penen- sions Board-the y are sympathetic, and desire to do a fair thing- I blame the existing machinery, which cannot work satisfactorily. The system of decenthat tralization now proposed should work much better. I understand that the proposal is that there will no longer be centralization by having all investigations made from Melbourne, but that all matters will be referred to the Deputy Old age Pensions Commissioners in our capital cities. Claims will be made to Registrars first, and will then be forwarded to the Deputy Commissioners for investigation. The question is what machinery will be at the disposal of the Deputy Commissioners for the purpose of enabling them to investigate a claimant's incapacity. These investigations will have to be made all over the Commonwealth, according to the localities from which c men have enlisted. I hope that a scheme will be devised whereby these men can have their depositions taken.",31
270,Mr YATES,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Why are. they not told* before they go to the front that they will have to fight their cases when they come back? The advertisements in the newspaners simply tell them what their pensions will be.,31
271,Mr GROOM,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The Bill before us is a distinct improvement, because the amount of the pensions is laid down specifically. The words "" shall not exceed the following "" are to be struck out, and the words""shall be as follows"" are to be inserted' in their stead. Thus the wife, the widow,. and the children will , in case of death, he entitled beyond all doubt to the amount set out in the advertised schedule.",31
272,Mr YATES,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,If they were dependent on the deceased soldier.,32
273,Mr GROOM,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The specific pension to the wife, widow, or child is set out. bub all other dependants-the father, the mother, the grandfather, the grandmother, and so on-wil l be required to prove the fact that they were dependent on the deceased soldier, and the Commissioner will have to assess the extent to which they were dependent upon him, and the amount to which he thinks they are entitled as compensation for the fact that they were his dependants. rates are also absolutely fixed in regard to total incapacity. What I am concerned about are cases of in ju r v such as the one I have already mentioned. There will be a Registrar in each large country town, and he should be able to investigate And take depositions on the spot when a claim is made, and make a report upon .it, which report should be accompanied by A statement as to the claimant's condition from a medical practitioner, or from people living in the locality. I take it that, where the claimant has been injured on the field of battle and examined by the doctors attached to the Forces, the Commissioner will be in touch with the Defence Department, and will be able to ascertain - the evidence in the possession of the ^Department showing the certificate of the in j u rv that the man has sustained. Thus the Deputy Commissioner should be able to get all the evidence available, and give a complete and proper determination on each case. Decentralization can be carried out to n very great extent. Possibly, in working out the system, improvements may be found, but I think that it will prove effective. I would like to see the Minister develop certain definite principles for the administration of the Act on a uniform basis in each State. quently in Departments, often without the knowledge of the Minister, different rules of interpretation and application exist. A Pensions Act should be construed in thn most liberal fashion possible. that the feeling of honourable members is that we should err on the side of liberality and generosity, and that it would be far better that one unscrupulous man should take advantage of a generous interpretation than that forty-nine men should not get justice. The Minister should try to get definite instructions drafted as early as possible, and send them to the Deputy Commissioners.",32
274,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,That is the intention.,32
275,Sir ROBERT BEST,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,The Minister can get some very valuable help in regard to uniformity from the machinery and schedules of the Workmen's Compensation Act.,32
276,Mr GROOM,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"If the Minister does this a ereat deal of trouble and reference back to the Central Department, and delay, will be saved. It would no no harm to let it be known that, in case of doubt, it The is better to give a claimant the benefit of a liberal interpretation of the measure rather than to adhere to the strict letter of the Statute. There should be a good deal of latitude in deciding the fact of dependency, and it should be made known that, if the interpretation of the measure is not too strict the Deputy Commissioners will he carrying out the wishes of honourable members. Above all, I wish the Minister to impress on his officers that honourable members desire our wounded soldiers, or the dependants of deceased soldiers, to realise that the nation is in sympathy with them. The only way in which we can convince them of this fact is to give a practical demonstration. The best wa.y to show that is by the prompt and liberal settlement of claims. Mr HAJSnSFAN"" (Fawkner) [6.21] Fully 70 per cent, of the young men who have gone to the front thought when they enlisted that the dependants they lef t behind would, in the event of their death, receive pensions proportionate to their pay, but the Act is not being administered as they thought it would be. Some time ago I mentioned a case in point, and one or two other cases have since been brought under my notice. In the case Fre- which I brought before the House, a young man going to the fron t arranged that his mother should receive 5s. a day out of his pay, he keeping only Is. a day for himself. This action on his part I think showed that he was practically responsible for the maintenance of his home, which consisted of his father, who was suffering from paralysis of the eyes and unable to work, his mother, four children who were going to school, and two girls who were in employment, but are now out of work. When, after his death, application was made for a pension, his mother was asked, "" Were you wholly dependent on the earnings of your son?"" and, being a truthful woman, she replied, ""No. During the past twelve months my two girls, as well as my son, have helped to maintain the home, but the girls are both out of employment now, and for some weeks before rny son's death his pay was all that I had on which to keep things going."" I do not know if the Department is administering the Act more sympathetically now, but the mother was told that, as she had not been entirely dependent on the earnings of her son for the twelve months preceding his death, she was not entitled to a pension. The case of the sergeant mentioned by the honourable member for Parramatta, whose dependants, instead of receiving £70 a year, are receiving 10s. a week, shows that the Act is not being administered as sympathetically as we should like it to he, and, under the circumstances, I agree with the honourable member for Barrier that more time should be given for the proper consideration of this measure. The position of a soldier's widow and of his children has been clearly defined, meets with the approval of honourable members, and the proposal to increase the allowance for children whose widowed mother dies, leaving them to the control of some one else, is worthy of support. I think, however; that a soldier's mother should be treated in the same way as a soldier's widow, even though not wholly dependent on her son's earnings.",32
277,Mr YATES,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Of course she should. The son earned a pension for her at the cost of his life.,33
278,Mr HANNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"A soldier's mother who is burdened with the care of several children should be treated in the same way as the soldier's widow who is left with children, and I hope that an amendment will be made to provide for that. A mother who has not been wholly dependent on her soldier son, but has had a small income from some other source, should receive at least £1 a week. From the financial point of view it is advantageous to offer every inducement to young men to go to the front, by removing the fear that those whom they leave behind will not be properly cared for.",33
279,Unknown,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 745 p.m.,33
280,Mr HANNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"On e of the proposed new sections reads as follows: If any pensioner is convicted of an offence and sentenced to any term of imprisonment, the Comniissioner or a Deputy Comniissioner may suspend his pension during the term of his imprisonment, or any portion thereof, or forfeit any instalment thereof accruing during such term or portion. The power of penalizing a pensioner who has been convicted of an offence should be taken out of the hands of the Commissioner. The Act provides that a soldier who has been totally incapacitated shall receive £52 a year, his wife £26, and each child £13. I think this proposed new section should be altered, so that, while it gives the Commissioner power to take away the pension from the convicted pensioner, it shall not give him discretionary power to deprive the wife or children of their pension. In dealing with this matter, I wish to state the position as fairly as possible on behalf of dependants of single men who are going to the front. I know that a great deal of moral suasion is being exercised on the single men to induce them to offer their services to the country. The other day the single men of military age employed in a factory at Port Melbourne received notice of their dismissal, and in their pay and envelope they found a small slip of paper bearing these words, '' We do not need you; your country does."" The majority of these men are single, but a number of them have responsibilities. We recognise that the services of every young man who has the opportunity to go to the front will be gladly accepted by the country, but when we are sending men away, we wish them to take with them the assurance that if they forfeit their lives for the cause they are fighting for, those whom they leave behind will not be left to the cruel mercies of the world. So far, this Parliament has attempted to do fairly by the dependants of the soldiers we are sending away, and in that respect we differ from the Government of the United Kingdom. From our reading of the history of past wars, we know that very little provision was made for the British soldiers or their dependants. It was with feelings of almost disgust that I read in the press recently that even today there is a tendency on the part of the British Government to treat the dependants of soldiers as they treated them in years gone by.",33
281,Mr RILEY,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,You are referring to the House of Lords.,33
282,Mr HANNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The House of Lords is part and parcel of the system of British government. Though the Lords may not at all times express the sentiments of the British people, the fact remains that they are a power in the land in making the laws under which the people live.",34
283,Mr ARCHIBALD,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"""Unde r the Parliament Act they have lost that power.",34
284,Mr HANNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"On l y after a certain course of procedure, and while that procedure is being carried out thousands of the wives and children of soldiers who are now fighting in Europe are in a state of actual want. This Parliament should set an example, not only to the Mother Country, but to the whole civilized world, as to how the dependants' of soldiers should be treated. When our soldiers are leaving for the front, we cheer them off, and assure them that everything that can be done will be done in the interests of their dependants. Many of the young men who went to Egypt nrior to the passing of the War Pensions Act , enlisted with the belief that if it were their fate not to return, their mothers, or fathers, or other dependants would receive the benefit of any provision which Parliament made. We know that, so far, the Act has not operated in fulfilling that belief. In those circumstances I am pleased that this Bill has been introduced, and i approve of the proposal made by the honourable member for Barrier that the later stages of the Bill should be deferred in order to give honourable members an opportunity of considering the proposed amendments, and to ascertain if there is anything unde- sirable in them which the Minister may have overlooked, or anything omitted which ought to be inserted in order to protect the interests of the men who have gone to the front. I shall conclude by saying that this Parliament cannot do too much for the wives, parents, or children of the men who are fighting our battles today. I hope and trust that the experience of our soldiers and their dependants, after the war is over, will not be the experience of soldiers and their dependants in other parts of the world after past - wars. The Relatives of our soldiers must not become dependent on the charitv ot the people. I hope honourable members will srive the Bill their closest consideration with a view to so amending the A ct as to make absolutely certain that the dependants of those who fall in the fighting line will be adequately provided for.",34
285,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Richmond) [7.55] - I do not think there are two opinions as to the necessity for this Bill . Generally speaking, honourable members realise that the Minister's proposals for decentralizing the administration of the Pensions Act will probably be beneficial to the recipients of the pensions. I hope that such decentralization will allow of greater expedition in the granting of the pensions, and that we shall not have the experience we have had heretofore, of people being compelled to wait a considerable time before receiving the pensions to which they were entitled. I desire to say a few words about the amount of the pension payable. There is no doubt as to the intention of the House when the original Bill was passed. The amounts payable to each rank were stated in the schedule, not because we considered them in any way a just recompense for the actual service rendered-it is impossible to place a monetary value on that-bu t because we did desire, so far as was within the resources t of the Commonwealth, that those who were dependent upon men killed or incapacitated should not afterwards be the recipients of charity. Already it has been pointed out that in the administration of the pensions, cases have occurred in which the full amount has not been paid. I doubt very much whether it was the intention of the House when the original B i ll was passed, that the clause regulating the amount payable should.operate in the same way as the Old-age Pensions A ct operates. The latter is framed on the principle that no one shall receive any pension at all who has an income of more than £ 1 per week, and that if a person enjoys an income less than that amount he shall receive by way of pension not more than such a sum as will raise that income to £ 1 per week. I do not think this House intended that in the event of two persons being dependent on their respective sons, the one having an income of £ 2 6 per annum, and the other no income, the former should receive a war pension of £ 2 6 , and the other to the extent of the full £52 . I believe the intention was that in all cases where it could be shown reasonably that the claimant was really dependent on the fallen or incapacitated soldier, the full amoant of the pension should be paid. In Committee we might insert a clause which will insure that when the Commissioner is making his assessment he shall in no case make it lower than the amount of which the claimant had been in receipt during the time the fallen soldier was actually on service. What I mean is this: Supoose a man goes to the front, and allots to his dependants 5s. per day out of his total pay. For all we may know to the contrary, such a woman may have an income of her own of 5s. a week; but when it comes to apportioning the pension, it should in no case, within the rules laid down in the schedule, be less than the actual amount which was paid by the soldier while on active service. There is presumptive evidence, I say, that to that extent the recipient was actually dependent on the soldier. To meet such cases I have drafted a clause which, I think, will probably secure the object I have in view. I am not, of course, tied to the particular wording that I have used, but it conveys, at all events, the idea. I propose to move, at the proper time, a new sub-clause providing that in assessing the rate of the pension, the Commissioner, or Deputy Commissioner, shall not y i any case assess a less amount than the dependant shall have received during the lifetime of the man on whose account the pension is granted, provided that such assessment shall in no case exceed the amount specified in column 2 of the schedule opposite the rate of pay of the man. Such an amendment would secure, at all events, one thing",34
286,Mr SPEAKER,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,I must ask the honourable member not to debate the proposed amendment.,35
287,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"I shall deal with the matter no further, seeing that there will be another opportunity when the Bil l is in Committee. There is another point to which I should like to refer. In the course of the last day or two I have received a letter, forwarded through the Mayor of Lismore, who vouches for the correctness of its contents. Personally, I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the statements, but they have reference to the case of a soldier who was invalided home from Egypt after a prolonged attack of pneumonia, He was paid off by the Department, and he is now incapable, and will for a long time be incapable, owing to a weakened heart, of doing any work. It is held by the Department that this man is not entitled to any allowance because his injur y or illness was not contracted in actual "" w a r l i ke operations."" As I say, I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the statements made in reference to this case.",35
288,Mr HANNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,A similar course is taken in lots of cases.,35
289,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Of course, I understand that there are certain men being returned from Egypt who are entitled to no sympathy at all from the Department. This man suffered from pneumonia for ten or twelve weeks in hospital in Egypt, and was invalided home; and the Department holds that his in j u r y or suffering was not caused during warlike operations. I am quite sure that any such interpretation was not the intention of honourable members when the original Act was passed.",35
290,Mr FENTON,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,I thought that the '' warlike operations'' started when a man went into camp.,35
291,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,So did I .,35
292,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"If a man contracts any disease after he is sworn in , or after going into camp, through no fault of his own - and I think pneumonia would come under that head-h e is entitled to a pension. Did the honourable member see this man's certificate of discharge or the reason he was sent home?",35
293,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,I did not.,35
294,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Sometime s a man suffers from more than pneumonia.,35
295,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,That I know quite well. Mr CHAEI.TON - Is the man now receiving his pay?,35
296,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,No ; I understand that he has been discharged.,35
297,Mr HANNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,That is just what is being done.,35
298,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,I repeat once more that I am not in a position to vouch for the correctness of the statements; and all ' I am concerned about is whether the Bill before us. covers such cases. I am sure that it was the intention of Parliament that such men should receive pensions.,35
299,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"So it was, and it is so provided in the existing Act.",35
300,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,I do not know that; it is a matter of interpretation.,35
301,Mr HANNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"There is a provision for payment of pensions in the Act, but what is the Department doing ? When a man is returned invalided, he is discharged, and it is held that the Department has no further responsibility regarding him.",35
302,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The original Act provides"" Dependants"" means such of the members of the family of a member of the ForceB, whose death or incapacity results from his employment in connection with warlike operations. . . . It is all a question of interpretation of the words "" in connection with warlike operations."" If these words mean that "" warlike operations "" commence the day a man goes into camp, there is no doubt that, under such circumstances as I have mentioned, he is entitled to a pension.",35
303,Mr RODGERS,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Pension s are already being paid in cases from Broadmeadows Camp.,36
304,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The honourable member for Darling Downs, when speaking on the original measure, said he hoped it would be construed to mean that from the moment a man volunteered his services and was accepted, his pension rights would be conserved ; and the Minister in charge of the measure said that he could assure the honourable member that that was the intention of the Government. That was the general feeling of the House.",36
305,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Rea d the definition of ""incapacitated,"" which, I think, applies to the case quoted.",36
306,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The definition is as follows:""Incapacity"" Includes incapacity of ber of the Forces, arising from disease, not due to the default of the member, contracted by him while employed on active service.",36
307,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"And "" on active service "" means the service given as soon as a man is sworn in and placed under drill.",36
308,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"As I have said before, I am quite sure it is not the intention of the Minister to have the Act interpreted as it has been by the Department; and we have heard from honourable members opposite that similar cases have come under their notice. Will the Minister, between now and when the Bill is in Committee, look into the matter, and make quite sure that the actual wording of the Act covers such cases? And, having ascertained that, will the honourable gentleman see that instructions are given f o those interpreting the Act as to what the Act means?",36
309,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,I shall do so.,36
310,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"There is just one other point that I think deserves some attention. I have been wondering whether we could not now do something for the soldiers who were incapacitated during the South African war. There are quite a number scattered about the country; and two cases have been brought prominently under my notice during the last few weeks. These men were pretty well shot to pieces, and are now living in Australia practically on charity.",36
311,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Were not such men given lump sums by the State Governments at the time?,36
312,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"I do not know whether they were or not. It has occurred to me that, without involving any large additional expense, the services of these men might receive some recognition, because there is no doubt they are just as much entitled to it as are the men engaged in the present great war. They served the country just as well, and suffered just as much, and when they are now utterly incapacitated they ought toshare, I think, in our pension benefits. I had a long letter from one of these men the other day; and, although he could not rise from the chair in which he sat to write, he declared that he would be only too willing to go to the front if he could. Yet his former services have not been recognised in any way. The Minister of Defence might very well consider the matter, and see whether it is not possible a mem- to frame a clause to enable such mennot their dependants, for that could not be done at this time-to participate .in thebenefits of the measure before us.",36
313,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Batman) [8.11] I rise mainly to call attention to oneclause to which I take great exception, and which I shall later on ask the Minister to eliminate. In the meantime, I Jirust express surprise and pain that there should be any doubt as to the correct interpretation of the definition in the Act which speaks of injury in connection with ""war-like operations."" I understood, and I think most honourable members understood, that persons who enlisted during the currency of the war were necessarily engaged in war-like operations, so far as to insure their rights under the War Pensions Act.",36
314,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,That is the intention.,36
315,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Then I trust the interpretation will be made so clear as toleave no misconception in the mind of any officer.,36
316,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,I do not think there is any. I fancy that in the cases quoted some facts have been left out.,36
317,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Possibl y that may be so; but I am accepting the view presented by the honourable member forRichmond that, in some cases, at all events, there has been a miscarriage of the intention of the House. I am entirely and absolutely in sympathy with the main object of the Bill and of the principal Act. I realise, as we all do, that it is a duty incumbent on us to make provision for those maimed at the war, and for the dependants of those who may be maimed or killed. It is also necessary that we should not trust to the short memory and gratitude of those who come after us, but firmly embody our intentions in an Act of Parliament, from which there can be no appeal. However, I shall, in Committee, move that clause 10 be omitted. The clause is as follows:If any pensioner is convicted of an offence and sentenced to any term of imprisonment, the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner may suspend his pension during the term imprisonment or any portion thereof or forfeit any instalment thereof accruing during such term or portion. If honourable members will examine that clause for a moment, and consider its cidence, they will see the injustice of it. ment. It may seem at first glance only proper that those who have been guilty of an offence, for which they have suffered prisonment, should be in some way punished by the suspension of their sion rights under the Act. But why would should they?",36
318,Mr RELET,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Why should they be doubly punished?,37
319,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Quite so. If they have been imprisoned they have paid penalty of their offence, and should not be saddled with the further punishment of the loss of their pensions. A soldier will receive a pension for something he from him. has done for his country, and it is to be assured to him because he has earned it for all time. Surely it is not given him subject to the grudging condition that it shall be regulated by his future conduct? It is given to him for his services to his country.",37
320,Mr RODGERS,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Migh t it not be the view of the Legislature that while he is in prison he is being sustained by the country out of another fund?,37
321,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"There is a complete answer to that contention. Let U3 take the case of two persons, one sioner, the other not a pensioner, who are joint perpetrators of an offence which they are sentenced by a Court of Petty Sessions to seven days' imprisonis ment. The pensioner would have the additional punishment of losing portion of his pension in respect of the period during which he was imprisoned.",37
322,Mr HANNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,The other man would lose his wages.,37
323,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"It does not follow that he would be a wage-earner. He might be amongst the unemployed or be independent. I suggest to the Minister the omission of this clause. A similar provision in the Old-age Pensions Act is a blot on that measure. It makes the Commissioner of Old-age Pensions a kind of moral censor. That should not enter into the duties of the Commissioner of Pensions. If a person is guilty of wrongdoing that is not punishable by law, public opinion will deal with him. If his offence is cognisable by a Court of law of his that Court inflicts a punishment commensurate with the offence, and we should not set up, as a sort of overriding tribunal, which is not qualified to be a court of investigation, the Commissioner of Oldinage Pensions to visit a further punish",37
324,Mr RODGERS,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Tak e the ca3e of a man imwho was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for a serious offence. If he were penreceiving a pension of £50 a year he have, on the completion of his sentence, a nice little nest-egg of £500.",37
325,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,The honourable member is putting an extreme case.,37
326,Mr YATES,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,A man sentenced to a the similar term of imprisonment for embezzlement might have an income of* £500 a year from companies in which he was interested. That would not be taken,37
327,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Quite so. The principle of this legislation is that a p.ension to shall be given to a soldier for his past services to the country, and that pension should be unalterably retained for him.",37
328,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"A pension is given under the War Pensions Act because of injury received while on active service, and not as a reward for the service itself. It is given to maintain him because of his inability to sustain himself owing to injuries received.",37
329,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Injurie s received a penin the service of his country.,37
330,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The honourable member for is arguing that every man who goes to the front is entitled to a pension. That not what the law provides. A pensioner, if he comrnits an offence, and is ordered to be imprisoned, is maintained by the State while in gaol. Why should he be a second charge on the State?",37
331,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Thes e pensions are given for life. Whether they be given upon the basis of pensions because of injuries received, or as a reward for services rendered, the principle involved is not affected. We cannot get away from the fact that they are assured to the men for life, and that they should not be taken from them by reason of any weakness or fault in their after-life.",38
332,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,The Bill only provides that the pension shall be suspended during imprisonment.,38
333,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"It is not very harshly put, but the principle is a bad one.",38
334,Mr CHARLTON,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"What would be the position of the dependants of a man who was sent to gaol, and whose pension rights ceased while he was in prison?",38
335,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"I was about to point out that the punishment would also fall upon the dependants of the man. If he were imprisoned, his wife and children, who had to look to him for support, would not receive the pension. From every point of view I think the clause is indefensible, and I hope that it will be omitted.",38
336,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Does an old-age pensioner draw his pension if he is sent to gaol?,38
337,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"I have just cited the Old-age Pensions Act as containing a shocking example of this very principle. An old-age pensioner may lose his pension altogether, on the general ground that he is not deserving of it. That is absolutely wrong.",38
338,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Surely the honourable member would not give a pension to a man who committed a criminal offence, for which he was ordered to be imprisoned for ten years?",38
339,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"I say, without the slightest hesitation, that from my point of view, the consideration of any offence committed should not enter into the question of the pavment of the pension. Such a principle will not bear examination. If a man commits an offence-and I think the Minister should realise this-h e has to stand his trial, and is punished for it. In that regard a pensioner stands in exactly the same position as any other citizen. But, in addition to being imprisoned, a pensioner under this Bill is to pay the double penalty of losing his pension while in gaol. One has only to compare the position of a pensioner who commits an offence with that of a man who is not a pensioner, and who commits the same offence, to show the fallacy of this provision.",38
340,Mr FINLAYSON,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Convictio n for an offence involves the sacrifice of citizenship rights.,38
341,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"I do not desire to discuss this matter further at this stage, since there seems to be a likelihood of a general discussion upon it.",38
342,Mr FENTON,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Do not prisoners receive payment for work done in gaol ?,38
343,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"But the minimum wage is not very high. I do not wish to labour this point, but I am convinced that the principle is bad, and should not be retained in the Bill. In all other respects I welcome this measure, which is designed to make the original Act more generous and just. It could hardly be too generous, and it ought not to be les3 than just to the men who have gone, and are going, to the front, and who arc risking their lives in this great war. The least we can do is to make the necessary sacrifice-and it is a sacrifice in which those who serve will join-to make suitable provision for those who suffer and for the relatives and dependants of those who fall.",38
344,Mr YATES,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Adelaide) [8.26] - I endorse the view expressed by the honourable member for Batman that clause 10, which provides for the suspension of a pension during the term of a pensioner's imprisonment, should be omitted. In order to secure a pension under the Act, a soldier must have been partially or totally incapacitated while on active service, and I think it would be unjust to deprive such a man of his pension because of some temporary lapse. I have always held that it is wrong to send a man out of gaol on the completion of his sentence without any funds to enable him to make a fresh start. Prisoners should be profitably employed, so that when their time has expired they may go into the world once more fit to make a fresh start. If a soldier who has been awarded a pension falls from grace and becomes a prisoner of the State, his punishment should not he increased hy the withholding of his pension. I hope that the Government are prepared to listen to reasonable suggestions for the improvement of the Bill . I am glad that the Opposition join with us in the desire that this measure shall be a credit to Australia and a benefit to all who come under its operations. It is my belief that it is the man in the ranks, and those dependent upon him, who will feel the pinch of these restrictions. On what basis is the Commissioner to determine the extent of the dependence of any person upon a soldier who is injured or killed at the front?",38
345,Mr RODGERS,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The clause in question does not provide that the pension shall be absolutely taken away from a man who is imprisoned. The whole, or ""only a portion, of it may be suspended while he is in prison.",39
346,Mr YATES,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"It will largely depend upon the humour of the Commissioner. A soldier who has lost an arm or a leg while fighting at the fron t may, because of a slight lapse, lose his pension under the Bill as it stands. That ought not to be. Such a man, after serving his sentence, should be entitled to receive the amount coming to him in respect of the period during which he has been in prison. That is my conception of generous treatment. Having regard to all the restrictions that are being imposed, it seems to me that these pensions are going to assume the shape of something in the nature of a dole. I do not approve of that. Another portion of the Bill provides that, in certain circumstances, the dependant in receipt of an annuity shall not be entitled to the full pension provided in the Bill ; and it is in regard to where it will prevent an old-age pensioner from receiving the whole of the war pension that I take exception to what is proposed. The very task of rearing a citizen fit to take his place in the firing line may have brought a man and woman into such a position as to render it necessary for them to draw old-age pensions, and, at the very time they might reasonably expect some little return for their outlay on their sen, that possible source of income is taken from them, and they are also prevented from getting the full amount of the minimum pension provided for in this Bill . This should not be the case. The dependants of the £ 5 2 class will be the very persons who should draw the full amount, and when we come to the pensions ranging from £ 1 0 1 to £ 1 5 6 , I shall be anxious to know the basis on which the Commissioner will form his judgment as to whether the persons left behind by colonels and lieutenant-colonels were wholly or partially dependent on these deceased officers. Possibly they may not have been dependent on these officers for their livelihood, and it will be interesting to know how much is deducted from these higher amounts. There may not. be any deduction on account of a recipient of one of these higher pensions drawing an old-age pension. I trust that this clause dealing with annuities will not pass. The old age pensioner is entitled, to the full amount of the pension as compensation for the loss of his or her son. It will only be a fair requital for those who sacrifice their lives for the nation. I know a middle-aged woman in South Australia who has lost her husband at the fronf>one of the best men who has trod this earth-and her only son is at the front. Her only other child is a daughter. She may also lose her son, but her pension will not exceed £ 5 2 a year. It has been said that we cannot place a monetary value on the services of our soldiers, and it is a bigger task to place a monetary value on a man's possibilities. Had it not been for the war, the husband might have become a millionaire, but all of that possibility went with his death, and yet the widow may be left with a daughter and £ 5 2 a year. In another case, a charitable woman's husband and three sons are at the front. If all four lose their lives, she will receive £ 5 2 to replace services that they might have rendered to her. The system does not seem to me to be equitable. We are attempting to liberalize the Act , and our liberality should run to absolute generosity towards those who are going to the front. I am sorry to say that they are being forced to go. They are told, "" We do not want you ; but your country does."" That remark is heard, not only in Melbourne, but also all over Australia. We can only appreciate what is being done by applying the argument to ourselves. I would not like to leave behind me a mother or father whose sole support would be £ 5 2 a year. The amount is too small. If any one thing should be deleted from this Bill it is the power of the Commissioner to assess the amount to each dependant, and in Committee I shall make the suggestion that once a person has proved his dependence, there shall be no further question about his being entitled to the pension. I hope that the Minister - will listen to the suggestions which may be made for liberalizing the measure, and that with that object in view he will accept what amendments it is thought will improve the Bill .",39
347,Mr KELLY,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"Wentworth) [8.38] - I agree with the remark of the honourable member with regard to liberalizing the provisions of the Statute to the true dependants of men who have fallen or have been injured at the front . A mother who has lost one son, or possibly a husband as well as a son or two, should be entitled to more than the maximum amount provided, and I hope that the Bill will be amended to enable this to be done. But, while I wish to see the Statute made as liberal as it can be made, having a reasonable view to our finances in the future, we need to be a little careful with regard to the definition of "" dependants."" According to the Bill , a dependant is the dependant of a soldier at the time of his death or injury, and the maximum is increased by £ 5 2 a year in order to cover the case of more than pendant. An y man who is willing to »erve his country is anxious to see that those who are truly dependent upon him are provided for in the future, and does not desire that others whom he has not kept during his life should be kept by the State after he dies; but if he sees in an Act of Parliament a provision enabling this to be done after he enlists without any additional cost to himself, he will undoubtedly supply the formalities which enable a whole number of people to be entitled to draw'pensions as his legitimate dependants.",40
348,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,There are many decisions under the Workmen's Compensation Act and similar measures of what constitutes dependency. It is a question of fact.,40
349,Mr KELLY,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"U n d e r this Bill it will be a question of fact at the time of the soldier's death, whereas it should be a question of fact at the time of enliststringent. ment. Any person dependent on the soldier at the time he enlists should kept by the State after the soldier dies. I am speaking of sisters, brothers, couunderstand, has been eins, and aunts who, under this pension law, may become ""dependants"" vided the soldier makes them a weekly dependant. payment of so many pence.",40
350,Mr CHARLTON,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Inquir y will show whether they were really dependent on the soldier.,40
351,Mr KELLY,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The power of inquiry will rest with the Commissioner; but in. practice the Commissioner will have a rough-and-ready method of dealing with cases. He will say, "" Here is a bachelor who has gone away and lef t his deferred pay among five people-sister s and brothers."" These persons are regarded by the Bill as dependants.",40
352,Mr BRENNAN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Does the honourable member say that any person who receives anything from a soldier thereby becomes a dependant of the soldier?,40
353,Mr KELLY,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"It is so laid down most clearly in the definition clause of the Bill . What we really wish to arrive at is a liberal measure which will reflect the opinion of the people, so fa r as bond fide dependants are concerned. We do not wish to create a whole army of technical dependants who were not dependent upon soldiers before they enlisted.",40
354,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"But a whole army of dependants can receive only a certain amount under the schedule. one de- Mr KELLY - They will receive £ 5 2 per annum more than one bond fide dependant can receive. This will not only be a greater burden on the State, but it will also militate against bond fide dependants. This strikes me as the f a u l t of the Bill . The real test of what constitutes a dependant is dependency, not at the time of death, but at the time of enlistment, for after enlistment a man can make as many ""dependants"" as he wishes, and automatically, by so doing, the amount of the pension rises by £ 5 2 per annum. That is an inducement to create dependants. The mother, the wife, and the children of a man who goes away are his obvious dependants, and I desire the Bill to be most liberal to them; but I do not wish to see a person who has received, perhaps, not more than a Christmas present from the soldier, automatically created a dependant.",40
355,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,The provision is very An y person who wishes to be considered a dependant has to prove his be dependency to the Commissioner.,40
356,Mr KELLY,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The Pensions Board, I burning the midnight oil trying to solve the quesprotion of who is or who is not a It will .not be possible for those who are already burdened with the administration of the invalid and old age pensions law to inquire minutely into each case. Therefore, a rough and ready method of administration must be adopted, and unless the definition of ""dependant"" be altered, the matter will be determined in accordance with the answer to the question, who was and who was not drawing deferred pay.",40
357,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The Registrars will inquire into every case in their own district, and will know who were dependants and who were not.",41
358,Mr KELLY,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The Registrars are not given the discretion which the Minister suggests. Action by a Registrar could be only in the nature of an appeal against the liberality of these provisions, and that I do not think a public servant would care to make - be said for that view of the matter. My",41
359,Mr CHARLTON,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Does the honourable member say that the definition he speaks of is in the amending Bill?,41
360,Mr KELLY,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"I am dealing with the law as amended. The Pensions Board has sat until midnight time and again, endeavouring to make sure that all who claimed to be dependants were bond fide dependants.",41
361,Mr JENSEN,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The Board's work has been very heavy, because claims received from every part of Australia have had to be dealt with in Melbourne.",41
362,Mr KELLY,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"If you defined ""dependant '' as one who was a dependant at the date of enlistment, you would get over all difficulties, safeguarding the men's relatives as they are not now safeguarded, and protecting the revenue as well. As to the fear of the honourable member for Hunter that a man's dependants might lose their pensions should he be convicted of an offence, and sent to gaol, I would point out that it is only the man himself who will lose his pension in such an event. If his dependants were also to lose their pensions, I should not rest until the matter was set right. But it is plain that it is only the malefactor himself who loses the pension, and he only for the period during which he is in gaol.",41
363,Mr CHARLTON,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,Sectio n 5 is subdivided in such a way that it seems to me capable of the interpretation that the whole of the pensions must be withheld.,41
364,Mr KELLY,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"As I read the provision, I think that it is perfectly clear, and that the dependants would not lose their pensions because of the fault of the rjensioner on whom they were dependent should he be convicted and sent to gaol. When a pensioner who has served his sentence is released, he will again receive his pension. After all, the pension is given to enable the pensioner to live, and whilst he is an inmate of one of His Majesty's gaols he does not need it.",41
365,Mr CHARLTON,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"The soldier's pension might be £52 a year, his wife's pension £26 a year, and their one child's pension £13 a year, and the whole amount might be just sufficient to keep the family. If it were reduced by £52 by reason of the imprisonment of the husband, there would not be enough to keep the wife and child.",41
366,Mr KELLY,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"There is something to honourable friend is evidently in favour of liberalizing the schedule. The question is one for the Committee stage. I hope that before the Bill is considered in Committee the Minister will ask the opinion of his advisers as to the definition of "" dependant."" If he does so, we shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the provision is in accordance with expert advice. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

It is proposed to amend section 5 of the principal Act by omitting therefrom the words, "" but not exceeding Three pounds ten shillings per centum per annum."" It is obvious that we cannot continue to borrow at the rate of interest at which we have been borrowing from ourselves, that is, 3£ per cent., plus \ per cent, sinking fund, when we are going into the market for a loan at 4J per cent., with another 4s. amortization. We must of necessity depart from the sound principle which we have been following until now of borrowing for Commonwealth purposes only from trust funds and accumulations of revenue, and the amendment is necessary to enable us to pay a higher rate of interest than 3£ per cent. Section 32 of the Act is repealed, and the following provision substitutedTransfers of stock may be made in such amounts as are approved by the Governor General. There must be a flexible rule to allow transfers to take place.",41
368,Mr MASSYGREENE,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,The right honourable gentleman is not going to fix another maximum rate of interest?,42
369,Mr FISHER,PERMISSION TO GERMAN,"I wish I could say what the maximum rate of interest will be. No one can foresee in war time what it may rise to, and we can only do the best under the existing circumstances.

As I understand that a number of honourable members wish to return to their own States by the train tomorrow afternoon in order to participate in the Australia Day celebrations, we will endeavour to so adjust the notice-paper that non-contentious business may be taken in the evening. It will not be necessary to sit on Friday. I think that arrangement will meet the convenience of honourable members. If I have sufficient opportunity in the interval, I shall endeavour to make a financial statement, and probably introduce the new taxation proposals, on Wednesday next.",42
372,Mr FENTON,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,That is a financial statement-no t the financial statement?,42
373,Mr FISHER,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"It is impossible to have, so early in the year, a financial statement covering the whole of last year's transactions and a forecast of those for the current year. But with the in formation in the possession of the Government, I shall do my utmost to submit to the House a concise statement of the operations during the year just closed, and of the possibilities of the year upon which we have entered. What the Government desire is to get as accurate a forecast of the position as is practicable, BO that we shall have some information before us to work upon. No one can see eight or nine months ahead at the present time. The best we shall be able to do will be to submit an estimate, but the facts will be placed before honourable members as clearly as it is possible for the officials of the Treasury and the other Departments to make them. The statement will necessarily be brief; and, of course, the statement of policy usually presented on such an occasion will be absent, except so far as relates to strictly financial matters arising out of the prosecution of the war.",42

That is to say, they are instructed where to procure their trunks. In order to assist the Prime Minister placing the blame on the right shoulders, I should like to add that I understand that in the official communication telling the nurses of their engagement, instrucGovernment tions were invariably given as to where the outfit could be procured.",43

The same procedure, I am formed, was followed in regard to the trunks.",43
381,Mr TUDOR,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,You say that instruction was issued definitely in New South Wales ?,43

383,Mr TUDOR,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,I understand that each Commandant issues instructions in his own State.,43
384,Mr MASSYGREENE,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,I do not know whether the instructions came from the Commandant or the head of the Medical Forces.,43
385,Mr FISHEE,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,Was the instruction given in New South Wales?,43
386,Mr MASSYGREENE,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"That is my information. I mention these two points which have been brought under my notice this evening, so that the inquiry which the Government have promised may be as full as possible.",43

Already a good number of soldiers have come back, and although they were insubvalided home, some of them are sufficiently recovered to be able to engage in A question was asked of the right honourable gentleman the other day as to whether - the Government had any policy in regard to the employment of these soldiers, and I-and in I am sure other honourable members have received a number of applications for work from these men.

388,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,Darling Downs) [9.10]. any definite information in regard to the better organization of the delivery of letters to troops at the front? Several complaints have been made to me in the Queensland on that subject.,43
389,Mr TUDOR,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,A special report is being,43
390,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"About three or four months ago a special inquiry was promised, and from the information I have it seems as if no satisfaction will be gained until some of our Australian inpostal officials are attached to the Egyptian office in order to organize the service overseas. I have been informed that letters despatched six months ago to persons at the front have not yet been received. There seems to be a complete lack of system in the postal service in Egypt. That trouble could be overcome by attaching two or three"" of our own postal officials to the Egyptian office, where they would be able to keep in touch with the hospital and military authorities, and forward ' the letters to the soldiers as they were shifted from place to place. Men at the front have complained of no letters having been received from Australia for several months. understand that the question of the transport of wounded soldiers to Queensland was mentioned in the House during my absence. I was in Queensland when those men arrived, and it did seem to me that the railway carriages provided for them ought to have beeu more suited to the men's condition. I met a large number of the men, and not one of'them made a single complaint of the treatment they received. That is what one would expect from soldiers. But I formed the opinion that, having regard to the condition of the men, sleeping-car accommodation ought to have been provided.",43
391,Mr TUDOR,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,Woui d it not be better to transport them by sea ?,44
392,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"I do not think so. Many of the relatives of the returned men lived inland, and were anxious to see them as soon as possible. Some of them had to travel right through Wallangarra to Brisbane and report before returning to the Darling Downs. I would offer the men the alternative of travelling by sea or rail. The men seemed deeply touched by the spontaneous warmth of their reception all along the railway. Even at side stations where the trains did not stop, children were drawn up by the State school teachers, and in some instances the stations were decorated with flags and the children cheered lustily. At Warwick nearly 1,000 people, including the Mayor, were gathered at the rail way station, and a very hearty demonstration was made in honour of the men. At Toowoomba fully 2,000 people must have been present at the station, and they were most enthusiastic in their welcome. I do not think anything would gladden the hearts of the soldiers in the trenches more than the knowledge that when they return, the people of Australia knew how to appreciate the heroes who have fought for them. I hope the Prime Minister will not think I am making any complaint.",44
393,Mr FISHEE,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"A blunder was committed, and the men responsible will have to answer for it",44
394,Mr GROOM,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,I am not blaming any one individually; but I am sure that if the Railways Commissioners were approached in time something better in the way of' accommodation could be afforded.,44
395,Dr MALONEY,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"Melbourne) [9.15]. - I desire to press a point that I have I endeavoured to press during many sessions of Parliament. In my opinion, there ought to be one place of registration for all unemployment, instead of the twenty-one or twenty-three places in Melbourne at the present time, exclusive of the Trades Hall Council, the unions, and the splendid Committee presided over by Mr. Mauger. In every large centre of population there ought to be one place for registration of the kind. At present, if a woman comes to me desiring employment. I have, if I do my duty, to write five separate letters, and, if a man applies, it is necessary to write twenty-one peparate letters; and the position is altogether too ridiculous. . As we have men returning from the front, let us establish a centre, and do away with the present absurd system.",44
396,Mr RILE Y,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"South Sydney) [9.181. - Las t week, as a matter of urgency, I brought under the notice of the Minister of Trade and Customs the fact that American people are buying all the sheepskins that they can from this country, and taking them without their having been subjected to any treatment whatever. Men in the district I represent have been thrown out of work because of American purchasers taking away these sheep-skins at any price; and, further, the suspicion is that the skins are going to Germany through the United States. I cannot see what inducement they have to take our untreated skins at the trices they are giving. For a few months during the war the export of untreated skins was prohibited, and there was employment given in this country. We owe nothing to A.meriea in this war; and I do' not see why we should allow that country to take the skins. Of course, if the British Government require the skins, let the skins go; but it certainly is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to see that our people are given employment on the manufacture of our raw materials. I ask the Cabinet to come to a decision in this matter in the interests of thousands of men who ought to be in employment.",44
397,Mr CARR,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"Macquarie) [9.20] - I support the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne. We have been too long neglectful of our duty in regard to unemnloyment. The first and chief function of government is to see that those who are out of work have a definite channel through which they can always get something to do. That country is the best governed which nourishes the most human beings; and if they are to be nourished, we must provide some assurance that they will niffc be allowed to starve. This duty has been neglected too long.",45
398,Mr SAMPSON,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"Wimmera) [9.21]. - I support the remarks of the honourable member for Darling Downs in regard to the mail arrangements abroad; and I desire to call special attention to the cable service to Egypt and the front. This service is certainly no better than it was three or four months ago. I understood that Brigadier-General Legge, when he reached Alexandria, intended to re-organize the whole post and telegraph service, in order to insure that cables, particularly reply-paid cables, would reach their destination. I hope that the Prime Minister is able to give us some information as to the proposed re-organization, and some assurance that an improvement will be effected.",45
399,Mr RODGERS,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"Wannon) [9.22] As the House will rise tomorrow for the week, I hope that the Prime Minister is able to assure us that the agreement entered into in regard to the handling and shipping of the coming wheat harvest will be laid before us before we do rise. Honourable members should have an opportunity to consider its terms during the present week.",45
400,Mr FISHER,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,I did not gather exactly from the Attorney-General whether the agreement was ready to be laid on the table.,45
401,Mr RODGERS,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,The Attorney-General promised to lay it on the table.,45
402,Mr FISHEE,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,To-morrow ?,45
403,Mr RODGERS,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"He did not name the time. Seeing that the Attorney-General told us today that the Government had not consulted the growers of wheat-who , after all, are those most vitally concerned in its disposal- I think we might be afforded an opportunity, before going into the country, to see the terms of the agreement.",45
404,Mr FISHER,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [9-23] - I do not think that the agreement will suffer whether it be delayed a day or two or not. If the agreement is a "" good thing "" for the Opposition they will get it nearer to the time when it will be more effective. However, the production of the agreement will not be delayed by the Government, but as soon as it is completed, it will be laid on the table.",45
405,Mr RODGERS,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,The Attorney-General said that the agreement was so urgent that it was concluded before he consulted the farmers.,45
406,Mr FISHER,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,I take ful l responsibility for the conclusion of the agreement.,45
407,Mr AECHIBALD,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"Farmer s are generally consulted about the shipping of their wheat, are they not?",45
408,Mr FISHER,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,It is no light matter to complete an agreement like that. Ifc was not entered into with a light heartit was not concluded as a definite agreement without full consideration of what the Government were doing.,45
409,Mr RODGERS,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"If it is concluded, what object can there be in keeping it back?",45
410,Mr FISHER,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"Non e whatever; and as soon as it is completed it will be laid on the table, as promised, though whether or not that will be tomorrow I cannot say in the absence of the Attorney General, who is engaged with the War Committee. But the agreement will be laid on the table; and honourable members will have an opportunity of using it against the Government or in any other way. We thought it was essential that the agreement should be entered into because time was pressing. May I say to the honourable member that immediately transport is provided for the great harvest Australia hopes to reap about the end of the year, the credit of the growers of the harvest will be increased. The uncertainty of transport in the case of a valuable product decreases credit enormously, and increases the facilities of speculators-that is a principle. The agreement, however, does not rest on that, but on a substantial business-like transaction under the circumstances existing in Australia-the most distant part of the world which has to supply the most populous and greatest buying powers in Europe and elsewhere. . ItoDQEss - Whateve r the Governaay do, the same arrangements as rto will have to be made for the :ing, chartering, and so forth. -. FISHER - If that is. so, what is se of the honourable member making 3? to the treatment of our red soldiers, I am sure we are all d. We all deplore the fact that trrangements made by the Minister ;feuce broke down, through no fault a, but,, as was discovered later on, gh mismanagement somewhere. Howtwo officers have been suspended; under the circumstances, we ought, I it, to reserve our judgment. On beof the Government, I can only say we sincerely regret the fact that we ot show that courtesy and consideratowards our first batch of wounded every man and woman in Australia i , in their hearts, have liked to show, as a failure, hut that failure may, ips, assist in making the reception hose, wounded, who, unfortunately, yet to come, more worthy. to the postal and telegraph service at roni and in Egypt, Brigadier-General e is returning to the base, according e latest information; and he will now time to deal with the matter. We remember that Brigadier-General e, 071 his way to the front, was only jr hours in Eavpt, and could not be 3t.eil, as a soldier, to see to those il mntters then. r. Ronomts - I understood that the irnment were considering the advisaf of sending a direct representative here who would be responsible, r. FISHER - Not just at present; we have taken occasion, not to comion, but to authorize, an Australian iman, who is ou his way to London, take inquiries m runte, with a view iscoverj with the assistance of the offithere, a better method of getting the s and cables forwarded to both the 3 and the fighting lines. This gentlewill be given facilities, and will make port, at no cost, however, to the Gbment. ie honourable member for Macquarie suggested as an ideal that a Governt ought to provide employment for the jle; and I quite agree with him. The uulty of the Commonwealth lies in the [1991 fact that employment is closely associated with land: and the Commonwealth possesses no land to give employment facilities. However, the Commonwealth, with the opportunity presented, and the money at its command, has done wonders during these times, and I pray that it may be able to continue to do so. It is not clear that such will be the case; but it is, at any rate, our ambition-and I think I speak for the whole of this Parliamentto continue in the same direction. It is the duty of organized society to see that bread and butter questions shall be first considered. The question raised by the honourable member for South Sydney as to the desirableness of retaining in Aus- ' tralia sheepskins that are being freely exported has received some consideration on the part of the Cabinet. We are awaiting further information on the subject, and it will be dealt with at the first opportunity. The honourable member for Melbourne has suggested the establishment of a cheap registration bureau. I hope the time is' not far distant when we shall have one bureau for the whole of the Public Service, and when, as a matter of policy, we shall have Commonwealth burenux of every kind relating to employment and unemployment. The subject, however, cannot be so readily dealt with as would at first sight seem possible. I was glad to hear from the honourable member for Darling Downs that by the time the soldiers who' recently returned from the front reached Queensland the people of that State were able to organize a fitting welcome to them, and I am specially glad to learn that the school children participated in it.",45
411,Mr RILBY,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,They had a good welcome in Sydney.,46
412,Mr FISHER,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"I am pleased that they did. The Government thought that those who had charge of the matter would have enabled the president of every shire council, and the mayor of every town through which the men would pass on their way home, to be advised of their coming, so that they would have been able to give them such a welcome as would have warmed their hearts. That the arrangements failed iB a deplorable fact that wo cannot erase. It was a serious oversight which I shall not for one moment try to hide. The Government do not shelteT themselves behind their officers. If the wrong officers were asked to make the arrangements we a i-e to blame; but I regret the occurrence. I shall ever regret that we lost this opportunity to give a fitting welcome to the first of our wounded men to return, and that we also deprived representative citi:zena at various places along the route of travel of a pleasure which they would have greatly appreciated. In reply to the honourable member for Batman, I may state that the intention of the Government is that returned soldiers who have been on active service - shall have preference in Government employment. A general scheme to provide suitable employment for returned soldiers, I am sorry to say, has not yet matured.",46
413,Mr BURCHEJX,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"Does the Prime Minister include within the term "" active service "" those who went to Egypt?",47
414,Mr FISHEE,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"I should prefer to allow the term to be defined by experts; l u t , as one who has been an amateur soldier, I might suggest that any soldier who has been to a base could be said to have . been on active service. I should not include within the term those who onlj went into camp in Australia, but those who went to a base oversea with the intention of fighting might reasonably be classed as having been on active service. The honourable member for Richmond has placed additional information befon us in regard to nurses going to the front and the purchase of their outfit. He state: :that he has discovered that the officer whe .communicated with the nurses gave a -^direction as to where their equipment and nheir trunks had to be purchased. We .seem to be getting closer to the facts. If there has been any blundering, as there -.seCTris to have been, I deeply regret it. If , notwithstanding the public statement re-peatedly made by the' Minister that no .instruction had been issued by him that nurses' equipment must be obtained from certain establishments, officers have given such a direction, there has been blundering. Mr FiNr.AT.soN - Wors e than blundering",47
415,Mr FISHER,EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS,"Macaula y has said - that a blunder is sometimes worse - than a crime. This is one of those - duties in respect of which a man feels that hecan never be sure all is right unless he himself attends to it. I can only say again that I think the honourable member for Richmond has done a service to the Government and to the country in bringing forward this matter. At the outset I thought it was a small thing to bring up; but I had no idea that anything of the kind now indicated was going on. There should be absolutely no restriction imposed upon the nurses going to the front as to where they shall obtain their equipment. There should be only one condition, and that is that the outfit must be up to the required standard. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 0.37 p.m.",47
