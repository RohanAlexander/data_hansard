7,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"That is a matter for the House to consider. My right honourable colleague, the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), reminds me that on the afternoon of the 22nd a garden party is to be tendered to HerExcellency Lady Helen Munro Ferguson.

8,Mr BURCHELL,ACTION BY SHIPPING COMBINE TO INCREASE,"I desire to ask the Prim© Minister1. Has the Shipping Combine or any of its representatives approached the Commonwealth Government or the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers with a view to increasing freights between Australia and Great Britain? 2. If so, with what result? 3. Can it be definitely stated whether the existence of the Commonwealth Government Line of Steamers has at any time been responsible for preventing an increase in the freight rates?",20
9,Mr HUGHES,ACTION BY SHIPPING COMBINE TO INCREASE,"The honourable member was good enough to apprise me of his intention to ask this question, and I now desire to supply him with the following reply1. Yes. 2. The Government has declined to increase the freights of the Commonwealth Government Line as suggested. 3. As the vessels of the shipping Combine have not (so far as is known at present) increased their freights between Great Britain and Australia, it can only'be assumed that the action of the Commonwealth Government is responsible for the freights not being raised.

17,Mr MARR,STATEMENT SHOWING TOTAL AMOUNT PER,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether Max Herz, a native of Munich. Germany, was interned during the same period as Father Jerger and Dr Hirschfield, and for similar reasons? 2. Whether Herz himself, during liis internment, provided evidence of his disloyalty? 3. If so. what considerations have influenced the Government in not deporting Herz, seeing the other two men were deported, especially in view of the fact that the medical profession of Australia has brought forward evidence to show that there' is no professional reason why he should be retained in Australia?",21
18,Mr HUGHES,STATEMENT SHOWING TOTAL AMOUNT PER,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. Dr Max Herz was interned on Iflth July, 1915, and was in the internment camp when Father Jerger and Dr Hirschfield were interned. 2. No doubt the honourable member refers to a request made by Dr Herz during his internment that he should be allowed to return to Germany 3. Very strong reports from numerous patients and the parents of patients desirous of treatment having been made, which indicated that he was possessed of great manipulative and surgical skill in orthopaedic cases, and that many afflicted persons had unbounded faith in him, and the Solicitor-General having recommended that he be not deported, it was decided to release him in order that he might attend his patients. SinGe this decision a deputation of medical men waited upon me in Sydney and urged that Dr Herz be deported. The deputation, which was a most representative one, assured me that a number of Australian surgeons possessing equal or superior skill were available to treat all the cases treated by Dr Herz! The matter is now being considered by the Government. NA ENGINEERS. RATES OF PAY .",21

Government have reviewed the circumstances and secured a report concerning the new schedule of rates applying to the Koyal Australian Engineers, as mentioned in Tlanstinl report, pages 2270-2271, 19th May, 1920? 2. Have the commissioned ollicers of the Koyal Australian Engineers received increments in their rates of pay or allowances? 3. Will the Minister provide a schedule of BUCII increases, if any, that apply to sappers and N.C. officers during the same period? 4. Does the Government intend to provide actual increases to the men and N.C.O.'s of the Royal Australian Engineers?",21
20,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:I . Reports have been submitted and have received consideration. ' The new rates of pay, which came into operation on 1st April. 1920, were framed by a representative committpe of senior officers, and are considered to provide reasonable minimum and maximum rates for the respective ranks. Following the principle which was established in the Australian Imperial Force, the basic condition has been adopted that all branches of the Permanent Forces be brought under one scale of pay instead of, as hitherto, having varying rates for theseveral branches. Having regard to the military value of the services rendered by the members of the several branches, it is considered that sufficient reason does not exist for continuing the old practice. Non-commissioned officers and men of the Royal Australian Engineers were, under the old regulations, already receiving rates which, in many cases, approximated to the general rate provided for their ranks under the new scale. In tliese cases no appreciable increase will occur until the members obtain promotion. 2. Commissioned officers of the Royal Australian Engineers have received the same increases as officers of other branches. No distinction is made between officers of the several branches, of the Forces-the y are all paid under the same conditions, and at the same rates for equivalent ranks. In this the commisRank.

The rates which were payable under the old regulation, and under the new scale, have been prepared in the form of a statement, which I will lay on the table They are as follow:ROYAL AUSTRALIAN ENOOTEEBS-RATE S OE PAY. Living in Barracks. Living out of Barracks. Old Rate. Present Rate. Old Rate. Married. Single. Married. Single. Married. Single. Married. Single. 106/-to 100/- to 88/5 to - 115/5 109/6 112/6 103/11 110/2 121/- 115/79/7 to 83/2 to 96/- to 90/- to 88/5 to - 109/7 105/- 107/6 98/7 104/4 116/- 110/83/- to 77/- to 76/11 to - 84/7 82/6 82/6 76/2 79/4 91/- 85/- NOTE - The following are the rates for married men.

It is not the present intention to vary the rates which have been approved except it be to reotify anomalies. For the purpose of bringing' to light any such, a Committee of Warrant and STon-Commissioned Officers from the two largest States has been appointed, and any representations made by them will receive full consideration.

25,Mr NICHOLLS,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN,"the Treasurer, upon notice Whether he will consider the advisability amending the War-time Profits Tax Assessduty, ment Act, with the object of making retrothat spective the exemptions of co-operative sociewith ties trading under the Rochdale system during the whole period of the war?",23
26,Sir JOSEPH COOK,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN,"The income of the societies referred to was subject to the war-time profits tax in respect of the year 1915-1916 only. This matter of its retrospective action was, I understand, carefully considered when the last amendrepresenting ing Act exempting these societies was upon noticepassed, and it was decided by my late colleague that it should only aipply to the down year then current and future years.

Has he had an inquiry made as to the merits or demerits of the Bulloh process of preserving fresh meat? 2. Is it a fact that this process has been in use in Orange for the past two years? 3. In view possibly of the great value of this process to country and city districts alike, if a success, will tlic Minister have expert inquiry made and a report submitted at an early date?",23
27,Mr MASSYGREENE,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. Yes. 2. I understand this is so. 3. As an inquiry has been made, no further seems necessary at present! but I shall be pleased to forward to the honourable member a copy of the reports made by the expert officers of the Department. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. EMPLOYMENT OF RETURNED SOLDIERS.",23
28,Mr JOWETT,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN,"for Mr ROBERT COOK) asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice Whether it is correct that the services of a number of returned soldiers now employed in the casual branch of his Department are to be dispensed with?",23
29,Mr WISE,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN,"The Acting Deputy Postto the master-General, Melbourne, has furnished the follo'iving information:Twenty-five casual employees (returned sol- ' diers) took up duty in the Mail Branch on 17th June, 1920, in consequence of a depletion of staff due to an outbreak of influenza. These men were originally engaged for a period of twelve days, but were retained to of work off arrears of leave. Before commencing however, they were distinctly informed their services were liable to be dispensed at any moment, and they are still employed on that understanding. It is probable that a few weeks will elapse before their engagement is terminated. SMALLARMS FACTORY . MINIMUM WAGE.",23
30,Mr NICHOLLS,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN,"the Minister the Minister for Defence, 1. Is it a fact that the Board of Trade laid as the basic wage in Lithgow the amount 2. If ""so, does the Minister propose to bring the Government employees at the Small Arms Factory, who are now paid the minimum wage of £2 12s. per week, up to the Board of Trade's finding? 3. In the event of the Government not recognising the Board of Trade's declaration and compelling the employees at the Small Arms Factory to approach the Federal Arbitration Court in ordci"" that they may receive the minimum wage, and seeing that it may take the Court two years to arrive at a decision, will the Minister agree to making the finding of the Court retrospective from the 1st of March, 1920?",23
31,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN,"T h © a n swers to the honourable member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. The New South Wales Board of Trade declaration regarding the living wage for adult male employees, Central Tableland Area, may be seen in the Tfew South Wales Government Gazette, No. .130, of 9th July. It finds that the average cost of living for that area, based on a system which is not admitted by the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration as satisfactory, is £3 ISs. 2.

In view of the possible delay which may occur in bringing their case before the Court, arrangements are being made for a conference between representatives of the Department and of the Arms, Explosives, and Munition Workers Federation regarding the wages of the employees of the Small Arms Factory. L ANDSETTLEME NT OF SOLDIERS.  the honourable imember for F l in d e r s (Mr Bruce ) asked the following questions relat i v e to the settlement of r e turn e d soldiers on the l and : Whether, in view of the financial interest and responsibility of the Commonwealth in connection with the question of the settlement of soldiers on the land, he will obtain the following information from the various State authorities, and make such information available for members of this House:(a) The number of returned soldiers in each State, up to the latest available date, who have been placed upon the land through the agency of the respective State's machinery in connection with the repatriation scheme? (6) The average purchase price in each State of the properties acquired for such purpose? <C; The average number of valuations obtained in respect of such properties prior to their acquisition? <f?) The average amount paid for valuations in respect of each such property? (e) Whether the amount paid in respect of such valuations is added to the purchase price of the land to the soldier? The Minister for R e p at r i at i o n (Senator M ill e n ) has n o w f u r n is h e d m e with the desired in for m at i o n , w h i c h has been made available by the several State Governments : New South Wales{a) Four thousand two hundred and ten up to 30th April, 1920.

(d) Valuations are mostly made by departmental officers. (e) The small amounts paid will be added, but will make no appreciable difference to the capital value. Queensland(o) The number of discharged soldiers who have been allotted land as perpetual lease selections in the State to date is 1,867. (6) The average purchasing price paid for properties acquired for discharged soldier settlement cannot be given, as in a number of cases the Land Court has not yet determined the amount of compensation. Where the compensation has been fixed, the average price of the properties is about £9 per acre, but when the total compensation of the acquired lands has been determined, the aver1 age will be very considerably reduced. (c) In all cases the services of officers of - the Lands Department have been utilized for the purpose of making valuation for the Crown on acquired lands. (d) In three cases only were the services of outside valuators used to verify the figures of the departmental officers. The average cost of such valuations was £42, (e) In computing the capital value of the land to the discharged soldier, no sum to cover the cost of the services of the officers of the Department, nor any of the amounts paid to private valuators, has been added to the compensation money paid for the land.

IMPORTATION OF FORGINGS .",25
33,Mr LAIRD SMITH,ROYAL AUSTRALIAN,"On the 3rd September (the honourable member for (Mr J . H . Catts) asked the f o l l o wsettler. All ing questions: 1. Is it the intention of the Government to import' forgings for Commonwealth shipbuilding at Cockatoo Dock? 2. Is the Broken Hill Proprietary Company able to supply steel of the requisite size and in quality for such forgings? 3. Has a 5-ton hammer been recently erected placed upon the at Cockatoo Island? 4. Is there a 7-ton hammer at Mort's Dock, 5. Are competent forgers available in Aus168; tralia capable of doing any forgings for any ships it is proposed to build at Cockatoo IsI am now able to furnish the honourable member with th© following information : 1. The question of importing a number of engine forgings for two large vessels building at Cockatoo Island Dockyard is under consideration. 2. The Broken Hill Proprietary Company is able to supply steel ingots of the size required. 3. A new hammer has been erected at Cockatoo Island of about the capacity indicated, 4. There is in existence at Mort's Dock, Sydney, a hammer of about the capacity indicated. 5. There are competent forgemen available in Australia capable of carrying out the work of manufacturing forgings of the size required. The reasons for importing a portion of tliese forgings are as follows:(a) Up to now about 50 per cent, of the large forgingB for ships under construction have been imported, and even under this arrangement the completion of the larger forgings has always delayed to a greater or lesser extent the vessels which have been completed. (6) The plant available as above is not suitable for efficiently working these large ingots, and some of the ingots supplied have not been very satisfactory. There is no doubt that tlic forgings turned out arc not equal in quality as yet to the imported material, although by exercising great care in supervision and manufacturethe forgings accepted by the Dr partment have complied with Lloyd's test. It is considered that in these large vessels for the overseas trade, carrying exceptionally valuable cargoes, the best material should be employed for such important purposes as shafting, &c. NA ARTILLERY.",25
34,Sir GRANVILLERYRIE,ROYALAUSTRALIAN GARRISON,"On 25th August th© honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) asked th© following question: Is it the intention of the Defence Department, on the plea of employing returned soldiers in the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery, ,to discharge married men who volunteered, and obtained the volunteers' badge, but were prevented from going to the war; and is the Department recruiting young single men who <lid not go to the war? I am now in a position to furnish the honourable member with the following in formation : No members of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery who volunteered for active service are being discharged except those who reach the age limit, or are undesirable. Members of the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery who, being eligible, did not volunteer, will not be re-engaged on the expiration of their present period of enlistment. Preference in enlistment is always given to applicants who have had war service, provided that such applicants conform to the physical standard necessary for enlistment in the Royal Australian Garrison Artillery.

Th© amount actually in hand in the Commionwealth Bank up to mid-day today is £25,046,470, and our experience in the past indicates that the mails from country districts, which will reach the various State capitals during the next few days, will bring further substantial amounts, which, together with some large subscriptions, of which we have be©n notified, but which are not yet actually in hand, will bring the total up to substantially .more than the £25,000,000 required. In the course of another day or two I hope to be able to supply detail figures showing the amount received in each State, and I am pleased indeed to be able to say that appearances indicate that the quota allotted to each of the several States will be f u l ly covered by them.

Surely th© honourable member does not object to be told that New South Wales, as well as the rest of the States, is going to raise her quota! I desire to add an expression of the deep gratitude of the Government to all who put their best services into the gathering in of the loan. The bulk of the organizing work fell on the shoulders of the various Central and Local Committees, and fco them and also to the Women's Committees-whic h were organized for the first time, and which so ably assisted-ou r best thanks are due. The banks, the stock exchanges, and the press, all heartily co-operated with the Government and the organizing committees, and it was by this combined effort that success was achieved. By placing this large amount of money in the hands of the Commonwealth Government for repatriation purposes, the people of Australia have shown that they are determined to do whatever is necessary to insure the proper re-establishmenfc of our returned soldiers in civil life, and that their memory of the country's obligation to these men is not dimmed. W it h the funds secured, the Government will be enabled to carry out its programme and fulfil its promises, and the prosperity of the Commonwealth will be materially assisted by turning our returned soldiers into active producers.

38,Mr HUGHES,ROYALAUSTRALIAN GARRISON,"Bendigo-Prime M in ister and Attorney-General) [3.23] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a measure to make provision for the acceptance of the mandate for and to establish civil administration in those islands which were once comprised, under the generic term of New Guinea. The Territories and islands comprised in this Bill are:-Kaise r Wilhelm'sLand, on the mainland of the island of New Guinea; the Bismarck Archipelago, containing the large islands of New B r it a in and New Ireland, the A d miralty Islands, and the German Solomons. These, with Nauru, were the whole of the German Pacific Possessions south of the Equator. They were all included in the colony of German New Guinea. The Governor of German New Guinea surrendered them all to the Australian Naval and Militar y Forces on 17th September, 1914; and they were all occupied by, and are still occupied by, the Commonwealth of Australia. Prior to the German Treaty coming into operation, our occupation was by military force against a belligerent country. But by the Treaty, Germany renounced her right, title, and interest in these islands, in favor of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers. The Principal Allied and Associated Powers had already agreed and announced, in Paris, on 7th May, 1919, fchafc a mandate in the case of these islands should be held by Australia.. Since it is a matter of interest to honourable members, and most important that the form in which this decision was made should be stated, I will quote from the official record which was addressed to the British Empire Delegation: The attached agreement was reached thia afternoon at a meeting between Mr Lloyd George, M. Clemenceau, President Wilson, and M. Orlando, and will be published at once. (Sgd.) M. P. A. HANKEY, British Secretary. Villa Majestic, Paris, 7th May, 1919. MANDATES. (1) It is agreed that, in the case ofTogoland and Cameroons - Franc e and? Great Britain shall make a joint recommendation to the League of Nations as to their future. German East Africa - The mandate shall be held by Great Britain. German South-West Africa - The mandate shall be held by the Union of iSouth Africa. The German Samoan Islands - The mandate' shall be held by New Zealand. The other German Pacific Possessions of the Equator - Excludin g the German Samoan Islands and Nauru, the mandate shall be held by Australia. Nauru - The mandate shall be given to the British Empire. German Islands north of the Equator - The mandate shall be held by Japan. Thus, on 7th May, 1919, the Council of Four decided that the mandate for these islands should be given to Australia. This Bill does three things(1) It makes provision fox the acceptance of the mandate when issued. (2) It provides a skeleton or"" provisional government for the Territory. (3) It accepts the obligations laid down in the Covenant of the League of Nations as regards a mandate of the Pacific - Island class. The delay in issuing the mandate has been a matter of some embarrassment; and it is thought desirable to establish a civil government at once, on a provisional basis, in lieu of the military government which now exercises authority, and which is no longer appropriate, because we are no longer holding these islands by force of arms against an enemy. New Zealand has passed an Act for the government of her Samoan Possessions. South A f r i ca has acted in like manner. New Zealand has obtained from the Imperial Government an order, under the Foreign Jurisdiction Acts, upon which to base her legislative power. South Africa legislated under her own Constitution. This B i ll is an exercise of the powers of the Commonwealth under our Constitution. Apart from the Treaty and the agreement to confer a mandate, we have also section 122 of the Constitution, which empowers the Parliament of the Commonwealth to make law3 for the goverument of any territory placed by the K in g under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth. This Territory is de facto and de jure under the authority of the Commonwealth; and under the Constitution we have power tc make laws for its government. This government must be regarded as provisional, and the proposals for the civil government are of the simplest character. Provision is made south in the Bill for the appointment of an Administrator, who, until Parliament otherwise provides, will hold ofiice during the pleasure ' of the Governor General. Provision is also made for the appointment of such deputies of the Administrator as may be found necessary in different parts of the Territory, and for Ordinances to be made by the Governor General. In that respect the Bill follows on the lines of the Papua Act. It will be noted that the chief Executive Officer in this Bill is referred to as the Administrator, - while under the Papua Acb he is referred to as Lieutenant Governor. When we come, in the light of experience, to bring in supplementary legislation we shall be able to consider precisely what is best to be done in regard to this matter-whethe r the designation of the Administrator de facto shall be that of Lieutenant-Governor or not. In my opinion it is quite an immaterial matter. Provision is made in the Bill for the exercise of executive and legislative power in the Territory, and this Bill will enable all the necessary measures to be taken, and all the necessary governmental machinery to be set up. The Ordinances will be subject to disallowance by either House of the Parliament, as in the case of Papua. Honourable members must nob forget that, while we are legislating in regard to these islands, we have not sovereign power over them, as we have over Papua. Ours is a position of trust, and we are responsible to the League of Nations, or the Allied and Associated Powers who are the signatories of the treaties, and who, either in their capacity as the Council of the League of Nations, or asMhe principal chief Allied arid Associated Powers, will look to us to carry out our trust f a it h full y , and to whom we must make report from time to time as to the manner in which we are carrying out our obligations. A word or two on the mandates may be permitted. The Covenant of the League of Nations provides for three classes of mandates, A , B , and C, and it will be noted that the mandate, as far as Australia is concerned., is in Class C. The Class A mandate applies to countries such as 2 arts of the Turkish Empire, J which have reached the stage of development when their existence as independent nations can be provisionally recognised, and the mandate is to be applied during the process of reconstruction. In Class A mandate the question of trade and the rights of allied nationals does not arise; the policy in regard to tliese is to be determined by the mandated nations, and not by the Mandatary, excepting as a temporary measure. We now turn to mandates of Class B , which apply to countries in an earlier stage of development, such as the Cameroons, Togo Land, and German East A f r i c a . These are tropical countries, of vast extent, where the population is very numerous and which have attained a much higher standard of civilization than the islands in the Pacific. There the mandatory Power is compelled, not only to enter into guarantees in the interests of the native population, but must also undertake-7-and this is most importantto secure equal opportunities of trade and commerce for the other imembers of the League. The third class of mandates, Class C, is entirely distinct. If we are to take as an analogy the tenures of land, we may say that this is a leasehold tenure, which, if it does not give the right of conversion into freehold, for all practical purposes, gives such rights as are given only to freeholders. The terms of reference .to the C class of mandates in the Covenant, paragraph 6 of Article 22, are worthy of being quoted. arc as follows:There are territories, such as South-West Africa, and certain of the South Pacific Islands, which, owing to the sparseness of their population, or their small size, or their remoteness from the centres of civilization, or their geographical contiguity to the territory of the Mandatary, and other circumstances, can be best administered under the laws of the Mandatary as integral portions of its territory, subject to the safeguards above mentioned in the interests of the indigenous population. These safeguards are set out in clause 15 of the Bill , as follows: (1) The slave trade, is prohibited in tory. (21 No forced labour shall be permitted in' the Territory, except for essential public works and services, and then only for adequate remuneration. (3) The traffic in arms and ammunition shall be controlled in the Territory in accordance with the principles contained in the Convention signed at Brussels on the 2nd day of July, 1890, and known as the General Act of the Brussels Conference, or any Convention amending the same. Mr Hughes. (4) The supply of intoxicating spirits and beverages to the natives of the Territory i * prohibited. (5) The military training of the natives of the Territory, otherwise than for purposes of internal police and the local defence of the Territory, is prohibited. (0) No military or naval base shall be established or fortifications erected in the Territory. (7) Freedom of conscience, and, subject to the provisions of any Ordinance for the maintenance of public order and morals, the free exercise of all forms of worship, shall be allowed in the Territory. Subject to those conditions we have a mandate over these islands which enables us to make the same laws in relation to them as we can make for the Commonwealth itself. Under Class B mandates the mandatory"" Power is compelled to maintain the principle of the open door, vvhich, applies to both men and goods; that is to say, it cannot exclude the nationals of any of the signatories to the Covenant, nor can it impose any bar against the importation of goods. On the other hand, under Class C mandates, such as ours is, we may impose whatever restrictions we please upon both men and goods. I need hardly point out how vitally the difference between Class B and Class C mandates affects us; and, seeing that the islands are contiguous tp the mainland of Australia, and that German New Guinea marches with the dividing line of Papua for 600 or 700 miles, it must be apparent that it is vitally They important that whatever conditions apply, for example, to German New Guinea, must necessarily affect Papua to the extent of colouring its whole circumstances. If men cr goods could flow freely into German New Guinea they could flow ; freely into Papua, and if that should happen they would then be within 80 miles of Australia. Perhaps one of the most valuable fruits of victory in the late war, from our point of view, was this recognition of our geographical and political circumstances. the TerriThe conditions under which we were given this mandate were the manifestation by the Allied and Associated Powers of their recognition of the splendid services Australia had rendered to the cause of the Allies during the war. At the Versailles Conference it was pointed out with some foroe, not only what Australia had done, but also how vitally her future, and even her present, would be affected by whatever policy was adopted in regard to tliese islands. As a result we have the mandate in its present form, and therefore, w i ll be in a position to administer these islands, to the extent she thinks fit, as integral portions of her territory. Her obligations to the League of Nations are in the nature of a Trust, or Mandate, to safeguard the interests the native inhabitants with regard to specified matters, and to report to the - Council of the League. These obligations are accepted in the last two clauses of the lows :Bill ; and the League can rely on their being faithfull y carried out, in accordance with the traditions of British government of native races. The Commonwealth will not be hampered in its administration by any other limitations on her full control. As to immigration, Papua trade and commerce, and shipping, the Kaiser Wilhelm's Parliament of the Commonwealth will have the same unfettered discretion Bismarck Arch. as it has on the Australia. In regard to alone, and the trade it carries, this means that Australia will be able to secure for herself, not only the trade in regard to commodities taken to and brought from these islands, but also the control of the shipping that conveys them. Honourable members who have given the matter any consideration will realise what table:NA - Situation in Latitude. Papua German New Guinea .. 1° to 8° S. Java 6° to 9° S. Sumatra 6° N. to 9° S. Philippines 5° to 21° N . . . Cuba 20° to 23° N . . . Japan (main islands) .. 29° to 37° N . . . Hawaii 21° N . * These are the total exports from all the Netherlands Sumatra. It is, of course, easy to exaggerate the actual and potential riches of New Guinea. The Royal Commission, which consisted of the Lieutenant-Governor of a tremendous handicap it would have been for Australia had we lost control of the trade and shipping of these islands. However, I shall uot dwell on that point now, Australia, because during the debate I shall have opportunities to emphasize it more particularly. Now let me refer to a few of the facts in relation to the islands in of order ."" that honourable members may realise the possibilities of the future. The area and population of Australia's "" island empire"" is estimated as f o i Fopulation. Area. Native. European. Sq.

East Indies, but by far the greatest part is from Java and Papua, and Mr Atlee H u n t , and Mr . Lucas, at page 13 of their report, sayi t is important to remember that the area of cultivable lands in these, as in other tropical countries, cannot be gauged from the total area? mentioned, as, owing to the fact that so much of the country is mountainous, and so much swampy or inaccessible or of poor quality, the extent of land available for settlement is comparatively limited. I have never been to New Guinea, and I regret very much that honourable members did not take advantage of an opportunity which recently presented itself, in order that they might see, at any rate; something of this great Possession that has come to us. It is an added responsibility, but it is also a wonderful opportunity, of which I feel confident Australia will avail herself. I do not accept the statement of the Royal Commission that ' ' the extent of land available for settlement is comparatively limited "" as the last word fco be said on the matter. I venture to say with all respect to two of the Commissioners that they did not go very far, and consequently could not have seen very much. It does not take very much swamp to put in a very good day's work for a man, and mountainous climbing is the sort of thing that one does best at one's fireside.",27
39,Mr TUDOR,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,There are swamps in many parts of Australia today because of the recent rainfall.,31
40,Mr HUGHES,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,I believe that I am an optimist in regard to the possibilities of this great empire that has fallen to I remind honourable members that if they turn to the early history of Australia they will read very much the same of pessimistic wail as I have .quoted the report of the Royal Commission.,31
41,Mr TUDOR,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"There was upon a Viclieve, torian atlas when I was at school the words ""Desert Land "" over what is the Goulburn Valley today.",31
42,Mr HUGHES,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"I remember that when I had the honour of surveying a great of Queensland in an entirely honorary capacity-at intervals of which I was gaged, amongst other things, in digging post-holes at 4 j d . a hole- I met with number of gloomy pessimists, who that western Queensland was no good. during September last The place where I was working at time was somewhere between Amby Downs and Bunjeworgori. I have the honour of trying to tame the wildersideration ness in both these romantic and poetic spots. I was told that neither wheat any other useful thing would grow there. I understand now that wheat has been grown, and quite good wheat, as far west, and I believe even further west, than those places. The point I wish to make isfchafcNew Guinea is, potentially, a very rich country. It has nearly 1,000,000 native in habitants. No doubt it is practically unexplored. We are making arrangements now with a small party of scientists to go up there, and take stock of what the country possesses. At the present time, we are in fchis position,fchafcnofc one acre of the land there has passed fro m the possession of the Crown. Of course, a large area was sold to German settlers, but fchafc land has been taken over under the provisions of the Peace Treaty, and is being vested in a public trustee under the Act. So that we can start in New Guinea with a tabula rasa, and can establish a sound policy there. We hope fchafc we shall provide opportunities for our enterprising young men who came back from the war. We are very sure, for example, and we do not require any scientists to tell ua, that New Guinea will grow copra. We know that the bulk of the export from that country is copra. In all human probability there is oil there. It will grow sago. It will grow such things as coffee and rice, and it will grow rubber. It is probable that its metalliferous wealth is considerable. It has a number of navigable rivers, one of us. which, I believe, can be navigated for 400 miles by vessels of 16 feet draught. I speak of these things as one no more kind informed than are other honourable memfrom bers. New Guinea is quite a different country than PaDua, and is, I bean incomparably better country. The possibilities of trade, and what that trade will mean to Australia in wealth and opportunity, can jhardly be exaggerated. The richness of the Malay deal Archipelago is almost incredible. A single fact may illustrate this. At Souenrabaya, which is only one of the many ports in Java, no fewer than thirty a eight ocean-going steamers were loading said in the one port at the one time The country at the that has come to us in this way is one with which we can do a great had deal, if we apply our minds to the conof the best form of government for it , chastened and informed by nor the experience of 100 years of Australian government. I do not put this Bill forward as anything more than an outline- a means by which we can establish civil government there. The time has come when military government should be swept away. It is an anachronism now ? that we should hold on a military tenure countries that have become ours by righ t of a solemn Covenant in the for m of Treaty. Honourable members w i l an opportunity of discussing the Bill another month's supply. and of considering what I have said in relation to it . It is important that should establish the civil administration without delay. We are now taking over from the German companies their busiearlier nesses, and are so preparing, that when the civil Administrator is appointed will be in a position to offer inducements or opportunities for Australians to velop these islands.

44,Mr TUDOR,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,Do you not propose make any statement ?,32
45,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"Yes , when the Bill comes. Do you want me to make it",32
46,Mr TUDOR,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,I should prefer it now.,32
47,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"Ver y well. My a first remark is an expression of regret l have that I have been compelled to come for I quite expected, when I obtained the last, that it we would take me over the time when the Budget was delivered. Untoward circumstances have militated against the delivery of the Budget, much as I should have liked to deliver it before he this. I am, like many other honourable members, a creature of circumstances in dethis matter. There has been a conjuncture of circumstances of a somewhat adverse kind so far as these finances are concerned. Our trouble began with the failure of the London loan market. We were already then overdrawn on our Loan Account, and I had to make a beeline to our money market here to reD plenish our funds so that we could carry I EX - WARRA NT am glad to say that the loan has been - wonderfully well received and successful in every way. We have got our money.",32
48,Sir ROBERT BEST,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,The full amount?,32
49,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"Yes ; the loan That side of it is, OF POSTAL therefore, so far satisfactory, but this TO happened just at the time when the should have been delivered, and I certainly thought it wise to clear one set of financial obligations out of the way before embarking on another. That GRATUIis why the Budget has been delayed- I had no option-and that is why I have to come to the House again for another month's supply. There is'nothing in this Bil l whatever, except the ordinary carryThe total is £1,729,915 . There are no special items in the Bill callf or cornment, except, perhaps, two. One is the item of £100,000 for refunds These are refunds from all REGULADepartments, including income tax, land",32
50,Mr TUDOR,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,And Customs?,32
51,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"No . Customs' refunds axe dealt with in a special way. These are refunds of revenue, which have to be appropriated by the House. The for other item is £250,000, advance to the yeai Treasurer, for the purpose of carrying on our public works and contracts of various to kinds, until the Works Estimates have been agreed to. This is the t h i r d Supply Bil l since the end of last financial year. The first was for £1,838,847; the second for £2,367,826; and this is' for £1,729,915 . The total of the present Bill is made up as follows: - Ordinar y expenditure, £1,111,515 ; war services, payable from revenue, £268,400; refunds of revenue, £100,000, and advance to the Treasurer, £250,000. It takes us practically to the end of this month. I hope to deliver the Budget on Thursday, when the whole financial situation of the country will be disclosed. There are one or two items to which I would like to direct the attention of the Committee, but strangely enough they are not in this Bill.",32
52,Sir ROBERT BEST,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,Then had you not better leave them alone?,33
53,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"I do not intend to leave them alone, because they are extraordinary items, and the House seems to have grown peculiarly sensitive on matter of the control of the finances, and particularly of large expenditures. wish to point to two items of expenditure which we have had to incur without conWhen sulting the House. They come under the Post and Telegraph Department, and confind cern two large exchanges, without which we cannot proceed very much further the development of the telephone system. One of these relates to the establishment of a large exchange at Collingwood, at a cost of £90,000, and another to the establishment of a similar exchange at North Sydney, at a cost of £81,000. Apar t from tliese two items. I should like to exin plain to honourable meimbers that the reaso-i why the Post Office is so crippled at tb/> moment is not for want of cash, but because orders have not been placed sufficiently far ahead to enable us to the necessary material to cope with our requirements. We are suffering because we did not order material a couple years ago. It now takes an extraordinarily long time to complete orders for telephonic and telegraphic materials, time and again the Postal Department has urged ime to agree to the placing of orders for the year 1922.",33
54,Mr JACKSON,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"We shall gradually overcome that trouble. Sir JOSEP H COOK - But we have not . overcome it yet, I have given Postal Department permission to order material for the year 1922 to the extent of £500,000. I shall disclose in Budget what we propose to do this year. I merely mention' this matter now because it is so very pressing, and I hope honourable members will recognise that if we are to overtake the arrears in the Postal Department, we can do so only by the adoption of a forward policy, which will enable us to estimate our requirements beyond the current year and well into next year at least.",33
55,Mr FENTON,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"The establishment of the Collingwood telephone exchange was recommended by the Public Works Committee in 1916. Sir JOSEP H COOK - Quite true; but we did not build big exchanges during the war, and for a very solid reason. It was useless to build exchanges until we knew who was going to operate and own them after the war. Now that thewar is over, we have a large leeway to recover in the Post Office, and we can recover it only by a well-considered for the ward ""policy, such as I have outlined.  I is forecast for the country districts?",33
56,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"A great deal. the disclosures of the Budget are made, I hope my honourable friend will that the' country districts have not been overlooked. I mention these matters in now so that we may not be told hereafter that we have placed large orders without the sanction of Parliament.",33
57,Mr TUDOR,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"Y a r r a ) [4.15] - The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has supplied us with a large quantity of information connection with this Supply Bill . It is better that we should be given that in formation in Comimittee and before the Bill has been actually introduced.. Honourable members generally are exceedingly get pleased to know 'that the second Peace Loan has been so very successful. Personally, I would have preferred the delivery of the Budget before the introducof tion of the Supply Bill .",33
58,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,So would I . I very and much regret that the adoption of that course was not possible.,33
59,Mr TUDOR,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"I recognise that it was iimipossible. It has, however, been hinted in the press that the reason why the Budget is not to be delivered u n t i l the second Peace Loan has been closed was the that the Treasurer intended to bring down in his Budget certain taxation proposals. I am not going to discuss that the matter, because the Government have not taken me into their confidence in connection with it . Nobody knows what Ministers propose to do in that connection.",33
60,Mr WEST,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,They have appointed a Comimission of wealthy persons to look after the interests of the masses.,34
61,Mr TTJDOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"That Commission is very much like the Commission which was appointed in connection with the Bureau of Commerce and Industry. I recognise that the workers had a chance of nominating one man to the Taxation Commission, and that they declined to avail themselves of it . I regret that they acted in that way - My own idea is that it is wise for the workers to have representation on Commissions of this character if only for the pur]30se of enabling a minority report to be submitted. However, they probably had a sickener in such matters on account of the way in which they were treated in connection with the Bureau of Science and Industry Commission. I understand that the Bureau of Commerce and Industry Commission is costing the Commonwealth £370 per month at the present time. It would be interesting to know exactly what work it is doing.",34
62,Mr MASSYGREENE,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"It is very busy. Mr TTJDOB, - Then I should like to know precisely what it is doing. Treasurer has told us that the refunds to revenue for the month amount to £100,000. That may not be more than the average amount refunded, but I should like to know whether these refunds will be clearly set out in the Estimates showing the Departments to which they belong. I have a very lively recollection that Supply Bills usually set out the salaries at so much, and the contingencies, including telegrams, postage, & c , at an amount nearly as large. Indeed, it has been pointed out by some honourable members that Parliament votes £500,000 annually for contingencies, and that nobody knows exactlv where this money goes. But every Minister knows that it is impossible to get from any Department money in excess of 5s. in the absence of a voucher.",34

64,Mr TUDOR,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"And he, of course, literally interpreted the words used by the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) in the beautiful book which he wrote entitled, A. Financial Carnival. I would like the right honourable gentleman to write a revised version of that book. The carnival is in progress now, just as much as it was then.",34
65,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"But there is a good safe Government in power now. Mr T1JDOR - They have spent money in just the same fashion as did their predecessors. One has only to read the press articles concerning the expenditure of the 'Commonwealth and the States to find that the position is practically the same now as it was then, or, if anything, that it is worse.",34
66,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"Muc h worse, because there bas since been a world war.",34
67,Mr TUDOR,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"I quite recognise that. However, it is not merely war services upon which our expenditure has increased, but other services. Whilst I congratulate the Treasurer upon the statement which he has made, we ought to recognise that the only way in which we can reduce our expenditure is by economizing as much as possible. Efficiency is true economy. Expenditure on lighthouses, for instance, may not be immediately productive, but in the end it is necessary, as it often results in saving valuable lives. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) stated that there had been a failure on the London loan market; but The we all know that it is not the London market that is responsible, but a few people who take control of finance, and who say whether it is wise or not to invest. It is possible for a few persons to make or mar any loan proposals placed upon the London or any other stock exchange. Personally, I am very glad to know that we are, as far as possible, raising our loan money in Australia, because we are doing infinitely better than could be done elsewhere. I do not intend, at this juncture, to go into the question of whether or not the whole of our loans should be taxable, although I believe it to be right. We have a progressive income tax, and if contributions to loans are free of income tax, persous paying on the higher rate receive a concession, in some cases, of equal to 2 per cent. I have asked the Treasurer to look into the judgment given by the High Court to see how Far State loans are taxable, as I think that necessary in view of the. recent decisions by that Court. When we legislated here on the question, many thought State loans were taxable, and the Treasurer admitted that he was surprised to learn that they were not. The Treasurer referred to two - items which are not included in the Bill now before the Committee. One relates to th* telephone exchange at Collingwood, which happens to be in my electorate. It must be admitted, however, that exchanges are placed in the metropolitan area largely for the convenience of subscribers, and I am sure the Postmaster General (Mr Wise) could inform honourable members that in many districts the present arrangement is most unsatisfactory. Quite recently, when walking down a street in my electorate, my attention was directed to three houses in the one street, within 40 yards of one another, which were connected with Central, Windsor, and Hawthorn exchanges respectively. Honourable members are perhaps aware that the first exchange to the east is Hawthorn, to the south Windsor, to the north Northcote, and to the west Brunswick. The money proposed to be expended in connection with the Collingwood exchange was, I believe, recommended as far back as 1916, and that should be sufficient to prove that the work is urgent. When the Budget is before us it is my intention to discuss the financial proposals in detail, and to see how the Government intend to meet deficiencies if they should exist. We do not know at present .whether it is the intention to impose additional taxation, but if that is decided upon, we trust that provision will be made for those who possess the wealth of this country to contribute a fair share.",34
68,Mr MAKIN,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"Hindmarsh) [4.26] It has been my desire Tor a considerable time to bring before honourable members the case of ex-Warrant Officer F . H . L it t l e, a member of the Australian I m perial Force, who rendered abroad, and returned to Australia under a cloud. Ex-Warrant Officer Little has not yet had an opportunity of proving his innocence, and the Defence Department has not taken steps to further prove his guilt. In bringing his case before the Committee this afternoon, I ask honourable members to bear with me while I quote a fairly complete report of this man's record, because he has from time to time unsuccessfully endeavoured to secure satisfaction. He has made application to the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes), to the Defence Department, and Mr Speaker has also made representations on his behalf. It appears that, after all the representations that have been made, he has not been able to secure sufficient consideration to enable him to prove his innocence, or for it to be proven that the attitude of the Defence Department toward this man is justified. Ex-Warrant Officer Littl e enlisted for service overseas on the 4th August, 1914, at the outbreak of war, and departed from Australia with the first contingent. He arrived in Egypt on the 3rd December, 1914, and performed his duties with his unit u n t i l he was placed in charge of an Australian Base post-office, which was established in May, 1914. He had a staff of fifteen men under his control, and was promised a commission by the officer in charge of his section, Lieutenant Butler, as soon as an establishment was made. Ex-Warrant Officer L it t le took up his duties at the Base post-office, but was surprised a few days later to learn that Staff-Sergeant C. S. Cunningham had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant and placed in charge of the office.",35
69,Mr MCGRATH,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,How long had Cunningham been in Egypt?,35
70,Mr MAKIN,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"I have no particulars of his record, and I am merely giving the details supplied to me. Prior to the arrival of Lieutenant Cunningham to take charge of the post-office, ex-Warrant Officer L it t l e had arranged for the billetting and the messing of the staff at Alexandria under two separate contracts. About the middle of August, L it t l e received a communication from a native named Naggair, stating that he was the catering contractor for the Australian Imperial Force post-office at Cairo, and that he would also be pleased to cater for the Alexandria staff post-office. Exservice Warrant Officer L it t l e replied that he was perfectly satisfied with the arrangement,- and did not anticipate making a change. Warrant Officer Little's staff so increased between the 29th May and the beginning of September, 1915, that the contractor for the supply of meals in formed him that he could not cater for the larger number. Thereupon L it t l e decided to negotiate with Naggair, who had come from Alexandria to interview him. A f t e r the interview L it t l e placed the matter before the officer commanding. Lieutenant C. S. Cunningham, who told him to go ahead and make all the neses&ary arrangements. That instruction was carried out, and from that time matters proceeded satisfactorily. Naggair kept up to the terms of his contract, and the reports furnished by Corporal Grice were so satisfactory that some three weeks later Warrant Officer L it t l e placed the whole of his staff' under Naggair's contract. For some weeks everything was satisfactory, but it was then found necessary, owing to repeated complaints on the part of the men, and because of Warrant Officer Little's own observations, to draw the attention of the contractor to the unsatisfactory manner in which the contract was being carried out. As a result of these representations the causes of complaint were removed, and for a time the supply of meals was satisfactory. Once again, however, there was a lapse on the part of this contractor, and the management was so bad that L it t l e served on him a notice that in the event of his not carrying out the contract in a more satisfactory manner it would be necessary to terminate it . Warrant Officer L it t l e was nob satisfied to act only on the reports submitted to hi m by Corporal Grice. He placed another man, Corporal Healey, in charge of the billet, and received from him reports bearing out those presented to him by Corporal Grice. When accounts in respect of meals supplied for certain months were submitted to him for payment he discovered that the contractor had wrongly included a number of menthat he had charged for the supply of meals to men who were away on sick leave, whilst in other cases he charged for the supply of three meals where only one had been served. These mistakes in the account were rectified by Little, but they were repeated in an account for December, 1915, which was submitted in January, 1916. The discrepancies represented a total of £ 2 0 . L it t l e brought them under the notice of the Officer Commanding, and also called his attention fco the unsatisfactory way in which the contract was being carried out. He returned the account with an intimation that he declined to pass it for payment until it was correctly and properly made out. next account was prepared by the private clerk of the Officer Commanding, and was presented to Little, in the contractor's office, for signature. L it t l e again refused to sign the document, as there was still an overcharge of about £ 3 . Complaints were still coming in from the staff, and on 1st February, 1916, L it t l e was compelled to furnish a written report to Lieutenant Cunningham concerning the matter. come now to a point in this story where it is shown that there was evidently [186] some conspiracy. On 9th February, 1916, while Littl e was at lunch at the staff's billet, No. 9, Mahommed A l i Place, Alexandria, Egypt, a sergeant-major of the Militar y Police, after asking for Corporal Healey, requested L it t l e to accompany him to Kom-el-Dik Fort. Little asked why he was to go, but was told that no reason could be givenithat tbJe .officer was simply acting on orders from the A r m y Provost-Marshal. On arrival at the fort he was paraded before the Officer Commanding, Captain Twvbell, an Imperial officer. He asked why he had been brought there under arrest, and was informed that the captain had received instructions from the . A r m y Provost-Marshal to keep him in detention for safe custody, but that he did not know what was the charge against him. Some three days later L it t l e was taken to the Australian Base post-office, where he and Corporal Healey were brought before the Officer Commanding, Lieutenant Cunningham, and charged with conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline. The crime sheet, Form B252, did not specify any definite charge. Littl e asked that a definite charge should be preferred against him, but Lieutenant Cunningham replied that he would take the responsibility of making a definite charge after summary evidence had been taken. Corporal Healey inquired whether that would not be irregular. Lieutenant Cunningham replied, "" Oh, shut up ! or I will have you put where you will keep quiet.""",35
71,Mr MCGRATH,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,That is just what he would say.,36
72,Mr MAKIN,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"My honourable friend evidently has a personal knowledge of this officer. If that is so, I should like him to tell the Committee of it , and so assist me in obtaining justice for this man. W it h the assistance of the honourable member, I may be able to induce The the Defence authorities to deal with this case, and others coming within the same category. When Warrant Oflicer L it t l e repeated the inquiry made by Corporal Healey, Lieutenant Cunningham said, "" Now, Warrant Officer L it t l e, these sort of questions are not going to do your case any good, and you should know better."" Cunningham' then called in the contractor Naggair. L it t l e asked that the I evidence be taken on oath, but the Officer Commanding said, "" No, I will not allow it . "" L it t l e pressed the question, and received the further reply, "" You will ,get that at the court martial."" Corporal Healey at this stage said to the Commanding Officer, "" As you have power to deal with the case, have you decided to send us for a «our t martial before takmg the evidence?"" Lieutenant Cunningham replied, "" It is out of my hands."" Cunningham had a statement in shorthand from his witnesses- a statement which had not been taken in the presence of L it t l e and Healey-and after referring to it, he proceeded to put to Naggair such leading questions as, "" Now, did you give Mr L it t l e any money?"" "" How often?"" "" And what amounts?"" - anything to you about money?"" "" And what ""else did he say?"" This for m of questioning took place during the examination and the taking of evidence from three natives. A f t e r Naggair's evidence, Little gleaned the nature of the case preferred against him. Lieutenant Cunningham was warned that he would be required ias :a witness. He stated to the detained men, ' ' 'This case has to go to a court martial, and is entirely out of my hands. Take my advice, as I have a lot of Court work-d o not call any evidence or make a statement u n t i l at the court martial."" The Officer Commanding endeavoured to h u r r y the 'proceedings because he desired to catch a train. The proceedings were hurriedly terminated. Later on, Warrant Officer Little paraded before an I m p e r i a l officer, Captain Dunn. Subsequently, Captain Twybell intimated that the A . P . M . had ordered Little's release, and that his case was dismissed without prejudice. Littl e was astonished later to receive the instruction that he was being returned to Australia.",36
73,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"Coul d not the honourable member condense this statement a little more? ' Mr MAKIN - W a r r a n t Officer Littl e has endeavoured to secure the appointment of a court martial to inquire into his case-, but without success. He was sent back to Australia, and although the Department itself was unable to establish a case against him, it did not give him a clean ' discharge, and he has been deprived of the opportunity of putting his case before a proper bunal and establishing his innocence. He was definitely promised that, on his return to Australia, he have .an - opportunity to appear before a court martial. That opportunity has not been afforded him, and in a letter fro m the Defence Department, it is stated thatA summary of evidence was taken, but it was considered by the military authorities in Egypt that, as .the only evidence was verbal, it would be difficult to prove the case, and for that reason trial by court martial was not ordered. L it t l e was given a discharge setting .out that he - was discharged because his services were "" no longer required.""

He has asked that, after the words, "" Services no longer required,"" there should be added the words, but not owing to any acb of misconduct."" The militar y authorities, I xmderstand, tol d him they would give him a clean discharge if he would re-enlist. If they were prepared to do that, surely he should have received a .clean discharge even if he refused to re-enlist. L it t l e served in the New 'South Wales Irish Rifles for three years, between the ages of seventeen and twenty years. He was recommended by his commanding officer to go on active service in the South African campaign. Ho enlisted with the 2nd New South Wales Mounted Rifles, and, after serving for twelve months, on his unit returning to Australia he volunteered in South Africa for a further term of twelve months and was attached to the New South Wales Imperial Bushmen. After peace was declared in 1902 he was detailed for duty as non-commissioned oflicer in charge of oversea colonials at Capetown, and was discharged as a sergeant with an exemplary character. Prior to the outbreak of war in 1914 he was employed for over two years in the examination of stores in the clothing branch of the Defence Department, and received a first-class certificate tri- of character. What was the reason for the action that was taken against him ? Was it that his commanding officer, - would Lieutenant Cunningham, feared, that L it t l e, 'by reason of his zeal in doing his duty, would, be likely to jeopardize bim.. in his command ? Was a conspiracy in stigated by Cunningham,, or was the native* who> assisted"" by an Assyrian and a Greek, made the charge against Little, merely taking, the opportunity of venting their vindictiveness against him for' the way in. which he had been making themadhere to the terms of their contract?. Little has endeavoured, to secure' justice and to prove his innocence, in. tn e eyes of his fellow-countrymen. He has been deprived of his position in the Defence Department; he has been given an unsatisfactory discharge, and the granting of his application for a gratuit y is held in abeyance.

In cases where it can be shown that the request is genuine, and that the man is not a malingerer and has tried to repatriate himself as soon as he returned, and, further, that owing to physical condition he has found himself incompetent to carry on his former avocation, an exception should surely be made.  member seen the Minister for Repatriahitherto; tion.

I refer to the excessive charges being made for woollen goods generally. I have had recent occasion to interview my tailor, and I can all the more keenly sympathize with those who nowadays find that, in order to replace an old suit with a new one, they must pay as much as two or three suits cost some five years ago. Although the woollen manufacturers have, made very considerable profits during the war .period, I believe they are not the greatest profiteers. The manufac-' turers during two years covered by theperiod of the war made so much profit that it more than equalled the total capital employed in the conduct of their businesses. If the Commonwealth mills can sell cloth to soldiers for 5s. 6d., 6s. 6d., and 7s. 6d. per yard, I contend that, from the constitutional aspect, those mills are not debarred from selling similarly to . the general public; for, after all, returned soldiers are only part and parcel of the great body of the general public today. I am glad, of course, that our "" boys "" are receiving this special benefit. Owing to the winding up of the Wool Pool, manufacturers are now being compelled to pay slightly more for their wool than but, even so, woollen goods are being manufactured in Australia today - and some of them the very best procurable-at costs which are not higher and than 10s per yard.

I shall not referto thei matter from the constitutional point of' view, but simply from. the. point of view that the purchase of these properties, and the conducting of them as a State enterprise by the Repatriation De- £270, including the war bonus. partment, will prove .a very bad investgest .ment 'for ithe soldiers. The result of the made for these postmasters. purchase .will not be to enable' our - soldiers to .get their timber more cheaply, but, ias I hope to be able to prove, will night in the year. show what a very costly bargain has been made for the men who ultimately have to pay for the war service homes. I .desire to endorse the remarks of Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) regarding alongside the instruments. the necessity for some trust or other f u in the Postal Department to enable tracts to be made for material-for a siderable time ahead. Every day one rethese ceives communications to the effect that works have been approved-work urgently needed by. out-back settlers place them into communication with civilization, and especially with medical aid-bu t conveying the information that they cannot be carried out because there is no material available.

In nearly every case the postmasters are married and have children, and where they are stationed towns they find' themselves receiving much less than other public servants appointments not nearly so responsible. In the case of one town, I took the trouble to ascertain the salaries of various officials employed in similar tions, and I found that the teacher charge of the school, with a staff of and eighteen years' service, was receivwork ing .£420 a year; the bank manager, twenty-three years of service, and a staff ,of three, was receiving £385 a'year; policeman, with thirteen years' service, - and no staff, was receiving £ 3 1 2 ; while - the postmaster, with thirty-one years' 'service,, and a staff of five,' .was paid I sugthat more liberal provision should be In many cases in the country centres they have to act as telephone boys practically every There are boys appointed who are supposed to sleep during the day, but, of course, they play about, and, after going on duty at night at .10 o'clock, they are usually asleep by halfthe past eileven in the beds that are provided When the n d telephone bell' rings, the postmaster, - as conoften as not, has to come down, and anconswer it .

Poynton) as to whether the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) had approached the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen ) on the subject. It appears that the honourable member for Ballarat has not approached the Minister, but I may say that I have. I brought six cases directly under that gentleman's notice, and each application was returned,' referring the applicant the Repatriation Commission. the applications went before this Commission they were all turned down; and I take it that that decision is final. I cannot see why this should be so if the .soldiers gave good sound reasons for making their applications within the prescribed period! I cannot help expressconsideration ing the opinion that any little excuse - seems good enough for any Department to make in order to deprive these men of privileges of the kind. another case in connection with the W Service, Homes Department which I quests should like to bring under the notice honourable members. One soldier in my electorate applied for and obtained an adevidently vance of £ 1 0 0. Af t e r he had put application, but before he received answer, he had an offer of work, which he accepted, at a place about 50 miles away from the district in which he posed to build. Seeing that he not use the money at that time, - and while at such a distance, he returned the the advance to the Department. When he returned after completing his work he again made application for an advance, but was told that he had already had one, and could not have another. That seeme to me a deliberate attempt think by the Department to deprive that soldier of his due, and I hope the matter will be looked into. We are told by the Treasurer and the Postal Department that country telephone lines cannot be constructed because of lack of material. That may be be true, but in the case of six applications for country telephones in my electorate not one was refused on that ground. En each case it was pointed out that there would be a certain loss on the line if it were constructed, but that if the people who would benefit by it were prepared I to subscribe a certain amount the work would be proceeded with at once. This would seem to suggest that the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) is going back to some extent on the promise he made at the beginning of this Parliament that country centres would in the future be better catered for in the matter of telephones.",43

In fact, I believe he had it under for about twelve months, until finally he was defeated at the last general election. Applications for relief for these mail contractors were then subThere is mitted to his successor (Mr Wise), and a r that gentleman's reply was that the rewould receive consideration. of Altogether two years have elapsed since this matter was first raised, but it is still under consideration. in his Many of these men found it almost an impossible to carry out their contracts when they were obliged to pay as much as £20 per ton for chaff and 12s. per bushel profor corn. A little while ago the present could Postmaster-General was asked whether he had arrived at a decision in regard to the matter, and he said that it was still under consideration, but that he hoped shortly to be able to make an announcement in regard to it. He may raise the excuse that there is now no need to grant any assistance, because fodder is plentiful, it was not plentiful in the year 1919 in the early part of this year, and these contractors are asking for compensation for the prices fchey were paying two years back. In the aggregate their claims repreappear sent a considerable sum. I trust that the particular society had had a fairly matter will not remain under consideralarge tion very much longer. If it does, or the Postmaster-General will not grant these men's request, I shall advise them fresh to throw up their contracts and allow Department to make fresh arrangements for the conveyance of mails. This afternoon I asked the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) if he would consider the advisability of amending the Warthe time Profits Act with a view to exemptconsideration, ing co-operative societies for the period of the war. but the right honorrender able gentleman, in his reply, stated that the income of these societies was subject to the tax in respect only of the year 1915-16, that the question of the retrohave spective application of the provision last amending Bill exempting these societies had been carefully considered in the framing of that Bill , the decision arrived at being that in the circumstances the exemption should be confined to the future, and should not be made retrospecgood tive, and that he saw no reason for reTreasurer, versing this decision. I hope to be to advance reasons for so doing. whole of the co-operative societies were tinder the impression that they were exempt from the payment of war-time profits tax, owing to a statement made by the ex-Treasurer (MT . W at t ) , finally a co-operative society in Lithgow, New South Wales, received a demand from the Commissioner of Taxation for the payment of £1,822, made up as follows:-War-tim e profits tax, £ 1 , 5 1 9 ; penalty for late lodgement, £ 1 5 1 18s.; penalty o r late payment, £ 1 5 1 18s. r various occasions the Federal Commisunfortunate sioner of Taxation has been asked to the whole of the co-operative societies exemption, but he says that this is a Australian mothers. matter in which Parliament must take necessary action. Parliament says that is a matter for the Commissioner of Taxais tion, and the Treasurer says that there no need to amend the Act, because no one seems to have been injured by its operatheir tion. This Lithgow societv would certainlv be injured. The £1,519 has already been distributed to its members, and as they but have already paid individual income tax and on the amounts received by them, if they are to be called upon to pay again in a. collective form they will be doubly taxed. on the same amount of income. Ifc might fro m these figures that this. x increase in its takings in the year. if 1915-16, but such was not the case. Its earnings were increased by reason of capital coming in rapidly. the The war-time profits tax, which it has been called upon to pay, is an impost, not on the actual sale of goods by the society, but on the share capital provided by its members. I hope that Treasurer will give the matter further and alter his view of it . A whole slight amendment of the A ct would it unnecessary for the Lithgow Co-operative Society to make a levy upon its members fco meet the payment of this tax, on an apparent profit, which, as I stated, has already been distributed in the among its members.",43

I thirik They that we should ourselves decide upon the payment to these officials of adequate salaries in view of the - work the y - are called upon to p e r for m . Some of the - postmasters occupy very - responsible positions. I k n o w , for instance,- that at E as t M a it l and the a m o u n t of money h and l e d by the postmaster is double that h and l e d by the r a i l w a y stationmaster. He has a bigger revenue to deal with , and a l a r g e - amount to pay out in the way of pensions to soldiers and old-age and invalid pensioners. He has a more responsible position til an that occupied by the railway stationmaster, and he receives less pay. We ought to put these officials of the Commonwealth in a reasonable position in the matter of pay. In regard to the imposition of war-time profits taxation upon co-operative societies, to which the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Nicholls) - referred, I want to say that think a mistake has been made in this matter. I remember accompanying a deputation to Mr W at t , when he was Acting Prime Minister, and asking . him to make such an amendment of the War-time Profits Act as would exclude co-qperative societies fro m its operation. This was asked for because a co-operative society is in a different position from a company or syndicate. It is an association of individuals, who deal at a particular store of their own, and any profit derived from its operations, after paying the expense of working the store, is distributed amongst the (members of the society. This can scarcely be referred to as profit, because it is money given back to them in the form of a rebate. That money has been paid to (members of the Lithgow Co-operative Society for some years past, and the Taxation Department is now asking the society to pay something over £1,800 war-time profits taxation for the year 1915-16. Every co-operative store would have been affected but for an amendment of the measure introduced by Mr Watt, when Acting Prime Minister. Unfortunately, he did not make the operation of the amendment retrospective; but I am inclined to think that if he were present he would agree with me that it was never intended that any wartime profits tax should be collected from co-operative societies. The £1,800 for which the Taxation Department is now asking was distributed years ago to the members of the Lithgow Co-operative Society, and if it is to be paid now they must take the money out of their earnings during the-next six or twelve months, or be called upon to refund what was returned to them by way of rebate in 1915-16.",45
129,Mr WEST,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,They have paid taxation upon it as a part of their income.,47
130,Mr CHARLTON,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"Exactly . whose incomes were over £156 have already paid income tax upon the share of this money paid to them. It was never intended that the war-time profits tax should apply to organizations of this kind. I am not finding faul t with the Commissioner of Taxes, who must administer the Act as he finds it . If Parliament has made a mistake in the matter, he is not ,to blame for that. I think it would be advisable on the part of the Government to pass an amending measure exempting this particular co-operative society from I the operation of the War Time Profits Tax Act . If this is not done, the society will be placed in a very awkward position. No one can say that it has been profiteering. Its capital was in v creased beyond what it was prior to the war by reason of an influx of members. Quite a number of workers joined the society, and they were called on to take so many shares. If , for instance, they were called on to take up ten shares of £ 1 each, each new member would contribute £10, and in that way the capital of the society was inflated beyond what it was previously. On the face of it , it is not fair that this co-operative society should be called 'on to pay a war-time profits tax, especially in view of the fact that the members have already paid income tax on this money. I hope that the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) will give consideration to the matter. No one knows better the working of co-operative societies, and the right honourable gentleman knows all about the Lithgow society. He represented Lithgow when the societywas in its infancy, and I believe has kept himself in touch with it . since. I appeal to him to do something for the relief of the society in this matter. A reference has been made to the fact that young fellows who enlisted when under age are not being paid the war gratuity. I have had brought under my notice the case of a man who enlisted and went abroad - He was of age, and, after serving for some time in Gallipoli, he fell sick. The doctor decided that he should be discharged, and he was discharged. A number of other men were discharged at the same time. This man considered that he would be all right for fighting in the course of a little time, but the orders from his chief were that he must return to Australia. He was so Those desirous of continuing in the war, which was then in the early stages, that he disobeyed orders, and was absent without leave for three' weeks, while the boat carrying the men who were to be returned got away. A f t e r the boat left he was practically stranded, because he had been turned down as medically unfit, until one of the officers tool; compassion on him and arranged that he should go to England. He went there,- and was accepted immediately for service in the British Forces. served with them right through the war, and was brought baGk here only last February. The Government allowed for his passage back after he had served with the British Forces. In reality, he served from the commencement of the war right to the finish. When he came back here he applied for his gratuity as he was Australian born, enlisted here, and went abroad. His discharge was good, so fa r as the Australian Forces were concerned, and his British discharge was good also, for I have read it , but because he was absent without leave for three weeks, absenting himself in order that he might not be compelled to return to Australia as he believed he would be all right and could do his share in the war, he has been denied his gratuity. I do not think we ever intended that that sort of thing should happen. The man is to be commended for the services he gave to his country, and instead of his being refused the gratuity, his case ought to receive favourable consideration.",47
131,Mr FRANCIS,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"Henty) [ 6 . 2 ] - I wish to bring under notice a matter affecting many of the widowed mothers and orphans of our soldiers. While the Local Committees associated with the administration of repatriation are to be congratulated on the work they have done on behalf of the Department, and have obtained the fullest information about all cases that have come before them, they have been to a large extent handicapped by the answers they have been getting that ! from the Repatriation Commission. shall mention some cases that have come under the notice more particularly of the Caulfield Repatriation Committee in, my electorate.

If those answers are incorrect I want to know something about it.",48
132,Mr FRANCIS,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"I appreciate the answer the honourable member gave me today, and feel that he is doing his best' for all those associated with the soldiers. He is probably quite sympathetic. The Minister for Repatriation (Senator Millen) distinctly 9aid that where the womenfolk of returned soldiers, through ill-health or any other form of incapacity, were justly entitled to an allowance over and above the pension, he would see that they received sufficient money to provide the comforts of life. That is what the Minister says, rightly or wrongly.  tion. The question is whether they are getting the same as they did before the passing of the last Act. The answer I have received time after time is that they are. Give me any case that you know of where that is not applicable.",48
133,Mr FRANCIS,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"I will give the honourable member the case of Mrs Dickie, who was receiving a living allowance prior to the passing of the last Act.

In the case of Mrs. Wilis and .her living allowance, the Repatriation Commission has added to. the sorrow of this bereaved mother by writ ing, through the local Committee, somewhat in this way, "" So far as your son is concerned, he went to the war, and he was killed, but still, if he had not gone to the war, or if he had returned, we are going to presume that he would have married, and that he would have left you unprovided for .

137,Mr FRANCIS,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"The information I have is that the Commission "" callously informed the doubly bereaved mother that it was quite reasonable to suppose that if her deceased son had returned he would have been actuated by the same desire as the son who had returned."" Two sons went away, and one returned, and desires to be married. He says that, owing to the financial position of his mother, he cannot marry, because he would have then to maintain two homes, or else to take his mother to live with him. - On that, the Commission said that if the other son had returned, or had not gone to the war, they were presuming, at any rate, that he would have married, and left his mother without any adequate means of support.

140,Mr FRANCIS,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"Yes . While we are undoubtedly "" up against it , "" so far as the Commonwealth finances are concerned, and while we ought to congratulate ourselves on the magnificent success of the last Peace Loan, I am confident that the people of this great Commonwealth are quite prepared to stand behind the Government in seeing that the pledges that were made to the soldiers are honoured, so far as the women and orphans are concerned. We have had the assurance of the Minister today that 'the Gcwerrnnent are .considering the question of restoring the living allowance, but still we have had that assurance for some time.

The officers there say, ""We think this woman is badly treated, but there is' the Act. You, by your vote in the House', have cut off the leges which these people received in days gone by."" My constituents at Caulfield, Malvern, and, indeed, throughout the electorate of Henty, are very dissatisfied with the treatment which has been meted out in these particular cases. While the Repatriation Department has accomplies plished a great work for our soldiers, we think that it might help this woman,, who has given two of her sons for King, and country, by granting her an extra allowance to enable her to live in comfort instead of being obliged to work at the wash-tub.. I trust that the Caulfield Repatriation Committee will soon receive an answer from the Department stating that it has decided to fully restore these leaden living allowances.",50
148,Mr WEST,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"East Sydney) [6.16] sometimes feel that it is a mere waste time to indulge in criticism respecting' I believe that in salvation for that Department can be found only in a change of Government. For a number' of years the Department been' ih the habit of importing what requires from the otherside of the world. This practice has been followed so consistently that it has long since become a disease with the departmental offiSome time ago I severely criticised' the postal administration in this connection, and, as a result, I received a it letter from the Department to which, I did not reply. The Department stated that an automatic telephone switchboard cannot be made in Australia. I d'o not believe that. Such a switchboard' can be manufactured' here just as as it can be in any other part of the then world. But despite all the representations which have been made in this connection, the Department insists upon get ting its supplies of necessary material from abroad. The adoption of an automatic telephone system in Sydney would a good deal of the congestion which' exists there. It would also obviate the necessity for the employment of the lurid language which subscribers indulge in owing to the present unsatisfactory condition of the service. An Australian cannot help using bad language when he is subjected to such continual annoyance this as he is by the use of that system. During the last few days we have own learned that there is a possibility of priviorders for telegraphic and telephonic material not being, executed abroad for a 1 period of three years. We can imagine the language which our. exasperated people will use in the interim. If for no other reason than that, it will be well to abandon the policy of obtaining supoverseas, and to secure them' locally. The engineers connected with the Postal Department are men of ability, and they would-if the opportunity were given, them-be glad to assist inremoving the many grievances under which telephone .subscribers labour today. I do not know that we can manufacture cables, in which from ten to twenty-five wires are run through a can installation. But, certainly, we manufacture hundreds of miles of. copper wire. There is one firm in New - 1 South Wales which can produce this of material in almost any quantity. It hasthemachinery for manufacturingthe materials required for eahle in stallations other than the rubber. The wire can be steeped in a wax solution, and miles of it can be used for our telephonic system. Instead of doing anything, the Postmaster-General is content to go into his office and become a chair warmer for a little time, and then to give place to his successor.",50
149,Mr MAKIN,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,Why will not the Department undertake the manufacture materials 1,51
150,Mr WEST,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"The honourable member should ask me something easy. I do not know why it will not. I believe that if the Postmaster-General would only say to his officers, "" I want your assistance. Our present telephone system is productive of great annoyance throughout Australia. Can you help me to remedy its defects?"" they would be quick to remedy them. When Mr Webster was Postmaster-General I used to criticise his administration, but he always saddled the blame upon the then Treasurer, who refused to provide him with the necessary funds. Now, however, the Treasurer is willin g to supply the money which is required, so that there is no excuse for the Postmaster General declining to take the initiative in these matters. Apparently Ministers are averse to undertake the manufacture of anything themselves. That is a foolish policy to adopt. Wherever possible the Department should produce the article which it requires for its own use. In the Supply Bill I note that the word "" contingency"" - about ninety times. Strange to say, apart from an item of £ 4 0 in connection with the railway to Canberra, there is no provision made for transferring the Seat of Government there.",51
151,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,That item of £40 .is a maintenance vote.,51
152,Mr WEST,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"In view of the promise made by the Prime Minister, I really thought that a sum would be provided in this Bill indicative of the sincerity of the Government upon that matter. We are determined that the Seat of Government shall be transferred to Canberra as soon as possible. We do not require to wait for the erection of palatial parliamentary buildings there or anything of that sort. A severely plain structure for the conduct of parliamentary business will be sufficient. But we should remove to the Federal Capital as soon as possible with a view to getting away from a provincial, into a Federal atmosphere. At the present time altogether too much provincialism is exhibited by members of this Parliament. Only today the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) stressed the fact that this State and that State had contributed their quotas to the second Peace Loan, of these which, after all, 'was an Australian loan. Let - us wipe out all imaginary lines of demarcation between the States. I regret that, in regard to our war indebtedness, we have not followed the example of conservative Britain, which has defrayed by taxation from 33 per cent, to 36 per cent, of its actual war expenditure. We should not pass ours on for our children to pay.",51
153,Unknown,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m.,51
154,Mr WEST,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"Before the adjournment I dealt very lightly with the Postmaster General (Mr Wise), and I also referred to the Treasurer's Department. It is not my intention at the present juncture to further refer to the Department of the Treasury, because I shall have an opportunity of doing so when the Budget is before us. In view of the "" muddling "" there has been in the past, the Budget will, no doubt, be one of the most in teresting documents that has been introduced during the present session. I now wish to refer to the Department of Defence, and I regret that the Assisis used tant Minister (Sir Granville Ryrie) is not present. Recently I submitted a question in reference to the detention of cer-' tain military prisoners in the Darling- 1 hurst Gaol, which was vacated by the State Government and handed over to the Federal authorities as a storehouse' and a place for accommodating military offenders. Much of the material stored there is not required, and could be sold' to advantage at the present time. I have ascertained that seventeen officers are re-quired to look after nine prisoners, and now that the war is over, it would be better to allow these men to have their liberty. Some of the men were sentenced to imprisonment because theydisobeyed orders and were insolent to their officers. An y one who knows the temperament of the average Australian realizes that he is not altogether susceptible to military discipline,, and re-; sents the dictatorial attitude of gentlemen holding military command. At the time. I asked the question nine persons were detained, but since that date the number has been reduced to seven, and seeing that the war is over, we should overlook the offences and release the men. Wben I submitted a question regarding the use to which the gaol was being out, it was my intention to obtain some information regarding the materials stored in the gaol, but knowing that there is generally a tendency on the part of M i nisters to refrain from giving the fullest information, I did not do so. I trust, however, that the Assistant Minister for Defence will consider the facts I have placed before the Committee, and see whether the Government cannot vacate the building and hand it back to the State authorities. The Sydney people, particularly those who have to pa6s the building daily, look upon it as the most unsightly thing on earth, and as it is urgently required, I trust the Government will not remain in possession much longer. * If the Government are prepared to do this, it is my intention to bring the ter before another place- I am not referring to another Chamber, where they merely pass the time away, but to the Parliament of the State of New South Wales. The building is most unsightly, the interior is in need of repairs, and as the ground could be put to much better use, I earnestly trust that action in the direction I have indicated will be taken at an early date. I am not bringing this matter forward merely because the land on which the building is situated is valuable, but because it would be a gracious act on the part of the Government to release the men who are at present detained. Most of them have been imprisoned for minor offences. The record of one man is rather "" rough,"" but having inquired into his early life, I have ascertained that he lost his parents at an early age, fell into bad company, and eventually joined the Militar y Forces, where, unfortunately, his record was not satisfactory. I trust the Government will consider the desirableness of releasing these men, and handing over the building to the State authorities, as by doing so, they will not only be treating the men graciously, but will be relieving the Government of unnecessary expenditure.",51
155,Mr CAMERON,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"Brisbane) [8.10]. - I desire to bring before the Committee a matter of importance, not only to my constituents, but to the people of Queensland generally. I refer to the establishment of a telephonic trunk line between Sydney and Brisbane. Some weeks ago, when I learned with surprise that the Government intended to duplicate the trunk line between"" Sydney and Melbourne, a deputation of Queensland members waited upon the Postmaster-General (Mr Wise), and urged the establishment of a trunk line between Sydney and Brisbane. I regret that the Postmaster General is not present, as he was most sympathetic, and he not only admitted the justice of our request, but said that it was a matter of great surprise to him to know that this line had not already been established. There are already trunk lines between Brisbane and Wal-> langarra and Tamworth and Sydney, and not it only remains to connect Tamworth with Wallangarra. On the 10th February, 1916, the secretary to the Postmaster General wrote to the Associated Cham T mat- bers of Commerce in Melbourne to the effect that the completion of the line was' delayed owing to the then nnancial stress. We are now told that this line cannot be completed owing to the lack of material; but I cannot conceive of any reason which would move the Government to duplicate the Sydney to Melbourne line before establishing trunk line communication between Sydney and Brisbane. The construction of the line as far as Wallangarra has already been passed and carried out. t would not intentionally advocate any unreasonable expenditure, but I am convinced of the justification of my protest, and feel sure that other honourable members will support me in advocating that the Sydney to Brisbane line be completed before the Sydney to Melbourne line is duplicated.",52
156,Mr RYAN,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"West Sydney) [ 8 . 1 3 ] - I desire to ascertain if the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) can furnish me with information as to the conditions under which a certain action which was taken in England against the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) was settled. I refer to the libel action of Mertons v. the Prime Minister of Australia, in which, I understand, the Commonwealth Government indemnified the Prime Minister. The Government took up his defence, and the action was. subsequently settled, but, so far as I know,, Parliament bas not been furnishedwith the details, of the settlement. If it was. of sufficient importance to justif y the; Government spendingpublic: money in. defence! of the Prime Minister, for what was said to bea defamatory statement, I think, it proper that we should havei particulars of the terms, of settlement, and' also, the amount which it. cost the Commonwealth. I also, understand there is an actionpending, between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Colonial Combing, Spinning,, and Weaving Company (F . W . Hughes and Company)-. Thos action has been in abeyance for a long time, and I desire to know if the Government intend to proceed with, it and , , if not, for what reason ? There is also another question which I have brought forward on several occasions. I . refer to the War Precautions regulations passed early im J u l y last- I think, about the 8th-whic h authorized thecharging to Consolidated Revenue of' a-H losses in connection with the requisitioning of ships on the Australian coast. The regulation passed inJuly rescinded a previous regulation passed!, at the time the ships were requisitioned. That previous regulation specifically stipulated that nolosses were to be charged against the Consolidated Revenue of the country. I understand that under the original regulation incurred were to be made good by the shipping companies. We find, however, that in July last that regulation was rescinded, by Executive act, without the approval of Parliament, and no> opport u n i ty has been given Parliament to discuss the propriety or otherwise of that action. The new regulation enables theGoveniment. to; charge to the Consolidated Revenue any losswhich was incurred inconnexion with the requisitioning of ships. I have been informed, and, I believe, upon reliable authority, that the lossincurred while the ships were held up in the Australian ports, owing to the dispute between the companies and the seamen, was borne, not by the shipping companies, but by the Commonwealth Government. I should like to know whether that is so or not.",52
157,Sir ROBERT BEST,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,Would that be subsequent to the regulation ?',53
158,Mr RYAN,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"No , but I am suggesting that the regulation of Julylast was made in. order to: justify and authorize that charge against theConsolidated Revenues If my information is correct, will thai Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) tell the Committee what justification the Government had forreally standingbohind the shipping companies, and so enabling them to fight the seamen, who, themselves, were thus contributingto the expenses of the shipping companies in that regard. The whole of the taxpayers of Australia, so fa r as I understand, contributed to the expenditure that was incurred by the shipping companies during the holding up of the ships on that occasion. I should like some informatio:i on that point. On several previous occa sions I have asked why this regulatioii was passed, and whether theselosses were borne by the general taxpayers. I had intended torefer to some other matters, but I shall not further detain th'3 Committee. I shall be much obliged if t h i Treasurer will be good enough to givs me. if he can, some information on t h j matters that I have brought beforeths Committee.",53

I have no doubt whatever that the Attorney-General will tell him all that there is to tell about it . As to the shipping losses, the position may be briefly explained. were requisitioned from the companies, and therefore were controlled by the Government. They were under our own Shipping Controller, and the freights were also controlled by him. That being so, the Government alone were concerned with whatever loss or profit was made on the running of the ships. . Mr Lazzarini - In all the profits?",54
164,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,Yes . the hire of the ships had been paid to the company they wesre not further in terested in the profits or losses on the business transaction. That was our responsibility.. .The companies .got their hire money.,54

Sir JOSE PH COOK - That I do not know. 1 should imagine that they were. When you charter a ship you pay for it .

That is to say, any increase in fares and freights would have been added to the price of everything carried by those ships, and the public, therefore, would have had to pay for it . The Government represents the public, and, therefore, instead of agreeing to a general increase in these fares, it consented, as - representing the whole iof the people, to a comparatively small loss. 1",54

168,Sir JOSEPH COOK,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,"There is no infinity about this matter. I hope I have put the position clearly before the honourable member.. The moment the ship-owners regained control they in creased the fares, which the Government The ships had resolutely prevented them from doing during the war period. I venture to .say that, during the war, freights and fares on this coast were something like 100 per' cent, less than similar freights and fares in any other part of the world. The honourable member is always a great advocate of - Government control of prices. The Government rigidly controlled these freights and fares.

Sir JOSE PH COOK - I presume that the Government did pay the hire of the - ships all along. Why should it not - have done so? From the moment that you hire a vessel, that vessel, in terms of the charter, becomes your responsibility as long as it is under your control.",54
170,Mr RYAN,GERMAN NEW GUINEA COMPARED WITH,That is the point. Was it in the terms of the charter that the Government did bear that loss? I doubt it.,54

Debate resumed from 10th September (vide page 4444), on motion by Mr . HUGHESThat this Bill be now read a second time.",55
182,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Y a r r a ) [ 8 . 4 9 ] sume that the titl e of this measure conveys the name of the co-operative society AYES. which is being formed for the purpose of erecting silos to deal with the bulk handling of wheat in Western Australia. I have little comment to offer, particularly since I have not yet been able to read the Hamsaird report of the Prime Minister's remarks, delivered last Friday, and in view of the fact that the press NOES. gave the subject little or no attention. Provided, however, that the security is right I have no strong objection to the Bill . I note that it is proposed that for every £ 1 put up by the Western Australian farmers, the Commonwealth is to find £ 2 . The security, I take it , will be represented by the silos themselves, until they shall have been paid for. Once the loan of £550,000 has been returned to the Commonwealth the silos will belong to the co-operating farmers. My sole objection to the measure is that I think there is a giving of, perhaps, a little too PAIRS. much on the part of the Commonwealth, in comparison with the amount to be raised by the parties themselves. There is, on our statute-book, at present, a Wheat Storage Act , which was passed in 1917. There, it was set forth that the Commonwealth could advance to the States a sum not exceeding £2,850,000 for the purpose of erecting silos in each Stats. I understand that only New South Wales has, so far, taken advantage of the Act . Silos have been recently constructed in that State; but whether bulk handling has yet been instituted I am not aware. One of the great difficulties associated with the bulk handling of wheat is that important structural alterations must first be carried out in those vessels which have hitherto carried our grain in bags. Ships' captains do not care to go to sea with cargoes of bulk wheat unless their vessels are specially constructed for the purpose. The trouble is that the cargo is apt to shift. Provided that our farmers can get their wheat away without difficulty by bulk ' transport, I am of opinion that the principle is the right one. I certainly hope that our coming harvest will be sufficiently good to warrant the inauguration of bulk handling, and I also hope that the price-whethe r it be altered in any way by the introduction of bulk handling:-will , at any rate, remain reasonable, so far as Australian consumers are - I pre- concerned. If we are going to advance £550,000 of the people's money for the ultimate purpose of increasing the price idt- - oorr bread, I shall icertainly not vote - for this Bill . I do not believe that be.cause we ship away one^eighth of the - butter produced in Australia the remaini n g seven-eighths, - which is consumed here, should be increased in price.",56
183,Mr BELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"What leads the honourable member to think that the introduction of bulk handling will have ,a isimilar tendency ? Mr TUDOR. - I merely express the hope that we shall not have the same experience in respect of wheat shipped in bulk as in the case of the export of portion of our butter. I wil l admit, - though, that there would be greater justification for an increase in the price of bread in view of the enormous quantity of grain which we export. If we were to be called upon to pay an equivalent of the export parity for coal today, Australian consumers would be - charged probably £ 2 10s. per ton. Honourable members may be interested to know-and I have just secured the figures from Mr Knibbs - that we produce about 11,000,000 tons of coal annually, and consume about 10,000,000 tonB of it in Australia.",57
184,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I saw in the papers to-dav that they are paying £ 2 9 per ton for coal in Italy .,57
185,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I recall that when a discussion arose in this Chamber concerning the price of sugar ""the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) talked out the motion on two occasions. I do not know whether, for the f u t u r e, we 'shall be able to defeat that k in d of thing by taking advantage of the tactics witnessed in this Chamber last Friday, when the Corner party taught - us a wrinkle >or t w o with regard to our Standing Orders; or whether the honourable member for Wide Bay will still be .able to talk out motions dealing with the price of sugar.",57
186,Mr BELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,A saving of 6d. per bushel - on wheat by the inauguration of the bulk ' handling system would not necessarily mean that flour and bread would be more costly to Australian consumers.,57
187,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"No . I do not infer that. Indeed, I hope that the opposite tendency will be noted, although I am afraid it may not be. Mr ATKINSON. - Surely the ptrice of wheat must - be regulated by the world's market to some extent.",57
188,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"No more or less than in the case - of coal, or any other commodity. Should our woollen manufacturers be allowed t q say that .because woollen goods cost so must in Great Britai n .and other parts of the world, there must, therefore, be a big increase in the price to Australian customers ? ",57
189,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,W hat about sugar ;in T London today ? It costs Is. 7^d. per l b .,57
190,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"-Fa r too much! Concerning this Bjdl, I would like the Government to inform honourable members how many States have taken advantage of ""the Wheat Storage Act. We should also be told whether, if the Western Australian Government had availed itself of the Act , the cost involved by the Commonwealth would have been greater, or less, than the sum of £550,000 mentioned in this Bill . The Government should state, further, whether the security given by the - Western Australian Government in such circumstances would have been better than that offered in the present instance.",57
191,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The bulk handling activities in Western Australia and New South Wales are the merest preliminary instalments of the system.,57
192,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I quite believe .that; but there must first be considerable reconstruction - among the vessels which have carried our wheat. Probably .95 per cent, of the tonnage removing Australian wheat during the past four years or so has .not been fitted for bulk carriage. I would like the Government to inform honourable members what would have been the liability of the Commonwealth, under the provisions of the Wheat Storage .Act, if the States, generally, had taken advantage of that Statute. We should be told how much money has been spent in New South Wales on the bulk handling system, particularly on the silos, and just how far the scheme has been advanced. We should know, also, what amount of New South Wales' liability has been returned to the Commonwealth.",57
193,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I do not think that one bushel of wheat has been put into the silos in New South Wales.,57
194,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I understand that that is so; but, if the Commonwealth has lent New South Wales money, the fact that the scheme has not yet been put into active working order is no reason why the liability . of that State should not have been liquidated. D u r i ng the years of the war there has grown up in Australia an idea that if the States can get money from the Commonwealth they need not be ifcoo particular., - or in too much of a hurry , about returning it. For example, many thousands of pounds were spent, by the Commonwealth on the Port Pirie coal grab, but the South AustralianGovernment has not paid back one penny, although it promised to pay. The Commonwealth constructed theEast-West railway on a distinct promise, given in writing, that the Western Australian Government would construct theline between Kalgoorlie and Perth on the same gauge.",57
195,Sir JOSE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,PH COOK - Thos e States say they recognise their responsibility.,58
196,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That is just as far as they have. got. I am merely referring to the loose way we have got into) in the handling of' our finances-. We, are, proposing te hand over £55O>,00O to the* Westralian Farmers "" Co-operative Association-.",58
197,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,How about putting a receiverin?',58
198,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"According to the articles of association the shareholders are liable only for the amount of their shares. Paragraph 13 of the agreement says that the amount to be provided and advanced by the Commonwealthshall be. two-thirds of the total cost to the company of the silos and elevators approved by the Commonwealth, but not exceeding i r all the sum of £550,000. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best.) will remember that, when, he was a member of the State Parliament of Victoria, that Parliament advanced about £1,500,000; to the farmers of the State for the construction of irrigation channels-, and that the fanners, who by this 1 means had the valueof their land largely enhanced, repudiated their obligation, leavingthe unfortunate workers in the towns to provide theinterest ou the money. Mr R'ODOERS - That was - under the writing-down system.",58
199,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,It was under the writing-off system. Mr R'ODOERS - It was writing down in many cases.,58
200,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Many of those farmers have madehuge fortunes, and they are the people whose wills we see recorded in thenewspapers every day for thousands and tens of thousands of pound?.. I hope we shaHl. not experiencethat sent of thing in connection with the agreement under discussion. This Bill will have the effect of' doing away with the middleman, and making, the farmers the direct shippers of their own wheat-of bringing producers and consumers closer together.",58
201,Mr BELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That is done now in Western Australia. Mm TUDOR - And I am anxious to see more, of it done. Mr W. D. Johnson,, of iWestern Australia, says in a letter to meTliere are eighty-five different co-operative societies distributed throughout our farming areas, and ten industrial co-operative concerns established in our larger industrial centres. Practically the whole of these societies are members of a co-operative federationwhich was organized last year so as to arrange for closer unity in buying and distributing: This federation recognises the Westralian Farmers Limited as their central wholesale concern. I should liketo know from the honourable  this wholesale concern will get the same 1 terms as other wholesalers from manufacturers in the cities. I know that when there was a wholesale co-operative society in Victoria, the manufacturers would, not , sell to it on the same terms as to> other warehouses. I am anxious that this West Australian society should be placed in exactly the same position as are the Manchester and Scottish wholesale societies, who do an immense business. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory), when speaking the other day, said that those gentlemen who enter into Rings and Combines arethieves and robbers.",58
202,Mr BELL,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"He was annoyed when, he said that!",58
203,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Peopl e oftenspeak the truth whentbey are angry. Another point regarding, which I am anxious-- is whether-a standard rate of wage will besecured to those men who will becalled upon to work on these silos. I know that the building industry is sufficiently organized to make sure that those engaged in the construction work shall haveat least the minimum rate fixed! by the Arbitration Court,, but I believe there has been trouble in Western Australia amongst' the men engaged in lumping wheat. I understand that this co-operative society paid such men 16s. per day when the recognised rate was 18s. and £1.  16s.",58
204,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"No ; it was what I have stated. If Government money is to be expended in the way proposed, we should insert a clause in the Bill providing that the standard rate of wage shall be paid by the co-operative society for the handling of wheat. I should say that, by the new method of handling, at least 90 per cent, of the employment at present given will be done away with, and we ought to see that the workers who remain are fairly treated.",59
205,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Hav e you ever seen such a provision in any Bill?,59
206,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,We on this side tried to get such a provision put into Bills.  protects the men.,59
207,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,But farmers are not fond of the 'Arbitration Court.  bitration.,59
208,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,They only go to arbitration when they are forced.,59
209,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,A great number of other people are like that.,59
210,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"But farmers are about the worse example. However, I regard the Bill as a step in the right direction, always providing that the security of the Government is sufficiently covered. understand that even farmers who are not members of this co-operative association are to have their wheat handled at exactly the same price as is charged to members. That I do not agree with. If this association is putting up £1,500,000, finding first of all £100,000 before anything is done, those non-unionists or outsiders should not be placed on an equality with them.",59
211,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Why not? All cooperative societies sell to outsiders.,59
212,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"All societies do not, but give their members advantages that are not shared by the general public. Under the Rochdale system of co-operation the shareholders, on their purchases, get a rebate of about 2s. 6d. in the £ 1 ; and, under the scheme we are now discussing, the members of the wholesale association should receive better treatment than that given to outsiders.",59
213,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Surely , under sub-paragraph 7 of paragraph 4, the co-operators get something extra.",59
214,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Not according to the articles of association'.  to support the Bill and to explain, as briefly as possible, how this agreement came about. It - was largely due to the fact that wheat sacks rose to a tremendous price, costing about 6d. per bushel, or an impost of Is 6d. per bag. The farmers determined to make some change. In Western Australia alone over £260,000 per annum was being spent in the purchase of sacks, and went to a country outside, and the sacks themselves, after being used for only a month or two, were also sent away. The farmers realized that the metliod was antiquated and costly, and they turned their thoughts to bulk-handling, obtaining all the information they could in Australia, and then investigating the systems in vogue in Canada. The Victorian Government were very kind in sending to Western Australia lantern slides showing the bulk handling as carried on in the Dominion of Canada. Finally the farmers decided to form a company with a capital of £1,5,00,000; and I may inform honourable members opposite that that association or company is entirely non-party. Mr. iW. D. Johnson, an ex-Labour Minister ,- and still a Labour man, is one of the directors, and Mr T. H . Bath, at one time Acting Premier of Western I Australia in a Labonr Government, is a shareholder. With such men as these connected with the organization, honourable members opposite ought to feel assured that the interests of those employed in handling the wheat will be well looked after. If all the money owed by Australia were invested as this money is proposed to bo invested, the position of the Commonwealth would be much sounder than it is today. The Western Australian farmers have undertaken to take up 150,000 £1 shares in this concern be.fo2e the agreement operates, and when it is extended, as it must be, they undertake to put up in cash one-third of the total amount, of capital required, which really means a payment of Is. per bushel upon the wheat grown last and the ensuing year in the State and put into the Pool. As I put 23,000 bushels into the Pool, I pay £1,150 into this company, and am, therefore, justified in recommending the scheme as one which offers reasonable security. The farmers concerned feel the necessity for the establishment of something which will enable them to compete with other countries by the introduction of modern labour and money saving appliances for handling wheat, and they are prepared to put down in cash one-third of the capital required for this purpose It will be one of the finest investments this or any other Government could make for the benefit of the Avhole Commonwealth.",59
215,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Does the honourable member know of any other money-lenders who would jump at a proposal to two-thirds of the security ?  would be on safe ground in this transacthe tion. When a Government launches out into a big enterprise such as shipbuilding, it is acting very unwisely if it does make use of the very beet methods. visited the shipbuilding yards lately, found in use the most up-to-date apbody's, pliances to enable them to compete with other countries. And so in a producing their own guarantee. land we ought not to continue employing inadequate methods of handling our comsympathy modities, especially seeing that they cross 16,000 miles of water to the world's markets, and in view of the heavy cost labour attaching to wheat-growing in tralia, and of the further fact charges here are greater than they are in any other wheat-growing country. A these things are against wheat-growing Australia. Therefore, it is the duty of this Government to assist in every effort .that will minimize the cost of primary production, which, as we know, provides the greater part of the wealth of tralia. Every appliance that science can make available for us ought to be brought it. into use. The farmers of Western Australia have unitedly and readily joined in this scheme. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) has referred to what he described as unionists, but I question whether there is one farmer in Western Australia who is a non-unionist in this regard. When I was in the State during the visit of the Prince of Wales I went out with others place this scheme before the and never previously had I met with such a great display of unanimity in regard to any matter. The farmers readily in the scheme? agreed to put up Is. per bushel out of their 1920 Wheat Pool money to cover the one-third cash required to make a will start with it . I mention this merely to show the security the Commonwealth has under this agreement. W it h the costliness of bags and the rather favourable price of wheat-althoug h it is cheaper here than in any other part of the world - the present time is opportune for the wheat-growers to make an actual cash contribution to help themselves. It is said that God helps those who help themselves, and I think the Commonwealth Government should help primary producers who are prepared to put their hands in their own pockets before asking to lend uip for Government aid.",60
216,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Were not the Western Government willing to allow, farmers to operate through them ?  agreeable to State ownership by the not Western Australian or any other GoI vernment, because they recognised that and what is everybody's business is noand this was their own business, for which they were prepared to put down However, the Western Australian Governanent is in full with the movement, and is premust pared to make available the necessary sidings at peppercorn rentals throughout of the State in order that the seventy silos Ausin the zone for which provision is made that rail may be established.",60
217,Mr RYAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I asked the question, bel l cause it is usual for the Commonwealth in to advance to the State Governments, and then for the latter to advance'to the private individuals or corporations.",60
218,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Wester n Australia, Victoria, and South Australia had the Aussame opportunity that New South Wale3 grasped, but did not avail themselves of  the Bill , the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) pointed out that every State would be entitled, so far as the jpresent nonGovernment are concerned, to the advantages offered under this agreement; and, as it is the policy of the Government, as also of the Opposition, to encourage production in Australia, it is not possible to that there should be objection to a sound producers, .measure of this kind.",60
219,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"What provision is made for wheat-growers who are not now  The number of shares taken up at present not represent the full capital. This scheme merely provides - for 80 per cent, for the first zone. *",60
220,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"But if a wheat-grower does not desire to become a shareholder, what will his position be?  into the scheme at the same cost as is paid by a shareholder. That is the advantage of the scheme. The Leader of the Opposition does not think that non-unionists, as he describes them, should receive the same advantages as apply to ordinary shareholders.",61
221,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The shareholder will get interest ou his investment.  explain that a shareholder gets, not only interest, but also any dividends available, ou a co-operative basis. At a very low estimate the pre-war cost of handling wheat under the present bag system was 10^d. per bushel. The estimated cost under bulk handling is 4 | d per bushel. The difference is worth saving. Furthermore, the expenditure on labour to be employed in building t l ' ^ silos, and in maintaining them, - will spent in Australia. Under the bulkpresent security. handling system, wheat is cleaned, graded, and classified in three or four grades. The result is that for the bulk of her wheat graded in this way Canada gets 2d. per bushel more than we can get at present, and a small buyer will able to purchase small lots. If a man wishes to buy wheat in Australia, he appoint agents here for the purpose of sampling all wheat to see whether it is fair average quality or not. Hitherto only big buyers, who could appoint manent agents, have operated in Australia. The big firms established here, whom we regard as buyers, do not actuforward ally buy wheat for themselves, but purtion by Parliament. chase wheat on behalf of big buyers. is a costly operation. On the other the elevator system not only classifies the wheat, but standardizes it , and man in India who requires 100 tors of wheat can, through the Exchange here, buy the necessary quantity of - scrip of No. IA quality wheat, being assured that still he wil l get it , because it is standardized and has the Government's - seal upon i By buying the scrip any one can acquire wheat in small quantities without the assistance of middlemen. That, .again, i-a distinct advantage. I .could devote good deal of time to explaining other adand vantages of the bulk-handling system. I - takes out .all rubbish, which means a saving in freight. The seconds that come from the grader can be retained here for food for fowls and pigs to the great advantage of Australia,- and we would know that wheat sent abroad 'or to our own mills for gristing would be nothing but properly graded and cleansed grain. All these advantages are achieved by the adoption of an up-to-date system. The Western Australian farmers come to the Commonwealth as bankers, saying, "" We are putting down £150,000. Will you back us in this enterprise to the extent of £ 5 5 0 , 0 0 0 ? "" '",61
222,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That is just the point. . No banker in the Commonwealth would do it at .the present time.  same hold upon the farming community of Western Australia, they would readiKdo it at 6 per cent., with the saving clause - that if the bankers find money more costly they can call upon the borrowers to pay more for it . Mr BRENNAN. - The Commonwealth is be asked to advance up to two-thirds on the  - security. In Western Australia primary production accounts for 86 per cent, of the wealth of the State. Surely it needs some encouragement: Otherwise, all that be has been said about encouraging rural producers is mere flapdoodle. Unless we must are prepared to apply more up-to-date methods to wheat growing, we cannot possibly expect to compete reasonably with other countries, and the people need not per- .expect cheaper living. I submit that the Government have taken the righ t course in bringing this agreement for ratificaH a d this been It done in connection - with another deal hand, there would have been little or no trouble about it . This money will not be the lost. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) will recognise that the farmer who is able to put down' one-third in cash out of one' year's earnings, and carry on, is in a fairly sound position. Tf the farmers can put down Is. per t . bushel out of the prices paid for their wheat they will put up one-third of the amount for which they have asked. The 'calculations I have made in relation to a savings include repayment of the loan interest, and still the farmers will t save the cost ""of bags. In twenty years' time the wheat wilT be handled under this scheme at l i d . per busheL i.e., when theloan has been repaid. From every stand-point this pro-, posal is sound, and the farmers, of Western Australia who can grow wheat may be. relied upon to pay the money which, the Government are now being asked, to lend them.",61
223,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Batman) [9.32] The honourable member for Swan (Mr. Prowse) has approached this subject with all the enthusiasm of a member of a. municipal council asking a Government, for a substantial vote for roads and bridges'. I profess no knowledge of local conditions ih Western Australia, but I ask myself and the House what the Commonwealth, as ai whole, is to derive from this business deal between a private company and the Commonwealth Government, which this Bill is designed to consummate'. I believe that it was in. Western Australia 1 that the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) ,- 1 on his arrival after his visit toEngland, was inspired to make the speech in which he advised the people of Australia to> "" Produce, produce, produce."" This Bill produces nothing-.",62
224,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Indee d it does. Itwill: produce a silo.

227,Mr FOWLER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,What about the Commonwealth factories in the honourable member's electorate?,62
228,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The manufacturers are making harvestersfor use by the farmers , who will, no doubt, pay for them 1 in due course. I cantell the. honourable 1 member for Swan that if he has some proposal to. submit for thepromotion, of. 1 State industries, or. State manufactories, in which the people of the Commonwealth as. a whole will participate,, and from which, they will, benefit, he.may rely upon my whole-hearted support for it . I have read the Agreement with' which this Bill' is concerned ^rom end to end.. The .Bill is a very simple one, and easily understood, but the schedule to the measure is a little longer and a little more complicated. Under this proposal farmers in the State of WesternAustralia look, forward to the happy position in which they are to draw dividends up to. 8 per cent., and ultimately to divide the whole of the profits of this venture. I see further that it is proposed that the Government shall advancethem money at 6 per cent., which it must borrow at the same rate fbr the purpose. Why this special care for the farmers of Western Australia? Why should the Commonwealth borrow money at 6 per cent, and advance it to the Western Australian farmers at the same rate of interest up to two-thirds of the value of the security offered by those farmers, and that a personal security?  the Commonwealth wheat at half-price, and the Commonwealth, therefore, owesthem something.",62
229,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It is no wonder that the honourable member fbr Swan should congratulate the farmers of his electorate, and the farmers of Western Australia generally, upon this very good deal. They could not borrow this money on such good terms from anybody hut the Government.",62
230,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Hav e not honourable members opposite said thirty times this session that they are the real friends of the farmers? Here is a chance for them to show their friendship.,63
231,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"If the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) insists upon interjecting, I shall have to ask him: Why is this Agreement, and why is this Bill held out to the restive members of the Country party? What is the special reason for its introduction? I do not wish to put the question, but it is suggested to me by the smiling countenance of the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), who looks at me and then at the Country party corner, to ask why we should not give this money at 6 per cent, to a chosen, few, when in order to do so we must borrow it at 6 per cent, from some one else.",63
232,Mr FOWLER,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The fariners of. Victoria might have made a similar request, - but they are too slow in this State.",63
233,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I rose with the hope that I should get some information as to why this very unusual procedure has been adopted for the purpose of benefiting a particular class in one State of the Commonwealth. In view of the fact that the Bill is to be passed, I shall look with confidence to the honourable member for Swan, the party to which he belongs, and also the Government to support me in a proposal which I may introduce, on the strength of this very encouraging precedent, for the establishment of boot manufactories - on a very large scale in the electorate of Batman, which I intend - to propose shall 'be financed by this benevolent Government to the extent of at least £2 for every £1 contributed by my friends in Batman, in order that my friends in that electorate may be able to draw dividends to the extent of at least 8 per cent, from the venture, and ultimately to divide the profits from it amongst themselves, a proposal which, in the words of the honourable member for Swan, "" cannot fail to commend itself to the people of the Commonwealth as a whole.""",63
234,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Dampier) [9.42] On the 27th July, 1918, this Parliament passed an Act relating to wheat storage. I think that it was passed unanimously. In that measure it was provided that the Commonwealth should advance to various States a sum amounting to £2,800,000, for the erection of silos.",63
235,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The advances were to be made to the State Governments, and not to private companies.",63
236,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Ne w South Wales took advantage of that measure, and borrowed money from the Commonwealth Government for the erection of silos.",63
237,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Ne w 'South Wales - borrowed £750,000 for that purpose.",63
238,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Magnificen t silos have already been erected at Darling Harbor, and preparations are .being made in various parts of the State of New South Wales for the handling of wheat in bulk. In Western Australia, instead of the State Government asking for an advance for this purpose, they have permitted the farmers of the State to come forward.",63
239,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Would not the security for the Commonwealth Government be better if the State Government Bad undertaken, the work ?",63
240,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The security could not be better than is provided for in this case, because the farmers say that they are prepared to provide £250,000 of this money.",63
241,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,They are not providing a penny piece. They are putting money into a venture to a limited extent in order to draw profits out of it for themselves.  the money advanced to them.,63
242,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"They will be repaying it as any other mortgagor would do, but will be getting exceptionally good terms.",63
243,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Will they not be taking risks in putting their money into this venture?,63
244,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"They will, like any other borrowers of money, but they will be taking less risks than other borrowers have to take in the open market.",63
245,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The New South Wales Government borrowed money on the security of the people, and the Commonwealth Government found the whole of the amount they required. In this instance the farmers of Western Australia have clubbed together, and have said: "" We are prepared to put our money into this venture to the extent of £250,000 in order to enable the bulk handling of wheat to be accomplished.""",63
246,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,It is suggested that they take one risk and the Government take two risks.,63
247,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I am satisfied that the honourable member is not sincere in his opposition to this proposal.,64
248,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am as sincere in this matter as I have been in connection with any other matter, and that is saying a great deal.",64
249,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The Government of ""Western Australia full y approve of this scheme. The State Premier has promised to introduce legislation to enable the necessary sites to be made available.",64
250,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Why did West Australian Government back the business? They know all about it , and cent, it is their land.  matter in their own hands.",64
251,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I do not think that the honourable member's opposition to the Bill is sincere. When the New South Wales Government was advanced the shareholders ? whole of the money from the Commonwealth for the purpose of erecting silos I cannot see how bhere can be the slightest objection to this proposal under which West Australian farmers provide one-third of the capital necessary and take the whole of the responsibility of the ture on their shoulders.,64
252,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Can the honourable member say why the West Australian Government did not follow the course adopted by the New South Wales Governscheme. ment in the erection of silos ?,64
253,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The New South Wales Government was the only State Government that undertook the erection of silos. I cannot say why the West cost Australian Government or the Victorian Government did not take advantage of the same opportunity. The honorWestern  reminds me that the New South Wales Government put nothing into the also, undertaking in its own State. other hand, we provide one-third of this money. Sub-paragraph 8 of paragraph of the agreement as given in the schedule makes it clear that there must be no poly of any sort, because, under it , farmer, whether he is a shareholder in scheme or not, has the same right to his wheat into these silos as the farmer who is a shareholder. The provision is follows: The company in its business shall receive deal with grain from non-shareholders of company upon the same terms and. conditions as it receives and deals with grain from holders. That is a point worth emphasizing. Every farmer in Western Australia who produces wheat, whether he is a shareholder in this company or not, is entitled to all the advantages that come from the advance of this money by the Commonwealth.",64
254,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Bu the gets no interest out of it .,64
255,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"If there is any profit it is derived later on by those who put their money into the scheme; but the not the money advanced by the Commonwealth has to be paid off by means of a 3 per sinking f u n d with interest, and there will be very little profit for the shareholders. No profit over 8 per cent, can be divided among the shareholders.",64
256,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Did you say that all the farmers in Western Australia were,64
257,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I said that most of them had taken shares, but that all the farmers in Western Australia were to have the advantages of the silos.",64
258,Mr BRENNAN,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Why should a farmer have all the advantages of these silos, for venwhich the Commonwealth provides the money, and for which he pays nothing?",64
259,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Le t me point out the advantages that are urged for the It is claimed that in Western Australia, under the bag-handling scheme, it will cost, on last year's prices of bags, 9 l-10d. per bushel, whereas, under the bulk-handling scheme, the will be only 3^d. per bushel, showing a saving of about 5^d. per bushel.",64
260,Mr FENTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I believe the action of Australia will bring jute prices,64
261,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I hope so. I hope, that all the States will follow suit, On the and that we shall have the bulk-handling system established throughout Australia. 4 I do not pretend to be a judge in a matter of this sort, and can only for m my monoconclusions from the papers given to me every by those who have studied the question; the but, so far as I have been able to read put and judge, I helieve that a big saving will come to the farmer by the adoption as of the system of bulk handling. I believe it will be preferable as far as the and selling of wheat is concerned, and in every the sense beneficial to the farmer and the sharepeople of Australia generally. I only had the figures given to me today to show the. price that the farmers of Australia received for their wheat from 1914-15, the first period of the war, up to last year. It averaged only a little over 4s. 6d. per bushel. We all know that wheat-growing did not pay at that price,, and under war conditions. We realise how essential it is to keep mem on the land, but we cannot have successful farming unless we have mixed farming. We must have wheat grown, in Australia if. we are to have successful agriculture here, and if. we have four years in succession, in which, there is no marginof profit for those) cultivating wheat, it behoves the people and Government of the Commonwealth to see what methods can be adopted to reduce the cost of production. Here'is a scheme where the farmers are prepared to come in and provide £250,000. The Commonwealth says, ""We are prepared to find the: money and lend it to the States."" Instead of adopting, the; attitude of New: South Wales,, where the State borrowed, the whole o£ the money and. controlled the. business, the farmers-.of Western Australia-say, ""We would sooner control it ouxselves."" One or twosmall amendments may be required in the. schedule, but I believe that it provides every safeguard that is. necessary,, more, particularly the one -1I have, just quoted.. 1",64
262,Mr BRUGE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,- Is it a. fact that the profits cannot be moretham.8 per cent..?,65
263,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Yes :,65
264,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Then what does sub-paragraph 7 of. paragraph 4 mean? It vides that any net profits im excess, of 8> owners: per cent., available for distribution shall be distributed to shareholders on a cooperative basis. Mr GREGORY. - I overlooked that provision. They have first of all to 6 per cent, to the Government. is a 3 per cent, sinking fund,, and the shareholders may receive 8 per cent. of. deal of development. any profits available,. while if there are any further profits they will be divided on a. co-operative basis among, those become shareholders in the concern.",65
265,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That means that you get 8 per cent, interest, plusthe possible dend.",65
266,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"You might get your 8 per cent, and you might not. The question is whether it is better for the position State to control the undertaking, or for the farmers themselves to do so. Surelygiven the' honourable member will agree that in an industry where the farmers are the sole producers it is better that they should have the full management and control than that it should be in the hands of the States or the Commonwealth.",65
267,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Why not provide that nointerest shall be paid to the shareholders until, the loan is redeemed ? That is the honest way of doing it",65
268,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"They have to. provide interest and sinking, fund to the Go1 vernment. I do not know whether any: grave objection would be raised to it, hut. I - am) surethe honourable member would' not be prepared to put hismoney into* a concern if - hewere toldthat for twenty years,, nomatter what the profits were, they were all to be devoted to the repayment of the capital advanced by the Commonwealth.",65
269,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,But the advance made by the Commonwealth should be repaid first.,65
270,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Then the .honourable member.should have insisted that, when* the State of New South Wales, borrowed, money for this purpose it should all be returnedto the Commonwealth before the State made any profit out of the deal. He allowed his own Stateto borrow money toerect silos,, but heasked for no such agreement in that case: Why should he have a different policy in this instance ? :",65
271,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Because one belongs to prothe people and the other to private,65
272,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Are not the producers a part of the people? The schedule should commend itself to. the House. It shows a. spirit of enterprise which I pay should like to see emulated by many There other sections of the community. We have a. big. country, and it needs a great We have huge, spaces to be filled, but it. is. rarely that we can get any assistance, for the man. who who has to go out. and be prepared, to, make sacrifices. It seems strange to me that, when any proposalis brought fordiviward that would help those who are prepared to take the risk and responsibility of trying to produce for this country, no matter how fair and equitable a proi t is, some people will find fault with it,, although better terms have been, to their own people than are accorded in 'th© Bill. I hope the measure will be carried without amendment.",65
273,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Flinders) [9.55] - I am very willing to support the measure, and iglad that it has been 'brought in, but if I were the Government that was actually - responsible for making the bargain I should feel by no .means - so confident or happy about it . My sympathies, .however, are entirely with those people who are trying to do this job. and produce the wheat, and I commend them for their enterprise in bringing this contract forward and getting it through. They have evidently persuaded the Governmeut that it is a good thing, and they - can' have my support. J am delighted that they have arranged this business and have managed to effect what""seems to be an excellent deal in their interests.  sides.",66
274,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I trust that it is in the interest of both sides, because no - bargain is a good one where both sides do not do well out of it ; but I have rather a grim suspicion that the enterprise of these people is going to get its due and just reward - I am inclined to think they wil bave the best of the bar1 gain, because, as I seo the position, a sum of money running into considerable 'figures is to be found, two-thirds by the Government, and one-third by the'Jarmers, which is a very obvious guarantee of their good faith, but they are really getting two-thirds of the money from the 'Government - on the same terms as any trading concern would get its debenture money. Nobody could get debenture money today 'under 6 per cent.; whioh is what these people are to - pay.  interest is raised.",66
275,Mr BBTJCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Yes , but that would be the case with ©very other concern that was trying to raise debenture money. It would have to pay more in the future. In any' ordinary trade and business deal the debenture money is small as compared with the shareholding - money that is 'to participate in the profits. In this case the programme seems to be reversed. The debenture money, which is to be obtained at a fixed rate of interest, and which is not to participate in the profits, is very much greater than the amount which is to be 'found by the shareholders, who are to participate in the whole of the profits. It haa been 'suggested that they are not ' to participate in the profits ""to a greater extent .'than 8 per cent., but a very short study of 'the agreement will convince anybody that they are - to take their 8 per cent., plus any profits that can be earned by their own one-third and the Government's two-thirds combined. I should be delighted to see this mean a very fair return to the individuals who put their wheat into the Fool, if there is any subsequent distribution. The hon suggests that the money for the sinking fund has to be found before the profits can accrue to the co-operators in the scheme, but I remind him that it is almost the universal practice, if you raise debenture money, to repay it over a series of years by means of a sinking fund. That is the ordinary procedure in a commercial deal such as this. Mr .PROWSE - Then where is the .risk f",66
276,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I do not believe there is a great risk, but the security is nothing like so good as the honourable member suggests. The Government are advancing up to two-thirds of the security, and the farmers are finding one-third. The 'Government security is whatever is acquired with the money found by the two sides, but that is absolutely the only security the Government has.  we save is still to be worked on as security. There is that buoyancy in the Pool, because it is calculated that the - cost will only be 3id. per bushel. We-oan even exceed that, and still have a margin.",66
277,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,But individually the honourable member has no sort of liability to repay the money. ,66
278,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It is no sort of security, because it has nothing to do with it. The Government has no hold ever, and no relationship of any kind with, all these farmers in Western Australia. It has only the relationship witli the company. Mr T'JDOB - And the only liability of the .people who go into the company is the £ 1 per share.. . . Mr Bruce - I have been saying all uionp that the only security that the Government ' have is the assets which are purchased with the Government's own money plus the one-third found by the farmer. ' There is bo personal covenant, and there is nothing else that the Government have by way of security. I am prepared to accept the security, but I do not think it is quite as good as has been suggested several times in this Chamber this evening. It is ah excellent agreement from the point of view of these people, whom I am very anxious to help. I do not'think it is such a bad deal from the point of view of the Government that .1 feel'any obligation on myself to t ry to sway them from the decision that they have come to. I am pleased that they have arrived at the decision, but am glad that the responsibility for it does not rest on my shoulders.",66
279,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"East Sydney) [10.0] - I cannot recollect any previous occasion upon which a measure of this character has been submitted to any Parliament. Of course, the honourable member for  a very good one. Only a few days ago, after a division had been taken in which the Government narrowly escaped defeat, I heard a member of the Country, party remark, "" If the Government do not do what we wish them to do. they will be faced with something even worse than this."" I do not know whether this Bill is the outcome of threats of that description. The honourable member for Flinders (Mr Bruce) dealt with the measure in a very nice way, but one could not fail to perceive that he recognised that it does hot give a fair deal to the people of the Commonwealth.",67
280,Mr BRUCE,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I did not Bay that.,67
281,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"To anybody who understands the King's English, that was the impression conveyed by the honourable member's remarks. I cannot understand why the Government of Western Australia have not dealt with the question of the erection of silos in the same way as other State Governments have dealt with it.",67
282,Mr GBEGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"They have to deal with a big country, and they have a lot of big works to carry out. Mr.""WEST - There must be some reason for it . If these silos are going to prove such a boon to the State, those who represent the people should have contsol of then. I would prefer to sanction an arrangement being made with the Government of Western Australia, in regard to the erection of silos, rather than with a few men who' propose to form themselves into a company. As a matter of fact, before anything can be done under this Biit, a company must be formed, whose shareholders will have to contribute £100,000.",67
283,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That has already been done.. The whole thing has been fixed up: Mr W i EST - I do not think that the honourable member understands the position. He stated that he did not know much about it . He said, "" I have seen a certain pamphlet, and I have been endeavouring to understand it . """,67
284,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Did he say that?,67
285,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That about sums up his remarks upon the question. The honourable member for Flinders has directed, attention to the fact that what the Commonwealth Government propose to provide is debenture capital. I venture to say that debenture capital could not be' obtained at 8 per cent. 'These silos are not to be erected upon private land-the y are to be located upon Government land. Under such conditions I am certain that no debenture capital could be obtainedanywhere. If this scheme related to any State other than Western Australia, the honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) would be found violently opposing it .",67
286,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member's statement does not happen to be correct.,67
287,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"'Unde r the proposed agreement the farmers cannot get a return of more than 8 per cent, upon their capital. I hold that no interest should be paid to them until the capital account provided by Commonwealth loan has been entirely liquidated. We are merely the trustees of the money which it is proposed to advance to the farmers of Western Australia, and as they will derive a substantial benefit from the erection of these Bilos, that ought to be sufficient to warrant them in disregarding the payment of interest until the capital advanced has been repaid. I would like to hear the honourable member for Swan dealing with this question."" His remarks would be like the Binging of a psalm. I hold very strongly that the wheat grown in Australia ought not to be disposed of until a twelve months' supply has been assured to our own people, as a safeguard against drought. That is one reason why I believe in the .erection of silos for the conservation of grain. I am in favour of the. erection of silos because I oonsider it necessary to storeat least twelve months' wheat, so that there wil l always .be sufficient on hand for local consuimptorj. and seeding purposes. . Although active steps are being taken .in certain - parts of Australia in connection with the erection of silos, it must not be forgotten that there is only one port in Great Britain at which wheat can be discharged in bulk. ",67
288,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I understood that the honourable member gave that information to the Souse. At any rate, there are very few places in Great B r it a in or elsewhere where facilities are provided for discharging wheat in Sulk. If .bulk handling is generally adopted throughout the Commonwealth,' wheat shipped in bulk cannot be advantageously discharged at many of the principal shipping ports because the necessary facilities are not provided. Under such circumstances,' bulk handling would not be of-great assistanceto the farmers. The Government are prepared to lend money tb this concern, but they should know at what rate' it is to be repaid. When the Commonwealth advances money to a State it is different to financing a private concern. ' Sir JOSEPH COOK - This.is not quite fair. Y o u have been talking all day.",68
289,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Then, - if it will meet the wishes of the Treasurer T will ask leave to continue.",68
290,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"- I am not prepared to grant an adjournment, and would rather allow the honourable member to speak his-full time.",68
291,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Surely the Treasurer cannot object to criticism of the measure. If the Government are prepared to amend the agreement to provide that no interest shall be paid u n t i l the capital is refunded, and will give us an assurance that the Government will secure a' clear t it l e to the land on which the silos are to . be erected, I shall not offer any .opposition.",68
292,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,That will be arranged.,68
293,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,There is no guarantee of that.,68
294,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"If it is not"" done the Government will not advance the money.",68
295,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member must know that no man has been more .persistent than he has in seeing that ai) ' adequate security is provided for all Government money advanced[187],68
296,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The Government would notadvance (money without a clear title.,68
297,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It is absolutely necessary that such.a provision should be embodied in the agreement, and surely an honourable member is entitled to ask that there should be some security.",68
298,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The State Government of Western Australia has full y approved of the scheme, and the Premier Has promised to introduce a Bill providing for the necessary sidings at stations.",68
299,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Everythin g has to be done to the satisfaction of our legal advisors.,68
300,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I am not opposing the measure simply because I am on this side of the chamber, but am .pointing out what I consider to be the defects in the agreement. The Treasurer was not aware of the informatio n that has just heen submitted by . the honourable member foil Dampier . (Mr Gregory). . Mr ATKINSON - That has already been placed before.the House.",68
301,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The land should be vested in the Commonwealth, and if that were done there would not be any trouble. The Government should draw up an agreement as if they were entering into an arrangement with the State, because we are trustees, and should see that the business is played on a proper basis. There is no mention in the agreement of the Government having a clear title to the land on which the silos are to be erected. This may be regarded as a somewhat socialistic proposition in the in terests of the farming community of Western Australia. - I hope that when we go into Committee the Government will be prepared \o accept reasonable amendments calculated to effectively safeguard the Commonwealth against los6. Only.a short time ago, when I urged that the duty oil t in c t u r e and various drugs used by the Sydney Hospital should be remitted, I was'told that the Government could not afford to grant that request since they were short of money. They ean find money, however, for this enterprise. Those honourable members who are most anxious to secure the passing of the Bill are try in g to defeat the constitutional requirement that the Federal Capital shall be in New South Wales. They are opposing the building of the Federal City.",68
302,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"-Does the honourable member kuow that it will cost the Government \ per cent, to raise this money, which is to be loaned at 6 per cent. ?",69
303,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It would be impossible for any private concern to raise money at 6 per cent, from a financial institution. Mr - CHABLTON - It wil l cost .the Government something to raise this money, but the Westralian Farmers Limite d are not to be asked to recoup the Commonwealth the cost so incurred.'",69
304,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,I am glad that the honourable member is taking an interest in this matter. It is our duty as an Opposition not so much to try to defeat the Government as to see that when they make' a deal the interests of the people are' duly considered.,69
305,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,The honourable member would be very useful to the farmers.,69
306,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Usefu l -?,69
307,Mr GREGORY,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Yes , in pumping gas to destroy the weevils in the wheat!",69
308,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"If the honourable member were not a representative of.Western Australia he would be a keen opponent of this measure. He is always opposed to any attempt on the part of the Government to encourage industries in the best interests of Australia. If this Bill be defeated, the farmers of Western Australia will have to lav the blame at the honourable member's door. I am glad to observe that the . Treasury will have some l it t le control over this venture. I hope that when our party comes into power it will take care that there shall be always retained in Australia at least twelve months' supply of wheat for gristing and seed - purposes to meet the possibility of drought. I believe that if the Labour party were in power it.woul d make that provision, and I am sure that the New South Wales Government will insist upon it in connection with their silo scheme - I regret that the Government of Western Australia has not followed the example of New South Wales in building State silos. The Commonwealth, in advancing money to a State Government, would be' practically advancing it to a section of its own taxpayers. There might be some reason for lending money for such a purpose to a State Government or a Government-controlled Commission, but in proposing to lend money to private enterprise in this way, we are creating an unwise precedent. I think I have shown that there are some anomaliesi n this measure, and I trust that we shall include in the - agreement provision for greater security. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ih Committee : Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to. Schedule 4. The company shall he formed ;under and be subject to the following conditions:(e) The Memorandum and Articles of Association and .every amendment thereof shall be subject to the approval of the Commonwealth, and shall provide (inter alia) (7) that any net profits in excess of the said eight per centum and available for distribution shall be distributed to shareholders on a co-operative basis according to the quantity of grain delivered 'by each shareholder to. the' company;",69
309,Mr CHAELTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Hunter ) [10.30] - X move That the word "" shareholders,"" in paragraph 7 of clause 4, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" suppliers."" If the amendment is agreed to, the paragraph will then read that all profits above 8 per cent, shall be - distributed to the suppliers on a co-operative basis according to the quantity of grain delivered by each to the company. All men who contribute grain to the scheme will be contributing also to the profits, and having provided that 8 per cent, shall be paid to the shareholders on the capital invested, it is fair to say that all profits in excess of that interest shall be distributed amongst all suppliers. Eight per cent, is a fair return on the capital invested. The honourable member for  handling would mean a saving of 4d. per bushel - The greater the number of suppliers of groin the greater will be the profit, and it is f a ir that they should all' participate. If the clause is not amended as suggested the shareholders, besides getting 8 per cent on their capital, will divide amongst them, on a co-operative basis, all profits in excess of 8 per cent., * and . nobody else will derive any' benefit other than by the more economieal handling of the grain. Perhaps within the next ten years there will be hundreds, of . new farmers in Western Australia, who may not be in a position to become shareholders in this company, and although they may place large quantities of wheat in the scheme, and thus help to create the profits, they will have no share in them.",69
310,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,Has the honourable member known his suggestion to be adopted by any co-operative society ?,70
311,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The co-operative societies do share their profits with nonshareholders, but whereas the shareholder may receive 2s. or 2s. fid. in the f l , the non-shareholder will receive only about Is. In this scheme, if the profits were equivalent to 15 per cent, on the capital invested the shareholders would really get the whole of them.  cent, on the capital invested, and the remaining 7 per cent, would be distributed on a co-operative basis.",70
312,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"The shareholders are to be guaranteed 8 per cent., which will be 2 per cent, more than the interest they will be paying to the Commonwealth, and if they agree to share any profits in excess of that rate with all who contribute grain to the scheme, they will be offering an inducement to farmers to support the venture.",70

314,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Yes , ancl he will participate in all the profits.  person to become a shareholder by buying one share for £ 1 . All profits in excess of S per cent, will be distributed on a co-operative basis. A man who owns only one share may contribute 10,000 bushels, and on a comparative basis he will get a dividend, but another holding 10,000 shares and contributipg no wheat, will get no dividend. There is nothing to prevent any man from becoming a shareholder. .

317,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Shareholder s are to be guaranteed 8 per cent., which very good speculation, especially when the speculator is personally concerned in the business.",70
318,Mr JACKSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"That 8 per cent, is not guaranteed.",70
319,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"But . before anybody else can get anything, the shareholders must be paid their 8 per cent.",70
320,Mr JACKSON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,But in a bad season they will get nothing.,70
321,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Hear , hear; 8 per cent, is a fair rate.",70
322,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It is true that in a bad season the shareholder may get no return at all on the capital he has in vested, and I would be in favour of providing that his S per - cent, per annum, should be a first charge on the profits from the following season.  principle in counexion with the company is that one shareholder shall have one vote. The large shareholder will be no stronger than anybody else. Mr Charlton' - The honourable member's assurance that any farmer, by payment of £ 1 may become a shareholder;, removes my objection to the agreement, and I will not press the amendment. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.",70
323,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"East Sydney) [10.40] - I move That the following words be added to paraa man have graph 7 of clause 4:-""afte r the amount of the loan from the Commonwealth Government bus been redeemed."" I do not think any percentage should be paid to shareholders until such time as the Commonwealth advance shall have been wiped off. In the agreement, only 3 per cent, is allowed for the redemption of the Commonwealth loan. The item of depreciation alone will amount to more than 3 per cent., yet no provision is made for depreciation at all. The Government sliould have some further security. No business man would entertain such a projjosition as this.",70
324,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Thre e per cent, would liquidate the liability in about nineteen years.",70
325,Mr WEST,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"S t ill , the item of depreman's ciation has not been considered, and that will absorb more than 3 per cent. No property depreciates more rapidly than wheat silos, exposed as they are to all weathers, and liable to a great deal of The first duty of the people concerned in this measure should be to refund the capital is a of the Commonwealth, for that would be to their own interests. If the liability were wiped out in ten years the sharewages. holders would find themselves in an excelanxious lent position.

326,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Y a r r a ) [10.46] move That the following new clause be inserted:"" 26A. All persons employed in carrying or transporting wheat to the silos or to the ship shall be paid the standard rate of wage as by the Arbitration Court, or as agreed the farmers and the workers."" Practically the whole of the lumping will have been done away with by the introArbitration duction of the bulk handling system. Still there will be some amount of work, and I want to see that the workers are safeever, guarded. Farmers in the past have opposed factories legislation and arbitrado tion Acts.",71
327,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"But they have a farmers' Court now in ""Western Australia; all machinery for the protection of the workwhat ers is in active force.",71
328,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I can see that the Treasurer will not accept my proposition; nevertheless, I propose to endeavour to safeguard the rights of the lumpers. On the last occasion, when there was trouble in Western Australia, the farmers would not pay the workers the rate which had been fixed. Under the agreement arrived at the rate of pay was from 18s. to £ 1 , ployees. but the farmers refused to give more than 16s.  for the farmers at all. The Minister controlling the Wheat Pool was concerned i that.",71
329,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,ParramattaTreasurer) [10.50] - I cannot think the honourable member (Mr Tudor) is serious in making a proposal of this Why should'these lumpers in Western Australia have preferential treatment over lumpers elsewhere? Surely this is an Australian matter?,71
330,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Thes e are the only people we are lending £550,000 to.",71
331,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"What has that ago to do with the matter? The honourable memGovernment, ber can give the lumpers no advantage out of this £550,000, except such as they get from the Arbitration Court. There is already an Arbitration Court Western Australia, and all the necessary machinery for securing them proper Why is the honourable member so to duplicate matters in this way? this The lumpers already get what the Court gives them, and if a provision of this kind were placed in thirty Acts, it could give back. them no more. Besides, we cannot bind these people in Western Australia; u n t i l - I .the matter has been cleared up in the High Court, we do not know where we stand.",71
332,Mr TUDOR,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"I do not say it should be fixed the Federal Arbitratio n Court; I mean between any Oourt, or any agreement.",71
333,Sir JOSEPH COOK,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"It is idle in a Federal Bill to stipulate what a State Court shall do. As I say, the machinery is already there, and as this proposal can give these men nothing whatwhy encumber the Bill with it?",71
334,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Hunter ) [10.55] - ! not know why the Treasurer objects to this amendment; or, indeed, why the representatives object to it . It the merely lays down that men shall be paid is mutually agreed on, and, failin g an agreement, that the matter shall go to the Court, probably the State Arbitration Court. We seek to have this amendment in the measure because the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) states that in the past agreements of the kind have been repudiated. If the Commonwealth is finding £550,000 of money, it is only fair to safeguard the interests of the em Commonwealth as a money lender on cer",71
335,Mr CHARLTON,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"And the Commonn wealth is lending the money on very good conditions. Money cannot now be raised for less than 6 per cent., and it costs the that Commonwealth more to borrow the money for this purpose, because it has to pay the kind. cost of the flotation of the loans.",71
336,Mr RODGERS,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"We might ns well attach such a condition io the per capita grant. Mr Charlton"" - That is quite a different matter. It would have been better if the State Government had accepted the offer of the Commonwealth three years in the matter of the silos. The State however, let the matter slide u n t i l the farmers have been compelled to for m a company. That does not say much for the Government of Western Australia, in or for the Governments of any of the other States who did not take advantage of i h i offer of the Commonwealth. I am quite in sympathy with the scheme, and Amrtey, F. do not wifh to'delay the measure; but this Blakeley, A . association is getting money on security Brennan, which no other lender would accept. What Considine, M . P could we do with the silos if the whole Fenton, J . E. scheme failed? Then, again, the land is Gabb, J. M . to be rested in the company, and no lender will advance money unless the title is Mahon, H . vested in him; and we have to depend on MCDonald, C. the State Government as to whether we Maloney, Dr get the land.",71
337,Mr BEII,INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE AND,"Darwin) [10.58] - I fail to understand why this amendment is proRiley, posed. If I understand it aright, it MCGRATH, D. C. means that the wage shall be according to Moloney, Parker an award of the Arbitration Court, or according to an agreement entered into between the parties. Surely wages are always fixed on one or the other plan. Why not make a similar provision in regard to the per capita grant, War Service port adopted. Homes, or public works generally? It is the first time. I have known such an amendment suggested. I feel quite sure that neither the Leader of the Opposition nor the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) are looking for cheap advertisements, but, at the same time, they are putting honourable members on this side in a false position, in, as it were, forcing them to vote against giving employees a wage according to an Arbitration Court or a mutual agreement.
