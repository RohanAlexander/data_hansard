1,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"Can the Prime Minister officially inform the House whether the Imperial Government has declined to hold a Defence Conference early in 19l4, and, if so, when the Conference is likely to be held?",12
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I have no information on the subject. ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. POSTAL REGULATION.,12
3,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I wish to know from the Postmaster-General, in reference to a reply that he gave to a deputation of licensed victuallers that waited on him yesterday, to ask for the removal of the prohibition on the conveyance of alcoholic liquors by post, whether he will inform the House of his final decision when he arrives at it , and .whether he will give us an opportunity to discuss it?",12
4,Mr AGAR WYNNE,Unknown,I do not think that the honourable member need have any fear. I expressed my opinion pretty clearly yesterday. PANA MA EXPOSITION.,13
5,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to the statement of the Premier of Queensland, appearing in the Baity Standard, thatQueensland is going to be represented at the Panama Exposition. If we know the Commonwealth is not taking definite action, then the question is what steps we will take to have our own Statu represented . . . . the opening of the Panama Canal of supreme importance to Queensland.",13
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not in order in reading an article from a newspaper in asking a question.,13
7,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I make myself responsible for the statemeutParticularly wilh regard to the prospects of the development of trade, and we must be represented. Will the Prime Minister be good enough to let the Premier of Queensland know as early as possible what the intentions of the Commonwealth are in regard to the Panama Exposition?",13
8,Mr RILEY,Unknown,And all other Governments.,13
9,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I shall do what is asked. This is the first time have heard a strong expression of opinion favourable to the project from any of State Premiers. CAPTAIN ONSLOW.,13
10,Mr RILEY,Unknown,I wish to know from the Minister representing the Minister of Defence when the Government will give the House its reasons for dispensing with REMOVAL OF NAME S FBOM Captain Onslow's services on the Naval Board ?,13
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The moment that Ministers feel that they can tell the House all the facts concerning this matinquiries ter tliey will be glad to do so. I suggest to my honourable friends oppo-"" site that they do not do Captain Onslow any good by putting questions of this kind. The whole matter, is sub judice, and it is not kind to the officer in quesf tion to drag it forward before it has been dealt with by the proper departbeen mental tribunal.",13
12,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,It may be too then. [ 7 2 ] -2,13
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"There has been a great deal more hubbub about Captain Onslow's suspension than there was about the discharge by the last Government of Captain Hardy, another naval officer. The members of the last Government have not yet given the world or Australia a word of explanation in regard to that action. Why should there be this difference between the treatment of the two cases?",13
14,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Is the Prime M in ister aware of the condition of affairs in connection with the Naval Board ? Is it true, as alleged, that trouble has arisen I regard out of the jealousy between the British members of the Board and the Australian members ? Will the honourable gentleman endeavour to discover if this trouble has not arisen through the Secretary working in conjunction with the President of the Board to the detriment of the officer who has been suspended?",13
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I must decline to answer these questions in the form in which they are put. The whole matter is being sifted to the bottom, and Captain Onslow and every other member of the Board will receive the fullest justice and fair play.",13
16,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,At whose hands?,13
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I admit-it is as well to say this-that the condition of that I affairs at the Naval Board has not been satisfactory for a long time past, but the things have only now come to a head. I hope that the result will be a better Board and a better state of affairs in every way. ELECTOR AL ADMINISTRATION . ROLLSDUMMY ELECTOBAL CABDS.",13
18,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs if he will cause to be made regarding the notices May seut out from Colac concerning objections to certain names on the Corangamite roll. I understand that one, Michael Bourke, of Swanport, Corangamite, who has resided on his farm continuously for about if t y years, and his two daughters, have received notice that their enrolment has objected to on the ground that they do not possess residence qualification, and late it is said that the objection is only initialed by the Commonwealth Registrar. Will the honourable gentleman have in quiries made into that matter? also ascertain the number of notices of objections sent out in Korumburra, and the number of objections that were found to be proper?",13
19,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I shall have an inquiry made into these matters. The question raised by the righ t honourable member last night is now being inquired into by the Chief Electoral Officer, and I hope to be able to give him full information shortly.",14
20,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Will the honourable member cause inquiry to be made about the number of notices of objections sent out in Korumburra?,14
21,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Yes . Of course, in the best regulated electoral office mistakes will happen. It is by no means a new thing for persons who have long resided in a district to be informed that objection has been taken to their enrolment. This sort of thing has been occurring for years, there have even been cases in which the names of such persons have been removed from the rolls without notice having beeu received.",14
22,Mr FENTON,Unknown,That shows that preliminary inquiries are not made.,14
23,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It shows that there is nothing very novel in what has been complained of.  thing for the Department to receive objections wholesale.,14
24,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I shall have the in quiries asked for by the Leader of the Opposition made by the Chief Electoral Officer.,14
25,Mr KING OMALLEY,Unknown,"Will the honourable gentleman issue orders that names shall not be taken off the roll unless there is sufficient evidence, and evidence of a character that would stand in a Court of law, to justify that course ?",14
26,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The Act and the regulations under it are administered by the Chief Electoral Officer, who is trusted by the present Administration to properly carry out his duties.  give a report on some of the matters that have been discussed here.",14
27,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The honourable member k'l.jws that that statement is absolutely without foundation.,14
28,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I wish to ask the honourable gentleman a question in reference to an answer given to a question raised by me on the adjournment, when I supplied newspaper authority for my statement that a registrar, had sent a comW ill he munication officially to a certain organized body, asking it to furnish objections to names on the roll which it thought ought to be objected to. I was not present when the Minister's reply was given, but on reading the report of the honourable gentleman's remarks I find that no reference was made to the main point, that the communication was reported to have been sent by a registrar to an organization, asking for its assistance. Will the honourable gentleman make further in quiry, and return to me the newspaper which I quoted ?",14
29,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The reply that I read was the report of the Chief Electoral Officer. I shall bring the honourable member's question under his notice, and ask him to supplement his report. The form under which these notices of objections are sent out has - not been altered since it was first drawn up on the 25th July, 1912.",14
30,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Yesterday I asEed the Honorary Minister what was the number of dummy cards in the electoral cabinets on election day, and he promised to get me the information.",14
31,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"The number of aummy cards in the Department on election day is not easily ascertainable, but shortly new after the election there were 18,281 dummy cards, that is, for the whole of Australia.",14
32,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I ask the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs if he will ascer-^ tain definitely whether any letter was* sent by a responsible registrar to a political or semi-political organization, asking its assistance in removing names from the roll. I gave him the newspaper cutting on which I founded my statement. lt purported to be a report from the organization, stating that a letter had been so received ?",14
33,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I do not know wliether any Registrar has so acted. If he has, he has done so in opposition to the spirit and letter of the express directions sent trusted to to the Commonwealth Electoral Officers of States by the Chief Electoral Officer.  orable gentleman have said that before?",14
34,Mr KELLY,Unknown,It has been said about four times.  has evaded giving that answer on every occasion.,14
35,Mr KELLY,Unknown,I have made the same statement at least four times in this House. I will ask the Chief Electoral Officer to make an inquiry as to whetlier any Registrar has acted in the manner that has been suggested.,14
36,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Does the Honorary M in ister think that his reply covered that point ?,15
37,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Personally , I thought that my answer was thoroughly satisfact o r y. I will have the matter brought under the notice of the Chief Electoral - Officer, and I will ask him to provide the right honourable gentleman with an early reply. SMALL - P OX INSYDNEY .",15
38,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"Is it a fact that the - Government is willing, if approached by a petition of business'men in Melbourne, to withdraw the proclamation that has - quarantined Sydney and the metropolitan area because of the outbreak of smallof pox there?",15
39,Mr GROOM,Unknown,It is not a fact.,15
40,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,"I desire to ask Minister of Trade and Customs whether the quarantine authorities of the Comshall monwealth have asked the authorities New South Wales to isolate and segregate the patients who are suffering from small-pox in that State, and also the contacts, and if so, has any reply been received as to their intentions in that regard ?",15
41,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I have stated several Imperial times in this House that the method of suppressing disease within a State is United Kingdom? entirely a matter of State jurisdiction. The Commonwealth has no power tate what steps a State shall take to suppress disease, but the Commonwealth by accepts full responsibility for the way in which it exercises its own powers. soon as the outbreak of small-pox occurred in New South Wales, Federal and State authorities co-operated with a common end in view. The Commonwealth handed over to the State authorities the whole quarantine station, and agreed to place it at their disposal f treatment of .patients.",15
42,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,Who declared area ?,15
43,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"To regulate Intersons, state traffic it was necessary for the Commonwealth to declare a certain disships of war? trict a quarantined area in which smallpox existed. A regulation was then framed, requiring all persons coming from that area to other States to estab: lish proof of their successful vaccination.",15
44,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,The quarantined area-is the cause of the whole trouble.,15
45,Mr GROOM,Unknown,It is the area which had to be declared under the law. MASTER PRINTERS' ASSOCIATION.,15
46,Mr FENTON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Attorney-General whether he has yet received the promised statement, of their case from the Master Printers' Association, and, if so, will he lay it on the Library table? Mr W . H , IRVINE - T h r e e days ago I received the letter to which the honourable membei' refers. I have not read it , but I have placed it in the hands the proper authority-tb e Crown Solicitor-to investigate the facts and report to me upon it . Until I receive that report I do not think it, would be the advisable to lay the document on the table of the Library, but probably 1 be prepared to take that course in as soon as it is returned to me.

SOCIAL INSURANCE.",16
51,Mr HIGGS,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"the Treasurer, upon noticeWith reference to his statement in Hansard as follows :- "" There is no doubt that this maternity allowance cannot continue to be paid for very long, and that a system of social insurance must soon take its place ""1. When does the Treasurer propose to introduce a scheme of social insurance? 2. Will the social insurance scheme be compulsory, and under what section in the Commonwealth Constitution is power given to make any person contribute to such a scheme? 3. Does the Government propose to pass a law to submit to referendum the amendment of the Constitution providing for power to establish a contributory system of social insurance?",16
52,Mr GLYNN,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. The preparation of a scheme involves a great deal of research, inquiry, and consideration, and is being pursued with due expedition. The date cannot at present be stated. 2. Whether the scheme will be compulsory is necessarily one of the matters under consideration. It is not thought desirable for Ministers to express opinions on legal questions or on a question that, while the scheme is not complete, would be hypothetical. 3. Such submission must depend on whether it is deemed to be necessary or not. At the present stage, there is nothing to show that such submission will be imperative. HENDERSON NAVAL BASE.",16
53,Mr BUBCHELL,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"the Prime Minister, upon noticeWith reference to the following statement of the Prime Minister on 24th September, when speaking of the visit of Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice, "" So far as I recollect, he wants a fee of 4,700 guineas, which will include the work of his own staff in preparing plans and reports after Ms return home. It will include everything, from start to finish""-Will he, in view of the strategical importance of the Henderson Naval Base, as mentioned in Admiral Henderson's Report, arrange for a special report on this Base to be prepared by Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice prior to that gentleman's return to England?",16
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMPERIAL DEFENCE,"My reference to the work to be done by Sir Maurice L t d . , Fitzmaurice, after his return, was with respect to the general establishments. We hope to get his opinion on the site before his return. NA RAILWAY : SUPPLY OF KARR I SLEEPERS.",16

57,Sir JOHN FORREST,COMMODATION AT QUARANTINE,"Swan-Trea surer) [10.55] - Honourable members will notice that the amount on these Estimates for Additions, New Works, and Buildings is £3,268,569, but reference to the Budget will show that the total amount of the proposed expenditure under this heading is £3,971,001. There is, however, in the Trust Fund an amount available for the Fleet of £702,432, which has to be deducted, and consequently honourable members are now asked to vote' only £3,268,569. Reference to page 232 of the Estimates will show how this sum is made up. There is £300,000 to be paid for the Fleet, £1,122,768 for works under the Department of Home Affairs, a further amount of £1,079,700 under the Postmaster-General's Department, £4,860 under the Treasurer's £692,311 under the Defence Department, and £68,930 under the Department of External Affairs. I have' abstracted the amounts which the Government ask Parliament to vote under the heads of Departments, because the Department of Home Affairs, for example, does work for the Defence, Postal, and other Departments. I find that for the Postmaster-General's Department the estimated expenditure for the current year is £1,350,113, as against an estimated expenditure for last year of £1,152,275, and an actual expenditure of £1,086,615. The estimated expenditure for the Defence Department, not including Fleet, for the current financial year, is £1,234,051, as against an estimated expenditure last year of £1,261,842, and an actual expenditure of £1,129,072. NA For the construction of the Fleet this year we are asking for a vote of OF COM£300,000, as against an estimated aud actual expenditure last year of £110,000. Honourable members will understand that the balance of the expenditure for last STATION : year, and also the balance of the proposed expenditure for this year, comes out of the Trust Fund. Under the Department of NA Trade and Customs we are asking for an appropriation this year of £57,752, as against an estimated expenditure last year of £76,083, and an actual expenSTA- diture of £51,060. Under the Department of Home Affairs the estimated expenditure for the current financial year is £244,377, as against an estimated expenditure last year of £99,622, and an actual expenditure of £151,460. Under the Department of External Affairs the estimated expenditure for this year is set down at £68,930, as against an estimated expenditure of £62,120 last year, and an actual expenditure of £62,619. For the Department of the Treasury, the estimate for this year for new works and buildings is £13,346. The estimate last year was £27,150, while the actual expenditure was £37,448. The totals, therefore are - Estimate for this year, £3,268,569; estimate for last year, £2,789,092, and the actual expenditure last year, £2,628,274. In regard to the Postal Department, honourable members will see in the report of my Budget speech and also in the Budget-papers that the whole expenditure from all sources this year is estimated at £7,150,275, as against £6,284,053 for 1912-13, so that Department, we propose to spend £866,222 more than was spent last year. The Post Office expenditure provided for on these Estimates is £1,350,113. We also propose to spend £595,000 from loan funds and the balance of the Special Works Account, available from last year, £15,897. This makes a total expenditure this year on the Post Office from all sources of £1,961,010, as against £1,500,309 for 1912-13, and £1,013,524 for 1911-12. All this information is given on page 1788 of Hansard. We are providing for telegraphs, telephones, and wireless this year, £1,079,700, as against £835,302 provided last year, so that we propose to spend the this year, under the heading of telegraphs, telephones, and wireless, £244,398 more than was spent last year. For post-office buildings, wireless stations, &c, we proStates pose to spend £320,413, as against an actual expenditure, last year of £251,313. In other words, we propose to expend intention, .££9,100 more than was spent last year. It is not necessary to say any more at - the present moment with regard to these Estimates. Ministers controlling the various departments will be Very glad to gi*e all information to honourable members as we .deal with the items. Already, in my Budget, I have dealt with most of these matters under the heading of "" Defence Department,"" "" Post Office Department,"" and "" General Expenditure.""",17
58,The CHAIRMAN,RANGES,"On this portion of the Estimates, as in regard to others, a general discussion is permissible on the fiisst item. Necessarily, afterwards, the debate will be confined to the particular items und'er discussion.",18
59,Mr FISHER,RANGES,Wide Bay) [11.5] - I shall take full advantage of the statement just made that we can discuss any matter - in a general sense in the course of the discussion on the first item. Last night the Prime Minister made a definite and distinct statement that in dealing with the amendment of the Braddon section of the Constitution - the previous Government dealt with the States differently from what the Fusion Government proposed in their agreement with the States. . Sir JOHN FOBBEST - I do not think he said that. He said you curtailed by six - months the period of ten years in the .Constitution.  - the States of six months' payment.,18
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,RANGES,That is only a way of putting it .,18
61,Mr FISHER,RANGES,I say we did not.,18
62,Sir JOHN FORREST,RANGES,"""You certainly curtailed the operation of the section by six months.",18
63,Mr FISHER,RANGES,"We did not. The agreement the Fusion Government made with the States was to come into operation ou the 1st July, 1910, if carried by the referendum. It was not carried by the referendum., a-nd, therefore, the agreement could not be made applicable in :a constitutional sense in the way that the then Government and the States wished it to be. Constitutional technicalities prevented it",18
64,Sir JOHN FORREST,RANGES,"That is correct. Mr FISHER,-The purport or intention of the financial agreement with the was to bring it into operation on the 1st July, and when we succeeded the Fusion Government we carried out that",18
65,Sir JOHN FORREST,RANGES,"The States did not agree to your proposal, and were not consulted by you.",18
66,Mr FISHER,RANGES,"The State Premiers agreed to the arrangement with the Commonwealth, but the people of the States would not put it into the Constitution in the form desired. The agreement that was entered into was to be brought into operation on the 1st July, 1910.",18
67,The CHAIRMAN,RANGES,"The honourable member for Wide Bay is taking a rather wide interpretation of a general debate on this portion of the Estimates. The debate will necessarily need to have relation to additions, new 'works, buildings, &c. I can hardly allow a debate to be re-opened practically on the whole question of the Budget.",18
68,Mr FISHER,RANGES,"I shall not have the slightest difficulty in connecting my remarks with new works and buildings. If it is strictly ruled that they are outside the scope of this debate, I am afraid debate will be restricted. I wished to take the earliest opportunity of saying 'that the Prinie Minister's statement in this regard was altogether wrong and misleading. The Fisher Government put into an Act the arrangement to return 25s. per head to the States and the other conditions imposed by the agreement entered into by the previous Government and the State Premiers for a period of ten years, commencing from the 1st July, 1910. TJnder the Constitution it .was 1 impossible for us to make the period apply from the 1st January, 1910. It was impossible for us to pay money to the States during the first half of the year, and therefore we had to restrict the payment during the first half of the year - and demand it in the second half of the year. Sir JOHN FORREST.'-What was the practical effect of that?",18
69,Mr FISHER,RANGES,The same as if the agreement entered into had been carried into effect. - Sir .JOHN FORREST - But it meant a six months' curtailment.,18
70,Mr FISHER,RANGES,"No ; we were restricted by a constitutional limitation to make tke amendment apply immediately on the date on which the Fusion Government intended to make it apply, but we did not alter the date nor did we withhold a shilling from the States with this exception : The Fusion Government's agreement provided for the payment of a sum of £600,000 into the Commonwealth revenue from the 1st January, 1910, to make up the Commonwealth deficiency, but through the defeat of the Financial Agreement at the referendum the right honourable gentleman's Government were not able to get the £600,000, and our Government that followed had to pass an Act to enable us to get £400,000 odd instead of the £600,000 that had been agreed upon by the Fusion Government and the State Premiers. Sir JOHN FORREST:-We calculated the deficiency would be £600,000.",18
71,Mr FISHER,RANGES,"That is so, but the actual deficiency was less than you anticipated, and we made a claim for it . We called upon the States to pay this inoney to the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister is absolutely wrong, and I feel sure that he does not wilfully attempt to mislead the public in this important matter. The States were in exactly the same position on this question as if the people had carried the referendum, with the exception that the Financial Agreement was not made a permanent provision of the Constitution. I hope these remarks will prevent the Prime Minister unconsciously doing his reputation an injustice by again referring to something that is only too plain, and in his reference committing a gross error and misrepresentation of the facts.  wish to protest against the item of the other States. £285,000 for the Capital site. I do this for the specific purpose of exposing the methods of gentlemen opposite. In South Australia during the election paign, and for a long time previously, the Fusionists were loud in their declamation of Mr. of the Labour Government for spending part of state millions on the Capital site. They dewhich the nounced the proposed expenditure hip condemned,Board But now we find that and thigh. present Government are providing for double the expenditure that was voted this purpose by the Labour Government.",19
72,Mr KELLY,RANGES,Does the Leader of the Opposition 'Object to that?  speak with one voice in one State aud with another voice in another State.,19
73,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"They said the same in Victoria.  in New South Wales was that there waa not enough money spent on the Capital site, but gentlemen belonging to the same party when they came into my district in South Australia were loud in their denunciations of the gross extravagance of the Labour party in connection with the site, while, on the first opportunity they get, they double the expenditure.",19
74,Mr BODCERS,RANGES,"We had a christening ceremony, you know.",19
75,Mr RILEY,RANGES,I can assure you that the Minister has never denounced it in our State. ,19
76,Mr BILEY,RANGES,He wanted more money spent there.  ber can see my point surely.,19
77,Mr RILEY,RANGES,"Yes .  peals to the public it ought to be honest enough to have one voice on one question, and not resort to such a low method of politics as that I have indicated. It should not pretend in one State to be opposed to the expenditure on the Capital site and accuse the Government of spending hundreds of thousands of pounds more than they actually spent, while saying in other States that there was not enough money being spent there. Here we have the evidence. Let me say plainly and straight out that the expenditure proposed in these Estimates is a New South They have robbed",19
78,Mr KELLY,RANGES,What ! ,19
79,Mr KELLY,RANGES,"Does the Leader of the camOpposition agree with that remark? POYNTON - Look at the records the of the post-offices. In one my electorate there is a building of Health has actually the that we must use that Department yet the insist place. They cannot find money to spend there, but they to can double the expenditure on the Capital site. If you go right through the Estimates you will find evidence of that sort of thing. I suppose that there have been quite a number of applications made for post-offices in places where their erection is justified, but we cannot get money made available for the purpose. This year the huge expenditure is to be increased. Where is all the money going to? It is going chiefly to New South Wales.",19
80,Mr RILEY,RANGES,To be spent on Federal territory.  is not the whole of the Commonwealth.,20
81,Mr RILEY,RANGES,The money is to be spent ou Commonwealth territory.  ber is taking this criticism personally.,20
82,Mr RILEY,RANGES,"The Government are spending the money on Commonwealth territory, not on the land of New South Wales.  are proposing to spend £285,000 on Federal territory. What do they propose to expend on defence and other works ? I asked the Honorary Minister the other day whether the Government intended to go on with the construction of the Naval Base at Port Lincoln. He replied that nothing is to be done tliere, but the Government can find money to spend on Naval Bases in other parts of the Commonwealth.",20
83,Mr KELLY,RANGES,"Of course, because they are advised that those works are more urgent and necessary.  Government will not take the advice of the same officer. Take the works in Western Australia, for instance. When he did advise the Government to go on with the works, they did not take his counsel; they only took the advice which suited themselves. When we reach the item I shall certainly move for a reduction of the amount. I want to brand the hypocrisy of the party in speaking with one voice in one State and saying something else in another State. The Fusionists ' accused the Fisher Government of having spent millions. The paid organizers for the Senate candidates who went through my electorate said that we were spending millions, and indulging in an extravagant waste of money on the Capital site.",20
84,Mr RILEY,RANGES,That is how they came he defeated. The people did not believe them.  experience' I have never come across a party who were so outrageous in their statements of what the other party were doing. We cannot get them to acknowledge the fact; we cannot pin them down to anything.,20
85,Mr KELLY,RANGES,Do you know that your own colleagues in New South Wales claimed that the Labour party was the only party who could be trusted to spend money on the Capital site?,20
86,Mr RILEY,RANGES,"That is r i g h t ; they did it well, too, but they did not do enough.  was a party in power for a number of years who did nothing with the Capital site. When honourable gentlemen opposite go to the country and say that the Labour Government spent millions there, though the actual fact is that they spent only £137,000, they - are playing the game pretty low.  the matter.  when the works contained in these Estimates are to be carried out. Some works have been approved of for years, and yet in regard to them, we find the ordinary re-votes. Quite a number of the items on these Estimates are re-votes.",20
87,Sir JOHN FORREST,RANGES,"You r Government did not spend the money.  of the Government, but of the Departments. We passed the Estimates early last year to enable the Departments to spend the money. That is the object in intercepting the debate on the Budget speech. The same thing will occur next year. We shall find on the Estimates thousands-hundred s of thousands-of re-votes again.",20
88,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"This is being done in view of the forthcoming election.  the item I have been discussing, I shall move a reduction, as a protest against the slanderous, lying statements which the Fusionists made during the last'elections in South Australia.",20
89,Mr BURCHELL,RANGES,"Fremantle) [11.20]. - I wish to ask one or two questions. Whether my sight is defective or not I do not know, but in these Estimates I cannot find certain items which I exto pected to see there, nor have I heard i u regard to the Loan Bill that any provision is made there for the Flinders or the Henderson Naval Base. Although I ara not vitally concerned in the Flinders Naval Base, still, on the broad lines of defence, I should like to know from the Treasurer where the expected expenditure is provided for on the Estimates or in the Budget-papers. On page 265 of the Estimates for additions to new works and naval works under the control of the Department of Defence I see an item of £98,000 for naval works, including labour and material, and an item of £112,000 for machinery and plant. Whether they are the two items which will cover the expenditure on Naval Bases or not I do not know.",20
90,Sir JOHN FORREST,RANGES,"Yes , they are.",21
91,Mr BUBCHELL,RANGES,"In £200,000 was appropriated, £172,000 was expended, and in these Estimates we are asked to vote £210,000. That sum, I take*-' it , will cover not .only the two Naval Bases I have mentioned, bu t also other naval works. I should like to get from the Treasurer or the Minister representing the Minister of Defence a definite statement as to the estimated expenditure on those Naval Bases. If I remember rightly, when the Estimates were under discussion last year, according to Hansard a definite statement was made regarding the amount to be expended on the different Naval Bases, and I think that similar information ought to be furnished on this occasion. There is another matter regarding which I am seeking information from a purely parochial stand-point. On page 257 of these Estimates provision is made for the expenditure of £5,392 on "" wireless telegraph station, Fremantle."" wish to know whether that is an addition to the Applecross wireless station, or whether any further wireless station is to be erected in the Fremantle division? If an addition to the Applecross wireless station is proposed, I would like to know what work is to be undertaken there ?",21
92,Sir JOHN FORREST,RANGES,When we get to the item you can ask for information.,21
93,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,And if you do not hapas pen to be here the opportunity w i l This procedure is not by any means,21
94,Mr BUBCHELL,RANGES,"If I am off track in any way I shall be pleased informed, because this is the first tunity I have had of discussing any Estithat mates.",21
95,Mr CHARLTON,RANGES,"Hunter) [11.25] I have risen to draw attention to the necessity for more works being carried by the Post and Telegraph Department i country districts. The Minister has just informed us that the Department is going to expend something like £244,000 more this year. During the time. I have been a member of the House I have been accustomed to hear a statement of that kind, but somehow or other the money does not happen to get expended in the country districts. The practice has been to concentrate expenditure on the big capitals and suburbs and overlook altogether the country districts. I venture to assert-and I leave it to honourable mem-, bers to say whether the assertion is correct or not-that in the country dis1912-13 tricts a large number of works are apand proved of, some of them for two or three years, and the statement is made by the Department that owing to the very many works which are approved of it is i m possible to carry out a particular work, and it has to remain in abeyance. That is playing with country people. The time has arrived when the Government should take a stand and say that so fair as the money will go the works which are approved of in the country districts shall be carried out at the earliest possible moment.",21
96,Mr LIVINGSTON,RANGES,You cannot blame the present Government.,21
97,Mr CHARLTON,RANGES,"I blame all Governments. I spoke of my expeiience in the House, and that of course applies to the Government I supported. The day has arrived when the Government should give instructions that country facilities in the way of telephone and telegraph lines should be provided as early as I possible. It is all very well for the House to vote large sums for that purpose, but if the bulk of the money is expended in thickly congested areas, that is an injustice to the people who are living in-the more scattered and remote parts of the Commonwealth. Who are the people that mostly require telephonic facilities? I submit that it is the country people. We should bring the country residents in close touch as possible with big coml go. mercial centres, and with medical men. new. There are very few electorates indeed the which have not good ground to complain to be in that regard. I heard the honourable oppormember for Gwydir say on one occasion he had fixed up everything all right for his electorate. He is a very fortu nate man indeed if he has done so. I know that other honourable members have out been striving; f a long time to get absoo r n . lutely necessary works-work s which were approved of-carrie d out, and the only answer they can get from the Department is, "" Yes ; this work will be carried out, but it must stand over and wait its turn , "" whilst the Department can employ labour in abundance in the big cities II t is not a question of being able .to get labour. I anticipate that the Department will not spend the votes which are now being asked for.",21
98,Mr FENTON,RANGES,On these Estimates there are thousands of pounds of re-votes.,22
99,Mr CHARLTON,RANGES,"Exactly ; every year that has been my complaint. If it is a question of getting labour and material, that is available; there is no difficulty in getting labour. It is only a question of organizing the Department and seeing that a work is carried out. What we require is a Government with a back-bone- a Government who will give instructions that works approved of shall be carried out in a reasonable time, aiid not allow honourable members to be put off, time after time, by the Department on the ground that a work will have to wait its turn. I know that it has been the exjjerience of other honourable members as well as myself, that, after considerable agitation, a particular line is approved of provided that the persons concerned would contribute a certain percentage of the estimated loss. The people at once set out to raise the money. They send it along to the Department and it lies dormant at the post office, or ail intimation is sent, *' Do not send the money along; we will give you the line and advise you when we require the money."" If we vote money for the purpose of giving better facilities to country people, we ought to be genuine in regard to the action which is to be taken. We should not vote money year after year with a view of doing certain things, knowing well it will not be expended, but we should make it obligatory on the Departments to spend the That is my complaint in regard to the treatment of country districts. While I admit that our expenditure must continue to expand, I think it is necessary for us to exercise great care in connection with it. For the first time we find that i proposed by this Government to provide £170,000 for the purchase of land for postal and telegraphic purposes]' and £425,000 for the construction of conduits and the laying of wires underground, or a total of £595,000, out of borrowed? money. When I say that I do not approve of borrowing for these purposes, I may be to ld that a precedent was set by the late Government in connection with the purchase of the post-office site at Perth. In this case, however, we find"" that it is proposed to borrow a large sum for such a work as the undergrounding of wires. That is a work which you cannot realise upon, and I am opposed toborrowing for such a purpose. These wires after a certain time will have toand be renewed, and once we initiate the system we shall go on borrowing for such works for all time. The Postal Department should be allowed to stand on itsown footing; it should be worked by itself, and should provide for its ownexpenditure. The Government, however, instead of dealing with it in a business like way, are introducing a system of borrowing for postal works, and the in terest on the money raised, instead of being debited to the Department itself, will be a charge on the Federal revenue,, and will have to be borne by the taxpayers generally. A system of this kind: once initiated will grow. The Department should pay interest on money borrowed for postal undertakings. Theresidents of big centres of population will receive the chief benefit from this expenditure, whilst the poorman in the country will have to payinterest on the borrowed money. A block of land is rarely purchased for postal' purposes in country districts. Land required for such a purpose is generally acquired from the State, and where it is necessary to purchase a block in a. country district the price is so low a» to be hardly worth mentioning. In almost any part of the country a blockcan be obtained for a few pounds. That being so, this £170,000 will be utilized' that for the most part in buying valuableproperty in big centres, while the interest, will be charged against the general money. revenue. Thus taxpayers in the countrywho will not get any benefit from thisexpenditure will be called upon to assist in paying the interest bill . The positionis the same in regard to the proposal toborrow £425,000 to provide for thet is laying of conduits and underground wires. Country districts will not benefit to theextent of a penny. The Government areinitiating in connection with the Postal' Department a system which we shall liver to regret. They are proposing to borrow in a wholesale fashion to carry out works for which provision should be made out of revenue.",22
100,Sir JOHN FORREST,RANGES,"The member is prepared, I suppose, to do without these works?",23
101,Mr CHARLTON,RANGES,"I am prepared to see the Department placed on a sound footing, and conducted as a business concern. I am altogether opposed to the introduction of a borrowing system, which will be a charge against the whole community, in order to carry out works that will be of no benefit whatever to tliose residing in ' sparsely-populated country districts. Residents of rural districts do not get a fair deal from any Government. Everything is centralized. favourable to the piling up of a huge public debt merely-.jto provide for certain works in the metropolitan districts. I shall not say that these works are unnecessary. On the contrary, I admit that they are. But I object to the borrowing of money for what is really a disappearing quantity-for something which we cannot realise upon, for which you have nothing to show-and the debitingof the taxpayers generally with that indebtedness. We cannot afford to allow this huge expenditure to go on year after year, while nothing is being done for the country districts. Those who have to pay the interest bill should reap some advantage. If this system is to go on, then I tliink the Department should be classified, and that we should declare that the people in large centres of population, who reap the benefit of all this expenditure, shall pay something more than country residents who derive none. This Parliament seems to lose sight of the country districts altogether. An expenditure of £2,000 in a rural division is a wonderful thing, whereas the expenditure of £100,000 in a city is regarded as a mere bagatelle. Ever since my return to this House I have been endeavouring in vain to secure the building of post-offices in thicklypopulated towns in my electorate. wpuld not cost more than £80 0 or £1,00 0 to build, yet I cannot get them.",23
102,Mr FALKINER,RANGES,How did the honourable member for Gwydir manage to do so well ?,23
103,Mr CHARLTON,RANGES,He is a very fortunate man. I think that before long the honourable member for Biverina wiil come to the conclusion that in this respect he is in the same boat as T am.,23
104,Mr FALKINER,RANGES,I have already.,23
105,Mr EODGERS,RANGES,There is material for a great country party here.,23
106,Mr CHARLTON,RANGES,"I agree with the honourable honourable member, that if the representatives of the country districts were organized we should probably obtain something like justice for our constituents. Money is provided on the Estimates for certain country works of which the responsible officials have approved, and yet, at the end of the financial year, we find that it has not been expended.",23
107,Mr RODGERS,RANGES,Artificia l surpluses are created in that way.,23
108,Mr CHARLTON,RANGES,"Ye s j I quite believe that every Treasurer likes to save a few hundred thousand pounds on his. I am not Estimates, and I think that that will be found to be the position of the present Treasurer at the end of the year. A Treasurer comes forward and says, "" Here you are! I am going to spend £300,000 more than my predecessors did . "" But the trouble is that, although the money is provided it is not spent. The country districts can reap no benefit from the Commonwealth services except in the matter of improved postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities, and when they cannot obtain the required facilities, although the officials themselves approve of them, they have just cause of complaint. An inspector reports in favour of a telephone line, saying that he believes it will pay, ancl that local residents, instead of having to travel 20 miles for a doctor, should be able to ring up one. But even after favourable reports have been received we find ourselves no further forward.",23
109,Mr FALKINER,RANGES,That is because they are putting in a new staircase in the Treasury building.,23
110,Mr CHARLTON,RANGES,"The honourable member is beginning already to ' notice the small things. He will see a great deal more when he has been here a year or two. I want the Postmaster-General, and the Treasurer, who, after all, has most to do with the finances, to realise that it They should not be with them a question of the city all the time-that this Parliament does not exist for the cities only, and that the country districts support the cities.",23
111,Mr RILEY,RANGES,"Nonsens e 1 Mr Charlton/ - The honourable member is one of those who claim to take a broad national view of things, but he is never able to see beyond the boundaries of his own electorate. I appeal to the Ministr y to do justice to the country districts, and not to hang up work, after the necessary money has been voted, on the plea that the necessary labour or material cannot be obtained. The Government should issue instructions that they expect money provided for these works to be expended with in the nnancial year, and that the necessary arrangements, particularly in the case of country undertakings, must be made to enable that to be done. Unless such an order °is given we shall find next year that we are still face to face with the position that confronts us today. A f t e r a Treasurer has carefully considered his Estimates, applied the pruning knife, and submitted them to Parliament, the works for which they provide should be carried out at once. We should take care that the money voted is actually expended within the financial year in carrying out the works for which it is intended. Unless that be done the country districts will continue to suffer in justice. I am sure that if country representatives would only band together they would make the Government feel the weight of their influence, and that we should get more for the rural districts than we have yet been able to secure.",23
112,Mr AHERN,RANGES,"Indi) [11.45] - I agree with what the honourable member for money Hunter has said. The matters to which he referred are of considerable importranges ance to country districts. Although i proposed to expend £11,924 on rifle I ranges in Victoria during the current financial year, of that amount £4,221 a re-vote, so that the new appropriation is. only £ 7 , 7 0 3. Last year the appropriaministration tion was £16,195 and only £6,994, or less than one-half, was expended. Department of Home Affairs, in conjuncHunter. tion with the Defence Department, should be capable of estimating what can be spent on these works in any year.",24
113,Mr ROBERTS,RANGES,It is the Department of Home Affairs that is to blame; the Department of Defence has not sufficient control.,24
114,Mr AHERN,RANGES,"It is certainly extraof the delay. ordinary that, when over £16,000 has been voted, less than £7,000 should be - Mr KELLY spent. Money should not be appropriated except for necessary works, and such energy. works should be carried out as soon as possible.",24
115,Mr RILEY,RANGES,The Departments that they cannot get the material.,24
116,Mr AHERN,RANGES,"That is what we heard yesterday in connection with the * administration of the Department of the Postmaster-General. Surely there is plenty of labour obtainable. We hear of men waiting for employment. Why cannot their services be used for these works? As to getting material, if the officers are business men they should look ahead more than a month or two. I have been a member of this House for only a few months, but my experience in connection with public works has appalled me. It was previously my belief that matters that were brought forward for consideration were dealt with in a prompt and business-like way. - The Government in its policy memorandum said that it would encourage the rifle clubs of Australia. How better cafi°thkt be done than by providing the necessary rifle ranges. Without ranges, effective training in musketry is impossible. In my electorate, ranges that were applied for years ago have, not yet been provided. We get promises of inspection, and reports, but no real advance, is made. The most ordinary requests are deferred in a manner that is unaccountable to business men. Although the sum proposed to be voted this year is not as large as the appropriation of last year, I hope that the voted will be spent. Promptitude should be shown in determining what will be provided, and steps should t is then be taken at once to provide them. trust that ranges will be provided in all important centres to give proper is effect to our system of compulsory military training. Turning now to the adof the Department of the Postmaster-General, I again endorse what The was said by the honourable member for I u my short experience, I have brought forward between forty and fifty matters of importance to my constituency, many of them relating to telephone services, but practically no progress has been made in dealing with them, and the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs looks at me with astonishment when I complain - My astonishment is caused by the honourable member's frenzied",24
117,Mr AHERN,RANGES,"The position is unsatisfactory. Yesterday I interjected, say when the Prime Minister was speaking, "" What has become of the promise of the Postmaster-General to frame a specification for the construction of cheaper telephone lines?"" and was told that it was in course of preparation. It is ahout ten weeks since we were told that the specification would be prepared without delay, and an ordinary business man would prepare such a specification within twenty four hours. It is not such a stupendous task that work should be hung up in the country districts lor weeks and months awaiting its completion.",24
118,Mr RILEY,RANGES,On e specification should be good enough for nearly the whole of a State.,25
119,Mr AHERN,RANGES,"F o r nearly the whole of Australia. I interviewed an officer of the Department in regard to this matter, and told him that I hoped that provision would be^. made for the in viting of tenders from local residents for the construction of telephone lines. He looked at me in wonder, and asked, "" What would become of our staff? "" Is the construction of necessary telephone lines to be delayed until the staff wakes up ? If the necessary works were pushed ahead, there would be ample for the staff to do, and employment would be given to many others as well. I know of a case in which a deposit was made months ago by local residents who desire a telephone, and the promise was made that tenders would be called withqut delay. But they have not been called for. I understand now that the department is taking steps to have the line peg-marked, so that we are no further forward than we were two months ago. Another work, the making of some additions to a postofiice in my electorate, does not seem to progress at all. Week after week the only reply to inquiries is that the matter is receiving attention. The blame in this case must be attributed to the Department of Home Affairs, which, he claims, was presided over in such a business-like way by the honourable member for Darwin. hope that the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs will shake up that Department. If the last Minister shook it up, it has gone to sleep again. Perhaps the present Minister will do more, and take less credit to himself for what is done. A large number of country telephone lines should be put in hand, if for no other reason than tc make cross country connexions to relieve the strain on the main lines. In many cases messages have to be transmitted over a distance of 200 miles, in a roundabout manner, to pass between places not more than 30 or 40 miles apart. The erection of cross country lines would make this unnecessary, and would prevent the blocking of business which now often occurs. I ask the Government to see that matters are dealt with in a more business-like way, and to push on with the public works-particularly the telephone constructions that are needed-in the country districts.",25
120,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"Yarra) [ 1 1 . 5 8 ] - It seems to me a pity that the discussion on these Estimates cannot be confined to one subject at a time. We might have one debate on country telephones, for in stance, and another on the Federal Capital expenditure, which is a burning question.",25
121,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RANGES,The last Government burned money at the Federal Capital.,25
122,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"We were denounced for proposing last year an expenditure of £110,000.",25
123,Mr AHERN,RANGES,"But £137,000 was spent.",25
124,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,It was probably thought wiser to exceed the vote than to stop work that had been commenced. This Government proposes to expend more than twice as much on the Federal Capital this year.,25
125,Mr FLEMING,RANGES,Whether it is wise depends on the return we get for it .,25
126,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"I grant that. But what did we find in Victoria? The Women's National League denounced the Labour Government for proposing to spend £110,000 on the Federal Capital. I have here the Hansard report of the discussion which took place when this particular question was under consideration. I find that after Sir John Quick had spoken, Mr Wise, the ex-member for Gippsland, submitted an amendment to reduce the amount proposed to be exI pended on the Federal Capital by £50,000. The honourable member for Wimmera, in speaking to that amendment, saidIt is time that the Minister gave us a statement as to how far the expenditure of the last two years has carried us. Many electors throughout Australia fear that we are being committed to an expenditure of millions of pounds. Indeed, the Minister has hinted as much, and that this expenditure will take place, regardless of the need for important developmental works and other public expenditure. Very serious protests have been made against the expenditure on the Federal Capital by representative bodies throughout Victoria. I have received resolutions from a large number of municipal councils protesting against the way in which this expenditure is increasing.",25
127,Mr THOMAS,RANGES,Municipa l councils !,26
128,Mr SAMPSON,RANGES,"Thos e bodies may be regarded by Ministers as unimportant; but I look upon them as very important. public services of great importance, and represent the taxpayers, who pay the piper, and must be allowed to express their views. Mr Wise pointed out that he had met a prominent member of the People's party who.had told him that that party was opposed to the Federal Capital expenditure and that the Labour party was the only one which was in favour of it .",26
129,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,What did the orable member for Echuca say?,26
130,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,I do not forget the motion which he had on the business paper as a political placard.,26
131,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RANGES,He is like the honourable member. He is quite safe.,26
132,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"At any rate we have this in common that we have both been returned to this House in spite of the Age newspaper. At the same time, I do not think that the honourable member holds quite as safe a seat as I do. I do not forget the political placard that he had upon the business-paper of this House for no other purpose than to lend colour to his profession that he was opposed to expenditure upon the Federal Capital. Now, however, he is absolutely dumb. He has not a word of protest to utter against the proposal of the Government to more than double that expenditure. Last year, he paired in favour of an amendment by Mr Wise to reduce the expenditure on the Federal Capital from £110,000 to £60,000. I should like to know what his attitude will be today when the honourable member for Grey submits the amendment to reduce the amount which the Government propose to expend on this item. ",26
133,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"A f t e r Mr Wise had drawn attention to the fact that the People's party had carried resolutions condemning this expenditure, Dr Salmon denounced it - ",26
134,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RANGES,The Victoria put him out for doing it .,26
135,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"They put him out of Parliament because he was associated with the wrong political party. Under the redistribution scheme for Victoria, his electorate disappeared, and then he decided to contest a seat for the Senate which he had no chance of winning. The candidates who defeated him had the support of no newspapers, and yet they walloped him right out. . Despite the enormous advantage that he enjoyed of having the support of both morning They perform papers in this city, he did not get a place. He finished f if t h or sixth on the poll.",26

138,Mr WISE,RANGES,"He spent only .£44,000.",26
139,Dr CARTY SALMON,RANGES,"I am taking the Minister's own figures, and he now asks for a revote of ^32,000.",26
140,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RANGES,What beat Mr. Wise?,26
141,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"I think it was a tale that was zealously circulated throughout his electorate that under the regime of the Fisher Government a sum of £4,000,000 was unaccounted for, and that Ministers locked themselves in their rooms and refused to admit the Auditor General. It wasstated that there were items of "" contingencies"" under which there was an expenditure of £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 for which ho account could be given. Certainly it was not the Federal Capital expenditure which was responsible for the defeat of Mr Wise. Every honourable member will admit that that gentleman was straightforward, and that when he was opposed to anything he did not mind saying so. He was not out to seek the support of certain newspapers.",26
142,Mr KELLY,RANGES,They tell me that he wore out the steps of the Aqe office.,26
143,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"That ' is something that cannot be said of me. The present Prime Minister, in discussing the Federal Capital expenditure last year, pointed out that people of it was absolutely justified. What I am complaining about is. the two voices with which honourable members opposite speak. I want to know how men who were elected under the wing of the Women's National League- I am referring to men like the honourable member for Indi , the honourable member for Corio, and the honourable member for Gippsland",26
144,Mr ROBERTS,RANGES,I think that the representative of Corio is a product of the People's party.,27

148,Mr AHERN,RANGES,The honourable member does not know my attitude on the Federal Capital question.,27
149,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"I desire to point out that the party with which the honourable member is connected denounced the Labour party in Victoria for spending money on the Federal Capital. The Women's National League, the People's Liberal party, and otlier organizations, adopted that attitude. Of course we all know that quite a number of people change their names as soon as their true characters are discovered. In much the same way these political organizations come up smiling, say, ^ as the "" R e for m League."" They are found out, and then they alter the name of their organization aud pretend .that they are a different body, when, as a matter of fact, they are the same old crowd. All these organizations opposed the late Government because it increased the expenditure upon the Federal Capital to £110,000. wish to know what they have to say now it is proposed to increase it to £285,000 ?",27
150,Mr FALKINER,RANGES,We propose roofs on the houses that the late Government started.,27
151,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"I voted for the expenditure upon the Federal Capital, bu t I am anxious ""to know what is going to be the attitude of tliose honourable members who opposed it . At the last elections certain persons attempted to make political capital out of the fact that the Labour party had started work at the Federal Capital. It . is the only party which has endeavoured to carry out the compact entered into with New South Wales when Federation was adopted. I remember the Minister of External Affairs saying that he was opposed*to the creation of a Federal Capital outside the present large centres of population. Honourable members opposite, representing every other State except New South Wales, have from time to time expressed the same opinion. The honourable member for Grey knows that in South Australia our action was used as a weapon against the Labour party.  late Government liad spent millions of pounds upon the Capital. another Mr TUDOR - T he expenditure upon the Federal Capital was also made use of in Victoria to damage Labour candidates. But if it was wrong for the Fisher Government to place upon the Estimates a sum of £110,000 to be expended upon the Capital, and to actually spend upon it £137,000, it must be doubly wrong for the present Government to expend £285,000.",27
152,Mr AHERN,RANGES,Does the honourable member favour a referendum upon the question of the advisableness of doing away with the Federal Capital ?,27
153,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"T he agreement with New South Wales was entered into prior to Federation and before there was a Federal Labour party in existence. When the first Commonwealth Parliament met, our party in this Chamber numbered sixteen members, who had been returned despite the opposition of every newspaper in the Commonwealth. We have grown steadily, until today we are thirty-seven strong. In the Senate we originally had only eight representatives of our party, but today we number twenty-nine. The I agreement that the Federal Capital should be in New South Wales was entered into by the people of Australia when they accepted our Commonwealth Constitution. to put When that Constitution was submitted to the people on the first occasion, in the absence of that provision, it was defeated in New South Wales. It was only after the Premiers of the six States had met in this building that it was agreed that New South Wales should have the Federal Capital, and that, at the instance of Sir George Turner, a provision was inserted in the Constitution that it should not be within 100 miles of Sydney. Seeing that that arrangement was entered into, I propose to abide by it .",27
154,Mr AHERN,RANGES,"Why not give the people an opportunity, of re-considering the question ?",27
155,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,Why not give them an opportunity of re-considering a l o t of other matters?,27
156,Mr AHERN,RANGES,Let the honourable member confine his remarks to this particular question.,28
157,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"I will . The establishment of the Federal Capital in New South Wales was one of the matters in respect of which the Constitution was amended between the holding of the first and second referendums. I am not in favour of going back on the compact that was entered into, and which I believe was instrumental in bringing N e w . South Wales into the Federation. I do not think it would be fair , especially now that acertain amount of money has been spent. I believe that the people of Australia have a good asset in the present Capital site. There is a large tract of very good country there, and no doubt the Honorary Minister can give us some information as to what revenue is being earned on the money spent. I should like to deal with the question of lighthouses, but, as my time is limited, I shall deal first with the matter of quarantine, leaving lighthouses for another occasion. When I was Minister of Trade and Customs I suggested that Dr No r r is should be instructed to make inquiries as to the various diseases with which the people of Australia were likely to come into contact tlirough these diseases being brought to our shores-in order to ascertain how we could protect Australia from those diseases with which, owing to the rapid increase in the speed of the vessels visiting our shores, we are more likely to come into contact, and more particularly in view of the opening up of the Panama Canal. The late Ministry agreed that Dr Norris should take a trip to see what was being done in other countries to grapple with this particular problem. On his return Dr Norris f u r nished a very valuable report, which contains a good deal of information, and maps showing where the various diseases, subject to quarantine, are in existence, such as plague, cholera, and yellow fever,"" which is a great source of danger now that the Panama Canal is being opened up.",28
158,Mr KELLY,RANGES,They have wiped out the yellow fever in the Panama zone.,28
159,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"That may be so, but it has not died out in other places from which we are likely to get it .",28
160,Mr GROOM,RANGES,We must continue to take precautions.,28
161,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"Certainly . I understand that the yellow fever can be transmitted by the mosquito, and that it is possible that the mosquito may be on board a ship at New Orleans, and the larvae, not hatched out u n t i l after the vessel reaches Sydney. One of the most i m portant diseases affecting Australia, at the present moment, is small-pox. In the report by Dr Norris there is a map of the world showing that the only white spot free from small-pox is Australia; at least it was so at the time this report was prepared.",28
162,Mr WEST,RANGES,Has Dr No r r is defined small-pox ?,28
163,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"I do not know whether he defined it in his report, but I think the medical profession know what smallpox is without requiring a definition from Dr Norris. I am not dealing with the particular outbreak in Sydney. Dr Norris could not have expressed an opinion on the Sydney outbreak in view of the fact that he left Australia six months before the present small-pox broke out there.",28
164,Mr RILEY,RANGES,""" All e g e d "" small-pox.",28
165,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"I prefer to call it the small-pox outbreak in Sydney. Honourable members can call ib what they choose. At any rate, honourable members will agree with me that it is necessary to take precautions to see that small-pox does not become endemic in Australia. It is bad enough to have an epidemic in one spot, but I believe that if small-pox gains a foothold in Australia, the people will suffer.  the fact that small-pox is endemic in London, and London is not quarantined?",28
166,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,I think the honourable member will agree with me that it_ is necessary for us to take every precaution we can to prevent small-pox establishing itself in Australia;  doing it . Your view is narrow. It is a Victorian view.,28
167,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"I have not said one word in connection with the present outbreak in Sydney. All I have said is that it is necessary to take precautions to see that small-pox shall not establish itself in Australia, and honourable members will agree with me in that.  going all over England when it is endemic in London ?",28
168,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,Is the honourable member prepared to say that he will wipe out all the quarantine stations ? ,29
169,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,Then the honourable member agrees with me that it is necessary to take precautions to prevent smallpox from coming into Australia. I maintain that the present Government are not providing enough on their Estimates to protect Australia in this direction.,29
170,Mr SINCLAIR,RANGES,You did half the vote last year.,29
171,Mr KELLY,RANGES,And small-pox came in .,29
172,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"T he honourable member for Moreton, as usual, is not correct. The appropriation was £50,000, and the expenditure amounted to £27,900.",29
173,Mr SINCLAIR,RANGES,"That is just about half, is it not?",29
174,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,It is considerably more than half.,29
175,Mr HIGGS,RANGES,Then you did not spend every penny you could lay your hands on 1,29
176,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"Apparentl y not. Honourable members will see that it was impossible to spend all the vote last year on the quarantine stations, because there were outbreaks of small-pox, and it was impossible to have the workmen at work in the stations. There were cases quarantined at Colmslie, in Queensland, and in Sydney, and Port Darwin, and we had a measles outbreak in Melbourne-the Irishman case. Again, the position of the Naval Base in Cockburn Sound, Western Australia, was not settled. There was a doubt as to whether we would be able to go to Woodman's Point for the quarantine station. It is doubtful whether we shall not have to go to Albany for the principal quarantine station if we cannot get a suitable place in or near Fremantle, having only a small sub-station at Fremantle.",29
177,Mr BURCHELL,RANGES,Not in Fremantle.,29
178,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"I mean in the district. If quarantine is effective, it does hot matter whether the station is within 3 miles or 4 miles of the city or is 40 miles away.  London.",29
179,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,"T he honourable member for Moreton will see the reason why the money was not all spent last year. We were hnng up on account of small-pox outbreaks, which prevented the work going on at the quarantine stations in Queensland, New South Wales, and Port Darwin ; and we were prevented from carrying out works in Western Australia on account of the location of the Naval Base. Dr Norris, in the last page of liis report, speaks of "" quarantine machinery well distributed on national lines,"" and he lays out a proj>er scheme of having first, second, and third-class stations, the first class stations to be capable of housing 1,000 patients each- I believe Sydney is to have accommodation for 1,100-and the smaller stations, such as Port Darnot spend win, are to have accommodation down to eight persons. One of the complaints last year was that provision was not made at Port Darwin, Townsville, Thursday Is-, land, and Brisbane for small-pox patients, and that the latter had to be brought all the way to Sydney. The lionorable member for North Sydney complained in the House that these cases were a menace to the people of Sydney, and that it was necessary to construct these works further north. The work at Townsville is now going on, and the Colmslie station, near Brisbane, is being erected on a site obtained from the State Government. I wish to know now from the present M in ister what is proposed to be done. In the £40,000 they* put on the Estimates this year, I believe Ministers are not allowing enough to protect the people of Australia, l t is most important that we should have effective quarantine. I trust there will be an explanation as to why there is such a small sum provided.",29
180,Mr ABCHIBALD,RANGES,"Hindmarsh) [12.30] - I agree with the honourable member for Hunter that there is great reason to complain about the way in which the requirements in the matter of country post-offices are attended to. It is suggested that, in a matter of this kind, members representing metropolitan districts are more advantageously situated than are those who represent country districts. While it may be true that metropolitan districts are better served, this cannot be attributed entirely to the in fluence of metropolitan members, because the trading and commercial interests in the big centres have quite as much influence with all Governments as have members of Parliament. The sections of the community owning property and wealth must always exercise a considerable influence, and these sections are very strong in the big cities. I should like to call special attention to a new policy, or an undesirable extension of an old policy. I refer to the payment out of loan for new works for the Post and Telegraph Department. The sooner this House puts its foot down on that practice the better. This should not be a party question. Honourable members on both sides should be able to come to an agreement that telegraph, telephone, aud postofhce services, being public conveniences, should be self-supporting - In the same way, sewerage and water services, as public conveniences, should be conducted on a paying basis. The position is vastly different when we come to deal with questions of naval and military defence, which may be regarded as an insurance against possible danger in the future. that the proposal of the Government to construct underground conduits for cables out of loan money should be protested against emphatically. I did not tone adopted by the Treasurer when he said that some honourable members would rather not have the work doue than have it done out of loan. Honourable members, in this matter, should be placed at no disadvantage merely because they happen to hold a strong opinion that works of this kind should not be constructed out of loan.  knows that the works are permanent, and will be as useful to the coming generation as to us. Why should they not pay some of the initia l cost?",29
181,Mr ARCHIBALD,RANGES,"F u t u r e generations will have their own burdens to bear. The honourable member has used an argument which would justify us in shuffling everything on to posterity, in order that we may ourselves obtain as much as we can for nothing. Long before Federation, works of this character in South Australia were always constructed out of revenue.  for us?",30
182,Mr ABCHIBALD,RANGES,"I am not anxious to follow the honourable member in the argument about posterity, which may be very interesting addressed to members of the People's party or some of the Liberal organizations. I hope that honourable members will adopt a firm attitude on this question of the class of works which may be legitimately constructed from loan. wish now to refer to a matter which, in my opinion, the Government have treated in a very cavalier way. I refer to the Sub-Naval Base at Port Lincoln. honourable members will say that this is a matter affecting South Australia, but ibis an historical fact that the admirals of the British Navy who have been in command in Australia during the last t h i r t y years, ancl not merely during the last two> or three years, have annually taken the vessels under their command to Port L in coln for guu practice and the evolutionsthey are required to go through under the Admiralty regulations. I should like to ask any man outside a lunatic asylum why the admirals have done this, if it was not because Port Lincoln is obviously the most suitable place tliey could find for carrying out evolutions of a certain character. I think This is the place that has been turned down by the present Government. In my opinion, we suffer from too many political minutes in connection with thelike the work of the Naval Board, and these minutes are not written by the members of the Board who have come here from England. I sliould not hesitate to leave theniatter of the Naval Bases to the expertsrecommended by the Admiralty. These questions should be dealt with by independent naval experts, and their decision should not be influenced by the interests of big cities. If this course be followed, it will be found that what I have said of Port Lincoln is accurate. There is noescaping the fact that every admiral in. charge of British sliips in Australian waters has gone year after year to PortLincoln for the purpose I have stated. All the political humbug, scheming, and. political minutes written by members of the Naval Board cannot get away from that fact, and the conclusion which shouldobviously be drawn fro m it . The honourable member for Yarra has referred to the great work done by Dr Norris in hisreport on quarantine. We are being continually told of the tyranny of the Labour party, but there is a new tyranny arising in Australia, and that is the tyranny of the medical profession. The members of that profession would appear to have madeup their minds to run Australia, and, tosome extent, they are doing it today. The medical profession, no doubt, containsa number of very able and conscientiousmen. Perhaps about a thir d of them arescientific meu, but to the other two-thirdsI science is absolutely unknown. I do notpropose to go at length into the matter of quarantine for small-pox, but I should like to say that we have not, in my Some opinion, sufficient information on the subject to justify a layman in coming to the conclusion that we have small-pox in Australia at all today. There is no evidence that we have in the Commonwealth the"" small-pox which the honourable member for Maranoa and I saw something of in London in the early seventies, when every time a man went out of his house he would see the ambulance coming along to remove some of his neighbours.  does the honourable member refer to? was in London in those days, but I never saw the ambulance going through the streets.",30
183,Mr ARCHIBALD,RANGES,"I refer to the north end of London, and I am strongly inclined to think that the small-pox of which I saw something in London was a type of disease unknown to many of the members of the medical profession practising in Australia. It was certainly a virulent and fatal disease, and honourable members who saw anything of it w i ll remember how patients were marked after it. They would not recognise it from the photographs which have beeu shown of sufferers from the disease here. of the ablest scientific medical men we have, and not merely medical quacks, believe that the disease affecting people in Sydney is not a pure type of small-pox. Many of the symptoms of true small-pox are absent from the disease in Sydney. Some of them go so far as to say that this is a new type of disease.",31
184,Mr RILEY,RANGES,They will get a new name for it directly.,31
185,Mr ARCHIBALD,RANGES,I would not be surprised if they did.,31
186,Mr GROOM,RANGES,Do you say perts have expressed the opinion that it is not a type of small-pox'?,31
187,Mr ARCHIBALD,RANGES,"That , I gathered, is the opinion of the medical men whom I have spoken to. I am referring now to medical men who have had much experience.",31
188,Mr GROOM,RANGES,Are they medical men who have seen these cases ?,31
189,Mr ABCHIBALD,RANGES,"Some of them have not seen any cases. ister knows very well that medical men continually .consult each other, and that the diagnoses of cases are reported in various text-books, although the cases themselves may have occurred 500 or 1,000 miles away. A scientific medical man, if he is a proper physician, is able to judge by the symptoms, and when such medical men find an absence of the symptoms which were found in the cases in the Old Country, no wonder that they are suspicious as to whether this disease is what is commonly called by the name of small-pox.",31
190,Mr BILEY,RANGES,"They are erring on what they call the safe side, which is very in jurious to the country.",31
191,Mr ARCHIBALD,RANGES,"They are.  I is any doubt but that the disease in Sydney is small-pox. I have seen a lot of the persons who have come out of hospital, and they are pitted all right.",31
192,Mr ARCHIBALD,RANGES,"The r e is no doubt that it is a type of small-pox, but surely the honourable member does not mean to tell me that it is anything like the smallpox which broke out in the Old Country ? ",31
193,Mr ABCHIBALD,RANGES,"I am strongly of the opinion that the pure type of smallpox cannot live in the climate of Australia, and that, no doubt, was the opinion of a good many medical men until the fiat Some went for t h from the union that the present outbreak is small-pox. No medical man dares to go against his own union. Talk of trade unions, sir! The medical men beat the members of any organization I know of as regards loyalty and the way they stick to each other, right or wrong. So long as a resolution on a matter has been agreed to by the union, the medical men are content. The Government ought, therefore, to be doubly careful in taking the opinion of medical men. I am not going to conthat the ex- demn Ministers. Naturally, they say, "" We must act in accordance with the expert medical advice."" But I would remind them that expert medical advice is divided. It would be well, therefore, for the Government to obtain the opinions of two or three, or four, expert medical meu aud compare them. That would enable Ministers to proceed on something like safe ground. I question very much whether they have gone into this aspect of the matter at all. I do not blame them But the M in - for what they have done. It is very likely that, if the previous Government had continued in office, they might have acted on similar lines. We have to be careful to see that this continent is not run by the doctors. I hail and wish much success to the American faith-healers who are coming here. One of the results of the spread of American faith-healing, no doubt, will be that balf of the doctors will be thrown out of work.",31
194,Mr GROOM,RANGES,"You will admit that, if we can exclude disease from Australia, there will be less work for the doctors?",32
195,Mr ARCHIBALD,RANGES,"That is right. There is no doubt that the most lucrative portion of a doctor's practice is in curing people who are not ill at all. My honourable friend opposite laughs at my remark, but let me assure him that there is a number of persons wandering about Australia who faucy they are ill , when there is absolutely nothing wrong with them. If you can persuade such persons by means of faith to overcome the idea that they are not all right they will not suffer, but the medical profession will . I am not going to condemn the Government absolutely in this matter. Let the Minister of Trade and Customs get the expert opinion of several members of the medical profession and, if possible, also the opinion of a scientific medical man, because I contend that the best men in the medical profession today, and those whose services persons value when tliere is anything wrong with them, are the scientific medical men. Not one-third of the doctors have been scientifically trained, or have any idea of following their profession on scientific methods. I hope that the Government will see if they cannot better safeguard the interests of Australia. There is, of course, one thing which must be remembered. It may be that the New South Wales Government ought to do considerably more than they have been doing. It appears to me that they should have proceeded with considerably more vigour in isolating the cases and the contacts in those portions of Sydney where the population is very congested, and the housing accommodation is a disgrace to a city in Australia. This might be excused and pardoned if it occurred in the older countries of the world, but in a new couutry it is simply scandalous. up to the Government of New South Wales to do considerably more than they have yet done in stamping out the disease.",32
196,Mr BILEY,RANGES,"South Sydney) [12.51]. - I , as one of the city members, was surprised this morning to hear the line of argument pursued by certain country members. It is wrong that men who represent country districts in a National Parliament should try to bring about ill feeling between the country and the city. Some of our honourable friends have said - that it was time that a Country party was formed in the House to make the Government do their duty. That was really a threat, bu t I hope the Government will not be swayed by it .",32
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RANGES,Who is threatening now?,32
198,Mr RILEY,RANGES,Some of the members who are supporting the Government.,32
199,Mr FENTON,RANGES,The honourable member for Hunter said it was time that a Count r y party was formed in this House.,32
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RANGES,I thought that ours was the Country party. Where is he ?,32
201,Mr RILEY,RANGES,"In the National Parliament we should always be animated by a desire to benefit the whole of the Commonwealth. All that the honourable member for Hunter is out for is to get telephones and telegraph wires for his electorate. He neglects all other parts of the Commonwealth, whereas I take a broad national view. If the honourable member would look at all matters from a national stand-point, he would not concentrate his eyes upon the Hunter electorate. The same remark applies to the honourable member for Indi . He complained that the present Government have not been able to do in four months all the things that he requires to be done in Indi . He complained, too, about having received only an acknowledgment of communications respecting certain cases. And he asserted that the city is receiving all the benefits-the advance of science, the comforts of civilization, telephones, telegrams, and so forth . I have looked through the Estimates in vain for an indication that one work is going to be erected in the whole of South Sydney, but I cannot find a trace of an item. Some honourable members say that the cities are getting the whole of the plums, but I can assure them that we in the city are not getting anything like a proportion It is of the revenue which we contribute. The honourable member for Indi went so far as to say that the country keeps the city. That is the sort of stuff which country members give to country people when they ever have to deliver speeches in the farmyards. I regret exceedingly that any honourable members should so neglect to take a national view as to try to raise the cry of country versus city. Nowj the country depends upon the city for its very existence. What is the good of men growing anything in the country unless they can send it to the city to be sold? Of what use is it for the orable member for Richmond to produce butter aud milk unless he can sell the articles in"" the city ? We in the city supplying the money. We are employing the people in the country. Y e t we find the honourable member for Hunter and others combining to form a Country party to fight the City party. I am really surThe prised at the attitude of the honourable member for Hunter.",32

203,Mr RILEY,RANGES,"We would import then. I regret very much that hardly anything is provided on the Estimates for the extension of the Sydney Post Ofiice. An y business man who has been there will realise that it is very congested, and not able to accommodate the public. Visitors have to stand three or four at the counter.",33

As regards the appointment an Inspector of Lighthouses, I wish to say a few words, as it is a very important I matter.

212,Mr RILEY,RANGES,"In the Gazette notice inviting applications for the position of Inspector of Lighthouses, it was stated that the applicants must have a knowdisledge of the whole of the Australian and that they must be mariners. Forty applications were received, and thati of a Mr Ramsbotham, of Western Ausa tralia, was recommended. I went through the papers, and found that Mr Ramsbotham is not a mariner, but a civil engineer, and that the Public Service Commissioner recommended him because he; had a temperament that fitted liim for the position. The man best qualified for the office-the gentleman who furnished the Departments with reports on the lighting of our coast-wa s turned down, I understand, on account of his temperament. I do not know what temperament is required for the position-whethe r the Inspector of Lighthouses should have a good, or bad, or a mixed temper-bu t it was said that the Government proposed to spend a lot of money on the erection of new lighthouses, and that a civil engineer, who would understand such work, would be the most suitable person for the position. I naturally anticipated, therefore, that tliese Estimates would make provision for the building of several lighthouses on our coast. I find, however, that the amount proposed to be voted, instead of being an increase, is rather a reduction on last year's vote. Why should it be necessary to appoint an In spector of Lighthouses at £800 a year, with no temper whatever, when there are uo uew works to be constructed ?",33

222,Mr RILEY,RANGES,"I think it was a mistake to appoint a man to this position u n t i l the Department was ready to make a start. The honourable member for Grey referred to the proposed vote of £285,000 for the Federal Territory as money to be spent in New South Wales.",34
223,Mr MCGRATH,RANGES,"Hear , hear.",34
224,Mr RILEY,RANGES,"I know that the honourable member for Ballarat wil l agree with the honourable member for Grey. Victorians always talk of expenditure on the Federal Territory as money being spent in New South Wales. That, however, is not the case. We have 900 square miles of territory which, for the most^part, has beeu given to the Commonwealth by the State of New South Wales, and every penny spent on that territory is enhancing the property of the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, provision should be made for ,the spending of £1,000,000 rather than £285,000. A million could be well spent up there. It would have the effect of increasing the population, and so increasing the revenue of the Territory, which in time will be self-supporting. I shall have to speak in parables to the Minister of Trade and Customs, and therefore, by way of a parable, let me point out that if the pioneer legislators of New South Wales and Victoria had displayed the foresight exhibited by this Parliament in regard to the Federal Territory, and had declared that all lands in and around Melbourne and Sydney, within a radius of 15 miles of a certain to point, should be permanently reserved from sale, it would not have been necessary for either State to raise money on the London market. They would now be drawing heavy revenues from these city lands, just as the Duke of Westminster derives a princely income from lands in London which he has leased. We have declared that no land in the Federal Territory shall be sold, so that money spent there is really an investment for the benefit of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. I hope the Minister will consider the advisableness of increasing the proposed vote. No item in these Estimates will give a better return. While the Department is at present constructing roads for the use of future generations in the Territory, they are neglecting to and reerect buildings. These roads will be overgrown with grass before long, unless people are encouraged to settle there. I should like to see our Commonwealth enterprises established there-the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, the Commonwealth Clothing Factory, and so forth .",34
225,Mr ELENDELL,RANGES,Oh !,34
226,Mr RILEY,RANGES,"I thought I should draw the honourable member for Corio when I referred to the woollen mills. If our Commonwealth factories were established there we should have at once an increased settlement, which would augment the revenue from the Territory. While some honourable members may object to the item, I promise the Minister that I shall vote for it . I regret that any honourable member should be disposed to regard the matter from a purely selfish and parochial point of view. The founders of Federation entered into a contract to establish the Capital in New South Wales, and I am sorry that the late Government did so little for the Territory. that they laid down the foundations for handsome monuments, and so for t h , but they neglected to erect any of the buildings that will be required. plan for these buildings has yet been prepared. Leaving this subject, I desire to express my regret that the cry of town versus country should have been raised this morning, and I hope that we shall hear no more of it in this Parliament. I should like to give a few words of advice to the lionorable member for Indi , who referred to the subject this morning. If my young and honourable friend wants this country to progress, then he ought not to try to split this Parliament into city aud country parties.",34
227,Mr HANS IBVINE,RANGES,It is going to happen.,35
228,Mr RILEY,RANGES,"I hope not. We must not forget that this is a National Parliament, and that we are here to represent the whole of the people. stoop to the ordinary parochial considerations to which the honourable member for Indi has given expression, then we shall become, not a National Legislature, but a second-rate municipal council. I can well understand my honourable friends telling their farming constituents that "" the country is the mainstay of the Commonwealth,"" and so forth .",35
229,Mr HANS IRVINE,RANGES,So it is.,35
230,Mr RILEY,RANGES,"I admit that my honourable friends have not much time - for study when they are in the country, and do not enjoy the advantages which city residents possess. For that they are to be pitied. But the fact remains that the country cannot exist without the cities. The farmer, for instance., does not manufacture boots or clothing.",35
231,Mr FLEMING,RANGES,Many boots in the country.,35
232,Mr RILEY,RANGES,"I thought that the honourable member was oue of the original settlers. I had an idea that he belonged to an aboriginal tribe, the members of which go without boots and clothes, and I know now that it is only because of a little veneer that he is able to be here. But I repeat that the country cannot live without the city. By way of illustration, let me point out that the.country cannot be developed without railways, and that railway locomotives are built , not on the farms, but in city works.",35
233,The CHAIRMAN,RANGES,"I ask the honourable member to connect his remarks with, It is true the Works Estimates.",35
234,Mr BILEY,RANGES,"M a n y things required for public works are constructed in ou r cities and sent to the country. The Not one joinery for a country post-office, for instance, is usually made in a city. Then, again, I would ask my honourable friendsfrom the country what advantage the farmer would reap from his industry if the men in the cities did not build shipsto carry his produce to market. We have elaborate systems of cool storageou our oversea vessels to carry perishable products, and it is the city man who builds them. It is, therefore, a mistake' for any youug man entering this House to say, "" We must have a Country p a r t y . "" As the representative of a city constituency, I am very anxious to assist in the development of the country on proper lines. My honourable frieuds who represent country constituencies, when theytell the farmer, "" You are the back-boneI f we and the mainstay of the country,"" havetheir tongues in their cheeks. They know they are "" pulling his l e g . "" Both parties must work together for thedevelopment of the country. I agree with my honourable friends that the country needs telephones and telegraphs. But I ask them, how can the instruments, and wires that are needed be obtained except from the cities where they .are' manufactured ? Then they say that all these works should be carried out by contractors. If the contract system were made universal, an - army of overseerswould be needed. Without oversight you would find telegraph poles put only a short distance into the ground, and in the first storm half of them would be blown over. I trust that the Government will put a large sum on the Estimates for the construction of lighthouses, because thedo not wear protection of life .and property on ourcoasts is of paramount importance. I hope, too, that the Honorary Ministerwill see that greater facilities are provided for the work that has to be done at the General Post Office, Sydney. It is the revenue earned in the cities and largetowns that makes the Postal Department A paying concern.",35

238,The CHAIRMAN,RANGES,The r e is no point - of order.,36

240,Mr KENDELL,RANGES,"Corio) [2.37] - I rise to reply to the remarks of the honourable member for Grey and the honourable member for South Sydney. The latter twitted the honourable member for In with wishing to create a Country party, payers. but possibly that will come to be necessary. The lionorable member for Grey told us that during the election camnot be discussed now. paign, especially in his State, Liberal candidates went up and down the country speaking against the squandering of inoney on the Federal Capital by the Fisher Government. I am opposed the spending of £280,000 this year the Federal Capital. If we were to build the proposed city, I do not know where we would get people to stock it . In opinion, the Government should appoint a Committee to ascertain what has althis ready been done, and what it is advisable be filled. to do in the future, so that we may get value for our expenditure. The main question that we have to consider in regard to all proposals for the expenditure of money is: What value shall we get for it? I agree with the honourable member the for Darwin as to the need for proper of system in the management of public affairs. Honourable members sometimes say, "" You will reduce wages,"" but I never to sughear them talk of the need for getting value for the wages that are paid. In my opinion, our methods need to be systematized. Want of system is killing us. We are spending money lavishly without getwho ting a proper return. I should like to cersee the vote for the Capital reduced, and the money thus saved made available for telephone extensions in the country disI hope that tricts. We deplore centralization. But does every one strive to get into the Although it is towns? Because there are more conveniences and more enjoyments there. Even the lads born and bred in the country will for not stay there when confronted with the I trust that superior attractions of town life . We should, therefore, try to make the couni n try more attractive. I know places witliin 25 miles of Melbourne to which young fellows have to ride 10 or 12 miles on Saturday night in order to ascertain who the football match. Telephone comthe munication would keep our people at home",36
241,Mr KING OMALLEY,RANGES,"The r e is a lot the to be said for making life in the country these matters, more attractive.",36
242,Mr KENDELL,RANGES,"In looking through the Estimates I find that the expenditure in various Departments is on the increase. It is costing us something like £80,000 a year to run the Land Tax Department, which seems an excessive amount, seeing d i that there are only about 14,000 tax",36
243,The CHAIRMAN,RANGES,That matter can,36
244,Mr KENDELL,RANGES,"I support what the honourable member for Hunter said about the need for more telephones in the country. When I was first elected, I was pesto tered with requests for telephone comon munications, and I wrote down the requests in a note-book, intending to score each one off as it was dealt with . I am my sorry to say that I have not yet been able to score off any, and unless the vote for work is increased, my book will soon",36
245,Mr MCDONALD,RANGES,"Kennedy) [2.45] I entirely endorse the remarks of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat in regard to the need for telephonic communication in the country. In my own electoral division tliere are quite a number of mining centres, and a considerable number of men who reside on selections. Tliese people undertook the hard pioneering work, and I hold that those who go out into remote mining areas make it easy for those who come after them. They receive very little assistance, and many of them remain in these outlying portions of the country for the greater part of their lives. If there is one portion of the Commonwealth which requires to be carefully handled with a view to promoting settlement there, it is the Gulf portion. After all, there are opportunities in the Gulf country, and that is the oue portion of Australia above all others which, from a defence point of view, requires protection. We should encourage settlement there by every means in our power. I regret to say that in some parts of the Gulf country population is decreasing. This is a matter which requires serious attention. When the honourable member for Corio spoke of young men who ride 10 or 12 miles to get the result of a football match, and who, if the telephone were available, would probably, stay at home, tlierewas a good deal of wisdom in his suggestion. In the mining centres one never knows when an accident will happen. I have known men who have had to be conveyed 60 or 70 miles in order to receive medical attention. I have known of a man having to be carried 30 miles along a road in order to meet a doctor. In these circumstances, the Government should endeavour to give these outlying districts as much telephonic communication as possible. The constituency which I represent is nearly four times the size of Victoria. Ifc embraces an area of 333,000 square miles, and there are people scattered all through it. There are some parts of it where telephonic communication could be easily and cheaply established. But when a request is made for the erection of a line, the departmental estimate is usually out of all proportion to the value of the work. It frequently happens that the people interested are prepared to undertake the work for one-third of the departmental estimate! I am glad to say that, during the recent election campaign, I was able, through the medium of privately-erected lines, to get into communication by telephone with my wife, who happened to be in Hughenden, 180 miles distant. I had to establish connection through a number of sheep stations. Most bf tliese lines are erected along the boundary fences of the runs.",37
246,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,The lionorable member must have been a long way from a big city.,37
247,Mr MCDONALD,RANGES,"I was. On one side the nearest town was Hughenden, and on the south side the nearest town was Muttaburra. These cheap lines are of considerable value to the general public. A thousand and one things may happen in such remote areas, and it is extremely convenient to be able to get into communication with some distant centre by means of tliese privately-erected lines. I hope that^the Government will grant as much telephonic communication as possible in all parts of Australia. If they do that, they will be doing good. At the same time, I strongly object to the expenditure upon the Federal Capital being decreased for that purpose. I would like to see the expenditure upon the Capital twice as much as it is at present, because I hold that we shall never have Federation in the true sense of the word until this Parliament is located in its own home.",37
248,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RANGES,"Parkes) [2.51]. - It is so long since I had the pleasure of hearing my own voice in this chamberowing to a monopoly of the public speaking by the Opposition-that I began to doubt whetlier I had not lost the faculty of speech. The honourable member for Corio and the honourable member for Kennedy have supplied me with two excellent texts upon which to hang the remarks that I propose to make. One of them commented on the very incomplete and extravagant methods which are adopted in this country in carrying out our public works, while the other drew particular attention to the great need that exists for - telephone communication in the rural areas, and to the apparent hesitation on the part of the Government to supply that need. ' I have here an interesting illustration of the red-tapism of the Postal Department in regard to the erection of country telephone lines. It appears that a telephone line is required over a very few miles, and that about eighteen months have elapsed since the work was first, brought under the notice of the Department. I have here a letter which affords a typical instance of how systems run. to seed instead of being modified aud made practicable by the personal interest which we should get under private enterprise.",37
249,Mr HIGGS,RANGES,The honourable member wants to hand over onr telephones to private enterprise.,38
250,Mr BRUCESMITH,RANGES,"I did think January; that the honourable member had gone out for the day. He is a sort of stormy petrel, who comes here and creates all sorts of discord between honourable members, thus preventing us from getting on with the business of the country. I hold in my hand a letter relating to the telephone lines to which I have referred, which informs those-who require it that the Department has called for tenders for the work and cannot get any. It did not - seem to know what step it should take next. Now, I assume that a business man would have tried to ascertain why uo tenders were received for the work. - One has only to take up the papers which I have here to see that they would absolutely bewilder any ordinary tenderer who was desirous of carrying out a work of - that character. But, before I touch f u r - posit required was ouly £ 4 5 . ther ou. this matter, I will mention one instance which recently came under my notice. The case was that of an honourable member who required a telephone line in his district to be run a distance of 14 miles from an ofiice to a race-course. The work was delayed for so many months - that the proprietors of the race-course at last resolved to carry it out themselves.' They had appealed to the Department again and again, and, although the Department had done nothing, it was asking the modest sum of £480 to carry out - the work. I repeat that it was so long in taking steps to do anything, that the proprietors of the race-course erected the line themselves. Taking Government material for the purpose, they carried it out for 25 per cent, of the price that the Government were demanding. In other ""words, they completed for £120 the undertaking for which the Government had - asked £ 4 8 0 . That is a sample of the way in which work is done by the Postal Department, today.  - cost of material ?",38
251,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RANGES,"Yes ; because ithe pnmrietors °f the race-course took the niausrial! fro m the Government which was on the spot waiting for the job to be carried out, and were charged for it . I know of another similar case in which a work has been urged on the Government for many months, but, so far, nothing has been done. At last, a letter was received from the Department to this effectTenders for the erection of the line were first invited in December last, closing on the Sth but the only tender received was too high. Fresh tenders, closing on the 26th February, were accordingly invited. The only tender received in time was also too high. On each occasion the tenders were invited no formal tender was received from local contractors or local residents. Now, we all kuow the type of men who enter into these local contracts. They are substantial and practical men, who do not possess any great legal knowledge, and they are men who are so impressed with the necessity for being safe, that they will not enter iuto a contract of a very complex and questionable cliaracter. The Department did not receive a tender. Why ? The answer, I think, is to be found in thepapers which I hold in my hand. Here is a contract which is not for a very large sum, seeing that the deYet I find that about twenty-five sheets of foolscap are sought to be made an attachment to the contract. First, we have the tender form . Then we come to a schedule of one page. A paper follows which is called "" Details of work in connection with the erection of a telephone line between Junee Junction and Junee Reefs,"" and which covers two pages containing eleven paragraphs. We then pass on to "" Special conditions and in structions,"" which occupy three more pages. In order to give the Committee an idea of the sort of microscopic details which are contained in this paper, I quote the following: Cut a notch about 1 foot from the ground - with a £-in. chisel so as to start the auger easily; bore a hole in pole (or strut), using a j - in. auger, boring in a downward direction to a depth of at least 18 inches, keeping the auger in a position in line with centre of pole (or strut), thus boring across the pole, (or strut), and striking the heart of same thereby. F ill up the hole with solution j allow about live minutes to elapse to permit solution to soak in, refill hole, and plug with a tight-fitting wooden plug.

252,Mr MCDONALD,RANGES,That is not the contract.,39

254,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,F o r what purpose?,39

And then we have a delightful condition ings of a technical character. put in . No matter what differences opinion may arise between the Postmas-. wires."" ter-General and this practical country contractor",39
256,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"How can he be a practical man. when he has never put up a telephone, and is not an engineer?",39
257,The CHAIRMAN,RANGES,Order !,39
258,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RANGES,"This is one of the conditions laid down for the unfortunate contractor: The Deputy Postmaster-General reserves the right to alter, modify, enlarge, or diminish any part of the works. No such alteration, tion, enlargement, or diminution shall in any way vitiate the contract, or except in so far as the Deputy Postmaster-General considers reasonable, and by writing under his hand allows, extend the lime stipulated for the completion of the work. That means that the Postmaster-General, through his officers, can order any addition or modification, and the contractor is not allowed any extension of time in which to do the work. This condition goes on f u r the r: No compensation for damage, injury, loss of profit, or otherwise shall be allowed to the contractor for or on account of any such alteration, modification, enlargement, or diminution of the works, but all additions or alterations shall be paid for, or deductions credited to the Deputy Postmaster-General, as the case may require, at schedule prices, or at prices to be mutually agreed upon between the Deputy Postmaster General and the contractor. That condition puts the 'practical country contractor entirely in the hands of the Postmaster-Geueral, who may order all these additions, but the contractor has no righ t to extra time. We have another document, on one page, headed "" Line Construction Wire, erection of . "" Another page is headed ' ' Line Construction: Pins (wood and iron), straight, for large in sulators."" Another is headed "" Coal Tar Composition,"" Another is headed "" Insulators."" Another is headed "" Erection of Telegraph Lines on New Poles and Trees,"" with' drawings.

260,Mr BEUCESMITH,RANGES,"As they were tendered on, of course they were.",39
261,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,Y o u are very unfair to the Department.,39
262,Mr BEUCESMITH,RANGES,I do not know whether the honourable member has a modifibrief for the Department.,39
263,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,B e just to the Department and we shall listen to you.,39
264,Mr BEUCESMITH,RANGES,"I do not care whether the honourable member listens to me or not. This work was submitted to the public, and tenders were called for, but only one tender was received, and it was ' too h i g h ."" So they got another ten1 der, and that was "" too h i g h ,"" altliough.it was the only one received. Then they called for fresh tenders and received none at all, and so they came back to the unfortunate parliamentary, representative, who had been agitated by the people, who were wondering why on earth he could not get something done. Then these people turned round and did the work themselves at 25 per cent, of the cost claimed by the Department. One of the great dangers of public departments is that they run to seed. None of the officers have any personal financial interest in the successf u l working of the Department; no balance-sheet is ever issued to the public to show how much they are losing or making, or whether, in carrying out work departmentally, they are not paying four times the price for which private individuals can get things done. In this case, which can be verified by the honourable member for Indi , we have a case in point. The Government estimate a work to cost £ 4 8 0 , which is subsequently done for £ 1 2 0 . I do not speak without knowledge or experience.",39
265,Mr HIGGS,RANGES,Y o u have never had any.,40
266,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RANGES,"I had three years' management of the biggest spending Department in New South Walesthe Works Department-and during my term of office many millions of pounds were spent. I found that the Department, in the few years preceding my advent, had so run toseed in the way indicated by the contract which I have just quoted, that I obtained one of the most practical accountants in Australia to devote some weeks to the Department to see where the work was overlapping; whetlier it was being properly done, and whether the men were f it for their positions. He was to report generally to me on the best means of putting that Department on the footing that a great business establishment would occupy if it were being managed on economical lines. That led to a great many changes, but did a great deal of good, because it prevented certain officers from trespassing beyond their domain, and prevented the work from overlapping, and also prevented a great waste of public money in carrying out works in an unbusiness-like way. Altogether, it practically ventilated the Department, because it got r i d of what is constantly growing up i u public departments. When a man is engaged with a private firm, he knows that his particular department will be criticised at the end of the year on the work it has done, and on the cost of the work ; and it is in his interests to manage the work in such a way that at the end of the year the department will show a creditable result. On the other hand, in a public department, an officer has certain duties to do; no one ever estimates the cost, with a view to showing at the end of the year how it will compare with the work of other people; and the consequence is that, very often, the work is done with so much red-tape that it will lead to the result indicated by the case which the honourable member for Indi has brought under my notice. I heartily endorse all that has been said by the honourable member for Kennedy with regard to telephones. Tliere seems to be an impression in the minds of Ministers that telephones are only required for such things as were mentioned by one lionorable member-communicatin g the results of cricket matches or races. have had a great many cases brought under my notice where it was a matter of' life or death to have telephone communication. Now that the wires are erected along fences, the work can be done so cheaply that there should not be any part of the country where there is a settlement of population that is not supplied with ""this great convenience. A telephone creates business. It conduces very much to the commercial activity of the country. I wish now to say a word about the prevalent idea that these things ought all to be done out of revenue. Telephones are a revenue-producing, in vestment. In many cases public telephones return an extravagant profit on the capital laid out on them. I waa speaking the other day to an American expert, and he told me that, in the public companies in the United States, the proprietors were so anxious to have telephones erected for the public that if a new telephone was ordered today it would be erected tomorrow.",40
267,Mr KING OMALLEY,RANGES,That is true.,40
268,Mr BRUCE SMITH,RANGES,"Imagine , in this country, expecting a telephone to be put up the day after it was ordered. I should expect it to be done on the same day next year. Yet there is a profit standing out. We are told over and over again by the Department that they only keep in hand sufficient material for a certain time. They do not hold large stocks, and if demands happen to come from different parts of the country for these conveniences, and the stock is exhausted, to have to wait until they import more is not business. The interest on a very large stock of material, out of which the public could be supplied with telephone conveniences, would not be great, and there is no reason why there should not be a large stock on hand to anticipate very large orders. I do not agree with the principle that tliese works must necessarily be constructed out of revenue. I have had answers to requests from my constituency, where certain telephones were required, to say that the money was uot available. We required a little sum of money to put up a public telephone in a public place in a thickly-populated suburb of Sydney, and we were told, in this great country of ours, that there was not the inoney "" available "" for that particular telephone, or for a number of others. I There should be no hesitation ingetting that money out of loan funds, because telephone construction comes properly under the category of loan expenditure. It is not only a permanent work if it is properly managed from year to year, but it is revenue-producing, and the sooner the Government arrive at the conclusion that works o.f that sort should be done out of loan money, or that they can borrow money for the purpose if they do not have it now, the better it will be for this try. For years I have urged on previous Governments, and I urged on the present Treasurer eight years ago, that he should utilize loan moneys to build post-offices. In the first place, we buy the land, which is a permanent asset. The mere fact of establishing a post-office on the site gives it an increment which it will maintain for all time; it is of a permanent character; and the moment a building is erected it produces more than sufficient revenue to pay interest on the loan. I remember the Government spending in one year no less than £900,000 out of revenue on post-offices. It is a wrong principle. have quoted to the House more than once a most able little treatise from one of the annual pamphlets of the Tasmanian Statistician, in which he lays down with proper accuracy the distinction between loan - expenditure and revenue expenditure. We know that, in other parts of the world, this practice of paying for permanent or revenue-producing assets out of revenue is considered absolutely wrong. These works sliould be built out of loan money. The asset passes down to posterity; the loan .should pass down to posterity-. If the work is of a perishing character, and yet produces revenue, it is the .duty of the - Government to maintain it , just as they maintain a railway today, and to simply charge each generation with the interest on the expenditure, while conferring on each generation the benefit which the establishment of the work brings with it . The telephone system is in a thoroughly unsatisfactory condition. Telephones should be distributed throughout the country, and if the Government have not enough money for them, they should borrow, or take the money out of loau funds for the purpose. I say, further, that the arrangements in connection with these contracts should be carried out in a thoroughly practical manner. Can it be supposed for a moment that, if a private firm were to employ an architect to prepare a specification to carry out a little work of, say, 15 miles of telephone, he would have twenty or t h i r t y pages of conditions, which, possibly, the country contractor would have to read, and submit himself to, and which, probably, lie could not understand if he had to do it ? A practical architect will make out a simple set of specifications, and if he be a well-known man the contractor will be perfectly satisfied that he should be coun- the arbiter in any matter in dispute. Under the system adopted by the Post and Telegraph Department, not ouly do we find twenty-five or t h i r t y pages of addenda laid down in black and white, and in the most technical terms; but if the slightest dispute arises, the decision of the Postmaster-General is final. In the erection of very large buildings, and in the construction of railways, although the specifications may be somewhat long, the terms and conditions of contract are of the simplest character. The engineer in the case of railways, or the architect in the case of buildings, is the final I arbiter, and as he will be known to the contractors, they can trust him, and there is very little difficulty. In view of what the Prime Minister said the other night as to the great want of business methods in certain branches of the Public Service, I trust that the Postmaster-General will look very closely into the way in which telephone line construction is being carried out. I trust also that the Governmeut will see that, as the honourable member for Kennedy has pointed out, telephone communication will be extended throughout the country wherever there are people willing to pay for the facilities afforded them.",40
269,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"Denison) [3.17]. - I wish honourable members to understand that I hold no brief for the Commonwealth electrical engineers. It cannot be said that in speaking on their behalf I am seeking their votes, because their number is so few. But I understand a little about their work, and I must say that I have just listened to one of the most unfair and unjust attacks that could be made upon any body of men. It was most unjust and unfair for the honourable member for Parkes to produce a great number of specifications and conditions, when he should know that they are not provided for the construction of the line, but are submitted for the guidance of the various bodies in calling for tenders. For instance, the conditions with respect to insulators are submitted wben calling tenders. What the honourable member has succeeded i u doing has been to show lines. that the work is highly technical, and that it is essential that it should be the hands of trained engineers. object of the specifications to which has referred is to secure that the work shall be carried out properly in order that the public may be provided with good telephone service. The honourable member would have us revert to the system of calling for tenders to enable on the insulators. what he would call "" the practical man pounds' worth of wire. in the country "" to take up the work. I have had some of these practical in the country under my supervision. would like to see. One of them was left for a little time to himself, and, although the specification provided that the poles must be put 4 f t . 6 in . in the ground, as soon this practical man got out of sight of the supervising officer he cut 2 feet oH departmental the poles, and put them only 2 f t . 6 i in the ground. Fortunately we covered some of the sawn-off butts in the bush, and we had the line unearthed, with the result that we found that several miles of it had not been constructed cordance with the specifications at all, if it had remained in the condition i which it was built the first wind that came along would have blown it across the roads, and, perhaps, brought about loss of life. . We have had a speech ou this subject from an honourable member who would not know an insulator from a telegraph sounder. I had one of gentlemen at one time under me. had been recommended to me by a lawshould yer. I put him to work, and he put in a whole day digging one post-hole, whilst in the same time another man on the job had sunk eight post-holes. Mr Bruce . SMITH - That was day labour, I suppose.",41
270,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"No ; that work was done under contract, but the untrained man shifted ten times as much d i r t as it was necessary for him to do in the simple operation of digging an ordinary telegraph post-hole. nothing about the qualifications of the honourable member for Parkes as a lawis yer, but he seems to be under the imsatisfactory pression that he can become a first-class telegraph engineer after a ten minutes' perusal of the papers submitted to him by a contractor who evidently was not allowed to do as he pleased by the partment. The Postmaster-General must for be very careful of what he is doing if ,he allows contractors to construct these The system was tried in every one of the States before Federation, and in was abandoned, because it was not satisThe factory. In connection with one line he put up by a contractor which came under my notice, upon inspection of the line we could not understand its enormous rea sistance, but upon a close examination we discovered that the contractor had old cut the wire in every case in tying He had spoiled This was one of the cheaply-constructed lines such meu as the honourable member for Parkes How long are we to be subjected to such twaddle as that to which we have listened today, from an as honourable member speaking of something about which he knows nothing at all . The authorities are today n . working against terrible odds in tryin g disto build up a Department of trained men. They are dreadfully handicapped i h their work by the way in which those in authority are influenced by such speeches in acas that to which we have listened and from the honourable member for Parkes. In hope that we have heard the last of this kind of thing. I contend that it would be better to continue the day-labour system for this work. If the volume of work to be done was sufficient to warrant contractors specializing, and keeping a body of trained men to do it , the position tbese would be different, but the honourable He member for Parkes proposes that any one be allowed to tender for the construction of a telephone line, and should be allowed to do practically as he pleases. He referred to an architect in connection with the building of a house, but if he were having a house built, would he not require to have all the details specified ? What sort of an architect would he be who did not set out all the details? In the same way, an electrical engineer who knew his business would set out every detail for this work, even to the number of I know nails required in putting the hoop-iron on the poles. This must be done if the work to be carried out in a substantial and manner. The honourable member for Kennedy was all righ t in what he said, in so far as his remarks referred to the kind of line which he indicated. I interjected while he was speaking that the Deline to which he referred was not constructed near a city. I wished honourable members to understand that the line must be going through miles of unoccupied country, and was not affected by other lines running parallel to it . If there were otlier lines parallel to such a line as the honourable member described, it would be useless. Only yesterday, I tried to talk to a geutlerna.u at Lara, and I found there was a considerable amount of in duction on the line, so that I could only hear about half that this gentleman wished to say. The reason was that there are a lot of lines parallel to the Lara line, which is one of the cheaply constructed lines. It was imperfectly constructed, owing to the lack of engineering knowledge of those who carried it out; or, more likely, want of funds to enable the engineer to construct a metallic circuit. I remind honourable members that, at all events, until quite recently, many requirements such as the height of the poles to be used, are specified in the Act of Par-, liament. What I should advise would be the establishment of a zone system of construction. The first zone should include lines in large centres requiring the most perfect construction, such, for instance, as a main trunk line between Melbourne and Geelong, or Melbourne and Ballarat. Such liues should be constructed under the best possible conditions to secure a low resistance. Then, in less thickly populated districts, we could have less perfect lines, and in purely country districts lines could be built much more cheaply, say, for £ 1 2 6s. per mile. These would be removed from other lines, and though the resistance might be a l it t l e high, so long as one could hear the ring of the telephone, he could speak over it . It will pay us to have skilled engineers to carry out the construction of our lines. I remind honourable members that, even if construction is handed over to contractors, we shall require to have supervising officers. I have walked about with my hands in my pockets for weeks supervising the work of a contractor, and I might just as well, at the time, have been directing the men, and doing something for the wages I was receiving. The honourable member for Parkes has told us that no estimates are submitted, but there is not a telephone line constructed in Australia today without an estimate being submitted. An estimate is in every case submitted by the local engineer to the Engineer-in-Chief, who, in turn, submits it to the Postmaster-General. I venture [73] to say that the Department may go so far as to ask the engineer to submit a tender side by side with the tender of a contractor. The honourable member for Parkes was amused by the provision for bracketing, but that was because he did not understand the importance of it . If brackets are not properly used in the construction of a line, the first strain' to which it is subjected may strip it back for half-a-mile. The honourable member may be a brilliant lawyer, but he has demonstrated today that he knows nothing of telegraph and telephone construction, or of electrical engineering. I ran a copper line between Hobart and Paratta in rough country, as the lionorable member for Franklin will know. I had six men working with me, and with those men I did 4 miles of line a day. Untrained men could not possibly have done the work, and they would probably, when in sulating, have given an extra tur n to the tie wire, aud the first frost would break the line altogether. It is necessary to tie the wire carefully on the insulators when straining the line between the poles.",42
271,Mr FALKINER,RANGES,I have erected 200 miles of telephone line without doing that.,43
272,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,W it h what sort of wire ?,43
273,Mr FALKINER,RANGES,No . 8 galvanized wire.,43
274,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"I do not refer to galvanized wire, but to copper wire. Where there are a number of lines in use, galvanized wire cannot be used. W it h the use of No. 8 galvanized wire, the resistance amounts to 16 ohms to the mile, whilst with copper wire the resistance is less than 8 ohms. The honourable member for Biverina may know a good merino lamb, but there is a great deal of difference between a merino lamb and a telephone line. On looking up this matter, I find that while the honourable member for Barrier and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie were at the Post Office, during the regime of the Fisher Government, they constructed more telephone lines in Australia than had any other Government during the previous ten years. More telephones were constructed i u the Indi electorate, I believe, than i u any other division in Victoria, and, unfortunately, for Indi , and the people of Australia, the people of Indi did not recognise that fact, and turned down a good man who had done much for the district, regardless of his political ideas. Much has been done in Australia. The country people have my sympathy, but I tell the farmer in the country that it is essential for him to have a telephone line in the city working well, if it is judiciously and fairly used. Sometimes, I am told, when a farmer calls on merchant A , and after getting a price says, "" I will not take that price,"" the merchant telephones round to merchant B before the farmer can get there. That is not putting the telephone to the best use, because a price is fixed. It is essential that the telephone system of a city shall be in first-class condition. There is nothing more irritating to a person than to have paid money for a telephone servico, and not to be able to hear what a subscriber is saying to him.",43
275,Mr MCW ILLIAMS,RANGES,That is little compared with the irritation of the man who has no telephone at all.,44
276,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"It is essential to have a good service. One day a friend of the honourable member and myselfan eminent gentleman in Tasmania - los t £-50 in five minutes owing to the defective working of the telephone. A mistake was made in speaking over the line in a business transaction, and it cost that gentleman £ 5 0 . Had it been a good silent line he could have done the business safely and well. That is why I am anxious to see telephone lines constructed under first-class engineers. I suppose it is because honourable members have to ride in railway trains that they do not suggest that any farmer along the line should construct a section of the railway opposite his farm .",44
277,Mr RODGERS,RANGES,It does not necessarily follow that the farmer is going to do it . What answer have you to give to those who for eighteen months have had propositions unattended to?,44
278,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"So far as I can gather, the engineers have not been able to get sufficient money to stock material, and so on. The Fisher Government rose to the occasion, and a sum of, I think, £600,000, was voted to enable the electricians of the Department to continue the work. We have still, I believe, an abominable system that compels the Department to employ so many casual hands, and if the Public Service Act is complied with, as soon as an engineer has trained a number of men-the y are employed for about six or nine monthsthey are put off, and new men have to be brought in and trained. Did any one ever hear of such a ridiculous practice as that ?",44
279,Mr MCDONALD,RANGES,"That is not the f a u l t of the Department, but of the House.",44
280,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,That is the f a u l t of honourable members like the honourable member for Parkes getting up here and pretending to know something ahout a subject tliey know nothing of.,44
281,Mr THOMAS,RANGES,There are two sides to that question.,44
282,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"That may be. Let the men remain in the Departmentas casual hands if you like. Australia is not likely to go back. Have we gone back in the construction of telephone Hues? Some honourable members seem to have no confidence in the country at all . When an engineer wants a number of men he is asked how many, and I understand, fro m practical experience, the names and the number' 'of the men are1 submitted to anotheF gentleman-the Public Service Commissioner-and he, with no responsibility on his shoulders, says how many men may be employed. Once the men are engaged they are handed over to the Postmaster-General, and the responsibility of the Commissioner ceases. Whether the men are capable or not I do not know.",44
283,Mr THOMAS,RANGES,The Commissioner has nothing to do with the casual hands.,44
284,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,I submit that he has.,44
285,Mr THOMAS,RANGES,No . It is the registrar in Ms Department.,44
286,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"The honourable member evidently misunderstands me. What I wish to point out is that, in my opinion, the Department would not have so mauy casual hands were it possible for the engineers to get permanent hands.",44
287,Mr THOMAS,RANGES,That is not the f a u l t of the Commissioner.,44
288,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"The Commissioner has the right to say how many men shall be employed, and who.",44
289,Mr THOMAS,RANGES,No .,44
290,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,Most decidedly he has.,44
291,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RANGES,Not as to casual hands.,44
292,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,In theory it may be all right. I have seen a list of names submitted to the Commissioner. He sent an officer who knew nothing about telegraph work to inquire whether a man was required.,44
293,Mr WEST,RANGES,"The Department has to get the men through the Commissioner. Mr LAT RD SMITH - Certainly ; and what is the use of any honourable member saying differently here? The honourable member for Parkes made a great point about borrowing for the construction of telephone lines. Suppose that the Department is about to construct a telephone line with borrowed money. The life of the poles of the line will be about twelve years. It is often said, "" Never mind about a pound or two for the cost of that line; the money is coming out of the loan account."" But let the money come out of the general revenue, and see how careful one is in framing his estimates. Why ? Because he realizes the responsibility which is on his shoulders. I have known a telegraph line to be constructed with borrowed money ancl renewed from the same source. Where.isjjour asset in that case ?",44
294,Mr AHERN,RANGES,Why should not the cers be as careful in expending borrowed money as in expending revenue?,45
295,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,Why should not and why they are not I do not know.,45
296,Mr AHERN,RANGES,It shows departmental improvidence.,45
297,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,Becaus partment have to show so much revenue from the service every year. The officers are not so careful as to that when a line is being constructed out of borrowed money.,45
298,Mr AHERN,RANGES,They ought not to be in the position.,45
299,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"That is another matter. Why do honourable members on London cities? the other side desire to indulge in the borrowing system ? Because it is a form of government to which they have comFranklin mitted themselves; because they reprefor sent a body of wealthy persons. capitalist has to find investments for his money. If honourable gentlemen on the of 24 miles. other side make it possible for the capitalist to get good investments, and they are strong enough over there to make laws that will compel the workers to pay the interest on the borrowed money, they are on top every time. That is why want to resort once more to the old system of borrowing money; but I think they about that. will find that they have a very hard row to hoe before they succeed in the attempt.  vative of the post.",45
300,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"A f t e r long study and thought by an engineer, it was [731-2 found conducive to the life of a telegraph pole to put in it a certain ingredient, which keeps insects from eating it and preserves it . There is only one way of putting in the ingredient, and that is the one which the discoverer intimated to the Department-in other words? to use the preservative f a it h full y and well. Suppose that the Department sent up country the. ingredient in at in without any in - t structions as to its use, a man might put it round the bottom of a pole before the pole is put into the ground. There is a simple instruction as to how to introduce the preservative into the pole.",45
301,Mr MCDONALD,RANGES,And a uniform one ?,45
302,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"Yes . I wish to remind honourable members that, all over the world, these engineers are being paid the highest salary which is paid in any offibranch of engineering. Why ? Because of the technical matters which they have to deal with. The honourable member for they Parkes spoke of what was done in the TJnited States, but he failed to tell us that, in Australia, we can get a telephone service for £ 6 , just as good as one for which £ 1 5 is paid in Chicago- a cheaper service, for e the Dea larger number of rings.  place where you can speak under 5 cents.",45
303,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"In London the charge is 2d., except in hotels, where it is 3d.",45

305,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,Are not Chicago and,45

307,Mr MCWILLIAMS,RANGES,That is a distance,45
308,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,Yes . I do not think that there is any place in the world where a cheaper service is provided.,45

312,Mr LAIRD SMITH,RANGES,"Let the honourable member consider the cost of constructing the line through country where hundreds of big trees had to be felled to save the line from being every twenty-four hours. member the hilly country through the line had to be taken, aud the crooked roads, necessitating the use of about thirty posts to the mile, instead of twenty-five. Again, let him remember the amount of work which had to be done to make it a silent line. Speaking from memory, I think that, by the exercise of his influence, the honourable member has got a metallic circuit for the whole Quite clearly I have heard a lady speaking over the line. If the voice is suitable, one can hear at a distance of 120 utiles from the Franklin practically a silent line. The honourable member should be the last to complain, because more money has been spent in the Franklin electorate, I tliink, than in any other district of the same size in Australia. There is a service which enables nearly every fruit-grower in the district to communicate every with the market, where he may sell 'his fruit, and very cheaply Why is not the honourable fair? I hope that the will go in for the zone I have suggested, giving the engineer more freedom, and not allowing so much interference with him by the He is a good man who sticks to liis last. Let us all do that, and we shall then have a better system of telephonic tiou. "" Having seen in operation the telephone systems of many countries, I have come to the conclusion that the Commonwealth system, while yet capable of much improvement, is not far behind them. - we give the officers the necessary and money to make improvements, shall hot have much trouble. other point that I desire to make is that it is unwise to stock too heavily. of example, I would point out that, nine years ago, the Ericsson magneto phone, which would ring over an enormous resistance, was regarded as something wonderful, whereas today, for city use, it is practically obsolete. wires that were used, ten years ago have been abandoned. We have also been told that insulators are going to be manufactured locally. What would be said of a Postmaster-General who imported and stocked 1,000,000 insulators, at a cost of Is. apiece, if it were found a little later that we could obtain them locally much Mr Laird Smith. cheaper, and at the same time encourage interrupted local industry ? Would there not be a Let him re- howl of indignation because of his want which of foresight ? I hope, therefore, that the Minister will not be influenced to any great extent by the criticism of novices in this matter, and that the Department will not stock goods to the extent that has been urged. These honourable members are doing their best for their constituents, but what we want is to have a little more faith in our public servants. They are distance. not all working merely for filthy lucre. We have in our Departments many capable men who are excellent organizers. A gentleman was brought down here district over from Queensland some time ago to organize the Postal Department, and I venture to say that no private company doing business in Melbourne today is better organized than that Department is under him.",45
313,The CHAIBMAN,RANGES,"The honourable member's time has expired. morning Dr MALONEY (Melbourne) [3.47] Although my words will be few, I hope indeed. that the subject to which I am about to member refer will be regarded as of sufficient im Minister portance to demand the serious considerasystem tion of the Government, with a view to the remedying of certain evils. I wish to point out, as plainly as I can, what I novice. consider to be the infamous conditions operating in connexiou with our various quarantine stations. Our present communica- Speaker, together with the honourable member for Franklin, the honourable member for Herbert, Senator Givens, and I , were quarantined last year at the Sydney station. I am glad that we were, If although I regret that what was supplied time to me as Australian lymph proved to be we New Zealand filth that ought not to have The only been given to any human being. The life of Senator Givens was seriously imBy way perilled by its use, whilst the case of the honourable member for Herbert was also telebad. On the other hand, the Manilla lymph obtained from the United States of America Government, and the Japanese lymph, proved to be perfect, and lef t no Then, again, bad results. I said, a little over a year ago, that Sydney was standing on the brink of an inferno, and I repeat that statement today. We were told when in quarantine that only 1 per cent, of the population of Sydney had been prepared by vaccination to resist small-pox; and I did not dream then that proof of the truth of my words would so soon be forthcoming. I think it was the lionorable member for Franklin who said, at the time, that Sydney had escaped epidemics of small-pox, not because of the quarantine arrangements, but in spite of them. We know that on a balmy day the germs of small-pox will carry a considerable distance, and that there is practically no distance between the boundary fence of the quarantine station in Sydney and the town of Manly. The postman used to call at the station every day; but I do not want to say too much about the matter. Tliere is only one other point that I desire to make. If three men, one extremely wealthy, another of moderate means, and the third in absolute poverty, were imprisoned for a crime, would there not be a shriek of indignation on the part of the public if any difference were made in their treatment in prison-if the wealthy man were given a good bed and an eiderdown quilt, whilst the man of poverty had only bare boards and a blanket? No one would defend such a system. Then, why should there be any difference in the treatment of first and second class and steerage passengers when ordered into quarantine ? Why should the second class passengers, and those who travel steerage, as well as the sailors and firemen, be treated as they have been by past Governments? I hope the Prime Minister will effect a change. Men and women sent into quarantine are held under restraint purely for the good of the community. They are, for the time being, the guests of the Commonwealth; and, just as we do not differentiate between the rights of citizens over twenty-one years of age, so there should be no difference in the treatment of men and women in quarantine, no matter whether they travel in the saloon or in the steerage. On one occasion, Mr Hugh Mahon, who, until lately, represented Coolgardie in this House, was sent into quarantine, and was ordered off a plot of grass because he had travelled second class, and the grass plot was reserved for saloon passengers. Our accommodation in Sydney was all that could be desired, but the second and t h i r d class passengers were not thought f it to have even decent places to wash in . Russian women travelling in the steerage had to bathe in a bath 2 f t . 6 in . long and 18 inches wide, posedand 15 inches deep-receptacle s which had been provided for the washing of clothing. I understand that we have on these Estimates £40,000 in respect of "" Quarantine. "" Last year, £50,000 was voted for that purpose, but only some £27,000 was expended; so that really only a sum of £17,000, added to the unexpended balance of last year, has been made available for improvements - We all recognise that there must be some control over our shipping, and at present I would not do away with the regulation under which the owners of a ship ordered into quarantine have to provision the passengers whilst they remain there. Such a requirement must necessarily make officers careful in the carriage of passengers and merchandise from infected ports. But let the sleeping apartments, the bathing accommodation, and the grass plots provided by the Government be the same for all classes - Those whose only crime is that they* cannot afford to travel first class should be treated just as saloon passengers are. Let us have equal privileges, and fair treatment for all.",46

I received the-.following letter, to which I draw the attention of the Honorary MinisterConstable Murphy . . . waited on me today, and asked me to file an electoral claim, stating that my name had been removed from the roll. Of course, I refused to do so, and told the constable that my name was on the roll, and that I voted at last election. not understand how my name could be removed from the roll. Because of my position, and the work I am engaged in, I venture to say that I am as much before the public as any man in Brisbane, and more so than any man in this district. I should be greatly obliged if you would, at your convenience, see to this disfranchisement. I do not want any public fuss made about it, but I do want some explanation and reinstatement without being further harassed. Cannot Ministers see that the methods which they are adopting are causing end of trouble, innocent citizens being prived of the right to vote through no fault of their own ? Tlte methods that are being adopted seem to strike at those who are best known, and who have lived longest in the districts in which they side. If the purification were directed the removal from the roll of the names those whose residence qualification is doubtful, the position would be different, but it seems to be directed to the disare franchisement of persons who have notand changed their residence.

349,Mr KELLY,RANGES,The number appears to be unusual because honourable members are advertising every mistake that occurs.,49
350,Mr FINLAYSON,RANGES,"It is strange that this wholesale disfranchisement is following on the Liberal Government's announcement that the rolls are being purified. If ib is possible for persons like this clergyman to have their names summarily removed from the roll, and their righ t to vote taken from them, there must be a large number of unknown persons similarly treated. I suggest to the Honorary Minister that the methods of the DepartTo-day ment need improvement.",49
351,Mr KELLY,RANGES,"Wentworth-Honorar y Minister) [4.81- I hope that honourable members bringing cases of this kind before the House will not persist in a statement which is absolutely without foundation, that the mistakes are due to some change in the methods of the Electoral DepartI can- ment. The forms sent out, which honourable members have been recently canvassing, are identical in every particular with those circulated with the authority of my predecessor.",49
352,Mr FINLAYSON,RANGES,Plu s this Government's instruction.,49
353,Mr KELLY,RANGES,"P l u s nothing. The only instruction that has been issued is that of no the permanent head of the Department, dethe Chief Electoral Officer, that whenever representations are made with regard to an elector having left the district, the local officer shall take independent steps to completely satisfy himself as to the ret r u th of them. The only change that has to beeu made is the adoption of an addiof tional precaution so that the Registrars of the various districts shall not, without independent inquiry, remove names which objected to. That is the actual fact, auy man who, in view of the official statements that have been circulated, says the contrary, is a man in whom the truth",49
354,Mr FINLAYSON,RANGES,"I say ttiat the change referred, to is not the only change.",49
355,Mr KELLY,RANGES,"It is an infamous thing this insinuation should be constantly made, and that the ordinary mistakes of the Department sliould be collected together and made. use of to support it . Even wlien, as in this case, uo public use is desired to be made of a document, cases are used to create outside an entirely false impression that the Govern the ment are endeavouring to do certain things that are against the law. Electoral Department is under the Chief Electoral Officer, who is charged with important duty of seeing that no voter is given an opportunity to record more than one vote. That responsibility, ing upon him under the Act , the Chief Electoral Officer is discharging without any pressure either from myself or from this Government. I merely wish to say out that if the honourable member for Brisyears bane desires to ventilate in this chamber otlier statements made to him, either persons in his own electorate or elsereceived where, he ought in common honesty longer to attempt to fasten the blame for these occasional mistakes on the vernment, but ought to recognise that they represent merely the normal conpersons dition of things- a condition which has obtained in Australia ever since we have had electoral administration.",49
356,Mr FENTON,RANGES,"Maribyrnong) [4.11] Oue of the greatest privileges which enjoy is that of having our names upon the electoral rolls, and of recording our votes upon polling day. The Assistant Minister of Home. Affairs was unfortuthe nately absent from the chamber the other of. day when I spoke upon the matter which I am about to bring forward. On that occasion I gave one instance in which objection had been lodged to the Mr Michael Calliuan, wlio has been a farmer at Campbellfield for two and a half years, and who is well known to every man in that portion of my electorate, appearing on the roll.",50
357,Mr KELLY,RANGES,Thotr e are twenty or thirt y similar cases in my own electorate.,50
358,Mr FENTON,RANGES,"Why sliould electors be harassed in this way, when there is no next ? need for it? If preliminary inquiries were made there would be no. necessity f warding objections in many instances. The simplest inquiry would have revealed the fact that Mr Callinan had been tinuously resident on his farm for two and a half years.",50
359,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RANGES,How does the orable member know that preliminary in - spoke. quiries are not made?,50
360,Mr FENTON,RANGES,How can they be?,50
361,Mr KELLY,RANGES,There may have been two persons of the same name on the roll.,50
362,Mr FENTON,RANGES,"No . I have perused roll, and there is only one person of that name who is enrolled. This makes The the objection all the more peculiar. If it were a case of a father and son living the in the same locality, I could understand the error. In another portion of my electorate there reside a stationmaster and resthis family of three, all of whom have votes. I'he Bailway Department of Victoria, having been struck by a spasm of reform, has removed this stationmaster of the hovel in which he has lived for to a better residence a few feet away on the same railway ground. Y e t by he and the members of his family have a notice that an objection has no been lodged to their names appearing upon the roll. Surely ' the most preliGominary investigation of this particular case would have proved that all these were located on the same spot. But I rose more particularly to make an appeal to the Prime Minister, who, I feel siiTe, is in a sympathetic mood. I believe that in many States of. the Commonwealth fclieire are a large number of breadwe winners who are out of work, and I hope that the Prime Minister wil l place his officers in trainin g so that these works may be proceeded with the moment that Works Estimates have been disposed",50
363,Mr ATKINSON,RANGES,I hope that the Oppoan sition will allow those Estimates to go name of through as soon as possible.,50
364,Mr FENTON,RANGES,"P a r t of these works, no doubt, have already been carried out, but thefre are a large number of new works which might be placed in hand very quickly.",50
365,Mr TUDOR,RANGES,Yarra) [4.15] - I should like to ask the Prime Minister what business will be proceeded with on Tuesday,50
366,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RANGES,"Parramattao r forPrime Minister aud Minister of Home Affairs) [4.15] - We shall proceed with the .consideration of the Works Esticonmates, and the sooner they are disposed of the soouer we shall be able to give out work, and relieve the congestion of which hon the honourable member for Maribyrnong Question resolved i u the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.16 p.m.",50
