1,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [3.5] - It is with the greatest reluctance that I interpose at this stage.. Although the occurrence of calamities in any part of Australia is certain t'o be sympathetically noted in this House, yet the disaster which occurred on Monday night is so grave and appalling that it is at least incumbent upon us to indicate our deep sorrow and regret, while extending our condolence to the numerous shattered victims. A .few days previously a similar accident, though happily on - a less serious scale, occurred in ' New South Wales, but so ' many' of our citizens have just been killed or maimed so near the spot where we. are now meeting that it might be regarded - as an indication of indifference if we were not pause for a moment in our arduous and imdistress, portant labours to express, in the simplest and sincerest fashion, our sympathy with the - many who are suffering. Considering the circumstances of the country and the sistance. rapidity of its development, our railways have a record of which we are properly proud, and it is therefore the more unfortunate that there should now be written on the pages of their history a misfortune so' deplorable. Accidents of this kind happen in all countries, especially in the New World, whose' general conditions resemble ours, most closely. They appear only of reduction, since they have never been provided against, even in the more closely settled countries of Europe. None the less we cannot refrain from expressing, however imperfectly, the unanimous symconsider pathy of the House with the victims of the disaster, and those associated with it.",14
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) communication [3.7] - The Prime Minister did right in asking us to pause for a moment in the disin charge of our ordinary business to express the deep sorrow which we feel at the calamity which has befallen us. In spite of our civilization and our material adI vancement, there is always the incalculable element of human error which creeps into our best laid schemes, and, by upsetting them now and again, plunges the comGreat Britain. munity into mourning, and causes the dark - shadow of sadness to hover over our homes. This is such an occasion, and I join corPrime dially with the Prime Minister in his extheir pression of sorrow and regret for those have been .the victims of thisi unhappy ocupon currence.

4,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"In reference to the proposal that the Imperial Government should convene a conference of representatives of the self-governing States of the Empire to the question of the restriction of Asiatic immigration, I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he has received any from the Imperial authorities asking the Commonwealth to take part such a gathering, and if so, what position he proposes to assume towards it?",15

8,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of DefenceIs it true that the Government proposes , to a central Commonwealth Naval Ship: 2. Is it true, as stated by Mr Bent (per Melbourne Argus of the 16th instant), that it is the intention of the Commonwealth Government to "" cruisers, torpedoes, and all that sort cf thing"" at the Saltwater River depfit? 3. Is it proposed that the suggested Saltwater River depot, is to be the head-quarters of the Commonwealth Fleet? 4. What steps have been taken to secure the finest site in the southern hemisphere-the State Docks at Cockatoo Island (New South Wales) for Commonwealth naval construction purposes? 5. Is it . seriously proposed to Cockatoo Island dock as the head-quarters of the Naval Construction Depot of the Commonwealth in favour of the Saltwater River site?",15
9,Mr EWING,Unknown,"The honourable member was good enough to inform me of his intention to ask these questions today, and consequently I have been able to obtain the following replyNo action has been taken with regard to ing any site for a central Commonwealth shipbuilding yard in Australia. In each State steps are being taken to obtain suitable areas which will meet the requirements in connection with naval development. These negotiations do affect Cockatoo Island, but since they are incomplete fuller information should not be made public at present. EASTER ENCAMPMENT : TRANSPORT DELAYS.",16
10,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister of Defence whether his attention has been directed to a statement published in the Sydney newspapers-and I dare say in the Melbourne journals also-to the effect that in connection with the Easter encampment in New South Wales thirty-one hours had been occupied in transporting a battery of field artillery from Albury to Heathcote-? Will he inquire into the matter, and if the statement should prove to be correct, will he take steps to enable men in future to reach the Easter encampment with much less loss of time?",16
11,Mr EWING,Unknown,"If any delay of the kind indicated actually took place, obviously it was not the fault of the Defence Department, because none of the members of the Defence Forces would desire to remain in a train, any longer than was absolutely unavoidable. The"" fault must have been with the railway authorities.",16
12,Mr KELLY,Unknown,The persons who made the transport arrangements were not in the train.,16
13,Mr EWING,Unknown,But the railways were engaged in transporting the men. If anv delay of the kind actually occurred I shall be glad to inquire into it.,16
14,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I desire to ask the .Minister whether he will - cause inquiry to be made as to the reason why, in connection with the recent .encampment at Langwarrin, it took from 3.30 p.m. till 11 p.m. to transport the Ballarat and Bendigo senior cadets a distance of 23 miles?",16

17,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Act i o n has already been taken. The Department of Home Affairs has been asked to prepare a memorandum showing the present position, the circumstances under which the previous estimate was made, and the circumstances under which it is now challenged. CUSTOMS TARIFFBILL . Order of .the Day for consideration, in Committee, of the Senate's requests, read.",16
18,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Before you leave the chair, sir, I wish to ask what is the most convenient course for me to adopt to raise a point of order to the effect that the Senate has no power to request this House to increase Customs and Excise duties? I should like you to intimate when will be the best time for me to express my views in regard to that matter.",16
19,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I think, perhaps, that it will be most convenient for the honourable member to express his views now. The point of order can then be disposed of.",16
20,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"In the first place, I wish to say that I have ""no feeling whatever' in this matter. As a matter of fact, many of the. requests made by the Senate for increases of duty meet with my personal"" approval. My sole object is to raise the constitutional issue, and to obtain a ruling from you, sir, in regard to the power of the Senate under the Constitution to make suggestions to this House for increases of duties. I contend that the action of that Chamber in requesting this House to increase duties is a proposal to increase the burdens upon the people, and that the power to increase "" any charge or burden on the people "" is denied to the Senate under section 53, paragraph 3, of the Constitution. I submit, too, that the words of paragraph 4 of that section, "" omission or amendment,"" do not confer power upon that Chamber to request this House to increase duties, which would be increases of "" a n y charge or burden on the people."" If the Senate can, under the Constitution, request this House to increase a duty, it possesses a greater power than it would have possessed had it been granted the power to amend a Bill , such as this, imposing taxation, because in the latter case it would not have had power to increase, or to request this House to increase, Customs or Excise duties. When the Senate was empowered to make requests in Money and Taxation Bills-whic h it was forbidden to amend - by the framers of the Constitution, it was intended that it should be a lesser power than that of amendment. That being so, I contend that, under this lesser power, it cannot do what it could not have done if it had been granted the greater power of amendment. I also contend that if the Senate has the power to request this House to increase duties, thereby, in effect, increasing the burdens on the people, it has a greater power than this House possesses; because this House cannot increase any duty unless the increase is proposed by a Minister of the Crown.",16
21,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,And upon sage.,17
22,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"In this a Minister of the Crown alone can move for the increase of any item in a Bil l imposing 'taxation. tend, therefore, that the Senate has a greater power than this House possesses if it can make suggestions to increase duties, since we cannot even make a suggestion to that effect. It may be argued that the proposals of the Senate are only "" requests "" to this House. But I contend that a great principle is involved. This action of the Senate might result in a deadlock between the two Houses of the Legislature. means anything at all it is a declaration by the Senate that it has practically the right of compelling this House to increase the burdens on the people, notwithstanding that such right is specially denied it by the Constitution. It may be said that you, Mr Speaker, have already decided this question by a ruling given some years ago. But I submit that the question which I have now raised has not been previously raised in the form in which I now bring it before this House. I therefore beg to submit, for your consideration and ruling, whether the Senate, under the power conferred by section 53, paragraph 4, of the Constitution, has power to make "" requests "" to increase Customs and Excise duties, and thereby to increase the charges or burdens on the people.",17
23,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Without debating the merits of the question raised by the right honourable member for Swan, important though it be, I rise to suggest that my right honourable friend has not proceeded in a proper way in this matter. While you, Mr Speaker, have important duties ""to perform in connection with the interpretation of the Standing Orders, I know of no law which imposes upon you the duty and obligation of interpreting the Constitution for us.",17
24,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,No r of determining such an abstract question.,17
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"This is not quite an abstract question. It is concrete enough, as the honourable member will observe if he looks at the schedule of requests that have come from the Senate. My right honourable friend is, I think, following the practice of the House of Commons with regard to the relations existing between the Commons and the Lords. But in Great Britain they have no written Constitution, and,- I mes- submit that that makes a very radical difference between their attitude in regard House to such questions and ours. All the powers possessed by the Senate are contained in our Constitution. Neither our Standing I con- Orders nor, I submit with great respect, anything that you, Sir, can say regarding those powers, can alter this Constitution in any way whatever. I know of nothing in the Constitution which imposes upon you rhe obligation to interpret for us what the powers of the two Houses are. I should think that if the right honourable member for Swan proposes to proceed further in this matter, he ought to proceed by resoluI f it tion ratEer than upon a point of order such as he has now raised. Regarding the merits of the question' itself, I do not now propose to say anything.",17
26,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The right honourable member for Swan was good enough, two weeks ago or thereabouts, to wait upon me and inform me that he intended to raise the question which he has raised this afternoon. The notice which the right honourable member was kind enough to give me has enabled me to go quietly through the matter relating to it, before it was actually raised in,the House, with a view of determining what my ruling ought to be. I am therefore prepared to give a ruling at once, which may be of service to the House. First, in regard to the point raised by the honourable member for Parramatta, it-is true that the obligation does not rest upon me to interpret the Constitution. I have ever striven,. as far' as possible, to avoid doing anything of that nature. I re-cognise that the only body fully entitled to interpret the Constitution is the High Court; arid I should be sorry even to seem to assume any of the functions which pertain peculiarly to it. Not even this House has the power finally to interpret the terms of the Constitution. Further, on three or four occasions I-have been asked, before to-dav, to rule as to what the privileges of this House are in regard to certain messages which have come before us-as to whether such messages ought to be received, and as to whether we ought to consider them. To rule on such points is surely part of my duty;' and, hitherto, I have striven to perform, that duty with a sense of the responsibilitv which rests upon me. In the same way today, I am asked whether a message which is about to be remitted for the consideration of the Committee is one that ought to be received by this House, or whether our privileges are in any way entrenched upon by suggestions for raising certain Customs duties. I propose to ""deal with the questions raised by the right honourable member for Swan in the reverse order from that in which he has raised them. He has pointed out that if some of the suggestions made by the Senate were allowed, one result would be that the Senate would prove to be possessed of powers that are not possessed by this House. He has pointed out that this House has not-the pqwer, except on the motion of a Minister of the Crown, to raise duties proposed by any measure before the House. I suppose that the right honourable member was ""referring to standing order 171, which reads as followsNo amendment for the imposition or for the increase of a tax rate or duty shall posed by any non-official member in any mittee on any Bill . If we were, at any time, in Committee on any Bill it would be impossible then to receive or make any proposal for the increase of any ""tax rate or duty,"" unless that increase were moved by a Minister of the Crown - But on the eariier stage of a Mr Sfeater. t Bill-o n the motion for its initiation, when the House is not in Committee on the Bill, but is dealing with preliminary resolutions relating to the imposition of duties-it would be competent for any honourable member to move for any increase which he might desire, at that stage. So that the contention that the practice which is sought to be followed by another branch of the Legislature today, would give that branch of the Legislature larger powers than this House possesses, is not quite correct. We are only estopped from taking such action as would increase a ""tax rate pr duty "" at one stage-that is, when the House is in Committee on the Bill. The next point raised by the right honourable member for Swan- I am' still taking his points in the reverse order-wa s as to the intentions of the framers of the Constitution itselfwhether it was intended to give to the Senate such powers as it claims. That is a matter as to which my ruling can be asked, but not a matter upon which I should be prepared to rule. Whether the practice which has been adopted does or does not confer upon that branch of the Legislature larger powers than the authors of the Constitution intended is not, I think, a question upon which my ruling is really sought. Then conies the next point to which the right - honourable member has referred, and concerning which he has kindly given me, in writing, a statement of his contention. The right honourable member submits thatIt is not competent for the Senate to make a. suggestion under section 53, paragraph 3, of the Constitution, that any item in the Tariff Bill , as sent to it by the House of Representatives, be increased. That paragraph provides thatThe Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. In this case the Senate has not made any amendment. It has simply sent to this House a message inviting us to amend it if we think fit. The Constitution clearly provides that in the case of measures for certain specified purposes, the Senate may be pro- not make >any amendment;. it may Com- merely make suggestions or requests for amendments. If the Senate had power to amend the Customs Tariff Bill, an amendment made by it would he obeved by the Department of Trade and Customs, precisely as it instantly obevs any amendment made by this House whilst the schedule is under consideration'.' It is, therefore, clear that the Senate makes nothing in the nature of an amendment by making a request to this House. The making of a request by another place is not followed by action on the part of the Department of Trade and Customs until that request has been considered by this House and agreed to. Unless this House makes the amendment requested the Department takes no notice of the decision of another place, and that decision has no operative value. It is simply a request to us to make a certain amendment. The next point arising under section 53 of the Constitution relates to the paragraph immediately following that which I have just readThe Senate may at any stage return to the House of Kepresentatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. . . . Those words contain no. limitation precluding the Senate from making a request for an amendment which may mean an increase of taxation. This question has not previously been directly ruled upon by me, but it has come before the House on two or three occasions. On turning to volume 1, page 385, of the Parliamentary Papers for 1905, Honourable members will find a detailed reference to all the cases in connection with which points similar to this have arisen. When the first Tariff Bill was before the Senatej certain requests were made, including one that the Excise duty on tobacco should be increased. message from another place, embodying those requests, came before this House, and was considered. No point of order was raised; the request for the increased duty was considered, together with others, and a vote of the House was taken. point raised today by the right honourable member for Swan was nearly touched later on, when the Sugar Bounty Bill of 1903 was before Parliament. nexion with that Bill, the Senate made a number of amendments-no t requestsamongst those amendments being one surer) which clearly involved an increased burden upon the people. When the Senate message was called on in the same way as that now before us was called on today, I stated that, in my opinion, the had gone too far . ' I took, the that we ought not to consider an amendment of the Senate which - clearly involved an increased burden upon the people. . I concluded by stating that if ' the Senate had desired that this amendment, should be made, its proper course, under paragraph 4 of section 53 of the Constitution would have been not to make it but to send to this House a request that it should be made here. The present Prime Minister, as Attorney-General, moved that the Bill be returned to the Senate with a statement that the amendment could hot be received in the form sent, since it was not competent for another place to make it, but that, if it desired, it could make a request to this House, in respect to it.^ The Senate forthwith sent a message to this House requesting that the amendment should be made; the House proceeded to debate the matter, and"" the incident was closed by this House making the amendment desired with a modification. If honourable members examine the debates on the Sugar Bounty Bill of 1903 they will see that the point now raised by the right honourable member for Swan was then practically ruled upon. We come now to. the next point raised by the right honourable member, that the words "" omission or amendment,"" in paragraph 4 of section 53 of the Constitution, give no authority to the Senate to suggest an increase of any proposed charge or burden' on the people. It seems to me that, there being no limitation in that paragraph precluding the consideration of a request for an increase of taxation, we have no right to refuse to consider such a. request. Such requests may be considered entirelyvon their merits, . and we have power to - reject, A modify, or accept them. Honourable members will find reference to this question in Hansard for 1902, pages 14885, 14892, 14918, and 15676. I rule, finally, that the message which we have received from the Senate is one which it is within.the power The of the Senate to send, and one which, f o llowing the precedents we have laid down on two or three occasions, we may well con- sider and deal with upon its merits. In . conI n CommiUee : . Sir WILLIAM LYNE '(Hume-Trea [3.36] - I propose,' with the concurrence of honourable 'members, to make a short statement indicating the requests which the Government propose to ask the Committee to accept, and those which we Senate shall ask honourable members to re-view ject or modify. I desire at the outset, to say that, like other honourable members,- I have noted the keen interest displayed by. another place in dealing with the schedule to the.Customs Tariff Bill as it left this House. I do not think that greater interest has been displayed by the Senate in any other measure which has been transmitted to it, and I feel sure that in making certain requests to us it has not been actuated by any desire to ^interfere with the proper functions of this Chamber. The Senate commenced its consideration of the Tariff on. the 22nd January, and completed it only on-the 2nd April. In the interval, every item was considered in detail from the point of view of honourable senators, and the Hansard reports of the debates on the various items in the Senate contain a great deal of information which may possiblv be of use to honourable members. Out of a total of 238 requests, it is the intention of the Government to propose the rejection of 51, and the acceptance of 187. I propose now to state, for the information of honourable members, the requests which the Government propose to accept, and also those which we propose to reject or modify, in order that before each is dealt with they may know what course the Government intend to take.",17
27,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Will the honourable gentleman supply the numbers of the items to which the requests apply ?,20
28,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I propose to do so. I hope to have the lists printed by tomorrow, but I wish to guard myself to this extent: It is possible that, m a few cases, we may not find it advisable to follow the lists in every particular, and I therefore reserve to myself the right to make certain alterations in the case of items in connection with which I am still making inquiries. So far as I can at the present moment give definite information as to the intention of the Government, I shall do so. It is proposed to accept the Senate's request No. 2.",20

30,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Yes , or modified.",20

33,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"Would it not printed tomorrow. be better for the honourable gentleman first to give the list of requests which the vernment propose to reject, seeing that they number only 51 ?",20
34,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"If it is the desire of honourable members that I should first refer to the requests which we do not propose to accept, I shall do so.",20

76,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The honourable member and his party agreed to a great many duties in this Chamber, because they could not obtain lower rates, but when those duties were considered in the Senate they succeeded in their efforts to them.

The sooner that position is the better will it be for the thrifty and government of Australia. of As soon as possible, we ought to resort to simple rule that those who spend the money shall be saddled with the responsibility and difficulty of raising it-. During the current financial year we shall collect at least ^2,000,000 more than we collected In other words, our revenue will have increased by about 23 per cent.; and that in spite of the fact that we are supposed to have been engaged in framing all a scientific Tariff,, with the object of keeping out importations and of decreasing revenue. What does this prove? It proves that the Tariff which was expected to have But coming the effect of stimulating local production I throughout Australia has done nothing of carethe kind.

106,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,It will take a little time for it to shrink.,27
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is obvious that this large revenue will not continue. There must be a shrinkage; but I doubt whether that shrinkage will be as large some honourable, members forecast. one outstanding feature in connection with our Commonwealth finance has been that our revenue has not decreased to the extentcreased that has been predicted. Sir George Turhave ner was out in his forecast as to the ,£2,000,000 shrinkage which wpuld take place in the revenue in consequence of the protective incidence of the duties levied under Tariff of 1901-2. Then, a little ago, the honourable member for Flindershimself an ex-Treasurer of this State-i endeavouring to forecast the future finanBut cial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, declared that when had 'adiusted themselves, we might expect to receive a revenue of a little over £ n.000.00 0 annually.",27

112,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Whic h will be badly wanted.,27
113,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I am not talking about that at present. We did not frame the Tariff to make money. We were supposed to frame it for the purpose of rescuing industries which - were being as strangled, and to prevent importations of The goods affecting those industries. Here is the net result of our efforts to prevent those importations-that they have enormously induring the year, and that we shall an increased yield of revenue of over sterling above that of last year. It seems to me that our Customs revenue - will not shrink, if our seasons keep as they the are, very much below £11,000,000. The while Vice-President of the Executive Council in the other Chamber thought that the n revenue would settle down at £10,250,000 . all these forecasts, made by - Victorian politicians, are, I am afraid, matters based on their experience as State Treasurersand State Ministers of Customs; and . it seems'to me that Victorian experience affords no very reliable guide in relation to our experience of Australia as a whole.' A very good judge estimates that the Tariff will work' out, at the end of the as follows: The yield in New South Wales is estimated to be 12s. per head more than that of last year; in Victoria, 8s. gd: per head more; in Queensland, about 6s.; in South Australia, about ios. 6d. ; in Western Australia, about ns. j and in Tasmania, about 6s. per head. So that there is not only aninHouse crease in the aggregate, but an increase per capita of the revenue derived from Tariff in all the States.",27
114,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,Whose opinion . is that? .,28
115,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"It is the opinion of Mr Nash, the financial editor of Sydney Daily Telegraph; and there are few better judges than - he. The ing fact is that, while we have been piling on these duties with the intention to ingraph crease local production and to kill renot made. venue, the revenue itself seems to laugh at all our puny efforts, and maintains itself in this increasing ratio through _ every month in the year. This is the best posinserting sible proof that to frame this Tariff on a made. basis derived from the experience of one or two large cities of Australia is to place it upon a false basis altogether. When we come to consider the needs of Australia asposeda whole, and especially the needs of its great primary industries, our efforts ought to be in the direction of a moderate Tariff, and, therefore, in the direction of modeis involved? rating these duties which have come from the Senate where they transgress the which I have just laid down. It will be our duty, therefore, while not doing anythat thing to prolong debate upon the Tariff, search this schedule with the greatest sible care, with a view of moderating those duties in which increases have been quested by honourable members of another place in pursuance of their rights. I shall do nothing which will add to the burdens of the people of Australia. I believe that in taking that stand I shall be doing that, which will eventually be best in the terests of Australian enterprise country as a whole. Item 2t.

Neither sago nor tapioca is produced in re Australia, and .1 can see no immediate prospect of their production here. They - are both valuable articles of food, and are largely used by people living in the interior of the country. They form a very valuable substitute for fruit and other perinishable products which cannot be readily and of the obtained in the interior.",28

122,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"I am. I notice gd.; that these foods are on the free list in the New Zealand Tariff.

They are articles of food which, will Be found not in most homes in the Commonwealth. Why should we impose a tax upon them? As f ar as. I know, they are not produced in Austraiia. They are good wholesome foods, especially for children. . I therefore trust that the request will be agreed to.",28
123,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [5.2] - I point out that the duty which the Government desire to retain means a tax of 30 or 40 per cent, on an article of diet which is used very largely by the poorer classes.",29
124,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [5.3]'. - We ought to hear from the Minister whether sago or tapioca are being grown in Australia at present, or whether there is any prospect of their being produced in saleable quantities. If there is evidence that they can be grown in quantities, or that some one is willing to embark on the industry of producing them, there may be a reasdn for a duty; but otherwise I can see no reason for dissenting from the request of the Senate.",29
125,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [5.4] - A duty was imposed on sago and tapioca in the 1902 Tariff, when the rate was'4s. per central, which is equal to Jd. per lb. I am not aware that sago and tapioca are grown in large quantities in Australia. Mr DUGALD THOMSON.:-Non e is grown.",29
126,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I think that some of the Queensland members could give us some information on that point. I 'do not assert that any large quantity is produced in Australia, but sago ought to - be grown here.",29
127,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,The Treasurer had better accept the request.,29
128,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The honourable member for Flinders is advocating the abolition of what he would call a revenue duty.,29
129,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The duty was in operation under the first Federal Tariff, and I have not heard any great Outcry against it. I should not like to say that we ought to obtain revenue by means of duties on goods in respect of which there is no necessity for a tax, but the States tainly crying out for increased revenue, and if we cut down the duties the smaller States will suffer.",29
130,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I believe that the acceptance of this request would mean the loss of a whole £ 5 0 0 to Tasmania.,29
131,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The acceptance of this request and others involving a reduction of duties would affect the returns from the Tariff.,29
132,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"But the revenue has increased by £1,750,000.",29
133,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Eve n so, the States will be none too well off. What would have been their position if the Tariff had not yielded an increased revenue? We may not always have seasons of prosperity, and we must be prepared to meet any depression that may occur. I think it would be unwise to accept this request, and I would remind honourable members in the Opposition corner that the honourable member for Balaclava said that he would support the Tariff as it left this House, so that I should at least be able to claim his vote.",29
134,Mr BATCHELOR,Unknown,"Boothby) [5.9] The Treasurer admits that this is a revenue duty, and to support his contention that it should be retained he falls back on the general statement that the States are anxious to secure as much revenue as possible. That argument would apply to every proposal to amend the Tariff. It seems to me that the point we have specially to consider in this connection is that tapioca and sago are not produced in Australia, and that this is therefore a purely revenue impost on articles of food. The Treasurer has said that there has been no outcry against it, but I would remind him that, speaking generally, the consumers of tapioca and sago do not own newspapers, and have no means of making vigorous protest against the duty. Sago and tapioca are wholesome foods for children, and in the circumstances I think that the Treasurer would be well advised in asking the Committee to agree to the request made by another place.",29
135,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Angas) [5.11] - When the Treasurer was speaking I interjected that it was to be regretted that he had not given the Committee an indication of the effect which the acceptance of the requests made by the Senate would have upon the revenue. We should have no difficulty in determining what stand we. ought to take in respect to proposals of this kind if we knew what would be the effect on the revenue of are cer- the acceptance of the requests made by the Senate, and what would be the effect of the increased duties requested and likely to be agreed to. That the Minister thought that such information ought to be given is suggested by the fact that it was pointed out in the Senate that the amendments made by the House of Representatives in the schedule as introduced would involve a loss of revenue amounting to about £ 4 4 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. We ought not to hesitate to accept this request on 'the ground that it would involve a surrender of revenue amounting to £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 per annum in respect of articles of such wide consumption as tapioca and sago, having in view the fact that on three items alone - wir e netting, timber, and galvanized iron - w e struck off duties involving a loss of revenue amounting to £ 1 7 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. If I remember rightly, the Treasurer, in submitting his Budget statement, said that this Tariff would yield £ 9 0 0 , 0 0 0 in excess of the amount derived last year under the first Federal Tariff, but that as against that increase we should have to make provision this year for an increased expenditure of nearly £1,000,000. impossible to incur even half of that increased expenditure during the present financial year. The bulk of the votes which are to absorb the increased revenue will lapse by the 30th June, so that we shall have a much bigger balance than was anticipated.",29
136,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I hope that they will not lapse.,30
137,Mr GLYNN,Unknown,"Surely the expenditure proposed by the Government in respect of immigration, defence, and many other items which I could mention will not be incurred this year. So far then as we are to consider these items from the point of view of this year's revenue we ought not to hesitate to make this item free, since the freeing of it can have very little effect upon the large surplus we are likely to have at the end of the present financial year",30
138,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"Herbert) [5.14]-Honourable members have stated that sago and tapioca are produced in Queensland. I do not think that they are produced to any extent there, but it cannotJ>e denied that they can be, and I dare say that they will be produced in larger quantities. I think that the request should be agreed to. Sago is a most nutritious substance. It is the principal food' of the natives of New Guinea, and by making it free we shall give those who are producing it in our Northern Possession-Papua- a convenient market. A great deal of sago is produced in Papua, and the fact that it is not of the best quality is due simply to defective treatment. The Treasurer would be making a great concession by agreeing to the request.",30
139,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"Flinders) [5.16]. - The honourable member for Angas has raised a very important question to which the Government should make a definite reply. He has pointed out that this is the first item which raises distinctly the question of what is likely to be the effect upon the revenue of the acceptance of these requests. We are told that we shall suffer a loss of £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 per annum if this item be made free, but in order to be in a position to effectively discharge our duty in dealing with these requests we should have from the Government a statement as to what will be the effect on the revenue generally if the requests made by the Senate be accepted. I presume that the Treasurer has the information before him. The Government, in order to determine what requests the House should be asked to accept and what it should be asked to reject, must It will be have had before them the figures for which I ask, and the statement which is to be published should give an indication of how the revenue will .be affected by the acceptance of, the requests.",30
140,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The Committee will be given the information as we deal with each item. Mr W i H . IRVINE - That is not sufficient. I believe we all desire, if possible, to make this item free; the only question is whether it is wise to agree to a request involving a considerable loss of revenue before we know how the revenue from the Tariff generally will be affected by the other requests that we are to deal with. I am in favour of accepting the request providing that the amendment can be made without adopting a principle that, - may seriously diminish the revenue from Customs and Excise. The honourable member for Laanecoorie interjected a few minutes ago that honourable members on this side were in favour of revenue duties, and should therefore be in favour of this impost. That statement' involves a misconception of the position. I am in favour of revenue duties in the sense that I believe that for a very large number of years we must derive the great bulk of our revenue from.Customs and Excise duties, and that therefore we must always regard"" the duties imposed from the point' of view of their returning a large revenue. In that sense we look upon all imposts as revenue duties. I should like to see the Commonwealth obtaining revenue as far as possible from duties which will also have a protective incidence, where such duties can be fairly imposed. We are asked to remove a revenue duty, which will returnonly £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 a year- a duty which I am assured is equal to 30 per cent, or 40 per cent, upon articles of food used largely by the poorer classes'.",30
141,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,And especially by the sick.,31
142,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Sag o and tapioca are consumed largely by invalids and children. Unless the Treasurer takes up the position that we cannot afford to lose this amount of revenue I shall feel compelled to vote for the acceptance of the Senate's request.,31
143,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,What about the protection of the industry ? Mr VV. H . IRVINE - We have practically no industry in respect of tapioca and sago.,31
144,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We shall have. Mr WH IRVINE,-Who says so? I am not a protectionist of the class that is prepared to impose protective duties on something which may possibly in the remote future be produced here.",31
145,Mr SALMON,Unknown,The honourable member would prefer a bounty for the encouragement of the industry.,31
146,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I should prefer, if possible, to grant a bounty. we should receive some definite statement from the Treasurer showing whether, taking into account the effect of the whole of the Senate's requests, which the honourable gentleman must have had before him in making up the list of those he proposes to accept, we can afford to lose this amount of revenue.",31
147,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Laanecoorie) [5.20] This is one of those propositions which causes protectionists to have very great misgivings. I am not in favour of revenue duties, and have never voted for them where I could avoid doing so.",31
148,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,All protectionist duties are revenue duties in one sense.,31
149,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"But not in the sense that this is a revenue duty. This duty is undoubtedly purely a revenue duty, and has no protective incidence. Although sago might be grown in Queensland, it is not grown there, or, at all events, to an extent which would warrant us in imposing a duty upon it equal to 40 per cent, ad valorem. I feel, with the honourable member for Flinders, that in the absence of any urgent necessity from the Treasury point of view, we should not impose a duty on this article, and I should, therefore, like to see the request of the Senate agreed to. But I must express mv surprise at hearing honourable members opposite, almost unanimously, condemning a revenue duty, when we know that some of them posed before the country at the last election as revenue tariffists.",31
150,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Who has condemned the duty on sago as' a revenue duty ?,31
151,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"We do not condemn it as a revenue duty, but as an improper revenue duty.",31
152,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Some honourable members opposite have condemned the duty altogether. They have expressed themselves' in favour of the adoption of the Senate's request, and I must express mv surprise that they should have done so in view of the fact that they' are here as professed revenue tarriffists.",31
153,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,What about the honourable gentleman's position ? How - does he intend to vote?,31
154,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"I am going'to ask the Government to agree to the Senate's request. The estimated loss of revenue by tin.' adoption of such a course is £is;Ooo. That is but a small amount, and it has I think been pointed out that we are dealing with an article of food, which by. reason of its portability, is largely used in the interior. I do not agree with the honourable member for Nepean that it is used as a substitute for fruit ; but sago and tapioca are valuable - foods in health or in sickness, and in the circumstances, I hope that the Government will see the advisability of accepting the Senate's request. The honourable member for Herbert advanced an argument, which should have weight with the Committee. He pointed out that since we have taken over the control of New Guinea, we cannot' better assist the development of that territory than by helping settlers there to. grow those products which the country is best adapted to produce. At this time last year, I visited portions - of the Ma-, lay Archipelago, where' both sago and tapioca are grown, and the countf.v and climate .is similar to New Guinea. By adopting the request of the.' Senate we shall do something to assist the development of New Guinea, and, though it may mean a loss of £13,000 of revenue, there are other ways of raising revenue than the imposition of taxation upon an articleof food.",31
155,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,Fawkner) [5.25] I have been somewhat surprised by this request from the Senate. It seems 'to me that it was decided at the last Federal. election to return a Parliament in favour of increases of duties all round.,31
156,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Not at all.,32
157,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,I understood that it was admitted that the result Federal election w.as to return a protectionist majority.,32
158,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Most decidedly.,32
159,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,I think I have heard heard honourable members of the Oppositors tion admit that.,32
160,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,We are not dealing now with a protectionist duty.,32
161,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"We are dealing'with a duty imposed by the first Federal Parliament. I admit that articles of food should be made as cheap as possible, but the first Parliament decided to impose a duty of Jd. per lb. on this article, and there was no great outcry as the result of that decision. I can see no real reason for the abolition of that duty. I should like to repeat the request made by the honourable members for Angas and Flinders, that the Ministei should submit some statement showing the financial result of accepting or rejecting the requests made by the Senate.",32
162,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,The Treasurer has said that it would be immaterial.,32
163,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"I understand that the honourable gentleman estimates that the result of the adoption of the Senate's request in this case would be a loss of revenue to the extent of £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 . I should not describe that as immaterial. If honourable members endeavoured to induce the House to agree to an expenditure of £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 for any purpose, they would find that the amount would not be regarded as immaterial. It is an amount which, in my opinion, is well worth considering. The duty has not been objected to in the past, ancl the people who have used sago have not noticed any increase in the price of the article due to the duty. Mr W. H. IRVINE - It represents duty of between 30 and 40 per cent.",32
164,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"I think that cannot be correct. It is the duty which has been in force since the imposition of the first Federal Tariff, and I see no justifications, tion for its abolition. It seems to me that mation. this House was returned to insist upon the maintenance of a protectionist policy, and I think we should do so.",32
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [5.28] - I am afraid that I cannot agree with the honourable member for Fawkner. The honourable member has given the Comceived mittee a new reading of the mandate of the last election, to which I cannot subscribe. . Mr FAIRBAIRN - I have heard the honourable member say that this is a protecof the last tionist Parliament.",32
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I gravely doubt whether the honourable member has heard me say even that. He has certainly never me say that the mandate of the elecwas for all-round increases of a protective character.,32
167,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,This would not be an increase. It would be maintaining the duty imposed under the first Federal Tariff.,32
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I take a revision of the Tariff to mean an. increase or reduction of duties as the circumstances warrant. It would be a fine thing if we were to appoint a Royal Commission to investigate the Tariff with an understanding that we should give attention to its recommendations if they involved, increases of duties, and not reductions of duties. The honourable member has given us a new reading of the mandate of the electors, and I haye not heard anything like it before in . this House. Honourable members who were absent from the Chamber when I first addressed myself to the question, have since asked the Minister to submit a statement such as I asked for before. When I made the request the Minister's reply was that the requests made by the Senate would, it adopted, make very little difference in the amount of revenue to be derived under the Tariff.",32
169,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It would not be very serious. Perhaps it would mean a difference of £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 , but I shall be able to give the figures more in detail.",32

For nine months of the current financial year we have already re£ 1 , 7 5 0 , 0 0 0 in excess of the revenue received for the whole of last year. Allowing for some slackness which is usual in the last quarter of the year, it is certain that by the end of the current financial year we shall have received £ 2 , 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 more revenue than was received last year, and, with such an increase of revenue, to suggest that we cannot afford to lose £ 1 3 , 0 0 0 from taxation on invalids' and children's foods seems to me to be absurd.",32
175,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [5.31.]. - Before giving a vote as a protectionist upon this question, I wished to know whether this article was grown, or was likely, in the near future, to be grown, in the Commonwealth. I find that practically it is not grown - at all in the Commonwealth. Although I am here as a high protectionist, I cannot agree with the honourable member for Fawkner that this House was returned to vote all-round increases in Tariff duties. If that be so, some of the honourable member's colleagues in the Opposition corner will have some difficulty in explaining some of their votes to their constituents. From what I have heard, I am quite satisfied that this is purely a revenue duty, and, as I stated in discussing the Tariff ""before, I am opposed to revenue duties. Seeing that there has been a substantial increase in the revenue under the new Tariff, the Minister might well give way to the Senate in this particular matter. Motion negatived.

176,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Do I that the Tariff, as it left the House of Representatives, provided for no preference, and that the Senate desire that there shall be a preference?",33
177,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Yes .,33
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Parramatta) [5.41] - I understand that there is no blue imported from foreign countries.,33
179,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I was point out that the proposed preference is really of no use.,33
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"On the contrary, I think this is a case in which a very stantial preference could be given to Great Britain.",33
181,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,Blu e is mostly imported from Great Britain.,33
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"And , therefore, we have a fitting opportunity to give a substantial preference.",33
183,Mr SALMON,Unknown,There can be no preference if there is no competition.,33
184,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Blu e is made all over the world, and we can give a preference, while, at the same time, imposing a duty that should satisfy any bigh-tariffist.",33

I take it that, even now, the Jd. per lb. duty is being charged on sago and tapioca. We have just decided, in response to a request from the Senate, that sago and tapioca should be free, but from when? No time has been stated.",33

We should decide the procedure in respect not only of that, but also of all the other items on which the Senate has' requested amendments in which we concur. When the Tariff was first considered, the date on which the reduction or increase of a duty should begin to operate was fixed. We have not done that in the case of sago and tapioca.",34
190,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The duty has lieen collected up to today. The reduction ought to begin to operate tomorrow.,34
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I doubt if that can be done without some definite arrangement.,34
192,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [5.52] - We should either state with regard to each item the date from which the alteration is to begin to operate, or pass a general resolution to the effect that in all cases the alteration shall begin to operate on the day after it is made. I do not know whether I can go back now, but I shall prepare a motion to the effect that I have suggested.",34
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I have just heard from a very good authority that, on the occasion of the previous Tariff, the alterations were made to operate as from the next day. If that rule is adopted now it will end the difficulty. Mr WyVTSON - It would be . better to specify in regard to each item the date from which the alteration shall operate. If a general clause, such as the Minister suggests, is put in, then, in the event of a case being brought before the High Court, it will be necessary for the Judge to look up the records of the House to find out when the alteration was made. seems rather acomplicated method of doing things. It would be much wiser, when an alteration has been agreed to for the Minister to move an addition to it to the effect that it should operate on and after such and such a date. Each item would then be clear and distinct. The item of sago and tapioca could be recommitted, by consent, afterwards, or even immediately, in order to add the necessary - words.",34
194,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"The item referred' to has been dealt with, and another item has also been dealt with, and a division taken. It would, therefore,. be very irregular to go back to it.",34
195,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"In that case, the easiest way out of the difficulty would be for the Minister to move that the remaining requests be postponed. The objection to a covering resolution such as the Minister suggested is that we cannot include the records of this House in a Statute.",34
196,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,"I agree with the reasoning of the honourable member for South Sydney, but there is a further difficulty that we are now dealing with requests. How does the honourable member suggest that we should amend the requests ?",34
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Unde r the Constitution it is provided that requests may be agreed to with or without modifications.,34
198,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The form of bur amendment is independent of the form of the request made try the Senate.,34

204,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"It is not rice at r all. It is similar to millet, and is used for making brooms.",34
205,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"If that is so, it alters the case.",34
206,Mr SALMON,Unknown,"Wit h regard to the point of procedure, I would suggest to the Minister that he should move that the request be agreed-to, and that the - alteration operate on and after the 23rd April.",34
207,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"There appears to be a doubt as to whether our acceptance or rejection of a request really constitutes at this stage an amendment of the Bill . We are not considering the schedule of the Bill which we sent to the Senate, but are considering requests made by the Senate. It would, therefore, be quite possible to come' to a decision one way or the other on these requests, and then put through formally in Committee the requests which we have agreed to, as amendments.",35

We are now asked to introduce something which has not been put before the Senate - We are asked to put in the schedule-whic h they have the right to see and discuss-ne w terms.,36
229,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,We are nothing in the schedule.,36
230,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,We are asked to say that their requests are to come into operation on certain dates. The Senate did not have that condition in the schedule when it was under consideration.,36
231,Mr WILSON,Unknown,The Senate had not power to deal with that matter.,36
232,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"My point is that in Committee Ave are asked to pass a motion' which will bring into force certain duties. The fact that it is done in response to requests'.from the Senate has nothing to do with the matter. If it be proposed to fix in the schedule the dates Avhen certain duties shall come into force it is really importing a condition or a fact which Avas not previously before the Senate, and it might properly claim that any requests for amendments from this House should be unlimited by condition or time.",36
233,Mr FISHER,Unknown,This is the only branch of the Parliament which can determine when a duty shall come into operation.,36

I do not propose to address the Committee at any length, because we had a long debate on this item on a previous cccasion. 1 noticed that certain statements were made in the Senate. When this duty was carried here, I made a promise to one gentleman in Tasmania that I would try to see that he was not injured through not being able to get supplies of this wax. A firm here agreed to let him have any quantity of the article at - cost price. A statement has been made, I understand, by that gentleman to the effect that he applied to the firm, and that they refused to allow him to have what he required. I am told that several votes were influenced by that fact. I spoke to the chairman of the company.",37
254,Mr STORRER,Unknown,Who said that he applied for it?,37
255,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,A member of the Government told me that.,37
256,Mr STORRER,Unknown,That he applied for it?,37
257,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"I did not say that he applied for it . I stated that he said that he could not get any wax; I think he did say that he applied for it, too, but I forget that part of his statement. However, I made a definite promise. I took a great deal of trouble to see that the man was not injured. I got a promise from the makers here a week or two ago, and, - very fortunately, the reply came to me in the presence of the Prime Minister. I spoke to the chairman of the company, who is the acting-mayor. I told him that it was not fair to me, or to the man himself, if his statements were correct.",37
258,Mr STORRER,Unknown,Thes e large firms will promise anything to get what they want.,37
259,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The actingmayor came away from a meeting of the directors of the company.

261,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Of paraffine wax. I wanted tp put myself right in regard to the matter, and to say that the firm were, and are, prepared to let the man have what he wanted at cost price. I do ziot like tactics such as those to which that gentleman resorted.",37
262,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,For how long will the firm supply him?,37
263,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,So long as he requires paraffine wax.,37
264,Mr WATSON,Unknown,That article is now being manufactured in New South Wales also.,37
265,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Exactly .,37
266,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,The firm are not under a legal obligation to supply this man.?,37
267,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,No ; but they are willing to place themselves under a legal obligation.,37
268,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"Are they prepared to do that'? . Sir. WILLIAM LYNE - Yes . The chairman of the board of directors was highly indignant that such a statement as that to which I have referred should have been made. I wish the Committee to understand that, because I felt annoyed that I should have made a promise to this particular individual which was not carried out. But, as the honourable member for South Sydney has said, New South Wales is now manufacturing paraffine wax, and will do so to a considerable extent before very long. I hope that the request of the Senate will not be agreed to.",37
269,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"North Sydney) [6.22] - The explanation made by the Treasurer is rather an extraordinary one. That he, as a Minister of the Crown, should have interested himself in negotiations between firms regarding the purchase and sale of material, is, I hope, without precedent. Such a course of action is highly improper, especially when it is undertaken with a view to influencing the rates of duty fixed by this Parliament.",37
270,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It was not undertaken for that reason at all.,37
271,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"I do not understand what other reason there could be for the Treasurer's action. An interference by a Minister of the Crown in the sale or purchase of goods between traders is .altogether improper. On the strength of some arrangement that the Treasurer has succeeded in making, this Committee is now asked to accept his statement that, for a number of years, a certain firm will supply an article that' it produces at cost price. The simplicity of such a proposal is without a parallel. In the first place, I do not see how any firm could give such an undertaking, and, in the second, I do not know how anybody could arrive at what was their ""cost p r i c e "" of production. I am in favour of the reduction requested by the Senate, but I am opposed to that class of argument being brought to bear in this Parliament for the purpose of influencing the votes of honourable members. I say again that it is highly undesirable that Ministers should interfere in negotiations between traders for the purchase and sale of material.",37
272,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea - ber surer) [6.25] - I cannot allow ment of the honourable member, for North Sydney to pass without challenge, because Treasurer. it embodies an absolute misrepresentation of the facts of the case. Honourable bers in this chamber had urged as an argusecond ment in favour of a reduction of on paraffine wax that a particular individual was unable to purchase supplies where, and that the firm to which allusion has been made, refused to supply it. stated at the time that they would supply it both in New South Wales and Victoria. Until after the vote had been taken in this House, I had no negotiations with that than that. firm whatever. It was only after a division had been taken that they made arrangement to give effect to a promise I plied ? had made when the matter was under consideration in this chamber. is no harm in a Minister doing a thing that sort. It was only last challenged the manager of the company with not having carried out that ment.",38

274,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The Prime reasonable .Minister was present when the chairman .of duces. directors and the manager of the company told me that they were prepared to supply any quantity of that material. Under these circumstances, I resent the accusation .that I have done something improper.",38
275,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"South Sydney) [6.26] It sounds very horrifying to be told that the Treasurer has been engaged in bargaining between. traders;. but there is really nocompany thing to worry about, seeing that the statement that he could not obtain a supply of paraffine wax in Australia was definitely made by the only person whom I know to be concerned in this matter. Apart altogether from the Treasurer's investigation, I believe, as the result of inquiry, that that person can be supplied from New South Wales if he so desires.",38
276,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Mr Georgeson will not supply him.,38
277,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I am informed that he will. Against the statements of honourable members from Tasmania, we have the statements of business men that they are .willing to supply any number of tons of paraffine wax.",38

288,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"West Sydney) [6.29]. - We have been told that this particular will sell its paraffine wax at cost price. I quite agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that that is a very indefinite, and almost impossible, standard to arrive at. Certainly the proposal is not a business one. Let us suppose that the Commonwealth Oil Corporation commences to produce paraffine wax. The mere fact that it produces that article is no guarantee that it will sell it.",38
289,Unknown,Unknown,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.4.5 p.m.,39
290,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"All I desire to add is, that the statement made by the Treasurer as to the undertaking to be made by the firms in question, appears to me to be, on the surface, one that is either quite satisfactory or entirely unsatisfactory according to whether.it is a'legal and binding bargain. The intrusion of the Minister into this transaction I conceive to be quite in harmony with the policy of this Parliament, which is in favour of what is termed the new protection; and that is most em-, phatically an interference by the State in the business of the capitalist, the consumer, and the employee. Whether it be a right or a wrong thing to do, that is emphatically the policy of this Parliament. Mr Bruce . SMITH - The question whether the undertaking is legal or illegal.",39
291,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"It is not sufficient to say that' th£ manufacturers will - sell at a certain price. It is not sufficient to say that they are going to make the article in Australia. We want an undertaking that tliey will engage to sell to any person who wishes to buy. I understand . that the agents of one of these, firms are prepared to give an undertaking - whether it be a - good thing or a bad one is for the Committee to say-that they will sell as much paraffine wax as the users of it wish t.o buy, at the price that the Standard Oil people are charging, for paraffine wax, whatever that price happens to be at any particular time, less the duty.. They undertake to give a three years' guarantee .to do that. That appears to me-, on the surface, to be a perfectly fair proposal'. ' The only weak point ln. it is that there may be sucb a thing as a combination between the Rockefeller Trust and this Australian Corporation. The representative of t.he firm here says that nothing is more unlikely. I do not share his opinion to quite the extent that some people appear to do. It is quite possible that there may be a combination. fore I fancy that if an agreement were arrived at, that the local firm would, during three years, sell at 4d., or at .the price for which the Rockefeller Trust was selling, whichever price was lower, that would be a sufficientguarantee. I suggest to the Minister that such a guarantee might be obtained, to sell as much paraffine wax as any person wishes to buy at a price equal to that at which the imported article is being sold less the. duty, or at 4d., whichever is the lower price, during a period of three years. If that arrangement could be made, I could not see my way to vote - against an industrythat might be of some service to New South Wales, a State which has been overlooked in many respects in .connection with this Tariff. As this is a bond iide enterprise, and no person is going to be placed at a disadvantage by reason of the proposal of the Government, I shall support it. ' Mr Bruce SMITH (Parkes) [7.49]. - I think that we require to review the position and see what we are discussing, because the honourable member who has just sat down has branched off into a number of details which seemed to me. to have no bearing upon the question. This branch of the Legislature resolved that a duty of i d . per lb. should be placed on stearine and is paraffine wax. The Senate has requested that the duty be. made Jd. In the course of - some observations made by the Treasurer for the purpose of justifying his proposal that we should resist the. request of the Senate, the honourable gentleman' told us of certain interviews that he had had with an individual manufacturer, followed by interviews, with the directors of a particular company who had this commodity to sell. I quite agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that it is a very irregular tiling for a Minister of the Crown of a great country like Australia to be having private interviews with individual manufacturers and with the directors of companies who happen to have the commodity which some particular manufacturers want, and then to make those ex parte and interested statements the basis for legislative action. The Treasurer has asked the Committee to take a .certain course upon the strength of information which he professes to have gathered from these unrecorded and unauthorized interviews.",39

296,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"I am looking after the interests of the little man as well. We have to consider the matter from the to point of view of those engaged in the industry, and of Australia generally. If we have to do some harm-and I am not saying that any harm whatever will be done-to any manufacturer, we certainly should not injure 4,000 employees in order imto protect about twenty. I do. not think to that the honourable member for Bass would desire t'o do that. But if we were to adopt How the request of the Senate, the result would That be to allow a vast quantity of paraffine wax to come into this country, to the injury of an industry in which hundreds of employees their are engaged. We should simply admit a commodity produced by coloured labour at very cheap rates. A very important conin relation to this subject is connected with the different by-products that I understand that oleine If and glycerine are being manufactured.

It is a business connected with the moulding of candles; that requires very little labour. For the sake of this industry we are asked to penalize the manufacturers of stearine and the by-products, which involve the emtection ployment of a great quantity of labour and the use of a considerable amount of maof chinery. For these reasons, I am glad that the Minister is going to stand fast, and to accept the request of the Senate.",41
301,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [7.59] - The one Treasurer has stated that a good deal has been said on this question. That is true. But after all that was said on occasion in support of the claims put forward for the large company interested the manufacture of paraffine wax, the result in this House was that the duty was carried by twenty-five to twenty-one-show ing a majority of only four. The Senate carried its request by twenty-three votes five, showing that the opinion on the quesagreed tion in that Chamber was very strong. I think it fortunate for . the Commonwealth of Australia that we have a House in which the interests of the States are considered against those of a few* interested persons who happen to have a large sum of money invested in a great business. When the matter was being discussed before, the Treasurer thought it right to say that tain manufacturer of candles, who hapsome pened to be in the gallery, was looking after his own interests; the honourable gentleman made no mention of the fact that he knew the representative of another and wealthy company to be within the precincts at the time. His remarks were not calcumade lated to uphold the dignity of his high and important office. A great deal has said, about the amount of capital requisite for the manufacture of stearine. At the scarcely present time there are only four manufacthe turers in Australia, and if the duty is fixed at the rate they ask for, they will enter [374]' into a combine. It may be said that I , as a protectionist, should vote for the higher rate, but, as I told the people of Tasmania when I first offered myself as a candidate for a seat in this Chamber, I am not a of .the Victorian, that is, of the high prohibitive, school, because, in my opinion, a prohibitive Tariff would lead to the establishment' of monopolies, to which",41

I voted for the proof the Queensland sugar industry as readily as I have voted for the protection Tasmanian industries. The manufacture which employs only twenty or thirty hands not is as important to those dependent upon it as is a large industry.

305,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"When Federation was - inaugurated there were four, two of whom have since gone under, whereas, if the rate to of duty supported by the Treasurer is to, the others will also disappear, and Tasmania will have still further cause to regret having entered the Union. When she did so, her people thoughtthat the as small industries, as well as the large, would be considered. My view has always been that the poor man and the small company should be studied rather than the rich man and the large companies, which can a cerlook after themselves. Unfortunately, honourable members seem likely to go back on their former votes. The honourable member for West Sydneyon the last occasion, voted for a duty of Jd. per lb., is now going to vote for a duty of i d . Some very strange statements have been in connection with this duty. For instance, Mr Kitchen, in the circular which been he has sent out, states thatIn the moulding of paraffine wax or stearine any labpur is required. I estimate that labour in the manufacture of stearine comes to something like 85 per cent., the other 15 per cent, being employed in the moulding of the candles. He professes to speak for three other manufacturers, one of whom, Mr Upton, wrote some years agoIt has been contended that in the conversion of tallow into stearine, a good deaf of labour employed,, but Jhis is not correct. men and boys,'under the control of the technical head, are all that is needed, but the real pense for manual labour comes in afterwards in the moulding-room, where . cutting, polishing,' packing, labelling, box-making, &c., &cl, ried on. While the cost of converting tallow into stearine will benefit - the labourer to the extent qf ios. per ton, the moulding into candles -.vill cost £ 3 ios - per ton, and, of course, labour is the same whether paraffine is used. It has been stated that . Mr Kitchen - is ready to supply a certain quantity of paraffine wax, but, as he manufactures stearine and not paraffine wax, there appears to be some confusion on the point. I 'have the authority of one of the manufacturers in Tasmania for saying that he is willing to take 200 tons tomorrow if Mr Kitchen will supply him. at the price at which he is now .purchasing from the Standard Oil Company. Mr Kitchen has told the Treasurer that he is prepared to sell paraffine wax at cost price.",41
306,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"How can do so, if he does not manufacture it? :",42
307,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"That is the question. He must be speaking of stearine. It has been complained that paraffine wax candles are injurious. to miners, but in Tasmania(hese candles 'are not used in mines. They are used for household purposes, and p r i vate persons are satisfied with them; while their manufacture is a profitable industry, and gives employment to labour.",42
308,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"How many are employed in making these candles? - Mr STORRER - I never ask how many are employed in an industry. If ' I ' know an industry to exist, I do what I can for. its preservation : just as I voted for the protection of the Brisbane glass industry. As the population of Tasmania, increases, the number of hands emplo\'ed in her industries will increase. Every industry must have a beginning. We should not allow a local companv to be destroyed by firms having their head-quarters in London, and remitting there any profits that they may make. I hope that the' Committee will deal fairly with the industries of Tasmania, and make the amendment requested by the Senate, reducing the duty to Jd. per lb.",42

329,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Newcastle) [8.15] - I regret that some honourable members should desire to deal with this duty on a wholly different basis.from that on which we have approached the - consideration of other items. In determining what should be the duty imposed on any article. I am not concerned' with the - relations between the firms engaged in its manufacture. contention is, as it was when the - Tariff was first under consideration, that stearine and paraffine represent the chief labour involved in the manufacture of candles, and that we should not be justified in imposing a heavv duty solely to protect those ' engaged in the moulding branch of the industry,'. The greater part of the labour in[374]-2 ' volved in the making of candles relates really to the production of stearine and its by-products, on the one hand, and to paraffine as a by-product of oil production on the other. The stearine and-paraffine having been manufactured and. made available, only a few boys are necessary to mould all ' the candles required to supply any one State. If this request be agreed to, we shall have the anomaly of a duty of i j d ! pec lb. on candles, and of only Jd. per lb. on the stearine and paraffine used in their manufacture. In other words, those engaged in the manufacture of stearine and paraffine will 'be protected to the extent only of Jd. per lb., whilst a protection of d . per lb. will be given to those, engaged in moulding.

Between 3,000 and 4,000 are employed directly and indirectly in. the manufacture of stearine and its by-products. We have to remember the men engaged in producing the machinery used in the. industry, theminers employed in getting out the coal consumed by it , and the fact that only Australian materials are used in it . I should not allow paraffine wax to be used in the manufacture of candles intended for use in mines on the mainland, and ' I - think that the same rule might also be applied .with advantage to. Tasmania. Plants which were previously producing stearine are now lying idle. I desire the duties to be so arranged that we shall have genuine stearine candles placed on the market: CerMv tain firms are importing paraffine wax and employing 75 per cent, of it in the manufacture of candles, only 25 per cent, of stearine being used. Candles so made are purchased by people' who imagine that they are obtaining a really good article, when, as a matter of fact, they are purchasirg that which is absolutely dear at any price.",43

In this State there are men working 4,000 feet below the surface, under conditions that are bad from almost every stand-point. The miners find that paraffine wax. candles give off a disagreeable odour, and they are loud in their demand for a better article. I find, on looking at the schedule, that the duty on candles made wholly or partly of paraffine wax is i j d . per lb.",44
340,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,That is . preferential rate. Imports from Germany - fro m countries other than the United Kingdom-ar e dutiable at 2d. perlb.,44
341,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"We import seme candles from black-labour countries, but not from Germany. If we are to place this duty on an equitable basis, we must take care to give the larger measure of protection to those engaged in the manufacture of stearine and wax, since the labour involved in that branch. of manufacture is f ar in excess of that required for the moulding of candles. We should refuse the Senate's request, and so compel our own manufacturers to put a good stearine candle on the market.",44
342,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,The men to whom the honourable member would give a monopoly are using paraffine wax.,44
343,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"So far as one can judge, there does not appear to be ground for the allegation that a monopoly exists, having^in view the fact that candles are imported into Victoria from New South Wales and South Australia, and that Victorian and South Australian candles - are also used in New South Wales. I do not deny that paraffine wax is used in the manufacture of composite candles here, because the Customs statistics show that, as the local production of candles has increased, our imports of paraffine wax have also increased. . I'desire to do away with that - importation. It is difficult, by looking at them, to distinguish between a pure stearine candle and one made chiefly of paraffine wax, but as soon as one of the latter is placed in a buggy lamp or in a mine, and are such subjected to any heat, it bends, and may be tied in a knot. Many people buy comare being posite candles, believing that they are made of stearine. I should like to see stearine more generally used. Tallow, even in its is a raw state, will furnish a good light for the miner; converted into stearine, it makes the best candles of which I know. By adopting a policy which will lead to the general manufacture of. stearine candles in Australia, we shall benefit,, not only those employed in the stearine industry, but pastoralists and farmers engaged in raising cattle, as well as the consumers generally.",44
344,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,Are any pure stearine candles made in Australia?,44
345,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Some are made in my own electorate.' If we reject this request, we shall not place the industry in Tasmania in a worse position than it occupied before this Tariff was introduced. Those engaged there in moulding wax into the candles then had the protection of a duty of Jd. per lb., and if we reject this request they will continue to enjoy the same measure of protection. ' Listening to the speeches of some of the representatives of Tasmania, one would imagine that it was proposed to do an injury to the industry in that State. We have no desire to do anything of the k in d ; but those who favour this request are really seeking to destroy a big industry in Australia by granting a protection of i d . per lb. to those engaged in moulding candles, whilst allowing a protection of only Jd. per lb. on the production of stearine The official statistics show that our imports of paraffine wax have largely increased since 1902. In 1904 we imported £ 1 3 , 6 4 8 worth; in 1905, £ 4 2 , 2 6 9 worth; and in 1906, £ 7 6 , 3 4 5 worth.",44
346,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,What was the decrease in the importation of candles during that time?,44
347,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"The figures I have quoted support m y contention that stearine candles are not being made here as largely as they ought to be. I hope that this request will be refused. The Committee should see that the duty is fixed with some regard for the labour employed, in the industry. If the duty of i d . is imposed the Tasmanian - moulders referred to will still be employed.

363,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) [8.49] - This motion has been submitted very quietly,- as .though there was some intention to smuggle it through, but I desire that the facts should be known. Glucose, I understand, is in America made from old boots and - things of that sort, and is used, amongst other purposes, for fortifying champagne. wax is extracted from shale and refined petroleum; and I ask whether that Cocoa is a proper ingredient for confectionery ?. use Then, I do not like to think of the public chewing plaster of Paris. . This material of is bad enough in Italian statuary as an trinkets apology for art, and is still worse as an I ask the Committee per to endorse the request of the Senate, and, on and if possible, to go further and prohibit the importation of any such confectionery. It has been said that this is not a strangled aid. industry, though it would appear that the used are well calculated. to choke those who consume such confectionery. ! Mr MCWILLIAMS - Would the able member also prohibit local manufacturers from using those ingredients ?",46
364,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Certainly . I suppose that plaster of Paris is used mainly for. ornamentation purposes, but, at the same time, it. is not a proper material from which to make confectionery.",47
365,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Flinders) [8.52]. - - - I agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Dalley in reference to .the use of paraffine wax and plaster of Paris in the manufacture of confectionery; .and I am sure that honourable members will agree that their importation in such connection ought to be prohibited.,47
366,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"But in' the sence of an Excise duty or of State laws and which he assisted 'those ingredients could continue to by Australian manufacturers. . Mr WH IRVINE - We are not now be. dealing with local manufacturers, and have a suggestion to make which I think 'may meet the difficulty. ' I never heard glucose being made - out of old boots; understand it is made principally from - maize, and is a useful and necessary article without restriction. ; in the production of certain classes of meats. - Mr WILSON - And not harmful. - Mr WH IRVINE - A - f u l - if properly produced.

Mr HUTCHISON (Hindmarsh) [8.55]. the - I agree with the honourable member Flinders in reference to the use of glucose, - but I hope that the Minister of Trade .Customs will exercise the powers he has under existing laws, and prohibit the portation of confectionery containing dele'terious substances.",47
367,Mr MCWILLIAMS,Unknown,"Is plaster, of Paris 'not used only for the purposes of ornathat ment ?",47
368,Mr HUTCHISON,Unknown,"There are many things used in the production of 'food 'are just as bad as plaster of Paris; and ' if I were the Minister of Trade and Cushibit 'toms, I should not hesitate to exercise powers of ' prohibition. There seems to a difference of opinion as to whether or cerned. - not glucose is injurious; but I - am willing to allow that commodity to be used , in the manufacture of sweetmeats. Doubtless the Minister w i i l promise, if we Sir WILLIAM LYNE - agree to the duty of 46., that he will 'cisc his powers of - prohibition, if he finds it is injurious. honorthat ingredients so injurious as paraffine wax and plaster of Paris are still being used.",47
369,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [8.57] - I am in agreement with honourable members who seek to prohibit, .as f ar as possible, the importation of confectionery containing such deleterious substances. We must, however, have regard to fairness as between local and foreign makers.",47
370,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"Bot h ought to be prohibited from using such ingredients. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK-Precisely ; but we have power in this connection to deal only with goods that come oversea. The Commerce Act, the virtues of which the abhonorable member for Hindmarsh extols, in passing, be used cannot. apply to any commodity produced locally, however injurious it may The suggestion of the honourable I member means that foreign makers shall be prevented from sending here confecof tionery containing plaster of Paris or I paraffine wax, while local manufacturers shall be allowed to use those ingredients t h is request originsweetated in the Senate, with an idea of following up the import duty with an Excise duty of a similar amount on locally-pron d not harmduced confectionery.",47
371,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"If such confectionery is injurious, its manufacture and sale ought to be absolutely prohibited.",47
372,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Exactly ; and I suggest that it would be better tb leave matter over until it can be dealt with, for not in the present proposed piece-meal fashion, but in a thorough manner. In the and Senate it was intended to recommit this item, for the purpose of imposing an Eximcise duty, but the matter was overlooked.",47
373,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,It was not overlooked ; no items were recommitted.,47
374,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I understand ' honourable senators, if they were here, would propose the deletion of this item until the matter could .be., dealt with in a which thorough manner. We only penalize the importation of - this stuff; we - do not proit. If the importers cam get through my the fourpenny Tariff, they can poison all be Australia so f ar as this provision is conI f we think this kind of thing quite ought not to come in, the proper course to take would be to prohibit it altogether. I believe the Minister has that power. - It s importation can exerbe prohibited under the Commerce Act if I have just received a memorandum stating that under the Victorian Pure Food Act the presence of paraffine wax and plaster of Paris in confectionery is prohibited.",47
375,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Therefore , the Victorian State authorities have already taken action to protect the people from that kind of thing. We may agree to the Minister's motion on account of the fact that the. request only partly carries out the Senate's intention. Had they completed their work, as they intended - to do, they would have proposed to penalize the local manufacture, as well as the importation, of these substances. That would be fair. If any proposal is made to leave out glucose, and to adopt the remainder of the requested amendment, I shall be compelled to vote for it.",48
376,Mr KNOX,Unknown,Le t us eliminate the whole amendment.,48
377,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I think it would be better, until we can deal with the matter properly. The only way to deal with it is by means of total prohibition.",48
378,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Dalley) '[9.3] - I am pleased to hear that honourable members de-sire to prohibit the importation of confectionery containing these substances. Is it the Minister's intention, if we do not adopt the request, to prohibit their importation under the Commerce Act?",48
379,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I am not the Minister who will - deal with that.,48
380,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Then I should like the Minister of Trade and Customs to give a definite answer to my question. I am not anxious to be poisoned by confectionery which comes in either under a 4d. duty or free, or to see Australians poisoned by it. I want to be sure that I am not buying an article from which I do not get full value. If I agree to the Minister's motion, is it the intention of the Government to prohibit the importation of these articles?",48
381,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Thei r importation cannot be prohibited unless they are considered injurious under the Commerce Act. It can be prohibited under that Act.,48
382,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"Every honourable member who has spoken has admitted that these substances are deleterious in confectionery. I am invited to vote for the motion on the ground that their importation will be prohibited. Unless we get a statement to that effect from the Government, I shall be compelled to vote .against the motion. No one can contend that these substances are fit for human consumption.  delighted at the anxiety of the honourable member for Dalley - to protect the young from deleterious materials put into lollies, but if the honourable member visited the factories around Melbourne, and in other parts, he would find tons of glucose being used. - Mr TUDOR - They make no secret of the fact that glucose ""is usedhere. They cannot get good results without it.  gives a better finish to the article, and I cannot discover that it has any deleterious effect upon those who consume the lollies made from it. Are we to say that the local article can be made from any ingredients which the manufacturers like to use, but that goods which come from reputable firms like Fry's and Cadbury's, in the United Kingdom, are to be shut out because they contain the same ingredients?",48
383,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"We can get level with the local manufacturer by' an Excise duty.  posing an Excise duty has passed. The idea in the Senate, when this request was agreed to, was to impose an Excise duty also, so as to reach the local manufacturer. The Minister has all the power necessary to prohibit importations, but I do not want him or the Committee to fall into the trap of preventing the importation of certain goods because they contain ingredients the use of which is allowed in Australia. Thatwould be placing a dangerous weapon in the hands of a keen protectionist, such as the Treasurer is, but I do. not think that he would use his .power to that extent. The Minister's motion should be agreed to. The State authorities can if they like deal with the sale, not only of locally-made, but of imported confectionery containing these substances. Victoria has done so, and other States can do the same.",48
384,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"Nepean) [9.10] - At the present stage of the manufacture of sweets, glucose is absolutely necessary in many of them. Chocolate creams and confections of that kind could not be made as a commercial commodity without it. It prevents them from getting hard. We are all at one in not wanting ourselves or our children to be poisoned with plaster' of Paris or paraffine wax. But the difficulty is that a fourpenny duty will not prohibit the importation of confectionery containing those substances. It will not prohibit the importation of those light ornaments used on wedding cakes. But if we agree to the requested amendment, while the articles could still be imported the Minister of Trade and Customs would not be able to exercise his power of prohibition under the Commerce Act, because there would be this express enactment in the Customs Tariff Act allowing them to be imported at a certain rate of duty. If we do not make this provision in the Customs Tariff Act, the Minister of Trade and Customs, if convinced that the articles are deleterious, can prohibit their importation under the Commerce Act. Therefore the course advocated by the honourable member for Dalley may be the very means of allowing these things to be imported. It will be better to leave the matter to the discretion of the Minister. Motion agreed to. Requested amendment not made. Item 46.

385,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,North I Sydney) [9.13]--Will the Minister state what he proposes to do with the request - new paragraph D ?,49
386,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I propose to accept it.,49
387,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"It is very undesirable that these distinctions should be made, such as having one rate of duty below a certain invoice price, and another rate of duty above it , more especially in an article which is not of large consumption or of very large importation. It only creates confusion to have the difference between the duty on an article which costs is. and on an article which costs is. oJd., not merely one of amount, as under an ad valorem duty, but the difference between a fixed rate and an ad valorem rate. It only complicates the Tariff and makes the difficulties greater for the Department and the importers. The Minister should adopt either an ad valorem or a fixed rate throughout. ' I am not suggesting to him what that rate should be.",49
388,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,There are numbers of cases where the ad valorem system is departed from.,49
389,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"There are very few instances of the kind now proposed. A duty of 3d. per lb. oh the cheaper grades of liquorice is very much more per cent, than is a duty of 25 per cent, on the dearer grades. Is that desirable? In the interests of the Department, as well as of the importers, the Minister should consider the advisability of either preserving the old duty, or imposing an ad valorem duty all round. I think that all kinds of liquorice should'be subjected to a similar duty, whether it be ad valorem, or per lb.",49
390,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Wentworth) [9.16] - I should like the Minister to state one or two of the reasons why he wishes the Committee to disagree with the Senate's request. As regards liquorice, the Tariff Commission made a unanimous recommendation. I hope that the Minister will recognise that the Committee is entitled to receive an explanation at his hand's, especially in view of. the fact that the Tariff Commission unanimously recommended the duty which has been suggested by the Senate. """,49
391,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The object is to bring the cheaper grades of liquorice under the same rate of duty as confectionery. pro- Mr DUGALD THOMSON (North v Sydney) [9.17] - I should like to hear the Minister's opinion of my suggestion, which, assure him, was not made in an antagonistic way. I believe that if he will only for consider the matter, he will recognise the wisdom of adopting one rate of duty.",49
392,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The honourable member will see that one request deals with liquorice, which is dutiable at 3d. per lb., that is the same rate as confectionery, and that the other, request deals with liquorice, which, including the inside packages, exceeds is. per lb. in value.",49
393,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,"If the Minister wishes to bring liquorice under the same rate of duty as confectionery, it should be made dutiable at 3d. per lb. all round. Some descriptions of confectionery cost much mare than is. per lb., and are dutiable at 3d. per lb. But in the case of liquorice,' a different method is adopted, and what is a comparatively small item as compared with confectionery, is divided into two classes, one class being subjected to a fixed duty, and the other to an ad valorem duty. No necessity has been found to deal in that way with the much larger item of confectionery. The Minister is seeking to make a difference, which, I assure him, will prove very often inconvenient to the Department, and often puzzling to the importers. He says that he desires to put liquorice on the same footing as confectionery, but. the Senate has put it on quite a different footing. I ask him to carry out his own intention.",49
394,Mr KNOX,Unknown,"Kooyong) [9.20] - It is yery difficult, indeed, to hear exactly what view the Minister expresses when the discussion is carried on in an undertone. So far as I understand the position, he wants the Committee to disagree with .the Senate's request that liquorice should bear a duty of 2d. per lb. I entirely agree with the last speaker that a composite - duty on a small item of this kind is highly objectionable. If the Minister would agree to impose a specific duty of 2^d. per lb. on all kinds of liquorice, the trade would know better how they stood. But to differentiate between grades of liquorice, and to levy a duty of 25 per cent, on liquorice invoiced at more that is. per lb., is to troduce a complication, for which I fail to see any justification. I trust that the Committee will resist the attempt to impose a composite duty, because it would be against the interests of the trade. The manufacture of pure liquorice of proper weight is being undertaken by a leading firm here, and deserves support at the hands of the Committee. The Minister has not made a sufficient explanation to enable us to understand properly the attitude of the Government on this item. I think that we are entitled to know' the reasons which are actuating them. .",50
395,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"Hume-Trea surer) [9.24] - I am asking the Committee to disagree with the Senate's request to reduce the duty on certain grades of liquorice from 3d. to 2d. per lb. The request to impose a duty of 25 per cent, on - liquorice invoiced at more than is. per lb. was agreed to by the Ministers in the Senate, to bring certain grades of liquorice into line and for fairly good reasons, I believe. I do not feel quite justified in repudiating what they did. on that occasion.",50

"" Mr DUGALD THOMSON ' (North Sydney) [9-50] - This is one of the items to which the Treasurer assented when it was previously' under consideration in this Chamber. I then raised the question as to why a duty of 4d. per lb. should be imposed upon dried herbs, seeing that dried vegetables were dutiable only at 20 per cent. A duty of 4d. per lb. upon dried herbs is an enormous one, and I fail to see why we should differentiate between the rate levied upon those herbs and that imposed upon dried vegetables. agreed to make the duty 20 per cent. I have before me the Hansard report of the debate when that proposal was accepted by him. The only difference between dried vegetables and dried herbs is that dried vegetables go direct to the consumer, whilst dried herbs are used by manufacturers. This duty is therefore a tax upon them. Surely if a duty of 20 per cent, on dried vegetables is sufficient, that rate should also be sufficient for dried herbs.",52

LYNE) pro- Mr Foster - To what vegetables does the honourable member refer? Mr DUGA LD THOMSON - In the drying of such vegetables as cabbages, carrots, and potatoes, the loss is greater than in drying herbs. Honourable members have received many protests from ' manufacturers who use dried herbs, and who do not see why they should be called upon to pay 4d. per lb., which in many cases is over 100 per cent., whereas the in users of dried vegetables are only charged 20 per cent.

423,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"The request was carried by sixteen to twelve. Mr DUGALD . THOMSON - But we carried the duty to which we agreed unanimously; there was no division. When the Treasurer objects to an agreement made by his colleague in another place being departed from, why should he ask this Committee to depart from an agreement made by The Treasurer him here?

Surely, therefore, it must commend itself to protectionists that the duty should not be as high as that on the finished article. The makers of sauces and chutneys, and butchers who make sausages, have to use dried herbs. It is inconsistent in honourable members to contend for a duty of 4d. per lb. on a raw material whilst they .support a duty of 20 per cent, on a finished article.

Requested amendment in item 61 (Vegetables, &c), adding new paragraph "" Herbs dried not medicinal, per lb., 4d.,"" within the time referred to. made. Item 67. Hay and Chaff, per cwt., is . ; and on and after 31st October, 1907, free. Request - Mak e the duty is.",52
427,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"Riverina) [10.10] wish the Government and the Committee to accept the Senate's request with a. modithe fication. I intend to propose the addition of the words "" not to come into force until 31st October, 1908."" That would bepractically six months from the present date. My reason for proposing this modification of the Senate's request is that, iir the northern part of Victoria and the southwestern part of New Soi'th Wales, stock are dying in thousands consequence of the existence of a droug'i-,. In some districts it is impossible f. r stock-owners to obtain fodder for their stock at any price. In other districts, I was informed no later than yesterday, that £ 8 per ton is being.... 26 paid for bad chaff, which is purchased by .. -17 stock-owners to keep their sheep, dairy cattle, and working horses alive. Whilst I am always prepared to protect native in- ' AVES dustries, I believe I can assume that people in more favoured districts, who have a little surplus of fodder at the present time, have no wish to take advantage of persons in less favoured districts, who are being ruined day after day in consequence of the lack of fodder for their stock.",53
428,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The same principle ' should apply to the duties on oats and maize and other kinds of fodder.,53
429,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"I shall be prepared to apply the same principle to other kinds of NOES . fodder. I have not had an opportunity to speak' to the Treasurer about a modification of the Senate's request, but the hon T orablegentleman has already announced that it is the intention of the Government to accept the Senate's request on this item.",53
430,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,Unknown,The Treasurer will have to move a motion for the acceptPAIBS. ance of the Senate's request before the honourable member can submit his proposed! modification.,53
431,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"That is so; but I wish now to indicate that it is my intention to propose the addition of the words; "" not to come into effect until 31st October,. 1908."" By that time. I hope that the serious drought to which I refer will have come to an end.",53
432,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,There maythen be a drought somewhere else.,53
433,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,It is improbable B. that there can be a drought anywhere else In the coastal districts the grass is now growing.,53
434,Mr BOWDEN,Unknown,"The honourable member's proposal might relieve the people 111 whom he is interested, but what about .the - I ' people in other districts ? ' Mr CHANTER - The fact that in coastal - districts there is sufficient grass growing to keep cattle alive will be no relief to stock-owners in the Riverina and in the northern portion of Victoria. well known that it has been found impossible to transfer stock from the Riverina to the coastal districts because of the shortage of trucks in New South Wales, and the fact that those which might be availed of are engaged six weeks ahead.",53
435,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,Why should we' impose a duty on hay and chaff at all if it is only operative at a time of practical famine in some parts of the Commonwealth?,54
436,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,I might remind the honourable member that the duty acted as a protective duty in the interests of Australian producers at a time when there was no drought in the Commonwealth.,54
437,Mr WH IRVINE,Unknown,To what occasion does the honourable member refer?,54
438,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,I refer to a time when maize was imported to Sydney from New Caledonia.,54
439,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,Maiz e does not. come under this item;,54
440,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"1I have already dealt with that in reply to the right honourable member for Swan, and I have said that I am prepared to take similar action with respect to the duties imposed on maize, oafs, or other kinds of fodder for stock. . Mr HEDGES - Onl y a month or two ago the honourable member voted against what he now proposes.",54
441,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"No , the honourable member is absolutely wrong. I am doing now exactly what I did before in trying to convince the Committee of the serious nature of. the drought.",54
442,Mr HEDGES,Unknown,We intend to support the honourable member.,54
443,Mr CHANTER,Unknown,"That being so, I shall not say another word.",54
444,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Parramatta) [10.18] - I suggest that the Treasurer might agree now to report progress - I look upon this as one of the most important items in. the Tariff. The proposals made in connection with it will require careful consideration, and we .have already done a good night's work.",54
445,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,"T have no objection. I wish to see'what would be the effect of the proposed modification, suggested by the honourable, member for Riverina. Perhaps I may be prepared to agree to it tomorrow. - Progress .reported. House adjourned at 10.19 P- - m It is",54
