SURVEY OF CBE ROUTE BETWEEN AUSwere TRALIA AND TASMANIA-KERAN G TELEmiddle PHONE SERVICE. . Mr KING O'MALLEY - In view of cember, the fact that a survey of alternative routes In for a cable between Tasmania and the cently mainland is now being made, I should like to ask the Postmaster-General whether it is intended to survey a route via King specially Island ?",14
1,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Orders have been three given that a route via King Island is to there. be surveyed together with others.,14
2,Mr SAMPSON,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Postmaster-General whether the following paragraph in regard to the telephone serthough vice, which appeared in this morning's issue of the Argus, is correctKerang is suffering at the present time from there. departmental disorganization. It was decided to give Kerang a local service, and an officer was sent up to make .all the necessary arrangements. Subsequently, a line foreman was in-' structed to carry out the work, and he went to Kerang with all possible speed. But when he got on the spot he found that the engineer planned the new service had omitted to obtain the poles required. The line foreman had to return to Melbourne without really fulfilling mission, and an inspector was sent up to things right. If the complaint is correct, have steps been taken to remedy it forthwith ?",14
3,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"The honourable member was good enough to inform me that he proposed to ask this question. I find that the paragraph, instead of being correct, is about as incorrect as it could possibly be. The first duty devolving upon those who petitioned for the exchange some months ago, has not yet been carried out, but the Department is pushing on with the work. The delay has been caused by the destruction of the whole of the material required for this work in. the fire which took place some time ago. We have had to await further consignments. The official reply is as followsElectrical Engineer's Branch, General Post Office, Memorandum to the Deputy Postmaster-General. - With regard to the paragraph in today's'. Argus, referring to the Kerang Telephone Exchange, I beg to report for your information that an application was received from the local Progress Association on 26th July, 1907, for the establishment of an exchange, with 38 subscribers. An Assistant Engineer visited Keran"" early in August, and collected all necessary data. Up to 4th December, 1907, only three of the 38 intending subscribers had paid their rents. The fire which occurred in Wallach's Buildings - on 30th November, 1907, destroyed ' all stocks of line material, and nothing could be done for the Kerang service until the stocks replenished, which took place about the of February, 19.08 - In the Engineer's original report, 42 new poles were allowed for. These poles were supplied under contract in De1907. All these poles are at Kerang. addition nine (9) extra 35-ft. poles were reforwarded from Melbourne to meet the demands for extra services and alterations It is now found that 20 (twenty) additional poles are required. These poles are being obtained under "" local offers,"" and are expected to be delivered in 14 days'. . The work at Kerang has been in progress for two cr weeks, and the men are still working In this respect, it may 'be mentioned that up to 17th March, 1908, only nine of the intending subscribers had paid their rentals, as required; but it was directed that the work should nevertheless be proceeded with, even althe rentals of the remaining twenty-seven intending subscribers had not been paid, or their agreements signed. The line foreman engaged in the work has not left Kerang since he went - J. HOWARD, for Electrical Engineer. TARIFF-NE W PROTECTION.,",14
4,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"Does the Prime who Minister intend to introduce immediately after the passing of the Tariff, and as part his of the Tariff proposals of the Government, ' set a Bill providing for a system of new protection ?",14
5,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"As the honourable member is aware, until the judgment of the High Court in the recent test case is given, it will be impossible to satisfactorily shape any scheme.",14
6,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,I understood that there were other means of carrying out what we desire.,14
7,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"The statement has been made before that as soon as that judgment is given, a measure will be prepared and introduced. ADVERTISING AUSTRALIA. DEFAMATORY ARTICLE ON SYDNEY.",14
8,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister, with further reference to the issue of the Lone Hand, subsidized by Melbourne, 7th May, 1908. the present Government, which containd. the defamatory article on Sydney, wherein that city was described as ""the mast disease-stricken,"" and of which 50,000 copies were distributed, a copy being sent to every newspaper in the United Kingdom and every leading newspaper in the United States, is he aware that vital statistics prove that so far from Sydney being "" the most, disease-stricken,"" it is one of the healthiest of Australian cities? Further, is he aware that its death rate is only 10.7 per 1,000, as against 13.6' in the case of Melbourne, 21.79 in the case of Adelaide, 17-10 in the case of Hobart, 15.24 in the case of Launceston, and 17.36 in the case of Perth and suburbs, none of which chief cities in the other States are stigmatized as diseasestricken? Is the honourable gentleman aware also that while the death rate of Sydney is, with the exception of Brisbane (10.o), the lowest, its birth rate is the highest in Australia?",14
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Before ' calling on the Prime Minister to reply, I would point out that the object of the honourable member in putting the question seems to be to make certain statements rather than to obtain an answer to his inquiry, and thatthat is distinctly contrary to the standing order, which requires that questions shall not contain any expression of opinion except to the extent necessary to explain them.",15
10,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,"-May I explain, sir, that I asked the question in consequence of an answer to a question given yesterday by' the Prime Minister, in which he said that he was aware of the publication of this defamatory article.",15
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable merrT-ber may ask the question, but, at the same time, I would point out that it is necessary to prevent questions from degenerating into - debates that may be carried on from time in time, one side replying to the other, and the object of the standing order being thus defeated.",15
12,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"One would .prefer comparisons that were instituted between Australian cities and those outside the Commonwealth ; but I take it that the honourable member, holding the views he does, is full y entitled to place this information before the House. NA STATES DEBTS - STATEMEN T BY THE PRIME MINISTER.",15
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONFERENCE OF STATES,"I wish to ask trie Prime Minister whether the following this subject. is a correct report of a statement made by him at the Conference of Premiers on Tuesday. Paragraphs of the same purport appear in both the Age and the ArgusLeading members of the House of Representatives no later than last evening, and members not of my own party, took me to task for proposing what they considered to be an extravagantly liberal scheme to the States. Mr Swinburne : Whoever said that had 'not read the scheme. Mr Deakin : However, he went to the point at once. He said that this was the only country he had ever heard of in which one Government went chasing the debts of another Government for the purpose of assuming them. If the report is correct, will the Prime Minister say who were the leading members of the House of Representatives and members not of his own party who uttered those criticisms ?",15
14,Mr DEAKIN,CONFERENCE OF STATES,"The statement. I quoted is correctly given, but its source is not. I did not say that it was made by any member bf the House of Representatives Later",15
15,Mr BRUCE SMITH,CONFERENCE OF STATES,"The Prime Minister is reported in the newspapers of today, in the discussion between himself and the Premiers yesterday, to have saidSo far as we have gone, we have kept within lines which we understand would receive favourable consideration by the Federal Parliament. Assuming that to be a substantially correct report, I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he will say how he has ascertained the opinion of the Federal Parliament in order to justify that statement at the Premiers' C o n f e r e n c e and whether the opinion of the Federal Parliament has ever been elicited or even invited on the Government financial scheme; if so, will he name the occasion?",15
16,Mr DEAKIN,CONFERENCE OF STATES,"The question is quite a natural one, and arises from the fact that the report published by the newspapers consists of excerpts from the complete report. In this particular instance, the assertion which the honourable member alleges or implies by his question was not made by me. I pointed out that at no time had any financial ischeme been decided on by this House, nor had it even been discussed, except by individual members at times, and PREMIER S. that I was assuming that the scheme which was suggested would be favourably considered by honourable members, only from my general knowledge of their views on FEDERA L CAPITA L SITE. EXHIBITION OF VIEWS .",15
17,Mr FULLER,CONFERENCE OF STATES,"I have a matter of privilege to bring under your notice, Mr. Speaker. A few days ago I was .presented with a picture of Dalgety, one of the proposed sites of the Federal Capital. A number of honourable members who had an opportunity of seeing it thought that it was such an exact representation of the site that it should be hung with .other pictures of Dalgety in the vestibule of the House so that honourable members generally might have an opportunity to inspect it. It was there at 12.30 p.m. today, but has disappeared. As a matter of privilege, I ask you to instruct your officers to ascertain its whereabouts.",16
18,Mr SPEAKER,CONFERENCE OF STATES,"I shall have inquiries made, and ascertain what has become of the picture.",16
19,Mr SALMON,CONFERENCE OF STATES,"I desire, Mr Speaker, to put a question to you with respect to the same matter. I saw the picture, and am not surprised to hear that it has disappeared. I made up my mind to ask you, on the House meeting, whether you had given permission for the picture, which is a palpable parody on others already hung in the vestibule, to be placed there.",16
20,Mr SPEAKER,CONFERENCE OF STATES,. Permission . has neither been sought of nor given by me.,16
21,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,CONFERENCE OF STATES,"May I be permitted to ask the honourable member for Illawarra a question through you, Mr. Speaker ?",16
22,Mr SPEAKER,CONFERENCE OF STATES,"On looking more closely at the standing order, I see that there are limitations as to the questions which may be asked of private members. Had I had the exact wording of the standing order before me yesterday, I should not have permitted the question which was asked of the honourable member for Fawkner. I cannot, under the standing order, permit a question to be asked of the honourable member for Illawarra.",16
23,Mr FULLER,CONFERENCE OF STATES,"I desire to raise a question of privilege. You, Mr Speaker, stated that you gave no instructions for permission for this picture to be hung; and I desire to know whether you gave any instructions for its removal from the corridor or for other pictures to be placed'there.",16
24,Mr SPEAKER,CONFERENCE OF STATES,"I have already mentioned that I gave permission for the pictures, which have been shown for some clays, to be displayed, in the corridor; but I have neither given nor refused permission for the picture referred to by the honourable member, nor did I hear of it until the honourable member mentioned it. PAPUA.",16
25,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,CONFERENCE OF STATES,"Has the Pjime Minister noticed that efforts are apparently being made by the German Government to vary the boundary between German New Guinea and Papua? Has the Prime Minister given any consideration to the effect of the suggested alteration, and taken steps to preserve the interests of our own territory ?",16
26,Mr DEAKIN,CONFERENCE OF STATES,"The determination of the boundary between German territory and Papua has been before us from time to time. Quite recently we communicated with the Colonial Office, requesting that authority should be obtained to invite the German Government to give authority to their local Government to confer with the Government of Papua in regard to the marking of the boundary. No proposals for any alteration of the boundary have been submitted to us. If any are made, of course, they will be considered. NA FISHERMEN.",16
27,Mr KELLY,IMMIGRATION OF SCOTTIS H,"I desire to ask the Prime .Minister Whether he is aware that the Chairman of the New South Wales Fisheries Board, Mr Frank Farnell, has received a communication from three representative Aberdeen-Glasgow fishermen who are the accredited representatives of over 5,000 active Scottish fishermen. According to the paragraph, these men seem anxious to come out to New South Wales and follow their calling here, not only in the actual catching of fish, but also in the erecting of factories for the canning of fish, both for local needs and for export purposes. I desire to know whether the Prime Minister will look into that statement, and endeavour to do something to assist these men to come here and erect canning factories?",16
28,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION OF SCOTTIS H,"As soon as I saw that intimation, I had it extracted and sent to the Department of the Minister of Trade and Customs, with a view to inquiry, as to its accuracy, and as to what action . could be taken to assist the object in view. As honourable members are aware,' there is a Commonwealth trawler in course of building; and no doubt the knowledge of that, fact has encouraged those Scottish fishermen to come here for the purpose of studying possibilities of the Australian waters. PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS . wealth OLD-AGE PENSIONS : FINANCIA L ARRANGEMENTS.",16
29,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION OF SCOTTIS H,"I desire to make a perprovided sonal explanation in reference to a statement. I made yesterday, and in answer to an interjection as to the financial proposals of the right honourable""member fo'r Swan while he was Treasurer of the present Adminisfration. My ' statement, I observe, has led to some misunderstanding; and I desire to briefly call attention to the fact - that the proposals referred to are those which were first made in the Budget statement of 1906-7. After that Budget statement, the' Government introduced a Constitution Alteration Bill as ,its complement, which passed through this Chamber, but failed to pass in another place,, because of the absence of an absolute majority by one vote or so. The effect of that Bill , had it been passed, would have been to enable us before 1910 to apply certaini Customs revenue to any purpose the Commonwealth thought fit, the Government having distinctly stated from the first that its object in introducing the Bill 'was to enable them to make immediate provision, for old-age pensions; but, owing to the rejection of that Bill , the referendum could not be taken. To deal with these pensions before 1910 was our consistent policy throughout. The next Conference of Premiers took place at Melbourne in October, 1906. I do not propose to read extracts, but if honourable members who are interested will read page 52 .of the official report, they will find that I then laid before the Premiers a proposal to alter, the Constitution in that regard prior to 1910. A report of a discussion on that proposal will be found on page 53. Our purpose was the same, namely, the dealing with old-age pensions. On page 114 honourable members will find that the proposal was favourably discussed by the representatives of the States; in fact, the question of old-age pensions occupied more attention at that Conference than any other subject. On page 116 honourable members will see that the relation of this proposal to the - taking over of the whole of the debts is also insisted o n ; and on page 127 it will be seen that, after a long debate,, and in consequence of my representation on behalf of the Government, the following resolution was carried and added, to those which had been submitted by the TreasurerProvided that in the event of the CommonParliament desiring to provide for old age pensions before 1910, nothing in the foregoing resolutions shall preclude any necessary alteration of the dates in the above resolution, that the whole period from the establishment of the Commonwealth be taken as the basis for determining the fixed annual amount. That was added to the resolutions to which I yesterday colloquially alluded as Sir John Forrest's. The Brisbane Conference was a continuation of the Melbourne Conference, and the consideration of the resolutions as they had been left in Melbourne was resumed. Sir John Forrest's resolutions had added to them the proposals introduced and carried by Mr Kidston to meet my request. Mr .JOSEPH COOK - How ,'ong after the Melbourne Conference was the Brisbane Conference?",17
30,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION OF SCOTTIS H,"The Brisbane Confer- . ence was held in Mav, 1907 ; but the Premiers then took up the same set of resolutions that had been considered at Melbourne-takin g them up exactly as they had been left at the previous Conference. They did not recommence as fresh confer- ences do, but continued the deliberations of the previous Conference. That is why' - I alluded to the proposals having been made with the substantial object of at once dealing with the question of old-age pensions, that is prior to 1910. This was an important part of our policy. The right honourable member for Swan, by interjection, stated that his scheme did not contain any such proposition. In a strict sense, perhaps, as to the proposals which he himself tabled, his statement is. perfectly true; but in the sense that I , as head of the Government, asked for and obtained this further resolution from the States Premiers, which was again before the Premiers when he met them in Brisbane, my statement is correct. It is quite true that the proposal did not emanate from my honourable friend, but it did emanate from the Government-it was placed before the States Premiers at the Conference held' in Melbourne, at which I was present, and it was again before them in the Conference held at Brisbane whileI was in London.",17
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,IMMIGRATION OF SCOTTIS H,The point is that this scheme was reaffirmed at Brisbane after that special provision had been disposed of.,18
32,Mr DEAKIN,IMMIGRATION OF SCOTTIS H,"My statement was that our proposals were made originally with a view to obtaining the power to deal with old-age pensions before 1910. That was embodied in the resolutions which were put before the Conference at Brisbane. Whilst the right honourable member for . Swan may be technically correct in saying that this one purpose WAS not included in his own proposals, the fact re' mains that it was attached to his proposals and at my request as head of the Government.",18
33,Sir JOHNFORREST,IMMIGRATION OF SCOTTIS H,"I wish to make a few observations by way of personal explanation. Whilst the Prime Minister was speaking yesterday I interjected that in the proposals which I submitted to this House in my Budget Speech on 31st July, 1.906, and which were afterwards submitted to the Premiers' Conference in Melbourne, in October, 1906, no mention was made of anticipating the withdrawal of the Braddon section-sectio n 87 of the Constitution. Those proposals, which were endorsed by the Government, would not have taken effect until after the end of 1910. I am well aware that some months after the Budget containing the proposals of the Government had been introduced, the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Government, proposed to submit to a referendum of the electors of the Commonwealth an alteration of. the Constitution by which the Braddon section would have been amended so as to permit of provision being made for old-age pensions before the end of 1910. The. Bill dealing with the matter was approved by this House, but failed to command the necessary majoritv in the Senate, and, therefore, was not referred to a referendum of the people. M.r. JOSEPH COOK - After it had failed was any further modification of that proposal made?",18
34,Sir JOHNFORREST,IMMIGRATION OF SCOTTIS H,"I have no recollection of any proposal being made at Brisbane in reference to it other than that put forward by the States' Premiers themselves. I certainly submitted no such proposal, and had no authority to do so. I did not know whether or not the Prime Minister intended to again ask Parliament to deal with section 87 of the Constitution. Therefore, I was perfectly accurate in the interjection which I made yesterday. However, I do not desire to labour the matter. All I wish to say is that the amendment of section 87 of the Constitution prior to the end of the year' 1910, when it becomes alterable, to enable the Commonwealth to impose special duties for the purpose of defraying the cost of a Federal system of old-age pensions, was not included in the scheme introduced by me as Treasurer, on behalf of the Government, in my Budget of 1906.

35,Mr CARR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"the Postmaster-General, upon noticeIn pursuance of paragraph (1) of question No. 3, asked on Tuesday, 5th May, will the Postmaster-General state definitely what are the exact terms of any concessions held by the Eastern Extension Cable Company from the Commonwealth, and the terms of any agreement existing between the two parties?",18
36,Mr MAUGER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The answer to the honourable member's question, is a5 followsYes. Copies of the various agreements between the Eastern Extension Company and the States, which became binding upon the Commonwealth on the transfer of the Department, will be laid upon the table of the Library. LABOUR CAUCUS.",18
37,Mr HALL,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"the honourable member for Fawkner, upon notice I. Whether he is correctly reported in the Argus of the 5th May, as saying"" There was a danger, too, of the country being governed by caucus. Something of that kind was happening in the Labour Party today. That party might drop its fads, but they were not allowed to do so by the caucus. He was betraying no confidence when he said that members of the party often opposed the dictation of the caucus, and were yet compelled to vote on questions against their consciences?"" 2. If this is a correct-report, will the honourable member name one instance in which any member of the Labour Party has voted against his conscience at the dictation of the caucus?",18
38,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I think, sir, that you have ruled that the questioning of an honourable member by another member cannot be permitted under our Standing Orders, except in specified circumstances-that is, when an honourable member has charge of business which is before the House. If the practice of one honourable member questioning another is permitted to continue, I fear that it will open up a very wide field, indeed.",19
39,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Mr Speaker, I would like to address you on this matter. Standing order 92 imposes a limitation upon questions which may be addressed to private members. It saysAfter notices have been given, ""Questions may be put to Ministers of the Crown relating to public affairs; and to other members relating to any Bill , motion, or other pubfic matter connected with the business on the Notice-paperThere is also a provision in the first of our Standing Orders, which says that, if our own Standing Orders are silent upon any matter, or do not impose an express prohibition, the practice ot"" the House of Commons shall apply..",19
40,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,But our' own rules are not silent upon the matter.,19
41,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The House of Commons is guided by a parallel rule to ours, but an exception is permitted. Upon page 249 of the n t h edition of May,'! find the followingQuestions addressed to unofficial members must relate to a Bill, motion, or other matter connected with the business of the House in which such members are concernedThat agrees exactly with our own rule. In substance it is the same. tinuesthough a question addressed to a member, the leader of the Opposition, inquiring the course he intended to adopt regarding a motion by the Government, was not allowed. Although questions may not be asked regarding. statements made by members outside the House, a question to an unofficial member has been permitted regarding a circumstance alleged to have happened outside Parliament, because it impugned the veracity of a member in respect to a statement made by him in the House. Isubmit that if the honourable member for Fawkner admits that he did make the statement attributed to him, there could not be a more distinct impugnment of the veracity of members of the Labour Party than his affirmation that they voted against their consciences. I submit that our Standing Orders being silent in this connection, the rule of the House of Commons applies.",19
42,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,There is no question of veracity involved.,19
43,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I think that a charge of want of veracity has been made against members of the Labour Party. To say that a member conscientiously believes one thing and says another is an attack upon his honour and truthfulness. If you, sir, are going to interpret the Standing Orders strictly, you will really cut down our rights very considerably, because we shall not be able to ask questions without notice.",19
44,Mr WISE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,That would be a blessing ,19
45,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"A very good thing, too.",19
46,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"That is not the point. No doubt the practice is sometimes abused by members of the Opposition corner. Standing order No. 68 readsThe House shall proceed each day with its ordinary business in the following routine :1. Presentation of Petitions. 2.'Giving notices. 3. Questions on notice. 4. Motions and Orders of the Day, or vice versd, as set down on the Notice-paper. If you, sir, are going to strictly limit us to the actual wording of the Standing Orders, questions without notice will be prohibited. Consequently, I ask you, sir, to go beyond the actual wording and to preserve the practice-to interpret our rules in the light of the practice of the House .of Commons, and having in mind, also, - the fact that our Standing Orders are merely provisional Standing Orders.",19
47,Mr SPEAKER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Officially , the Standing Orders cannot be regarded as temporary, having' been adopted seven .years May con- ago in the waythat standing orders intended to remain permanently in force would be adopted. They are the Standing Orders for the time being, and are effective in every sense of the word. In view of the wording of No. 92, I do not think it can be said that they are silent on this question. That standing order does not read exactly as the honourable, member quoted it. He omitted the last few words, which are important in their bearing on the particular point which has been raised. The standing order saysAfter notices have been given, Questions may be put to Ministers of the Crown relating topublic affairs; and to other members relating to any Bill , motion, or other public matter connected with the business on the Notice-paper, of which such members may have charge.",19
48,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I read everv word of that.,19
49,Mr SPEAKER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The honourable member . did not read the words following the word "" Notice-paper."" Mr . CROUCH - I think I did so. omission, if made, was accidental.",20
50,Mr HENRY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,WILLIS - The omission of the words could not affect the honourable member's argument.,20
51,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,That is so.,20
52,Mr SPEAKER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I do not doubt that the honourable member intended to read the words; but I would - point out that the Standing Orders require, among other things, that when the Speaker is addressing the House, honourable members must be silent. Had I had the latter part of standing order 92 before me yesterday afternoon, I should not have permitted the honourable member for Werriwa to put his question without notice to the honourable member for .Fawkner; but, having permitted that to Ibe done, I did not exclude the question on notice from today's business paper, nor shall I refuse to allow it to be put. After it has been put and answered - shoul d the honourable member for Fawkner wish to answer it-the rule to which my attention has been called wil l be given effect to.",20
53,Mr CROUCH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"AS a personal explanation, I wish to say that I intended to read, and believe I read, the whole of the standing order, and if I omitted any words, I regret that I did so. The words which you, Mr Speaker, say I omitted did not in the slightest degree affect ""my argument.",20
54,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"He a r , hear.",20
55,Mr FAIRBAIRN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"My . reply to the honourable member for Werriwa is that the report is substantially correct, but, being necessarily brief, is perhaps misleading. If the honourable member had heard the whole speech, he would have known that I had no desire to impugn the private honour of - members of the Labour Party. wished to express was that Labour members were often compelled by the caucus to vote against their judgment. UNION JACK.",20
56,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"the Prime Minister, u f o n notice I. Whether he has read in the English Times a speech, delivered by Lord Rosebery at a presentation of Union Jacks by the Victoria League to thirty Edinburgh School Board schools, in which the following passage occurs :""What does that flag stand for? It stands for the United Kingdom and the British Empire. It is because it stands for justice, good government, liberty, and Christianity that we honour that flag. It is spread all over the world. I have travelled from London to AusThe tralia, and wherever I stopped on that journey I .stopped under the British flag. I went from London to Gibraltar-ther e was the Union Jack. I went from Gibraltar, through the Suez Canal, touching in Egypt-ther e was the British flag. T went on to Ceylon - ther e was the British flag; and then I ended my long journey at the westernmost part of Australia, and there was a British flag."" 2. Whether he has read in the Sydney Morning Herald o i 2nd May, or elsewhere, the f o l lowing :"" EXITUNION JACK. "" In the official statutory rules issued by the Military authorities is found the following: - Regulation 35. The heading ' Union Jack' is hereby cancelled, and Australian Ensign ' sub1 stituted."" 3. Is it not a fact that both in Canada and Natal the local flag is always flown together with the Union Jack, the former as the colonial national symbol and the latter as the symbol of the British Empire? 4. Seeing that the inclusion of a miniature Union Jack in the Australian flag does not and cannot make it the flag of the British Empire, will he confer with the Minister for Defence so that directions may issue in order that wherever Empire Day (24th Mav) is officially celebrated in the Commonwealth the Union Jack may be given the place of honour as the emblem of British unitv. and as an acknowledgment of Australia's loyalty to the Empire?",20
57,Mr EWING,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The replies to the honourable member's questions are1. Yes. 2. Yes, or words to that effect. 3. All the colonies in the Empire, including the Australian States, prior to Federation, appear to have had a flag, which wasgenerally an ensign carrying the Jack. Federation rendered an Australian flag necessary. The Australian What I flag selected was also an ensign carrying the Jack, with a large star, and the Southern Cross. This was forwarded to the Imperial authorities, approved by the King in 1902, duly gaze'tted, and placed in the flag book by the Imperial Government. Subsequently, in 1903, Parliament passed a unanimous resolution that it should be flown. The Commonwealth boats carry the Jack at the bow, and the Australian flag at the stern. With regard _ to Natal and Canada, which both have their own flags, there is no information to hand as to their use. In New Zealand there seems to be no fixed practice. Sometimes"" the Jack is flown, and sometimes the flag of the Dominion of New Zealand. 4. Instructions have already been given that on Empire Day. in addition to the Australian flag, the Union Jack is to be flown.. SIZE OF GRAIN BAGS.

62,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Before doing so, I queswish to say two or three words.",21
63,Mr MALONEY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"As to the denaturing of oil of a lower standard, I have the supopinion of one. of the best analytical chemists that Victoria has every known- the a gentleman who has served the State well, who, in anything he' does ""for the Commonwealth, will give the same good service to - that it can be done by using a very dark residual oil, or what may be termed a dark the engine oil. As honourable members are be aware, the methylation of spirit takes place without affecting its burning or other qualities. The only result of'the methylation is to make the spirit offensive to the taste,. so that it cannot go into consumption as vide page an alcoholic drink.",21
64,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,What will ' be the cost of denaturating kerosene?,21
65,Mr MALONEY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"It will be as nearly as possible equal to the cost of denaturating spirits. I think that we may very well conaccept Mr Wilkinson's opinion in respect The Standard Oil Trust in.America has controlled Parliaments and Courts; it has set down Mr Lawson ""after a terrible fight, and has even been able to worse the present President of the United States. That being so, I do not think that we shall be able to fight against it . MrW ILKS - We shall have a big try.",21
66,Mr MALONEY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"We have an opportunity now to show that we are not to be overridden by it, and every protectionist, whether he be a prohibitionist or a moderate protectionist, should do his utmost to assist the industry in New South Wales. I may say, in passing,- that just as I do not know what a moderate thief is, so I cannot understand a moderate protectionist. An attempt is now being made to insert the thin end of the wedge. I detest combines, and have nothing but loathing for trusts; but if we are to choose between the two, let us guard ourselves against the most powerful combine in the world. protectionist should do his utmost to help the industry in the great State of New South Wales. If any one says that by doing so we are assisting to build up a trust in Australia, we shall be able to reply that we may at any time acquire the local works at a fair valuation, and that, having nationalized them, we shall be able to present a four-square front to the efforts of the American combine. The Standard Oil Company disguises itself here under the name of the Colonial Oil Company. . I am informed that it could riot be registered in New York, and that it had to be registered in New Jersey, which has been described by one of the greatest of Americans as the place where all frauds-and swindles can be registered. Money will be spent freely, and it behoves every honourable member to recognise that for the first time we are confronted with the operations of one of the most powerful combines that has ever existed. It may be said on behalf of the Standard Oil Company that its oil today is better than it has ever been. I shall not deny such a statement, nor have I the information at my disposal to enable me to deny the assertion that those employed by it receive. a higher average wage than is paid by like corporations. Then ag'ain, it may be urged that it is far better that the industry should be controlled by one governing body, so that a good article may be sold cheaply to the consumer. know, however, that it .has swept 4,000 oil and other companies out of existence, not by fair means of competition, but frequently by underground engineering of the kind that we have experienced in connection with the operations of the American harvester trust. We all know that some time ago the present Treasurer, when Minister ot Trade and Customs, had to take action to prevent the Australian market being flooded with oil by the Standard Oil Company. Honourable members may imagine that I am bitter in my opposition to that company. As a matter of fact, I am not. I recognise that it has at its head the most powerful brains that were ever devoted to the work of acquiring power and accumulating capital. But behind this Parliament, elected on the freest franchise of which the world knows, we have every man and woman in Australia, and although the Standard Oil Company may swamp or controlthis Legislature, it cannot control the people at its back.",22
67,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Hume-Trea Every surer) [3.17] - I wish to refer briefly to some statements made yesterday in reference to this question. I stated last night that I intercepted some shipments of kerosene by the Standard Oil Company, and required the oil to be stamped in a certain, way. That action was taken mainly as the result of the introduction of certain oil in South Australia in tins that were marked "" Test."" A professional man, whose name for the moment I forget, was deputed to examine this oil, and he proceeded to treat it on the assumption that it was of a certain flash point, with the result that he narrowly escaped a serious explosion. Thereafter the oil was carefully scrutinized. The shipments of oil, which it was attempted to land here with the object, as far as I could judge, of retarding the progress of the Commonwealth Oil Company, which had just commenced operations, was marked "" 150 test.""0",22
68,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"That was the fire test. . Sir WILLIAM LYNE - No ; I made them stamp the fire test on the consignments. The 150 degrees open test is equal to 105 degrees close test, and I caused the company to brand these consignments with the words "" equal to - 105 degrees close test."" The company fought the Department for nearly six months, and during all that time was crowding, oil into Australia. I ultimately decided that the kerosene We shipped before my decision was announced to the company should be landed, but that thereafter all shipments should comply with that decision. The company complained that it would have to return a lot of this oil to America,, but instead of doing so it made the alteration that I required.  did the honourable member allow it to go into consumption?",22
69,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I did not, of my own knowledge, know that it was bad, but I determined that the cases or tins should be marked in the way I have indicated.",23
70,Mr KELLY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Did the Minister say last night that the oil which he intercepted was dangerous ?,23
71,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"It may or may not have been dangerous. nothing on the cases to indicate what it was. The honourable member for Boothby said last night that 73 degrees flash point was the standard test nearly all over'the world. I have taken the trouble to ascertain the tests which are fixed in various countries, and a recital of them should be interesting. In New South Wales the test is 83 degrees Fahrenheit close test; Queensland, 83 degrees close test; Victoria, 73 degrees close test; Western Australia, 83 degrees; New Zealand, 83 degrees; Antigua (South America), 83 degrees; Austria, 73 degrees; Barbadoes, 83 degrees; Ceylon, 76 degrees; Germany, 69.8 degrees; Great Britain, 73 degrees; Malta, 76 degrees; Montserrat, 83 degrees; Trinidad, 95 degrees; St. Lucia, 95 degrees.",23
72,Mr KELLY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Is that the open test?,23
73,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"No . In each case it is the close test. I a Nevis and St. Kitts, the test is 83 degrees; and in Jamaica, 95 degrees. Coming to the United States of America, we find that in Arkansas the test is 83 degrees; Illinois, 103 degrees; Kentucky, 83. degrees; Louisiana, 98 degrees; Baltimore, 93 degrees; Oklahama Territory, 93 degrees; Rhode Island, 83 degrees; and Delaware, 103 degrees.",23
74,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Are all these tests on the same basis?,23
75,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I asked for a return showing tests on the same basis. This return was prepared, not by me, but by the Department. When the honourable member for Boothby was speaking last night, I interjected that I thought that in manv places the standard was higher than he mentioned. At that time. I did not know in how many; but I knew the test was 83 degrees in Queensland, and I thought it due to myself and to the Committee to bring forward all the information I could on the subject. why Mr Wilks (Dalley) [3.25] - This discussion has gone beyond the range of an ordinary Tariff question, and has dealt with the various tests of oils, and with the posi; tion and methods of the oil companies, i have no desire to be placed in the position of giving any advantage to one oil company over another, though I suppose that whichever way we vote, so the advantage will go. It is well to remember the position of the three companies-o r of two companies particularly-whic h arecompeting today. The honourable member for MelThere was bourne referred to the millionaire connexions of the oil companies, and I may say that the Colonial Oil Company, which is the Standard Oil Company under another name, and the British Imperial Company, which is a French-English company, both have associated with them m i l lionaires-in the one case a Rockefeller, and in the other case a Rothschild. But their consumers do not care whether their pennies go to enrich a Rockefeller or a Rothschild. Then we have the Commonwealth Oil Corporation ; and it is remarkable how these astute business people select telling names with a view to effective advertisement. This company is almost as much a millionaire company as are the other two I have mentioned ; but, unlike the latter, it does not produce domestic kerosene, so that there is no competition in this connection. I should very much like to know whether the Treasurer's proposal is purely in the interests of public safety, or purely in the interests of protection. Honourable members have been fairly deluged with literature in regard to the various companies interested; and I have taken the trouble to read the documents supplied, though I do not propose to weary the Committee with extracts. The Colonial Oil Company imports two high-test oils for domestic illuminating purposes at 1.00 degrees and 103 degrees, and two engine oils, flashing at 86 degrees and 87 degrees. The amendment, as originally sent from the Senate, gave an advantage to the British Imperial Company, whereas the amendment before us would give an advantage to the Standard Oil Company. Had I voted for the amendment yesterday, I should have given assistance to the British Imperial Company, and if I vote today for the amendment unaltered, I shall be acting distinctly in the interests of the Standard Oil Company. In connection with the Standard Oil Company, it is alleged, with a good deal of force, that its representative came to this country specifically; to fight the Tariff and anti-trust legislation ; so that it will be seen my remarks have some force. As I said before, I desire to give no advantage to one company more than to another; my concern is only for those who use the oil for illuminating or industrial purposes. The honourable member for Melbourne spoke about certain persons being ""captured "" by an oil company ; and 1 desire to know whether the Commonwealth Parliament has been captured. It has been stated that when the Tariff was last before us, members of this House were captured by a certain company ; and it is well that we should go beyond the question immediately before us, in order to satisfy the public that, at any rate, there is no "" capturing'' in the present instance. So far, the allegations to which I have referred have not been denied, but there is a body appointed to test their truth. At any rate, it was stated that, on the last occasion, a company did capture certain votes in this House; and that is, perhaps, the.only serious attack ever made on this Parliament.",23
76,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,How did the company capture votes?,24
77,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"It is not for me to say. That was the statement made;' and I am only now urging upon honourable members to show all these oil companies that it is not in their interests, but in the interests the general public, that we are voting. The British Imperial Company import one i l luminating oil for domestic purposes at 103. degrees and one engine oil flashing at 98 degrees. Under the proposal of yesterday, the illuminating oil of both companies would have been admitted without denaturating; and, in this connection, there would have been no monopoly to one 'or the other. That proposal, however, would have admitted the British Imoerial engine-oil without being denaturated, while the Standard Company's oil would have had to be treated. But to-dav the proposal before us wiH cause the British Imperial oil to be denaturated, while the other oil would be admitted without treatment. The Standard Oil Company first fought the British I m perial Oil Company with a conditional rebate, which th s Parliament declared to be : illegal, and then the former company imported a cheaper and inferior kerosene, ostensibly for engine use; but only the cases, and not the tins, were marked. The honourable member for North Sydney pointed out that, under the proposal, we should have power to deal with imported oils, but. not with locally-produced oils,- because the latter, with all the attendant dangers, could be sold retail without any treatment. The suggestion I would make in regard to the local oil is the imposition of an Excise duty, because I think o i l is dangerous under a certain flash pointWe find, however, that in the States where most illuminating of] is used, ' the standard is the highest; and no doubt the officers of the Department took care that the tests were made under equal conditions. The honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Maranoa urged that the denaturating process would prove expensive. I do not see how that could be, because in the country of origin it would not be necessary to denaturate every tin, but simply to denaturate a tank which would be set aside for the Australian trade.",24
78,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The whole of the tinning is not done in Australia. _ Mr Wilks - But on the arrival of the tinned oils, the Customs officials would act in the same way as they do in' regard to cotton-seed oil and other commodities, and make a .promiscuous test of a shipment. The honourable members. I have just mentioned also asked whether companies would manufacture oils specially for Australia, and my reply is that the tendency throughout of the world's trade today is to consider the habits, customs, and tastes of the countries to be supplied. It is neglect of this study that militates against British trade, and it is attention.to it which has raised American trade to its present condition.",24
79,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"-Will "" the honourable member tell us what the process of denaturating is ?",24
80,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I do not pretend to know; but the Customs officials have confidence in Mr Wilkinson, who is a chemist of world-wide reputation, and in these matters we must rely on the scientist. If I could answer scientific questions of the kind, I fancy I should be-occupying a much more lucrativeposition than that of a member of Parliament. The Standard Oil Trust operated first by the offer of a rebate, ultimately rendered illegal by Parliament, and subsequently they introduced inferior kerosene oil ostensibly for use as a motive power for en- gines, but really that it might be palmed off upon unsuspecting consumers. The company marked, the cases containing this oil "" for engine use,"" but they did not mark the tins. The retailer was thus able to sell this inferior kerosene for illuminating purposes.",24
81,Mr KELLY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Would member be satisfied if the tins,' as well as the cases, were stamped?",25
82,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I think that we had better not permit either the Standard Oil Trust - or the British Imperial Oil Company to obtain .a monopoly. If we fix the flash point test at 102 degrees we shall grant a monopoly to the Standard Oil Trust. Both the organizations to which I have referred are of mammoth dimensions, and personally I am not at all concerned whether I do an act of kindness for Rockefeller or for Rothschild. But I am concerned in safeguarding the interests of the Australian consumers. I desire to enable them to obtain kerosene oil of good quality at as low a price as possible. During the course of this debate we have been asked to show that any real danger is to be apprehended from the use of oil having a low flash point. My reply is that if only one person lost his life in teni years as the result of using low test oils it would be our bounden duty to interfere.",25
83,Mr WILSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Are there not as many lives lost as the result of using kerosene of the Crown. possessing a high flash point as are sacrificed by reason, of using oil possessing i i low flash point?",25
84,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I cannot say.,25
85,Mr WILSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,It is so . Mr Wilks - Why do all countries impose some test?,25
86,Mr KELLY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,It is a dividing line between low test oils and oils that are used for illuminating purposes.,25
87,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,There is always a danger where there is a light.,25
88,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"In India and Burmah, . we are informed, the. flash point test is fixed at 73 degrees.. But I would point out that the conditions in Australia are entirely different from those which obtain in the countries I have mentioned. We all know that in our cities kerosene is not used to any material extent as. an jlluminant. But it is used very largely in outlying districts. If we fix the flash point at 97 decrees, I think'that we shall be acting reasonably. The Commonwealth Oil Corporation', does not produce kerosene oil for i l luminating, purposes in any considerable quantity. The proposal submitted by the Treasurer yesterday would have conferred a - benefit on the Commonwealth Oil Corporation, while that which he has presented today would benefit the Standard O i l Trust. I see no difficulty whatever in the .way of denaturating this o i l . the honourable Sir WILLIAM LYNE - I have just been informed that it is idle to continue the discussion, because the Standard Oil Company has the numbers in its bag.",25
89,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I rise to a point of order. Honourable members are slandered enough outside of this House, and they do not want to be slandered inside it . The Treasurer has just stated that he has been informed that the Standard Oil Trust has, a majority of honourable members in its bag, and that it is idle to continue the debate. In making that statement he is giving currency to the infamous slander which' has been .published about honourable members of this Parliament, that they are men who can be bought with money to give corrupt votes in connection with this Tariff. We cannot deal with these anonymous slanders very easily, but when the Treasurer of the Commonwealth makes the statement which he has made, I ask whether such a reflection' on honourable members should be made by a Minister of the Crown ? It is the most abominable and the greatest slander which has ever been uttered against a Parliament by a Minister",25
90,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I say,' deliberately, that that message was brought to me.",25
91,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,B y whom?,25
92,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"It is a scandal to see the representative of the Standard Oil Trust buttonholing honourable members as he has done in the precincts of the parliamentary building. i did not cast any imputation upon honourable members. I say again that the representative of that trust has approached nearly every honourable member and has endeavoured to get. them - probabl y he has been successful in, the case of a large number-to promise to support it. So much has been said about this matter outside that I actually turned the representative of that trust out of my - office. It is a scandal that a man should be sent here from America to force this item through in opposition to the interests of the people of this country. I cast no imputation upon honourable members, but we have had quite enough of visits from agents from America, and we do not want any more of them.",25

94,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,B y persuading . them.,25
95,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Not by bribing them?,26
96,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I never suggested these rival companies. that. The statement. I made was not that honourable members had been bribed. do not believe that any honourable member of this House has been bribed. agent of the Standard Oil Trust has been canvassing to an extent which I say should not be allowed within the precincts, of this building.",26
97,The CHAIRMAN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I very much deprecate the statement made by the Treasurer, which certainlv does not seem to me to be in keeping with the dignity of a Minister of the Crown. Whilst I have no power to order him to withdraw it on the ground that it is unparliamentary, I can express, my personal opinion upon it .",26
98,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The imputation that a certain trust has honourable members of this House, in its bag is a very serious one.",26
99,The CHAIRMAN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I quite realise the serious imputation which the Treasurer has made. He stated that he had just heard that the Standard Oil Trust had honourable members in its bag. That was not the right thing for the Treasurer to say, and, although I have no power to deal with such remarks, I think that it would be better, in the interests of this House, if such statements were not made.",26
100,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I desire to make a personal explanation. . As I initiated the opposition to - the proposal of the Governmerat in regard to this item, I may as well say that, until after I had made mv speech, I had had no communication of any kind whatever with' any representative of the Standard Oil Trust; nor have I been buttonholed by any agent of that trust. But during 'last week I was persistently buttonholed by the representatives of the rival companies-the British I m perial Company and the Commonwealth Oil Corporation.",26
101,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I also desire to make a personal explanation. The Treasurer has stated that lie has been informed that a certain foreign trust has a majority of honourable members in its bag.

148,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I believe so. I made a similar statement in reference to a certain gentleman who was always here in regard to the piano duties.,28

152,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I do not know list. whether he was or was not here.,28
153,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,He was able to get from a public Department papers relating to his opponents.,28
154,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I am referring to another person who was here. spoken to one or two officials as to whether it is right that persons should come into those portions of the building which ought to be reserved for members, and should be allowed to canvass in the way that can-, vassing has been done.",28
155,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Why has it allowed? What has Mr Speaker been doing to allow it?,28
156,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The Treasurer has ways had the galleries full of manufacfact. turers.,28
157,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"If I had power, I should prevent canvassing within the precincts of the Chamber.",28
158,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The Treasurer encourimputation ages it.,28
159,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Why does not Mr. Speaker have canvassers kept out?,28
160,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"If honourable members regard my remarks as a reflection on the character of any one of them, I unreservedly withdraw them; because it was not intended that they should reflect on the honesty of the Committee. I do not wish honourable members to think that I would make'an imputation of that kind unless I was sure of my facts.",28
161,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,It is not so much what the Committee thinks as what the public thinks about the statement.,28
162,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I am making these remarks in order that they may go forth to the public. I did not believe the statement made by the newspaper to which the honourable member has referred. I have said so over and over again. We am as may be justly proud that no imputation can rightly be made on the character of any member.,28
163,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Unfortunately , imputations have been made. It is the statements pubhas lished outside which make the Treasurer's remarks so serious. What he said' will be published all over the world.",28
164,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,All I intended was to point out that the canvassing had been carried on to such an extent that a list or lists had been made out showing that we could not win. ,28
165,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Any one can make out a,28

174,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The phrase slipped out accidentally; I did not intend it to have the application which has been given to it.,29
175,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,That was the expression which gave offence.,29
176,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Then I withdraw it. I have said enough to show that no offence was intended. I did not wish to hurt the feelings of any honourable member, and although in debate I am at times pretty hot, I never wish to hurt any one's feelings. Perhaps this discussion will do some good. It may cause the extraordinary canvassing which has been going on to cease. The gentleman to whom I have referred is a good deal to blame for the remark which he made, which has caused a great deal of feeling amongst honourable members, namely, that he had come here to put this matter through Parliament. ' Mr THOMAS - Will the Treasurer stop the canvassing in regard to the timber duties ?",29
177,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I cannot stop it.,29
178,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The Minister will not be found complaining about it .,29
179,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I did not know that there had been much canvassing about' the timber duties.,29
180,Mr MAHON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The Queen's H all has been filled with canvassers.,29
181,Mr KELLY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,There has been more canvassing on the part of. the Commonwealth OilCorporation than on the part of other companies.,29
182,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"My nose has been kept close to the grindstone, so that I have not seen what has been going on in the Queen's H all . There has been no canvassing so far as I am concerned, though I have heard statements. Perhaps there has been a good deal of canvassing.",29
183,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The Treasurer refines his remarks beautifully. He says now, in effect, that we are not rogues but fools.",29
184,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I have wished that many honourable members were not so keen in regard to certain matters as I have found them to be. I have not been able ito persuade them to .change their position, nor have I been able to get anything through, until there has been a large amount of criticism.",29
185,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The Treasurer has nearly dragged honourable members from one side of the chamber to the other in his eagerness to secure their votes.,29
186,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I am sorry for my unintentional remark. The words which I used were misunderstood.,29
187,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Does not the Treasurer admit that the manufacturers who have asked for protection, as well as the importers, have interviewed honourable members ? Let him be fair to both sides.",29
188,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I am not picking out one ""side or the other. Canvassing has gone on to a terrible extent.",29
189,Mr KELLY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,On both sides.,29
190,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I believe so.,29
191,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Canvasser s do not come to me.,29
192,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"If ever I am in charge of another Tariff, I shall - try to have the surroundings of the chamber kept free from canvassers. I have had to bear the result of a great' deal of the canvassing which has taken place. I have had to fight against it, and oni many occasions have felt its effects very keenly. Therefore, perhaps it has been more obvious to me than it has been to other honourable members.",29
193,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Does not the Treasurer think that the Minister's room should be kept free from manufacturers and their agents ?,29
194,Mr MCDOUGALL,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Has not the Commonwealth Oil Corporation circularized honourable members ?,29
195,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I have heard so, and that certain letters have been dictated; but I put that on one side, because I do not know it of my own knowledge.",29
196,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I have received, from hundreds of manufacturers, letters conveying information relative to the Tariff. I do not complain of that, though I discount largely information from interested sources. Sir"" WILLIAM LYNE - That is not what I have been referring to. I hope that honourable members will accept my fervent assurance that, by the unfortunate expression which I used, I did not mean to convev any imputation against the honour of the Committee. Question-That the consideration of the item be postponed-proposed .",29
197,Mr KNOX,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Kooyong) [4.10] - The time has arrived when the honour of this Chamber must be definitely vindicated, and I support the motion for the postponement of the item. Statements have appeared in the press-eve n this - morning a Melbourne journal prints such a statement in one of its articles-reflectin g upon honorthat able members.",29
198,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I have had nothing to do with that.,30
199,Mr KNOX,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"No . I accept the surer's withdrawal of - his personal statement ments. But we should know what steps are to be taken to have this charge investigated. and for ever. Since the inception of the Federal Parliament I have had close intercourse with honourable members of all shades tical opinion, and, with an intimate knowledge of the men who constitute i declare that, in my judgment, this is a pure House. It cannot be justly said that has - been either directly or indirectly ruptly influenced, and it is an outrage such a charge should be made against it. I am strongly in favour of the proposal that the further consideration of this quest be postponed in order that an quiry may be made as to whether or not "" an attempt has been made, either directly or indirectly, to influence the vote of House in its bag. any honourable member. I know the representatives of the Standard pany here as well as the representatives of the other companies, and my desire has able member justice. always been to ascertain .what is best the interests, not of any individual, but of the consuming public of Australia. Notwithstanding that the Treasurer, has withdrawn his remark- a withdrawal which I personally accept- I think it would outrageous to proceed with the considerawithout tion of this request until a full investigareally tion has beeni made into these We should determine whether there exists in this House of seventy-five members one"" black sheep, but I declare that in my humble judgment there is not one.",30
200,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I do riot believe that there is.,30
201,Mr KNOX,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The insinuations that have been made in the press, and the charges that have been formulated in discussions in this House, reflect upon this branch of the Legislature so strongly that we should demand the fullest and closest investigation into them.",30
202,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"We have a Privilege Procedure Committee, which can inquire into the matter.",30
203,Mr KNOX,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Yes ; it was at my suggestion that the Prime Minister agreed that that Committee should have the power to inquire into allegations of the kind now before us that were made against this House in a. section of the press, and we should refuse to deal with this item until Committee has inquired and reported. I appeal to my honourable friends, whose character, I am convinced, cannot be besmirched in the way suggested by a secTreation of the press, to support the amendfor the postponement of the item, so that this charge may be cleared up at once ' Mr Reid '(East Sydney) [4.15] - The Treasurer has expressed his regret for of polihaving circulated a statement",30
204,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"F o r having unint , I tentionally used certain words..",30
205,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I was about to say that it the Minister has expressed his - regret for corhaving .circulated in this House a statethat ment conveyed to him which, as it stood, was calculated to cast a very serious imputation upon an indefinite number of honreorable members. That statement was that in the Standard Oil Company had a majority in its bag "" - in other words, that it had a majority of honourable members of this",30
206,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I did not refer to Oil' Comthe matter in that way.,30
207,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I wish to do the honorI point out that, in in the impulse of the moment, without realizing the significance of his words, he made a statement in a tone so audible that I had immediately to take notice of it . The Minister, having been guilty of the inbe discretion of publishing the statement recognising how much it might be taken to mean, has expressed his allegations. regret for it.",30
208,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,But that is only a personal matter.,30
209,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"That is so. The Treasurer may now be acquitted of anything more than having on the impulse of_ the moment circulated a statement which"" has a very bad appearance. I wish now to leave him out of the question. We have to consider the position not only of the Minister who has been guilty of an indiscretion' for which he has very straightforwardly expressed his regret, but of honourable members generally. When the Minister said "" I have just been informed,"" his words suggested that he had iust received a message ' to the effect that, the Standard Oil Company had a maiority of honourable members in its bag. The person who brought that message is the person - who made the imputation upon the House.",30
210,Mr HUTCHISON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Who is he?,30
211,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,We do not know. statement made inadvertently at the table by the Treasurer will be published all over the world.,31
212,Sir WILLIAM,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"LYNE - I wish to go f u r - be done immediately. ther than I did, and say that the person to whom I referred did not use the word ""bag.""",31
213,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"That makes the position even more serious. We must lemember that this sort of thing has been hinted at for months outside the House. I have been told that the Age this morning published a leading article, in which it referred, in connection with the Standard O i l Company, to rumours affecting members which had been ""crystallized."" I have not seen the article, but I think that that is the expression used. When a leading paper in Australia like the Age gives currency to such a statement, and we have that statement made in the ..House itself, feelings of self-respect should induce us to postpone the item. We ought to say that we are prepared to have the fullest investigation; and that until such an investigation has been made into this imputation, we refuse to deal with the item.",31
214,Mr HUGHES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"West Sydney) [4-19] - I agree with what has been said. The way in which men have been permitted to enter this House, to waylay honourable members, to talk to and inflict themselves upon them, is little short of disgraceful. I have never had an opportunity of seeing the representatives of the Standard Oil Company, but I have seen a representative of the Commonwealth Oil Company. The only transaction that I have had in respect of the British Imperial Oil Company is this : that whilst I was away from my home one of its representatives left there a lamp filled with oil, with a. request that we should burn it. When I returned I told the man, who called later on, to take the lamp away, and that I regretted that he should have left it. It is very serious to speak, in the terms that have been used, about members of this House in connection with a great corporation like the Standard Oil Company. The power of that company is so tremendous-it s ramifications are so extensive-that any imputation against any man, no matter how absurd, .will find credence with many people. members will vote in one way and some in another, and in view of this imputation, a very large number of people will think that some of us have been bought. Any journal that makes such a statement- I say The nothing to exempt any man who makes it should be asked before a responsible Committee of this House to substantiate it , or to withdraw it and apologize. That should I have been in politics for some fourteen or fifteen years, and do not believe that either in this Parliament, or in any of the State Assemblies, there has been any bribery or corruption.",31
215,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,On Tariff matters.,31
216,Mr MCDOUGALL,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,What about the land swindles of New South Wales ?,31
217,Mr HUGHES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I know nothing of them. It was after my time, in the State Parliament. What I do say is that, so far as I know, the Parliaments of Australia have been uniformly pure, and that if thefe is a black sheep in this House, it is about time that we were made aware of that fact. We, who claim not to be black sheep, ought no longer to sit under such an infamous imputation.",31
218,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Lang) [4-23] - I support the motion for the postponement of the item, because its adoption will give an opportunity for this charge to be cleared up, as it ought to be. I have not been approached by a representative of any oil company, and have not received any communication from these companies, other than the circulars which have been sent to every honourable member.",31
219,Mr CARR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"As the honourable member is a free-trader, it was a certainty that he would vote for kerosene being free. No doubt that is why he has not been interviewed by any representatives of the oil companies.",31
220,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"It is against free traders that this charge is very largely levelled. Not only have I not seen any representatives of oil companies, but I should not even know them if I saw them. I have stedfastly refused to grant interviews with respect to Tariff matters, and have asked that any communication desired to be made to me on Tariff subjects should be addressed to me through the post. It is amusing to hear the Treasurer, of all men, inveighing against the practice Of lobbying, since he has admitted time after time on the floor of the House that he has been in conference with manufacturers and their agents in regard to the effect of the Tariff upon their Some honourable manufactures. . It comes ill from the Minister to resent lobbying, when he is acknowledged to be one of the worse offenders in the encouragement of lobbying on occasions when one particular side of the Tariff is concerned. It is only when the other side of the question is brought to the front that, in his opinion, lobbying becomes an evil. We have seen the galleries absolutely crammed by manufacturers and their agents, and we have seen the Treasurer in conference with some of them. Never a word of protest from the Minister was heard on those occasions, but, because a lady happened to be here the other day - I do not know who she was, but the Treasurer evidently did - he thought it was a great crime, seeing that her desire was to have a reduction of duty. There was no scandal or crime, however, when the galleries were filled with men, - who were imploring the Treasurer to give them an opportunity to dip their hands in the public purse in order that they niight enrich themselves.",31
221,The CHAIRMAN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Order ! I ask the honourable member not to indulge ih that language.,32
222,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"It is, at any rate, a truthful statement. I was merely drawing attention to contrasts in the Treasurer's actions. An opportunity is now presented for inquiry-for substantiating, if possible, the insinuations which have been thrown broadcast both within and without the Chamber. If we allow the opportunity to pass we shall deserve to remain under a stigma. The first. explanation of the Treasurer was an aggravation of the offence, but, in the second explanation, he climbed down. But he had done the mischief, and thus served his object, which was to feed the flame Of unmerited slander outside the House. Honourable members ought to support the motion of the honourable member for Dalley, in order that this matter may be sifted to the bottom. If there is any one in the House who has been guilty of receiving bribes, or who has been amenable to undue influence in the casting of his vote, there is now an opportunity for thorough 'inquiry.",32
223,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The Government ought to support the motion.,32
224,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Undoubtedly . Honourable members who hold fiscal views different from those entertained by those on the immediate. Opposition benches, have had cast at them insinuations, which, in my opinion, are intended to coerce them into voting against their conscience, in the fear that in the public estimation they may, through these gross insinuations, be regarded as having been bought by a wealthy company. [39i]",32
225,Mr MCDOUGALL,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Does the honourable member think that if the Standard Oil Company bribed an honourable member there would be any record of the bribe?,32
226,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"A gross imputation has been cast upon honourable members, and there ought to be a thorough investigation. I trust that the Treasurer will assist as far as he can in enabling evidence' to be furnished so that the honour of the House may'be cleared.",32
227,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Hume-Trea surer) [4.29] - If I am in order, I should prefer to myself submit the motion for postponement.",32
228,The CHAIRMAN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The motion has already been submitted by the honourable member for Dalley.,32
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I can only say that, in consequence of the discussion, I had made up my mind to submit a motion of the kind myself, though I desire it to be distinctly understood that that decision was not arrived at because I have any belief that there has been any bribery. On the contrary, I do not believe that there has been bribery of any kind.",32
230,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Le t the Treasurer bring forward the man who made the statement to him.,32
231,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I am not going to say anything more on that score, at the present time.",32
232,Mr THOMAS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,What did he say?,32
233,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I told honourable members just now that he said he had got a list, and it was not much use going on. .",32
234,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"That is different from what the Treasurer told us. The Treasurer tola, us that this man said the company had the majority "" in its bag.""",32
235,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The right honourable member keeps harping on those words, and he is very unfair in doing so. I withdrew the words at bnce, when I saw their effect; but the right honourable member wants to make, a great stir, and blow his own trumpet, without any regard to the defence of the honour of honourable members. The right honourable member is only trying to make a great noise throughout the country.",32
236,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"No , no.",32
237,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I do not know what kind of board or committee will be required; but I believe that a body has been appointed already to inquire into matters of this kind.,32
238,The CHAIRMAN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I must ask the Treasurer not to discuss the constitution of any board Of inquiry, because the question before us now is that this item be postponed.",33
239,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,But the questions are so closely associated.,33
240,The CHAIRMAN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"There is no objection to his remarks, so long as the honourable member does not enter into a discussion of the constitution of any proposed board.",33
241,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"When the item is postponed I - hope that anv investigation decided upon will take place at once, because it is most undesirable to have the item indefinitely postponed.",33
242,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Who will make the investigation ?,33
243,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I do not know : I was about to refer to that matter when I 'was stopped by the Chairman.,33
244,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,It is a matter which will have to be considered by the Government.,33
245,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"It is quite probable that the proposed inquiry will do a little good, though I feel quite confident that no honourable member will be found guilty of any action unbecoming to his position. As I said before, it must be distinctly understood that, while I agree with this motion, I do not think that there has been the slightest bribery of any kind.",33
246,Mr GLYNN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Angas) [4.32] - We ought to know what is the next step the Government propose to take when this item has been postponed.,33
247,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I shall consult with the Prime Minister as to the course to be pursued.,33
248,Mr FISHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I think the Prime Minister ought fo be here when we are discussing a question reflecting on the honour of the House.,33
249,Mr HUME COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The Prime Minister would not know anything about the r:atter. seeing that he did not hear the debate.,33
250,Mr GLYNN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"What the Minister ought to do is to give the name of' his informant, so that, under our powers in relation to privilege, that person, if he can be found, may be brought to the bar of the House and asked to either substantiate or withdraw his words. I agree with the honourable member for Lang, that, in other respects, there is an opening for reformation. I do not know why honourable members should tolerate it , but it struck me yesterday, when a reflection was made on the political integrity of the honourable member for Boothby, to the effect that his voting was not consistent with his protectionist pledges",33
251,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,There was no imputation of that character.,33
252,Mr GLYNN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"In my mind, the words used by the Treasurer amounted to an imputation. If the Treasurer has the right to say that a man is not keeping his election pledges simply because he does not agree with the degree of protection proposed by the Government- ",33
253,Mr BATCHELOR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"My pledges have always been for free kerosene. ^ Mr Glynn - It struck me that the Treasurer did not take thefairest course when he suggested to the public that, the honourable member was not consistent with his election pledges.",33
254,Mr CARR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Macquarie) [4.35] - I hope this item will be postponed. I have taken a .particular interest in the oil duties, and I quite agree that, so far as the local industry is concerned, it would be better if there was an inquiry of the kind suggested, not only because of the imputations which have been cast, and which, of course, must be cleared first, but because the whole ouestion is a very intricate one. Personally, I should like to see the scope of the inquiry extended, so that a better understanding of the situation may be arrived at. Oil corporations have the name of indulging in machinations and the suspicion has been t accentuated by the discussion this afternoon ",33
255,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Parkes) [4.36] I shall support the motion, because I think it is necessary to emphasize the gravity of the situation which has been produced by the Treasurer's statement. The Committee ought not to allow themselves to be diverted by a mere apology on the part of the honourable gentleman, who made a statement which he now says is not an exact reproduction of what he was told. The Committee must remember that the Treasurer told us that somebody had told him that this oil company had secured a majority of the members of the House, and if we allow ourselves to be diverted into a fishing inquiry we shall lose the scent of the matter. The Treasurer has given us a thread in saying that he was told by somebody that the state of things described existed; and it is his absolute duty, either to disclose the name of that person, or to place himself in a position to be able to say that that person has unconditionally withdrawn any imputation he cast on the House. If we allow ourselves to be diverted into a sort of fishing excursion to find out whether not we are honourable men, we shall lose the thread which the Treasurer has given us. It is all very well for the Minister to say that he is sorry, but he has adSpeaker; mitted that the worse part of the expression, namely, that the oil companies had orable members "" in the bag,"" was not stated to him by the person who gave him the information.. Why did the Treasurer use that expression ?",33
256,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,It shows what interpretaable tion the Treasurer placed on the words.,34
257,Mr BRUCE SMITH,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"precisely ; and the Committee ought to insist on the Treadutv upon another item. surer revealing the name, or obtaining his informant an unconditional withdrawal of any imputation on members of this House.",34
258,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Laanecoorie) [4.38] - I agree with the honourable member for Parkes in the view that this special matter should be followed to its conclusion, and that the imputation, which rests on no basis or foundation, should be unconditionally withdrawn.",34
259,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,We cannot decide as to sented here? this item until the matter is cleared up.,34
260,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"^-1 quite agree with view, and I am glad that the item is to postponed. In addition, I think that whole question of lobbying, as it is carried on in this House, should.be brought under review. I should prefer such a question to be discussed when the Speaker is in the direction. chair, because that gentleman has control of the galleries, which are most frequented by those who desire to place matters conan nected with their business before members.",34

We should afford every facility for their placing before us, in a proper up in reference to this matter. fashion, their desires in any matters affectno ing themselves. Unfortunately, however, we have in the galleries of this House perin sons who subject honourable members to their importunities, and who are not ciimatter. rectlv affected by the Tariff, but are paid for the services which they render to others.",34

265,Mr SALMON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"That is the sort of or thing which ought to be stopped once and for ever. The power, however, does not - lie in this Committee, nor even in the House, but rests in the hands of Mr. and it is for that reason I believe this question ought to be discussed in the honHouse. The honourable member for Lang mentioned one particular individual, and made it appear that she had been specially singled oiit for reference because she advocated a reduction of duties. The honormember may be astonished to Team that that individual was prepared to work upon the same terms to obtain an increased That is the sort from of thing that we should stop.",34

' Mr FISHER (Wide Bav) [4.42] - My own opinion is that there has been a great deal pf loose talk indulged in by honourable members upon the question of their honour When Ministers make loose statements regarding the honour of this House, it is high time that serious 1 do not the honourable member for Laanecoorie to misunderstand the position which I take There is more impropriety in a person becoming the paid advocate of a duty than there is a professional man being engaged to represent-a particular firm in respect of any If honourable members cannot withstand persuasion on the part of paid servants, they ought not to he here. But my difficulty is not on that score at all. . I have previously stated that I do not believe there is a word of truth in the statements which have been published regarding the corruption of honourable members. that fact does not justify the Treasurer in throwing out hints of the kind, because the worse of all charges is that which consists, of half truth, and which may be made by insinuation in so many different ways. You, sir, will recollect an occasion in the Queensland Parliament upon which a very important matter of this character cropped up, and upon which we took a very definite action. The charge was made that .the votes of certain honourable members in connection with the construction of syndicate railways had been influenced, and that a document could be produced to show that improper overtures had been made to a person who had weight with honourable members, and that the document would show impropriety between the syndicate interested and honourable member's who might have been induced not to take a certain course.",34
270,Colonel FOXTON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,An offer was made.,35
271,Mr FISHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The present Premier of Queensland and myself obtained the original document. A proposal was made by the representative of a syndicate to an ex-member of the Queensland Parliament that the latter should benefit considerably if he were able to induce the Labour Party-no t co endeavour to pass the Bill , but not to stonewall it. That is the history of the matter. What did we do? Immediately we arrived at that position we said that corruption had been attempted by a party who would have benefited by the passing of the Bill. We therefore asked the Government not to proceed with the measure-to drop it immediately, and to seek a fitting oppoitunity to deal with the question.",35
272,Colonel FOXTON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,And they did.,35
273,Mr FISHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"- At first they character- involved in this discussion. ized our staLtements as political fireworks. At that time we did not wish to produce the document, and we did not produce it . was then suggested that it should be handed to Mr Speaker, but he declined to take the responsibility of deciding the matter. Mr. Kidston then suggested that a Judge should be appointed to determine the question at issue. His suggestion was adopted, and a District Court Judge was appointed to decide whether or not the charge was a sound one. The report of Judge Mansfield was that a deliberate and w i l f u l attempt had been made ""to suborn Parliament.",35
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,What happened further ?,35
275,Mr FISHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Nothing . But Colonel FOXTON - The gentleman concerned cleared out.,35
276,Mr FISHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The person who used to haunt Parliament Hou9e for the purpose of gaining support for syndicate railways took a first class ticket to another part of the world, and the particular measure in question was withdrawn. I mention this in cident to illustrate the danger of making . charges. But in that case we had the incriminating document in our possession. If there be a single member of this Committee who knows of any document which would incriminate or influence any honourable member, his .bounden duty is to rise in his place and inform us of it. If the Treasurer has any grounds for his suspicions, he should state them clearly. As being relevant to this question, I may, perhaps, be pardoned for stating a circumstance which happened in connection with my own family. Not long ago, a kerosene lamp was left at my house. My wife stated that she did not order it, and that she did not require it. The person who delivered it said that similar lamps were to be distributed to members of this Parliament. I had to write to the company concerned upon two occasions before they sent a man to take it away.",35
277,Mr THOMAS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Was that the Standard Oil Trust?,35
278,Mr FISHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I think it was the British Imperial Company. I had to write to them twice before they took the lamp away. One of the agents subsequently came to me and apologized for their action. That case whjich I have mentioned involved a gross act of impropriety, and if other honourable members have been similarly treated, they ought to say so. But I come nov^to the main point What does the postponement of this item mean ? Will it make any difference to the position? It Why not pass the Tariff now?",35
279,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"^ I have every confidence in honourable members, and I feel sure that there has been no bribery.",35
280,Mr FISHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"If the Treasurer has any evidence of bribery, let him produce it. I have related the only instance, so far as I am personally concerned, in which an act of impropriety was committed. Of course, I do not regard the forwarding to honourable members at this House of small articles such as a plug of tobacco, in - order that they may appreciate its quality, as improper. But to send any articleto an honourable member's private house is exceeding the bounds of decency.",35
281,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I had a lamp sent to me once, and I relegated it to the cellar of the Grand Hotel.",36
282,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I received a bag of lates from MACRobertson, and I am ashamed to say that I ate them.",36
283,Mr FISHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The interjection of leader of the Opposition aptly illustrates this question stood alone. my point. Nobody would ever accuse him of being likely to be corrupted by present of a bag of chocolates. MACRobertson had sent a ton of chocolates to his private house, it would have been an act of impropriety. What advantage steps to clear the atmosphere. shall we gain by postponing the considerathat tion of this item? Mr Reid,-We shall afford the slanderTariff. ers an opportunity of coming forward.",36
284,Mr FISHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"What does that mean? Is it not a fact """"that nine orable members believe that the whole of these charges are so much' humbug-tha they are farcical?",36
285,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"It is not a question of what we believe, but of what public believes.",36
286,Mr FISHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"My experience of the public is that it is much more sensible are ordinary Parliaments. The people are - chiefly concerned in getting the considerais tion of this Tariff completed. No investisponsibility in this connection. gation of the kind suggested can be pleted within a month, so that if the posal of the honourable member for Dalley be carried, the Tariff may not become law this session. I appeal to the leader of the Opposition as to whether our honour been seriously assailed-whethe r the tion cannot be made clear by a vote being taken upon this matter ? The only investiwarily gation for which I would care two straws would be one conducted by a Justice of High Court.",36
287,Sir JOHN FORREST,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"What is quiry wanted for, seeing that no charges have been made?",36

291,Mr WILKS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,It is an American phrase.,36
292,Mr FISHER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I appeal to the leader of the Opposition to allow this item to be dealt with, and to permit of our proceeding in a dignified way to ascertain whether there has been corruption or attempted corruption-in short, whether there is any foundation for any charges which may have chocobeen made against honourable members.",36

294,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"But deploring will not stop it. We want to take active I submit this is a matter which does not so much concern the Minister in charge of this It is one in which the Prime Minister, as the guardian of the honour and character of this House, should be held to out of ten honhis responsibility.",36
295,Mr STORRER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,A Select Committee has t been appointed for the purpose of such an inquiry.,36
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"No . A Select the Committee has been appointed to suggest some procedure which can be applied to similar cases in future. But nothing has than been promised by the Prime Minister. No definite statement can be got from him. It about time that we held him to his reI do not comthink that this item ought to'be passed prountil we have had from him a clear declaration that he will take such steps as will secure a full and fair investigation has into the allegations and rumours which posihave been heard from time to time. The Minister appears to have been unled by an article which appeared today in a journal which champions him, the into making the statements which have given offence. He made yesterday a remark similar to that which was made an into-day, and the Age therefore pats him on the back this morning, and calls him an "" o l d general."" It praises him we very highly for his courage in making these fierce denunciations of honourable I should like to read what the Treasurer's newspaper said about him this morning.",36

Speaking of what occurred yesterday, the Age, in a leading article today, says of the TreasurerHe was aprotectionist, not a time server, and he felt it was time that protectionists who allowed any influence to persuade them to "" get behind their protectionist principles"" should be exposed. This is the inception of what has culminated to-dayThis straight thrust at the Corner party evoked a storm of interjections, but the Minister, like an old general, coolly utilized the interval of rest provided him to prepare another attack. I suppose that it is the "" other attack "" that we have had today. The Minister gathered courage as he went on; but, luckily for the honourable member and the Committee, he has been pulled up this time. A little later the article continues"" They boasted,"" cried the Minister, "" that although we had passed the Commerce Act, they would ride through it "" ; and he added grimly, "" But they didn't."" A Labour member had interjected a little earlier- "" The same company boasted that it would buy the Commonwealth Parliament""; and the Minister said, ""Hear, hear ! "" There can be no doubt that Sir Will liam Lyne's disclosures-quite apart from certain disquieting rumours that have been rife for some time past, such as the quoted interjection crystallizesThe Age writer deliberately associates the Treasurer with these disquieting and accepts his remarks as cumulative evidence as to the baneful effect of the Standard Oil Trust's influence upon this Chamber. Its statements go almost as far as those of the Sydney Bulletin some time ago, though the proprietors of the latter journal were more courageous, and, instead of speaking - about rumours crystallizing, had the courage to say what they did about honourable members being bribed. All this that an. atmosphere charged with suspicionis being created. As the honourable member for West Sydney very properly said, where the Standard Oil Trust is concerned, it does not take much to arouse suspicion. There is therefore the greater reason why we should be supersensitive rather than allow allegations our honesty in relation to the Trust to pass unnoticed. I do not think that the mere postponing of the item will clear the air; I shall support the motion in order to Mr Josefh Cook. I do not Enable Ministers to consider what should be done to purify the atmosphere. In my It sup- opinion, we should not impose duties or* oil until' the Prime Minister has specifically stated what he intends to do toremove the suspicions which are at present hanging over Parliament.",36
299,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Robertson) [5.0] - The Minister was rather slow in moving in this matter. He says that he is very jealous of the honour of Parliament, yet it was not until a private member had moved that he did anything. He has stated that the word "" bag "" was not used by him, but that he said that the Trust had a list.",37
300,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I said that there was a list, and that the Standard Oil Trust would win.",37
301,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The Treasurer said that the Standard Oil Trusthad a list. His remarks' were - tantamount to saying that it had captured a majority' of honourable 'members.,37
302,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,No .,37
303,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"How could ithave a list, unless its representatives had interviewed honourable members, and knew how they would vote? The Minister can put his own interpretation on his words; but what he said was that the Trust had honourable members in its bag. If that was his belief, it was his duty, to consult . the Prime Minister, and not proceed with the item until he had done so. Had he found that there was nothing in the susrumours, picions, he could have gone on without making, them public. The Minister has acted very injudiciously. Although he has apologized, he has not undone the harm that his remarks have created. He ""has publicly stated his opinion that the Trust possessed a list of honourable members whose opinions were known, and "" had the disquieting Committee in its bag.""",37
304,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I did not think anything of the kind. indicates Mr HENRY WILLIS - The statement made by the Minister was most improper. He should have investigated the source of his suspicions, and, having done so, if he still held them, he should have made a full breast of the affair, and shown what influence had been at work, so that we might know how things stood. I think impugning that a great many slanders are current because we do not assert our privileges. The building is infested with dead-beats and the representatives of all sorts of concerns,, and there is no one representing Mr . - Speaker to go round and turn them out. No member of a trust or company Approached me; I should not know any them if I fell over them.

It is all very well for honourable members opposite to talk of what will be published in the newspapers tomorrow. The newspapers are like these oil companies-the y are ranged on opposing sides. When a Minister proposes something of which the Ministerial organs approve they warmly support him, whilst the attitude of the leader of the Opposition in opposing that proposal is supported by the Opposition journals.

There is no doubt that in the House or in public it would have - been wrong to use such language; and I have given the only explanation I can offer.

Under the circumstances, I do not see that much can be gained by a postponement, except, of course, a vote when the atmosphere is clearer and calmer. The question becomes immaterial now that any suggestion against the honesty of honourable members has been unreservedly withdrawn.. In my opinion, the statement which appeared in the leading columns of the Melbourne Age this morning is much worse than which gave rise to the discussion this up to afternoon. We, of course, take no notice of imputations of the kind when they appear in journalistic ' ' rags,'' but when they are published in a journal which purports tolead public opinion in Victoria, there ought to be some authority or proof for charges newspaper However, we iknow that Tuesunder present conditions, any attempts on the part of the Parliament to deal with am newspaper attacks end in absurdity; and,, in any case, questions of the kind have a l ready been referred to a Select Committee.

The. demand for that class of work is so limited that they complain of the severity of the times. Yet we are asked to a increase that severity by imposing an. unnecessary burden upon them. If these persons followed their own inclinations they would use Australian marble for the finer it classes of sculpture. But they point out that the local marble has certain defects.,50

Mr JOHNSON - Mr Richardson pointed out that even in the finest quality of Australian marble there are certain defects. He admitted that at a greater depth a more perfect marble may be discovered.,50

524,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I am speaking of the marble used in statuary, which has to be very finely. It is full of small flinty substances, which, if struck by the chisel",50
525,Mr WEBSTER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"As a rule, when struck the chisel, they knock a piece out of it .",50
526,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"They not only knock a piece out of the chisel, but cause a defect in the statuary by impairing its beauty. As the sculptors themselves say 'that we' have not a sufficiently fine marble for use in the more delicate classes of sculpture, and no amount of duty will cure this grave defect. It is also pointed out that, after working, the local marble loses its. whiteness and assumes a dirty muddy-like tint. I think that for a little while longer we ought to admit marble free. - Mr Webster (Gwydir) [8.0] - I am rather surprised that the honourable member for Lang should talk with such an amount of authority upon this question. His remarks merely serve to show how little he knows about it.",50
527,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Surely the sculptors know their own business.,51
528,Mr WEBSTER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Practicall y all the statuary that we see in Australia is imported from Italy, where it is produced by the aid of intricate machinery with which no Australian workman could compete. If we abolish the duty upon marble we shall detrimentally affect the production of that article in Australia, a course of action which seems to me absolutely unjustifiable/ I hope that the Committee will agree to the retention of this duty, in the interests ot the marble industry.",51
529,Mr STORRER,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Bass) [8.1] - A few months ago I visited a sculptor's studio in Victoria, where I was shown several kinds of marble which are produced in this State; and only a week or two ago another sculptcr informed me that he had discovered a quarry not far from Launceston' which contains the best marble that he has seen. Under these circumstances, I think we should retain this d u t y of 10 per cent. Marble may be the raw material of the sculptor, but it is the finished article of the ouarryman, and the latter, needs to be encouraged just as much as does any one else.",51
530,Mr HEDGES,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Fremantle) [8.3] - I hope that the Committee will not admit unwrought marble free. I think that a duty of 10 per cent, is little enough to impose upon this material. Statuary is not a necessary of life. Persons who can afford to have statuary about their places can afford to pay a little duty upon the raw material used in its production. Since this item was previously under consideration, I have paid a visit to Angaston, in South Australia, where some of the finest deposits of marble to be found in the. Commonwealth exist-marbl e which is suitable for a'i practical purposes. If anvbody desires to use better marble than can be obtained there, he can 'certainly afford to pay a duty of 10 per cent, upon it.",51
531,Mr CARR,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Macquarie) [8.5] - I hope that the duty of 10 per cent, upon this item will be retained. In New South Wales, we have a number of extensive quarries, containing the best marble to be found in the world. There is every reason why we should encourage the quarrying of this marble, owing to the cheap transit charges levied upon other marbles which answer the same purpose, but which do not provide our own. people with employment, or enable us to develop our own resources. In this instance, at any rate, there is very little danger of the duty being added to the price of the commodity.

534,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Hume-Trea surer) [8.13] - I ask the Committee to insist on the duty originally agreed to, as it was imposed for the reason that the Ammonia Company of Australia was erecting a Targe plant at Sydney for the manufacture of muriate of ammonia.

The more consistent course for those who think that disinfectants and insecticides should remain free would be to vote against the Senate's request. Then, again, those who consider that they' should be taxed, .should vote against the suggested amendment, because, under it , sheep, cattle, and horse washes would be free, whilst articles of infinitely more importance to the health of humanity would remain dutiable.

In the interests of cleanliness and public health, insecticides should be freeMany disinfectants are used in hospitals as well as for cleansing drains and for other sanitary purposes. They can be made where ever there is a chemist; but there are many patent preparations which are excellent and valuable. I hope that the Committee will disagree with the Senate's requests.

They are grown in Austria, more particularly in . the provinces of the Danube, and my information is that not one ounce of these flowers is produced in Australia. I do not know why they should not be grown here, but it would be better to encourage their cultivation by means of a bounty than by a duty. If the duty be charged on the ' flower's, as well as on the packages, we shall injure the tinning, printing, and paper industries. These insecticides are sent in in parcels of 1 oz. to 3 ozs. weight, but, if they are admitted free in 28-lb. parcels, the small 'manufacturer may purchase them, and, in manufacturing the insecticides, compete with the largest manufacturers, The with benefit to the other industries ! have mentioned.",54

I do not know how many more there are in the Commonwealth,; but they are not doing great business, in view of the fact that the value of the importations increased from jQig'6ix in 1903 to over .£52,000 in 1906. I may say that I have been over the establishment of the well-known manufacturing chemists, Messrs.

As a matter of for fact, it would not require many hands to manufacture sufficient disinfectants to supply the needs of the whole Commonwealth. I ask the Committee who will be chiefly affected by this duty? Unquestionably, it will be the poorer classes of the community. The public health demands that we should enable our people to procure disinfectants of the best quality at the lowest possible price.'

We appear to ignore the fact that a Royal Commisthem are printed locally. sion was appointed at the cost of many thousands of pounds to investigate the operation of the - first Commonwealth Tariff. The Government, too, in their desire to tax everything that is used by the thirds of their producers, seem to forget their original posals. Ever since the Commonwealth established, insecticides, sheep washes, and disinfectants, have been admitted free. But now, on account of a decision of the Senate- I believe by a very narrow maready jority-the y are prepared to levy a heavy duty upon these articles. clearly shown that the product from which insecticides are manufactured is not grown in Australia. If there is one thing more than another that we must deplore, it is the number of insect pests to be found the Commonwealth. The man who makes a his living from the soil is at constant with pests of all descriptions, and insecper ticides are a valuable aid to him in that connection. Similarly, we ought not place any embargo upon disinfectants. I hope that the Committee will not do anydrum thing adverse to the interests of our ducers. I have received a number of following: letters from my own State, intimating that the imposition of a tax upon any of these drum, articles will have a very injurious effect. I shall not be able to support the Governlon plus ment in departing from the proposal which they originally submitted to this Committee, and from the recommendation of the Tariff Commission.",56
606,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Lang) [9.2] - It is only in accordance with the fitness of things that honourable members who carried a tax upon tombstones should now support a tax upon hospitals. I desire to' point out that the Tariff Commission recommended that this item should be placed upon the free list, that the Government originally adopted their recommendation, and that this Committee also agreed to it . Yet the Treasurer liow exhibits a complete change of front. I need scarcely remind honourable members that locally-made disinfectant is already sold at half the price of the imported article, and consequently there is no need to extend to it any protection whatever. It is, so I am informed by chemical experts, a very inferior article, and, therefore, not nearly as effecas are the imported standard Further, more than two-thirds of the imported disinfectants are put up by local labour in locally-made tins and bottles, and the labels attached to Consequently, these importations provide a considerable amount of employment. As a matter of fact, I am informed, the cost of the labour thus employed amounts to twoentire selling cost. proExcept as regards sheep dips and cattle was washes, which comprise about 80 per cent, of the total importations, the importation of disinfectants has recently declined. The honourable member for Wilmot has alreferred to the fact that these disinfectants enjoy a very high measure of naI t has been tural protection.",56
607,Mr HUMECOOK,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,It costs more to send them from Melbourne to Perth than it does to send them from London to Melbourne.,56
608,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The honourable memin ber for Wilmot has shown that they enjoy very cons derable natural protection. The : war freight charges are 85 per cent, higher cargo steamer than they are for ordinary cargo, namely, 65s. as against 35s. to per ton. Upon a 40-gallon cask this works out at 7d. per gallon, and upon a 5-gallon at r i j d . per gallon. A communicaprotion which has reached me contains the The difference in the Home cost of the 5-gallon 3s. 6d. each (subsequently sold here for use at is. 6d. each), a difference of 5d. per gali i j i d . gives the local manufacturer is. 4id. per gallon protection. But on the ground of the public health alone, I * maintain that we should endeavour to make these articles as cheap as possible. I hold in my hand a table of bacteriological tests to which various disinfectants were subjected, and I find that the most efficient is cyllin (medical) .Jeyes, which, upon a B. typhosus organism was found to be twenty times stronger than <pure carbolic acid. The other disinfectants included perchloride of mercury, cyllin, creolin, lysol, Pearson's antiseptic, zotal, bactox, carbolic acid, lozar, formalin,, chinosol, chloride of zinc, lysofarm, and listerine. These were found to possess carbolic acid co-efficient's ranging from 20.0 t-.in i l .",56
609,Mr HUME COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,-Are those Australian disinfectants ?,57
610,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I am speaking of all disinfectants' included in the list of tests supplied to me. The country of origin is not stated.,57

612,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Jeye s is at the head of the list I have read. And I am informed .that the cheaper kinds of locally-produced disinfectants are practically useless, because of the adulteration which takes place, and, perhaps, because of the lack of experience of local manufacturers - It is essential that the disinfectants used in our hospitals and elsewhere shall be of the best quality, and obtainable as cheaply as possible. Therefore, I shall vote for the first proposal of the Government, namely, to-make disinfectants and insecticides free.",57
613,Mr HUTCHISON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Hindmarsh) [p.ri'J. --The honourable member for Lang speaks of disinfectants having been sold at half price, and would lead the Committee to believe that all Australian disinfectants are sold at half price, and, consequently, are inferior. I would point out. that inferior lines of both imported and locally-made articles can be obtained. As for the tests which he has quoted. I am informed that recent tests by Dr Bull, M . D . , B.S., D rector of the Bacteriological Laboratory at the Melbourne University, have proved beyond doubt that phenyle of Australian manufacture is quite equal in co-efficiency and quality to the best imported. What better authority than Dr Bull can we have? According to the Opposition, no Australian maker is capable of producing anything good, and we must depend on foreigners for everything.",57

615,Mr HUTCHISON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"O u r workmen and manufacturers must be protected against the competition of the people of Great Britain as much as against the competition of those of other countries, though I prefer' that goods which we do not manufacture shall be imported from the Old Country rather than from other parts of the world. We are as well able to manufacture disinfectants and insecticides as are the people of Great Britain, Europe, or America, and the members of the Opposition should show that they have some faith in their own country. The testimonial to which I have referred should induce the Committee to give protection to an industry which will hold its own against outside competition.",57

617,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,There was no argument.,57
618,Mr BOWDEN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The Treasurer is so sunk in ignorance and prejudice that he is not open to argument. What the honourable member for Lang said was that disinfectants were of different qualities-.,57

620,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,-Rubbis h !,57
621,Mr BOWDEN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"He pointed out that imported disinfectants sell for nearly twice as much as those which are locally made, showing conclusively that the imported article is bought, either because of the prejudice against the locally made, or because it is better, and that there is no need for the proposed protection. Australia should fall into line with the other countries of the world by allowing disinfectants and insecticides to be admitted free. In New South Wales, the Government,, and many municipal councils, distribute disinfectants free to householders, to encourage their i - use, in the interests of the public health. Therefore, we should make this article as cheap as possible.",57
622,Mr WILSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,Are insecticides distributed free?,57
623,Mr BOWDEN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"No doubt many municipal authorities would distribute insecticide, too, if applied to. The Government proposes to allow 28-lb. packets of insecticides to come in free, and to make dutiable anything imported in smaller quantities. That seems to me an unworthy proposal. The packing into smaller parcels is a mere bagatelle, and gives opportunities for adulteration. I wish also to emphasize the point made by the honourable member for Wentworth, that the: fruit-growers of Australia should be studied. They have all they can do to make ends meet. It is not the pastoralists, but the fruit-growers, who have the greatest struggle, yet sheep dips and cattle dips are free while the insecticides and disinfectants are made dutiable. Every kind of frui t is. attacked by its own particular pesf, and most of them by more than one",57
624,Mr HUME COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,They are imported articles.,58
625,Mr BOWDEN,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,A great many of these diseases have been imported.,58
626,Mr HUME COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Most of them have been imported. ' Mr BOWDEN - If that be we ought to give the fruit-grower a chance to fight them with imported remedies. Governments of the States compel the about the matter. fruit-growers to combat these pests, and are doing all they can to assist them in the fight, and we ought to further their efforts by making disinfectants and insecticides to be caught. free.",58
627,Mr HUTCHISON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Hindmarsh) [9.20]. - On looking at the tests referred to by the honourable member for Lang, I find them to be English tests, whereas that which I read was a Melbourne test.

If * the locally-made article were what the honourable member stated, customers would not be found for it, because the facts would be set out the labels.

633,Mr HUME COOK,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The honourable member was at the time speaking of the tests which had been made. He does not like,58
634,Mr JOHNSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I resent the Minister's language, and shall not allow him to force statements into my mouth. If , in the confusion caused by a bombardment of interjections, I made a slip, I am not going to be pinned down to it . I say that, from information which I have received, ' I have reason to believe that the best imported Engseen lish disinfectants are far and away ahead what of the cheaper brands made in Australia. I was quoting the tests of the various disinof fectants, whose names I gave. None of us, except medical men or scientists, can profess information as we are able to gather from the best sources available to us. I have put the Committee the information that I have been able to obtain, and I am entitled to do that just as the honourable member who interjects is entitled to give what on information he obtains from any source. Mr HENRY WILLIS '(Robertson) [9.26] - I am willing to concede that these disinfectants are of equal value. If they are not effective, they will not find, any buyers. The effect of these proposed duties of 25 and 15 per cent, would be to in prices to that extent. The honourable member for Bourke .smiles .as if he' not were an innocent. Does he not know that Austhe object of protection is to give local I manufacturers a margin on which to work upon the ground that the cost of production here is in many cases more than elsewhere? The Government are seeking to increase the prices of these imports by 25 per cent. If the foreigner does not pay the duty-, then the consumer must do so. The prices of local productions will also be in creased if these duties be imposed. Sheepwashes are free. It is proposed to impose heavy duties on disinfectants and insecticides n.e.i. We must not forget that manymen make sheep-dips from disinfectants, and that washes so prepared are just as effective as are many that are put up and sold under various names. Undoubtedly, the intention of the Government in supporting this request is to increase the cost to the consumer. Their policy is to tax the producer.",58
635,Mr HUTCHISON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The honourable member knows nothing about the matter.,59
636,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"I am glad to find that the honourable member disagrees with me. If honourable members desire to improve our staple products, they will make these articles as cheap as possible to the. consumer. Some honourable members think that the item is a comparativelytrivial one. As a matter of fact, millions of sheep and cattle are treated with these materials, and the imposition of these duties will mean that the producers will have to pay into the revenue an enormous sum.",59

Little's English phenyle is sold today in Victoria at 5s. 2d. per dozen., whereas MCKellan and Ramsay's phenyle- a local production-is sold at 3s. 6d. per dozen.",59

691,Mr REID,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"In some cases, the duty of ios. will be an impost of more than 100 per cent. These articles are used very largely by invalids, and I do not think that such a high duty should be imposed.",63
692,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"North Sydney) [10.30] - Apar t from the objection which has been raised by the leader of the Opposition, I should like to ask the Treasurer whether he is satisfied that the furniture which we expressly relieved from these high fixed duties will not be brought under the item if the request be agreed to. The proposed new paragraph will cover couches and lounges constructed not wholly of cane. I am satisfied that the Department will so construe it . Austrian cane couches, for instance, are made partly of wood, and the backs of Chinese cane chairs and lounges are supported by wood. The Department of Trade and Customs has power to charge the higher duty where there is any doubt as to the rate that should be imposed.",63

702,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"But we might go tco far by making such a modification. Some wood might be used in the construction of the lounges and settees intended to be covered by this request. If I assure the honourable member that Austrian chairs and couches consisting principally of wood will not be made dutiable under this item, that should be sufficient.",63
703,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"That is all very well. We have this assurance by the Minister, at the instance of an officer, but we have no assurance that the decision will continue to be observed. .We must take ordinary precautions to see that our proposals express exactly what we mean. I submit that duties 'of 40 per cent, and 30 per cent, are sufficiently high; but before I vote against the proposal made, I ask the Treasurer to make it clear that the couches and chairs which were specially exempted will not be included. I do Mr TUDOR (Yarra) [10.37] - The honourable member for North Sydney need have no apprehensions. The articles which this item is intended to cover are those which come from Japan, the Straits Settlements, and China, and the A section of the Tariff Commission had them in their mind when the duties were recommended which were honourable originally introduced by the Government. I have here a piece of imported bamboo, which is riddled by insects, and the honourable member for Melbourne, who has had a trip to the East, knows exactly what the position is there. Some objection has been raised to lobbying; and I may say that the samples of wood I have in my possession were not supplied by any manufacturer, but by the secretary of the wicker-workers' trades union. Here is a piece of Australian blackwood, covered with pith, which insects will not touch. These insects, imported from the East, get into the furniture already in use in Australia : and I know a gentleman, into whose oiano these insects got from some of the imported chairs or settees. He promptly rushed the instrument into an auction room; and it was not long before it was in the auction West Sydney. room again. There is hardly an honourable member, I suppose, but who has had an experience of the ravages of these insects in advertence. furniture; and, as has alreadv been pointed out, the willow industry of Tasmania has, from this cause, been absolutely ruined. Mr French, the Government Entomologist of Victoria, who, ot course, is unbiased, very strongly against the Importation of furniture which carries these insects; and I borer insect. urge upon honourable members the necessity for imposing a high duty, so as to prevent, as far as possible, these insects from cominto ing in .

During the past three I months I have had a little experience of the way in which those officers can stretch for their imaginations in interpreting this in Tariff. I know perfectly well what they w i ll do if they possibly can. Their idea is to get at the public every time. In reference to one item, I brought under their notice the - statement of the Treasurer, as recorded in'Hansard, but they told me that they could take no notice of that, and that they must interpret the Tariff as they found it. Let us embody our desires in this schedule.

Mr STORRER - As far as I know, our Customs officers exercise a certain amount of intelligence, and if they did they should be dismissed from the service.

The cost of such articles as settees and lounges wicker, .bamboo, or cane, made in the East, is only about £ 5 5s.. for a set eight pieces. This duty of ios. each would be equivalent to more than 100 per cent, upon such articles. As the Minister that he does not desire a duty of more than 45 per cent., I make the suggestion that the amount of 10s. should be reduced to 5s. Will the Treasurer accept that gestion, or does he wish to clap a duty of 100 per cent, on goods of this descripTo tion?",65
721,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,I wish to collect what the Senate desire to have collected.,65
722,Mr HENRY WILLIS,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"The Senate say, "" Whichever rate returns, the higher duty."" There is no doubt that the duty of ios. would be higher, because this description of furniture is very inexpensive.",65
723,Mr MALONEY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Melbourne) [10.58] The honourable member for Robertson says that. the duty proposed would amount to 100 per cent. But is he aware of the wages paid in the East? The wages in Japan are higher than those in China; but even in Japan a man for a day's work of twelve hours receives only is. 2 j d . In Melbourne, under the Factories Act, a cabinetmaker is paid 8s. for a day's work of eight hours. So that the wages paid here are 600 per cent, higher than those paid in Japan. The honourable member for Parramatta has alluded to the small quantity of this description of furniture that is imported. It is small if we take the money value of it ; but I ask honourable members to remember the destructive character of the .insect which is so frequently introduced in bamboo furniture.",65
724,Mr ATKINSON,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,The insects do not necessarily come in the imported furniture.,65
725,Mr MALONEY,EASTERN EXTENSION CABLE,"Mr French, the Victorian Entomologist, whose name has attained world-wide fame, says that theinsect is a native of Japan. Twenty years not ago it was quite unknown in this country, but at the present time it is quite common.
