0,NA,Unknown,It seemed so ridiculous and so utterly at variance with all my public utterances on the subject that nobody could possibly believe I hacl ever said it .,44
1,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"The publication of that statement in the Sydney Morning Herald, the Daily 'Telegraph, the Evening Nei.cs, and the Ausbralian Star, not to mention some of the country newspapers, must have exerted considerable influence upon the electors of that State regarding the question then at issue.",44
2,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,Is the member referring to a period prior to the referendum t,44
3,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Yes now to a manifesto issued by his party upon the night that the Prime Minister was addressing his meeting. In offering these observations, I wish honourable members to understand that I am anxious to avoid all personal reflections. I think that we should endeavour to raise the tone of the Federal Parliament by avoiding all references of a personal character. In the manifesto to which I have referred- some thousands of copies of which were distributed",44
4,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,Has the honourable member a copy of it here ?,44
5,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I have a part of it here-the other portion is at home. Amongst other statements contained in that manifesto is the following :Free-trade and a high protective Tariff are both impossible. The necessity of raising a large venue makes free-trade impossible, ancl for same reason a prohibitive Tariff is out of question. Therefore, there is nothing to both free-traders nnd protectionists the ranks of the association.",44
6,Mr BROWN,Unknown,The name of the association was altered for that purpose.,44
7,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Exactly . The effect of that statement was to mislead the free-traders of New South Wales, ancl to tion,will induce them to vote differently from what tive they otherwise would have done.",44
8,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,Unknown,Was that festo issued prior to the referendum ?,44
9,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,No ; it was the issued upon the night that the right honour the able gentleman delivered his address at of revenue. Maitland.,44
10,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,It says that hibitive Tariff was impossible.,44
11,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Yes . In his address the right honourable gentleman clared that he desired to raise revenue.,44
12,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,I have always stated that revenue was the first consideration.,44
13,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"That is so; but the Prime Minister must admit that after reading the statement to which I have directed attention, the people of the Commonwealth would scarcely expect a Tariff of the character originally proposed by the Government to be submitted to this House. Why, the duties levied upon some of theitems which it contained amountedto SO honourable per cent, and 100 per cent. That the right honourable gentleman misled some of his own supporters in this matter is evidenced I come by the fact that Mr Thomson, who formerly represented a free-trade constituency in the New South Wales Legislature, and who took the chair for him at one of his meetings, immediately upon the character of the Tariff being made public, wired as follows :Great wrath at betrayal of constituency by breach of promise. .We expected heavy revenue duties, but not a one-sided Victorian monstrosity.",44
14,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,Unknown,That shows that he did not understand the subject about which he was talking.,44
15,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,It shows that the Prime Minister misled the free-trade electors of New South Wales.,44
16,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"At the meeting over which Mr Thomson presided I distinctly stated that the Tariff would be a reprotective one, that the Ministry was almost the entirely composed of protectionists, but that the the measure of protection afforded must be prevent moderate, having regard to the circumfrom joining stances of the States.",44
17,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Did the Prime Minister sayI t will be a business Tariff, a practical working Tariff, a real Federal Tariff? That is what we fight for. If you desire revenue destructhen you must look for another representaand the Australian Parliament must look for another Prime Minister, for we shall not take manipart in any such task us that. It will be generally admitted that some of duties which were originally proposed by Government must have been destructive",44
18,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,No ; the proof of a prothe pudding is in. the eating.,44
19,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,The dutie* originally proposed must necessarily have deproduced a large revenue. The other night my honourable friend intimated that I had something to do with the defeat of the duty - upon tea. I take my full share of responsibility in that connection. Why did I .assist in bringing about the defeat of that - duty ?,44
20,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,The honourable member had his leader's pair in his pocket.,45
21,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I did so be-cause on the 19th of March of last year the Treasurer brought down to the House .an amended financial statement showing that up to that date he would, so far as he could ascertain from the estimates, receive nearly £600,000 more than he had anticipated, notwithstanding all the reductions which hacl been made in the Tariff. At that time we had dealt with all the principal items of the Tariff. The Treasurer's statement was submitted the night before we were called upon to deal with the tea duty, and in view of the fact that the revenue was so much in excess - of the Ministerial estimate, many honourable .members like myself, who believe that tea is a fair subject for duty, felt thab they - could not support a proposal which would provide the Government with an additional £500,000 or £600,000.",45
22,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The honourable member admits whipping on that occasion? Mr SYD LVEY SMITH - I admit having taken part in it.,45
23,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The honourable member did not sav that in Tasmania.,45
24,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Yes , I did *but when the Minister for Home Affairs in Tasmania. was in Tasmania h.e told the people of that State a nice little fairy tale, which, glad to say, was not received with much appreciation. In dealing with the tea duty - the Treasurer made the following important statement. I venture to say that if we hurl told the States which have been loyal to the federal movement from first to last that their finances were - disarranged to a considerable extent, Ave have found that they would not have entered the Federation at all. In the case of Tasmania the question issue was to relieve that State of taxation to the extent of £15,124. But what was shortly the position of New South Wales'? The Prime Minister has frequently told the tors of that State that federation would - cost them the price of the registration - dog-that it would not amount to 2s. 6cl. per head of the population. Indeed, he (recently declared that its actual cost is about Is. per head of the population. Yet, according to the last financial statement of the Colonial Treasurer under the Federal Tariff, the people of New South Wales are taxed to the extent of £1,250,000 more than they were previously taxed. This.sum represents about £ 1 per head, notwithstanding which the Prime Minister assured them that federation certainly would not cost more than 2s. Gd. per head.",45
25,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"That was the estimate which was always made of the "" n e w "" expenditure caused by federation. It does not reach that sum even now.",45
26,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Did the right honourable gentleman tell the people of New South Wales that they would be compelled to submit to additional taxation through the Customs representing £1,250,000?",45
27,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,No ; but I told them that there must be a heavy Tariff i i i order that proper returns might be made to the States.,45
28,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"The Tariff at present operating yields about £9,500,000 annually, notwithstanding that reductions were made in it represenbing taxation bo the extent of £1,250,000 a year. Yet my honourable friend opposite blames the Opposition, because in a fair fight they defeated an attempt on the part of the Government to extract an additional £500,000 or £600,000 from the pockets of the people.'",45
29,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The lionorable : member explained that matter differently,45
30,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I explained it I am as I am explaining it now; I never make speeches calculated to mislead people.,45
31,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The honourable member cannob have been correctly reported.,45
32,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I do not make much complaint of misreporting, of which, however, I have bo bake my share. This is to be nob the firsb bime the Prime Minister and should myself have come into collision over the into matter of misleading the electors in reference to a Tariff. A few years ago the Prime at Minister was a supporter of our free-trade Ministry, and when an abbempb was made, after his election, to raise the fiscal issue,.he said that ""he would have nothing electo do with the Opposition."" The Governnot menb was defeated a few weeks later, and of a the right honourable member accepted office as Attorney-General. Mr Wise, the present has Attorney-General of New South Wales, only speaking in reference to a partly protective 'Tariff which was introduced in the New South Wales Parliament, said :The honourable and learned member for East - Sydney, Mr Barton, has had two opportunities - of makingbis choice, and on each occasion he has deceived those who trusted him. 1 tell him now that upon the great question of a union of the colonies his chance of leadership has gone by for ever. The man who will not be a leader upon that question, or upon any other great question requiring the confidence of the people, is the man who has betrayed that confi-clence twice.",45
33,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,Unknown,Mr Wise has repented of that since.,46
34,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I dare say that Mr Wise has repented of a good many tilings since, but that was his opinion as - a free-trader. At any rate, these remarks show that the Prime Minister was not true to the promise he made to the people of East Sydney when he was elected, but that he brought in a protective measure, which was contrary to the wishes of the electors, as was proved by the subsequent defeat of the Government. The Minister for Home Affairs has been making some speeches in Tasmania .in reply to those delivered by the leader of the Opposition. It must be admitted that, the Minister for Home Affairs had a very Audience at the meeting to which I am year. - about to refer.",46
35,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I had a very audience ; the honourable member must havemention. been reading the Launceston Examiner.,46
36,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I saw by one of the newspapers which support the honourable gentleman's policy that at meeting there were about 500 people present. At the meeting - addressed by Mr figures. Beid, although a charge of Is. per head - was made for admission, up to ten minutes before the hour of commencement",46
37,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,To see the play.,46
38,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I which the Prime Minister does not like, and which he will like less before the general election is over. I was about to point out that, notwithstanding this charge for admission-which , I may say, was made - against the wish of the leader of the Oppoground sition-the hall was packed. On the other hand, when the Minister for Home Affairs - addressed a meeting in the same hall - audience was so small that a curtain was - drawn half-way down the hall, galleries there was not a single auditor. At that meeting the Minister for Home Affairs societies ? endeavoured to show that protectionist Victoria had made great progress as compared with free-trade New South Wales, aud to support his position he referred to the deposits in the Savings Banks of the two'States. As a matter of fact, during the last ten years the Savings Bank depositors of New South Wales have increased by about 79 per cent., as against an increase of 34 per cent, in Victoria, while the deposits have increased by 105 per cent, in New South Wales as against 71 per cent, in Victoria. During the same period the average per depositor was £ 3 8 l is . 6'd. in New South Wales as compared with £2 4 14s. Sd. per head in Victoria, while in 1901 the amount per head of population in the Savings Banks of Victoria was £ 8 Ss. 8d. as against £ 8 13s. 9d. in New South Wales. In 1891,in all the banks, building societies, and other provident associations of Victoria, the deposits amounted to £7,195,001 more than did the deposits in similar institutions in New South Wales, whereas in 1901 the reverse was shown, the amount in New South Wales being ovei £5,000^000 more than in Victoria.",46
39,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,The honourable member is small comparing a boom year with a drought 1,46
40,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I will take any year the honourable member likes to large The Minister for Home Affairs, in the course of his speech in Tasmania, said that in the Savings Banks of New South Wales the deposits amounted to £11,000,000, ignoring the fact that they that amounted to nearly £900,000 more.",46
41,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,I gave the exact,46
42,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I took the figures from the report in the Sydney Daily Telegraph.,46
43,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,How much was there in t is a play the banks generally ?,46
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,Giv e the number of Savings Bank depositors.,46
45,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"The honourable member for Melbourne Ports changes his ' as soon as he finds the facts against him. I admit that there were more depositors in Victoria, but I have shown that the the deposits per depositor and per head of population were greater in New South while in the Wales than in Victoria.",46
46,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Where are the friendly,46
47,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"All these societies are lumped together in Coghlan. The Minister for Home Affairs talked about the enormous sums of loan money expended in New South Wales as compared with Victoria. It must be remembered, however, that the way iij which the figures are used in Victoria would deceive most honourable members. In New South Wales the expenditure of loan money includes such works as sewerage, tramways, and local government, and the amount comes to £ 5 1 4 s. per head : but in Victoria, for the purpose of reference, water and sewerage works and tramways are kept apart. If in Victoria all these works were taken into consideration in the same way as in New South Wales we should find that in 1900, which, I believe, was the last year of office of the Reid Administration-and we are not responsible for what has taken place since",47
48,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the honourable member intend to connect these remarks with the question before the House'/,47
49,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I think I shall be in order in showing that New South of Wales has made progress under free-trade, while Victoria has gone 'hack tective policy. The expenditure per head of population in New South Wales in 1900 was £ 5 1 4s., while in Victoria it was £ 5 4 2s. 4d. The Minister for Home Affairs i stated that the New South Wales Governber ment had received £40,000,000 from the public lands, but if we compare the alienated lands in Victoria and in New South Wales we find that the latter State has parted with 24 per cent., and Victoria with cent. It must further be borne in mind that Victoria has received from her minerals no less a sum than £263,000,000 sterling: while from the same source New South trade ? Wales has received only £138,000,000. Victoria thus had a splendid £125,000,000 more than New South Wales i from this source.",47
50,Mr MAUSER,Unknown,How about the last ten years ?,47
51,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I am now toria speaking of the total receipts. The Minister for Home Affairs tried to gull the people Tasmania by speaking of the great success of manufactures in Victoria as compared with those in New South Wales. But durthe ing the last twelve 3'ears, the number males employed in the factories of Victoria litis decreased by 2,04G, as compared with an increase in New South Wales during the last eleven years of 11,258. It must be admitted that the number of females employed in the factories of Victoria has, during that period, increased by 11,143, but the total increase of males and females in New South Wales has been 15,256 as against 9,097 in Victoria. Then the Minister for Home Affairs tried to show that even in the matter of population Victoria could compare favourably with New South Wales. But surely it is no evidence of prosperity under protection that in the last ten years Victoria has lost one-tenth of her population, and is still losing it in large numbers. The Attorney-General himself admitted in a speech he delivered on this question in the Victorian State Parliament on ihe 5th October, 1892, that in Victoria the miners hacl nothing to expect from protection, while the farmers had obtained all the benefit they possibly could from that policy, and would soon be in the same position as the miners, thus showing clearly that protection could not possibly be of any advantage to either these classes. As to trade, I should like to refer to the figures of Mr Fenton, the under a proVictorian statistician.",47
52,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"He is all wrong. Mr SYDNEY SM [TH - Everybod y is all wrong, according to the honourable, memfor Melbourne Pcrts. But Mr Fenton shows that in the years from 1860 to 1900' there was a decreasein extra-Australian trade amounting to £600,000 in Victoria, as against an increase of £26,000,000 in New 41 per South Wales during the same period.",47
53,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Does not the honourable member know that Mr Fenton has said that he forgot to include the whole of the timber,47
54,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"That will not start with amount to a great deal. Mr MAUtniis - Ove r £100,000. - Mr SYDNEY SMITH - Thedifferenc e in favour of New South Wales was £26,000,000. Forty years ago the extra-trade of Vicexceeded that of New South Wales by about £14,000,000. Whereas in 1900 of the extra-trade of New South Wales exceeded that of Victoria by £11,000,000. In this debate references have been made to administration of the Customs departof ment. Like my honourable friends on the opposition benches I believe in the law being administered in a fair and just way. If a man attempts to defraud the revenue, let the Minister enforce the law ; but he ought to discriminate between a man who has deliberately tried to defraud the revenue and a man who has made a .simple mistake, as has been the case very often. I could cite a number of cases where the magistrates have told the Customs authorities that there was no intent to defraud the revenue, but that they were bound to impose a fine of £ b , although the sum in dispute amounted to only a few - shillings. I hold that in such cases a man ouglit not to be made a criminal where he was guilty of uo wrong intent, but of only a simple mistake. I wonder what the Minister would say if every person who did business with his department were to turn round and say- "" I shall proceed against you for every mistake which you have made in administering the law."" If that policy were adoped, many prosecutions would be instituted because mistakes must have been made in hundreds of cases. If the Customs authorities were proceeded against for all the mistakes which they have made, we could well understand what would happen. The Minister adopts a very novel method' to prevent the possibility of any mistakes on his part coming before the courts. In this connection, I may refer to the case which was tried in Sydney only yesterday. I do not know anything about the merits of the case ; I do not know the merchant concerned, and no one has communicated with me on the subject. I have only read the report which appeared in the Evening News yesterday evening. If Mr. Goldring, the merchant in question did wrong, let him pay the penalty for his wrong-doings. According to the statement which was submitted on his behalf to the court, his goods, books, and papers were seized, and have been held, for some considerable timemonths, I believe-the department preventing him from going on with his business, and refusing to give him a reason for their course of action. I shall quote the exact words of the Sydney telegram which appeared in the Evening A ews:- T The case of Magnus Goldring againstfcheCollection tor of Customs occupied the attention of Court today. It came before their Honours on an application by Goldriug, who is an importer watches and jewellery, to make absolute, nisi by which the Commonwealth Collector Customs had been called upon to show cause a writ of mandamus should not be issued pel him to sign entries for two parcels of watches, or to state his reasons for refusing to do so. A man whose business is being interfered with by the Customs department has a right to know the reason for their action. He was also called upon to show cause why he should noteitherdeliverupapplicant's books, which were taken away by him under certain powers exercised by him under the Customs Act, or, in compliance with the requirements of the Act, give applicant certified copies, for the purpose of enabling him to carry on his business. If this thing can be done to Mr Goldring it can be done to any other merchant in the Commonwealth, and any man is liable to have his business ruined by the action of the department. One would have thought that the Minister would have been only too glad to have a full inquiry made into the case in order that Mr Goldring might have an opportunity to obtain justice if he had a cause of complaint against the administration of the law. But what did the Government do 1 The application was based on the ground that the delay in returning' the books of the applicant or furnishing copies within a'reasonable time was a denial of nis rights; that he was entitled to have his entries pissed, and to have the goods delivered for home consumption within a reasonable time after the production of the material for such entries, or to be informed why the entries had not been passed. Surely that is a reasonable request for any merchant to make! How would any merchant who holds a seat in this House like the Customs authorities to seize his goods, books, and invoices, interrupt his business without ascribing any reason for their course of action, and decline to allow a copy of his invoices to be made? I am sure that the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, would not like to be treated iii that way. Mr Goldring does not appear in the character of a dishonest man when he publicly appeals against the action of the Minister, and courts the fullest inquiry into his transactions with the department. It does not look as if' he was afraid of an inquiry being held. Sir Julian Salomons, when the affidavits in support of the application hud been read, took a preliminary objection that the Court had no jurisdiction to deal with the matter. Last session it was the duty of the Opposito point out to the House how persons the Full in the Commonwealth were prevented from of taking any action at law against any mema. rule ber of the Commonwealth Government, and of a short Bill was introduced in order, as I why understood, to enable any aggrieved person to comto apply for some measure of redress. Apparently the Minister for Trade ""and Customs can interpret the law as he likes, and will not allow a court or any one else to intervene and give redress to a business man who feels aggrieved by his administration. It appears to me to be anextraordinary proceeding on his part, and to need explanation. According to this report his action looks very bad indeed. Sir Julian Salomons, acting for the Government, said tiiat the Commonwealth Constitution having transferred the Customs department to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Parliament and its Executive, no officer of the toms, any more than any officer of the Executive Government, was open to mandamus from the State Court. What remedy does this man possess ?",47
55,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"If he had paid the duty he would have obtained his goods, and then he could have sued for the deposit which he had made. Instead of that, he chose to take another course, and to ask the court to command a Commonwealth officer to do something.",49
56,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Older . The Attorney General can give the explanation at a later stage.,49
57,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I should like the Attorney-General to be allowed to give the explanation now, sir.",49
58,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"I can assure the honourable member that Mr Goldring having two other remedies open to him, chose a third, which would have meant coercing the Commonwealth without the Court being properly informed as to the circumstances. He had his remedy under the Claims Against the Commonwealth Act, and he did not choosefcotake it. He had his remedy under the Customs Act, and he did not choose to take it . He chose to do something else",49
59,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Why should not the Minister for Trade and Customs allow him to have access to his books and to make a copy of the invoices ?,49
60,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,He could have got them at any time by depositing the amount of the duty.,49
61,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I understand that in some cases where merchants have overpaid the department, the Treasurer will not refund . the excess amount. I have been told of one case where, because the importer did not take action within a certain time, he could not get the excess refunded. It is a-fair and straightforward course for a man to appeal to a court, and in every such case the Minister ought to give a reason for his actionIn giving judgment, the Acting Chief Justicesaid that, under the (i!)bh section of the Commonwealth Act, Customs and other matters weretransferred to the Commonwealth, and officerswere appointed to perform the duties of such Customs, including a comptroller and collectorfor each State. It was quite clear our State> Legislature and Government luid nothing to dowith the matter, and that this court had nopower to say whether a federal officer had or had. not discharged his duties properly. That was. entirely a matter between him and the authority Cuswhich appointed him. The Collector of Customsowed no duty to the State Government. Seemingly, it is difficult for a man to getany redress in a case of this kind. Mr.. Pilcher, who is a leader at the S3'dne3' bar,, advised Mr Goldring as to what was theproper course for him to take; his advicewas followed ; and the Government immediately set up the plea that the court had no jurisdiction. It is a case of such importancethat an explanation ought to be given by the Minister. The action of the department does not reflect much credit on the Commonwealth: and it is not fair that the Commonwealth should be placed in such an invidious position. When the Prime Minister spoke at Maitland not long agoof the work which had been done by the Government ho referred to the Acts, which had been passed. He took a great deal of credit to the Government for the passing of the Public Service Act. He pointed out that it was a splendid measure, inasmuch as it took away all political patronage and influence from the Ministry. I wish to ask the right honourable and learned gentleman who was responsible for taking away political patronage and influence from the Ministry? In their original Rill the Government took to themselves all the necessary powers to make appointments, increasesalaries, and effect any adjustments ; and the honourable member for Wentworth proposed an amendment which compelled the Government to obtain a recommendation from the Public Service Commissioner before they acted, in order that he mighthave a voice in every case of the kind. The influence and power of the Public Service Commissioner which had been annulled' under the Bill as introduced by the Government was in that way restored.",49
62,Mr WILKS,Unknown,He would have been merely payment a recording clerk.,49
63,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Yes . That would have been very handy no doubt for some members of the Government, judging by certain appointments that have been made. There was certainly, need for a Public Service Act to prevent political influence, because I think even honourable members opposite were shocked.",49
64,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,Unknown,The honourable member is an authority on that point.,50
65,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I was for that, many years & member of a New South Wales Government, ancl I defy any one to point to any case in which I allowed tical influence to interfere with appointments in the department I administered.",50
66,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"They tried to get at honourable member, but could not manage it.",50
67,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I do not say that I was any better than any one else but I defy any one to point to any appointhave ments in the public service of New South ancl freedom. Wales of which I have reason to be ashamed. I think the honourable for Eden-Monaro will admit that I always obtained the services of the very best men. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - We all give you credit for that.,50
68,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"The Minister cannot take much credit for Public Service Act, because if it had been passed as proposed by the Government it 'would not have got rid of the political fluence to which reference has been made. I come now to one or two other matters which I think are of much importance. speaking pf the Tariff the Minister for and Customs in December last made a notable admission. It is not often that we can get a Parliament. protectionist to make any admission of the kind; but that made by the Minister was keeping with assertions madefrom time to time by honourable members on this House, and as often denied by protectionists. In speaking in the House on the 2nd Dewas cember last, the right honourable gentleman is reported by Hansard to have made this statement-although, I suppose, the ters will attempt to deny the correctness of Commonwealth. MansardThe honourable member may look it up iis he likes ; but he will find as I have given, showing the importations from Germany, France, and Belgium. And I say regards these countries protection and labour reign supreme. These are the countries which my right honourable friend has always urged that we should copy. He says that we ought to adopt protection because it benefits theworking classes.",50
69,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"--If the honourable memberreads the newspapers of Melbourne to - day, he will not think it has clone so.",50
70,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I think we can obtain plenty of evidence that it has not helped Victoria. We are all sorry forbecause we have no feeling againstthis State. We recognise that the men of Victoria are as good as those of any otherpolipart of the Commonwealth.,50
71,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,Almost .,50
72,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I shall not the make that exception. A large number of former Melbourne residents live in my constituency, and they are splendid men. They came over to free-trade New South ; Wales, and they have done well. They obtained there the benefit of fresh air",50
73,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Anc l they are now on the member honourable member's committee.,50
74,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Of course they are. I take exception to the action of the Prime Minister in regard to the proposed preferential trade between England ancl the Prime colonies. When a cablegram was published the in the Melbourne newspapers giving the substance of Mr Chamberlain's speech, my right honourable friend, not as Sir Edmund inBarton, but as the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, sent a cablegram to England intimating his approval, as head of the In Federal Government, of the proposal, ancl Trade presumabty the authorities at home would believe that he was speaking for the Federal",50
75,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,I did not send in any cablegram; I simply expressed my opinion in answer to a request by a represide of the sentative of a press agencv.,50
76,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"That opinion cabled home by the press agency, ancl my right honourable friend will admit that it was transmitted to England as the opinion Minisof the Prime Minister, speaking for the",50
77,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"The opinion of as much the Prime Minister, speaking for his that the figures are Government.",50
78,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"If that is theas opinion of the Government they should have cheap the courage to admit it ; they should come clown to the House and say- "" This is our opinion; we do not want any mistake. We believe we are voicing the opinion of the' people of the Commonwealth, and we are prepared to stake our existence on it."" In view of what Mr Chamberlain .said, it is singular that in the speech which them. the Prime Minister delivered at Maitland in 1901 he made a statement, appeared in the Governor General's speech of 10th May, 1901Some time must elapse before the financial conditions of the Commonwealth will admit provision being made for old-age pensions. It is, however, the desire of my Ministers to with the subject as soon as possible. The right honourable gentleman told the people what he was going to do. First all, he caught the free-traders like Mr. Thompson, who was gullible, but found out his mistake. Of course, some of us knew the right honourable gentleman too well. We had been in Parliament with him, ancl knew that on the question of freeheavy trade he was able to turn somersaults without any trouble The Prime Minister told the people.of the Commonwealth, in the course of his Maitland speech, that was in favour of old-age pensions, and that understand. the workers could expect them, not from the Opposition, but from his Government. He told the free-traders of Australia that his Government were not going in for any Tariff to destroy revenue, but for one which free-traders ancl protectionists alike could join hand in hand in supporting. He gained his point through what 1 say was a piece of deception. He knows that had it not been for that deception the Vice President of the Executive Council, for whom I have the greatest respect, could not have obtained anything like 50,000 votes. In this way the right lionorable gentleman gained his point. He secured the support of a large number of free-traders, as well as that of a great number of workers, and passed this objectionable Tariff. No doubt Mr . Chamberlain read the Prime Minister's speeches, and said- "" The Prime Minister of the Commonwealth is a pretty shrewd fellow ; be he humbugged the workers and the free traders.",50
79,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must not say that the Prime Minister humbugged the electors.,51
80,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I am speaking in a political sense. I will say that he miskites led them.,51
81,Sir EDMUND BAKTON,Unknown,I do not mind i Mr Speaker. The honourable member said just now that I deceived the electors.,51
82,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I will say that has the right honourable gentleman deceived,51
83,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable mem- . which also ber must not say that.,51
84,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"Then I will say that he led them astray. No doubt Mr. Chamberlain, on reading my right honorof able friend's speeches, considered that the deal Prime Minister had done very well; that he had been able to lead the workers astray by the promise of old-age pensions; that he had led the free-traders astray; and had of succeeded in getting his Tariff through",51
85,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,"Not "" h is "" Tariff.",51
86,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"- He succeeded in passing, not the Tariff he proposed, but one to which we objected because of the duties which it still contained. No doubt Mr Chamberlain hoped to succeed by adopting similar questionable tactics. Sir ""WILLIAM MCMILLAN - A Tariff that he the right honourable gentleman did not",51
87,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I do not say that. I am sorry that Mr Chamberlain supports the system of preferential trade proposed, because we all give him every credit for his action in connection with the South African war. We all cordially supported the action of the Government-o r most honourable members of the' Opposition did so-in sending troops to assist the Empire, and we should do it tomorrow if the occasion arose. . We are all anxious. to do what we can to assist the Empire, because if it goes down we must go down with it -.! start therefore with a fairly good opinion of Mr Chamberlain, but I must say that I am astounded that he should be a party to the system of preferential trade proposed. What does Mr Chamberlain sayThe workers must be convinced that they would recouped the tax on food by extra wages, by sociid reforms, and by old-age pensions.",51
88,Mr WILKS,Unknown,He laid great stress on old age pensions.,51
89,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,Y'es .,51
90,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,They will need them if a tax is placed on food.,51
91,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"After two hacl been flown, first by Mr Chamberlain and then by Mr Balfour-on e speaking t , one way and one the other-thos e gentlemen considered that they could correctly interpret public opinion, but I think they will be mistaken. Mr Balfour, who was at first half-hearted, then made this statement :Is it so certain that the working classes would be ? repudiate such a tax ? If by a general tax on foodstuffs it was possible to obtain from the colonies large measures of free-trade in manufactured goods, I am not sure it would not; be worthwhile. I do not know whether the British working classes would consent to the sacrifice, or whether the colonies would consent to modify their Tariffs. As free-traders we should welcome the opening of our doors, because we realise that we are able to hold our own. The Minister for Trade and Customs referred in the extract I have given to the imports from France, Germany, and Belgium, where, he said, low wages and protection reigned supreme. Our imports from those countries amounted to about £3,860,000, but our exports to those countries totalled about £6,520,000. We are sending goods to those countries, and receiving in return 70 per cent, more goods than they get for the goods they send to us. We have gained in one year £2,660,000 by our trade with the foreign countries to which reference has been made. Then it appears that the Government believe that England is going down, for I presume that is really the effect of the Prime Minister's cablegram. He endorses Mr Balfour's opinion that England is going down. I see no evidence of it. Accordingfcothe latest returns there is no likelihood of anything of the kind. The latest report issued by the Board of Trade does not indicate anything in that direction. What do we gather from it 1 In 1S71 the population of the United Kingdom was 260 per square mile; in France it was 177 per square mile; in Germany 196 per square mile, and in the United States 10""7 per square mile. In 1900 the United Kingdom maintained a population of 342 to the square mile; France, 1 9 1 ; Germany, 269 ; and the United States, 21. If these countries were called upon to maintain the same population per square mile as England, with its 120,000 square miles of territory, France, instead of maintaining 39,000,000, would have to maintain 71,230,000; Germany,, instead of maintaining 56,367,000, would have to maintain 72,000,000; and the United States, instead of 75,000,000, would have to maintain nearly 1,226,735,400. This is according to the last statistics supplied to Parliament by the Board of Trade.",51
92,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"If the honourable member compares New South Wales with Victoria on that basis, where will New South Wales",52
93,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I am endeavouring to show that England is really going ahead, and will presently give figures showing trade, &c, per head of population as well as per square .mile. We know that, as a matter of fact, Victoria is going back. Mr AUSTI N CHAPMAN - Mr Chamberlain had better withdraw.",52
94,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"He willbemade to withdraw. I do not say that my speech or amspeech made in this Parliament will have any effect upon Mr Chamberlain, and I dare say that even the speech of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro will have less effect upon him than that perhaps of any other member of - the House. When the honourable member for Melbourne Ports speaks of comparing New South Wales and Victoria, I would ask him whether he will deny that in the value of goods manufactured and in process of manufacture there has been a decline of £2,412,000 for the last year.",52
95,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,I do deny it .,52
96,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"There we are, Cogldan is wrong again.",52
97,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,No ; Fenton is wrong.,52
98,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"They are all wrong if their statements do not suit the views of honourable members opposite. I would ask honourable members whether the figures dealing with the annual production of coal give any evidence that England is going down. According to the figures supplied by the Board of Trade during 1S90-4 the average annual production in tons, per head of the population in England was, 3 79 ; in France, 43 ; in Ger- many, -79, and in the United States, 1-09. In 1S95-99, the average annual production per head of population had risen in England to 5-07 tons, in France to -7S tons, Germany l 6 9 tons, and in the United States to 2-57 tons. Let honourable members apply any test they like, and they will find that England is ahead. Is that any evidence of decay 1 Now-, let us look at the wages paid to coal-miners, and it must be remembered that one of the arguments used by the Prime Minister at Maitland depended upon the question of wages. The right honourable gentleman told the coal-miners that if they went in for protection factories would be established in the State and more coal would be used. England, as we know, has an open door, and yet her consumption of is greater than that of France, the United States, or Germany.",52
99,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"Does the honorwas, able member refer to export or internal consumption ?",53
100,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I have referred to the average annual production, but will give the figures of internal consumption presently. The wages paid to miners in England are lOd. per hour ; in France, 4d.; in Germany, 4-d.j and in the United States, od - Is there any evidence there that British workmen are worse off than those of other countries ? ",53
101,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Does the honourable member connect this with the Governor1895-9, General's speech ?",53
102,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I do. I do not know why I am asked the question. Reference has been made to the question preferential treatment, and I am endeavourthe ing to show that England has no need to in for preferential treatment in the way suggested because she is prosperous now without it .",53
103,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,There is nothing of that in the Governor General's speech.,53
104,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,I have already objected that the right honourable gentleman had not the courage to challenge us on question. I should not have blamed him if he had not sent home a cablegram in which he speaks for the people of Australia.,53
105,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,I did not send it .,53
106,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,The right honourable gentleman speaking as Prime Minister of Australia gave the information to the press agency.,53
107,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,"They asked my opinion, and I gave it , and I gave them another opinion yesterday.",53
108,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I say that if the right honourable gentleman, as Prime Minister of Australia, speaks for Australia, he should be prepared to come down here, and take the responsibility of it. However, he does not speak for Australia.",53
109,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,He speaks for the majority.,53
110,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,No r does he speak for the majority of the people of tralia.,53
111,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,Unknown,The honourable memthe ber speaks for Great Britain.,53
112,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I speak for Great Britain because I know that if the Empire goes down, we go down with her. coal I find according to the Board of Trade returns that the estimated consumption of coal per head of population in 1900 for the United Kingdom 4'OS tons, for France 1-19 tons, for Germany 1-77 tons, and for the United States 3-08 tons. Does that give any evidence of the decay of EngI land 1 Now, let us take the production of pig iron, and let it be remembered that while we have here a Government prepared to give certain encouragement to the establishment of the iron industry, there is in England no protection and no bonus for that industry, which is in open competition with all. What is the position in this respect in Eagland today. Taking the five years the average annual production of pig-iron per head of population was -22 tons in the United Kingdom, -06 tons in France, ""13 in Germany, and -15 tons in of the United States. Is that any evidence of decay of England 1 Can any evidence go of decay be found in the figures dealing with exports ? But I find that the exports of domestic produce per square mile in the United Kingdom in 1900 were valued at £ 2 , 3 3 S ; from Fiance £804, from Germany £1,062, and from the United States £79. Per head of population the average value of exports for the years 1895-9 the amounted to £ 5 19s. 5d. for the United Kingdom, £ 3 14s. Sd. for France, £ 3 7s. 3d. for Germany, and £ 2 18s. 4d. for the United States. There is in those figures no evidence of decay which calls upon us for a change in our whole fiscal policy. Then I take the average trade of the United Kingdom with Germany, and I find that during 1880-85 the imports of the United Kingdom per head of population amounted to 14s. 6d., and the exports to 10s. 3d., while during 1896 to 1900 the average for imports was 14s. 3d., while the average for exports was increased to l is . 9d. That certainly sho'ws no evidence of decay. If we take the totals, the figures are £3,700,000 and the total exports £5,500,000. Now, if we take the imports of merchandise in relation to the total we will find that in 1880 the percentage from France was 10-25, from Germany 5-92, and from the United States 26-04. In 1900 Austhe percentage was the same from France, it was 5-96 from Germany, and 26-53 from United States, showing a very little increase. In connection with exports the figures for 1880 were, for France 6-99 and for 1900 6-97, for Germany for 1880 7-60 and for 1900 9-34-, and for the United States for 18S0 13-83. I have not the figures for 1900. If we take the figures relating to shipping we find that in the ""United States of 92A per cent, engaged in foreign trade 7 per cent, of the trade was carried in American vessels and 85J per cent, in British vessels. This has been so strongly brought under the notice of the American authorities that they have instituted an inquiry to discover - whether their, position cannot in some way be improved. If we take the figures affecting exports of domestic produce we shall find that the exports of the United Kingdom for the five years 1895-1900 gave an an average value of £226,000,000, for France £135,000,000, and for Germany £166,000,000. In 1900 our British exports increased to £283,000,000, or an increase of £57,000,000. In France the increase was £29,000,000, and in Germany the increase was from £166,000,000 to £222,000,000. Let us take another test in the number of unemployed in all trades covered by the returns of the trades unions, and we find that while during 1S92 to 1S94 the number was 7 per cent, in 1899, in 1901 the number had been reduced to 3 per cent. In the engineering and metal trades the number of unemployed in the years 1892 to 1894 was 8£ per cent., and in 1899 it was only 3 per cent. These figures do not show any evidence of decay. If six of the great Powers were called upon to maintain the same population per square mile as Great Britain, with her 120,000 square miles, we should find that instead of maintaining 390,000j000 people, as they do at oresent, they should maintain 4,400,000,000.",53
113,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Will the honourable member apply that reasoning to New South Wales and Victoria ?,54
114,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"I think I have been fair with honourable members in giving these figures of population, wealth, trade, and the consumption of coal; and while I give the figures for free-trade England I give the figures for the other side as well. I only ask that honourable members opposite should do the same in regard to Victoria. The Secretary to the Board of Trade, in commenting upon those figures, saysWhatever these figures show, it is clear that they do not show that there has been any material displacement of home manufactures in our markets by Germany.",54
115,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,In what year was that written ?,54
116,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"The document from which I am quoting was laid upon the table of the House of Commons in 1902, and no later figures are obtainable. Those statements show that there is no evidence of the decadence of British trade.",54
117,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,Surely the British Government do not say that England is decaying.,54
118,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"No , but they are trying to reverse the policy which British statesmen have followed with remarkable success for the last 50 years. We are told that France and Germany are getting our trade j but there is not a workman's paradise in either of those countries. I have a return here which shows that in 33 German towns, each with a population of about 100,000, the highest wages paid in 1901 were 19s. 3d. and the lowest 13s. 9d. a week. In France, in the summer of 1882, men got 2s. 6d. a day, and in the summer of 1892, 2s. 4£d., while the wage paid to women was Is. 9£d. and Is. 7-^d. in the two periods respectively. In Belgium, in 1874, men were receiving Is. 7£d., and in 1895 Is. 7d. a day, and women l l f - d. and l l | - d ., a decrease in each case. It must be remembered, too, that in those countries people ordinarily work not eight, but ten, twelve, and thirteen hours a day. Sir Robert Giffen, a well-known writer of financial essays, pointed out that in Great Britain during the last 50 years the wages of carpenters have increased 43 per cent., of bricklayers and masons 30 per cent., of pattern weavers 55 percent., of weavers 115 per cent., of spinners 160 per cent., and of miners 50 per cent. When under protection wheat was 94s. a quarter, the farmers used to pay their labourers 7s. a week. In 1S7S wheat was 46s. a quarter, and they paid 15s. a week, while in 1886 they paid 15s., though the price of wheat was then only 30s. a quarter. The working class representatives in the House of Commons are unanimously opposed to any reversal of the fiscal policy of the country. They know that wages are higher, hours of labour shorter, and conditions of employment better in free-trade England than in anv protected eountry. I find from another return that in 1887 the weekly increase in wages was £45,000, in 1898 £95,000, and in 1899 £114,000. The total increase for 1889 was £6,000,000, and for the first eight months of 1900 £150,000 a week, or a total of about £8,000,000. On page 52 of the document from which I have quoted there is a return called table G, which shows the average annual value of the importations into England from Germany in the periods 18S0-1SS4, 1891-1895, and. 18961900. In dealing with this return I shall take no notice of the importation of sugar. We all know that sugar is notproduceclin the United Kingdom, but her importation of that commodity is very large, amounting, I believe, to over £9,000,000. Germans like to pay bounties to produce beet sugar cheaply for the advantage of the people of England, I am sure the English workers have no cause to complain. Comparing the periods 1880-1SS4 and 1896-1900, the increase of importations into the United Kingdom from Germany, deducting sugar, is £353,333, not much more than £400,000. Is there in those figures any evidence that the productions of German workmen are displacing in the English markets the productions of British workmen 1 The Board of Trade report saysOur exports consist more largely of manufactured goods in proportion to our whole exports than do those of France and the United States, but we are run very close by Germany in this respect. Nevertheless, measuring per head of the population, we are ahead of Germany or any other of our competitors. The importations into Great Britain consist largely of raw material which comes from America, Germany, the colonies, and other countries, to be made up by British workmen, and re-exported very largely to the countries of original production. For example, the United Kingdom imports immense quantities of cotton from the United States, and, under free-trade, manufactures 66 per cent, of the cotton goods used in the world. That is done under free-trade, and by workers who are paid better wages .than are received in protectionist countries.",54
119,Mr KENNEDY,Unknown,Are the wages paid in Great Britain better than those paid in the United States 1,55
120,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"On that subject. I should'like to quote the opinion of Mr Hoskins, a well-known manufacturer of iron, who, in New South Wales, prospered under free-trade. When, in 1900, a contract was opened for the supply of cast-iron pipes for the Geelong waterworks, he was ready to land the pipes required at Geelong, if the duty were remitted, for £26,000, but the Otis Company, a Melbourne firm, wanted £32,000. As the Government of the day would not remit the duty, the Melbourne tender was accepted, so that the Geelong people are now' paying interest upon £6,000 more capital than would have been expended if the tender of the free-trade manufacturer had been accepted. In 1901, after a visit to America, Mr Hoskins, speaking about the conditions of labour there, was reported to have said that in some of the large steel If the works, and notably in Carnegie's, men were called upon to work for eleven hours a day, and for thirteen hours on the night shifts. American emplo) ers take more out of their 7 men in many ways than do employers here. Generally ten hours is a working day, but in the Homestead Works the hours were . eleven in the day-time, and thirteen at night, and the majority of employees were not Americans but Russians. Returning to the subject of the importation of raw materials into England, I may point out that materials for textile manufactures were imported to the extent of £77,347,363, for sundry industries to the value of £65,079,691, and that the imports of metals represented a value of £33,195,391, the total being over £175,000,000. Of manufactured goods, Englaud imported only £93,225,005 far worth. Now, looking at the other side we find that the manufactured goods worked up by British workmen-pai d at higher wages than continental employees, and working for a smaller number of hours per day-and ex- ported from England, represented a value of £234,7S9,389. Thus England exported manufactured articles to the value of £141,000,000 in excess of her total imports of manufactured goods. That does not tend to show that England's manufactures are being displaced by any of her competitors. These figures are taken from the official returns of the Board of Trade, and the position in regard to Germany is summed up as follows:- In the period under review there was an increase in our imports from Germany to the extent of 3 7 million pouuds. There has been some decrease in the imports of agricultural produce from Germany, balanced by an increase in the imports of sugar, and some slight increases in the imports of cotton, woollen, glass, and iron manufactures, none of which, however, are imported to any great extent. On the other hand, our exports to Germuny increased by ±T>,500,000, or over 30 per cent. This increase was largely due to one special article, coal; but woollen yarns, cotton manufactures, iron and steel manufactures iiud machinery also contributed their share. Whatever thesefiguresshow, it is clear that they do not show thab there has been any material displacement of home manufactures in our home markets by Germany. I think that this supplies the best evidence that could be produced as to the progress made by England under free-trade. had not intended to speak at such length, but the interruptions of my honourable friends opposite have shown the necessity for affording-the in a little enlightenment. They evidently do not read the latest reports, or do not properly digest the facts contained in them. I have quoted from the reports of the Board of Trade, and I now wish to read an extract from a statement by Armitage Smith, who in his Fifty Years of Free-trade says :Statistics of wages and prices show that with easier work and shorter hours a labourer gets now about 05 per cent., factory operatives 75 per cent., and a skilled mechanic 00 per cent, of necessaries than he did 50 years ago. Sir R. Gift'en has stated that nearly the whole of the economic advantage o£ the last 50 years has gone to the working classes, that is, their tion has not only changed absolutely as regards the comforts o£ life, but relatively as regards other classes in thejr share of the general perity. ' While the capital has increased, the income from capital has not increased in proportion. The increase of earnings goes exclusively, or almost exclusively, to the working classes. What has happened to the working classes infchehist 50 years is not so much what may be called an improvement as a revolution offchemost remarkable description. The condition of the British Empire is so satisfactory today, and the progress she has made during the last 50 years has been so marvellous, that it is extraoi'dinary to find a man like Mr Joseph Chamberlain contemplating such a leap in the dark as has been indicated by recent cables. England now enjoys a position among the nations such as has never been achieved by any great power, search the annals of history as we may. Taking, her population per square mile, I have pointed out that if the six great Powers are to maintain a similar proportion of people to area, they must sustain 4,400,000,000 instead of the 390,000,000 they have now. England under a free-trade' policy has controlled over one-quarter of the surface of the globe; her population today represents one-quarter of the whole population of the earth, and her surplus wealth is sufficient to pay the national debts of all the nations twice over, and leave a substantial balance. The policy of free-trade, which has done so much for England, and has produced such marvellous results, is one that we should seek to engraft upon the Constitution of Australia. AVe should endeavour to avoid the adoption of a protectionist policy, and we should not for one moment agree to sink the I fiscal question, as has been,id vised by the Primo Minister. The Melbourne Aye has supported the Government view that we ought not to raise the fiscal issue at the next elections. We are told that we should defer the revival of that question until after the close of the next Parliament, by which time the protectionists hope that they may obbain a sbill larger majorib}' than they now possess in bhis House by the same objectionable bacbics as were adopbed ab the lasb election. The advantage which the probecbionisbs now enjoy in this chamber is not very great. We have 35 free-traders here as against 40 protectionists, including the honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Philip Fysh, who was returned as a free trader, but has voted as a protectionist. posiWhen I was in Tasmania I was told that "" free-trade "" was one offchemost prominent pros- features in the placards on the cabs which conveyed the honourable member's supporters to the poll. Notwithstanding the honourable member's apostacy, the protectionists have a majority of only five in this House, whilst the free-traders have a majority in the Senate. The Government majority in this chamber was obtained under very questionable circumstances, and I venbure to say that upon the fiscal question, this House does not represent the views of the people of Australia. We shall not, therefore, follow the advice of our enemy, the Melbourne Age. I warn free-traders that, although the present Tariff is not one of which they can approve, they have been saved by the exertions of the free-trade party from much more calamitous results. Instead of having revenue duties upon some articles and protectionist duties upon others, they would have had to submit to all round high protective duties, and if the Government secure a large majority at the next elections, there is a strong probability that an effort will be made to still further increase the burdens of the people. The Government have crippled the great mining, agricultural and pastoral industries of Australia, which cannot derive any benefit from a protectionist policy. They have ignored the example of New Zealand, 31 i Governor-GeneraVs Speech: [REPRESENTATIVES.] which admits agricultural and mining machinery free of duty, and they have condemned our agriculturists, miners, and pastoralists, who are obliged to seek markets for their produce in Competition with the whole world, to bear heavy taxation upon all the necessaries of life, upon all the implements used in carrying on their several industries. As against this, we find that the Victorian manufacturers who have enjoyed the benefits of protection for the last 35 years, and are still unable to stand alone, are allowed to. obtain their machinery free of any impost. Our staple industries have not received fair treatment, and I feel convinced that when the - time arrives for the people to express their opinions regarding the action of the Government, they will return a substantial majority of honourable members who favour a free trade policy.",55
121,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown," I had hoped to hear some speech from the Government side before being called upon to address the House this evening. It is remarkable that the Government should have been willing to allow. the debate to close, as it certainly would have done if I had not risen at this time, without some reply by the Minister for Trade and Customs,'to the very severe criticisms which have been passed upon his administration. We have hacl speeches from the leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for North Sydney, and others, containing very serious charges against the administration of Ministers, ancl especially against that of the Minister for Trade and Customs. In regard to some of these charges, Ministerial action should have been taken to offer an explanation the moment they were uttered. I know that in many respects a Government has to be thick-skinned; but, if charges concerning the administration of justice and of the great departments of the State largely affecting the industrial life of the country are made in Parliament, they should be the subject of immediate inquiry, ancl honourable members should, at the very earliest opportunity, be placed in possession of the actual facts. No Government, however large its majority may be, does itself any good by stolidly ignoring the questions and asseverations of a minority. Having passed through a very anxious session, in which the great work of the Commonwealth was completed- I refer to the framing of the Tariff - it might Address in Reply. naturally have been thought that during the present session, in which to a large extent our attention will be focussed upon what may be called non-contentious subjects, it would not be necessary for honourable members to deal exhaustively and either with legislative or administrative matters. But, on the other hand, I cannot forget that this is probably the last occasion in connection with a debate of this kind in which honourable members will have an opportunity, prior to' the general election, of criticising the administration of the Government. If I may be permitted to say so, I do not think that I can be regarded as an unfair man. During the whole of my political career, as the Prime Minister knows, I have been anxious to accord fair play even to my opponents'. In the first Administration of the Commonwealth, I recognise that even if the Government had been composed of angels from heaven friction would have been inevitable. Difficulties were bound to arise, and under any circumstances many were sure to be greatly dissatisfied. But after . making all allowances for these considerations, I feel very strongly as a federalist, who is as ardent, pure, and, I hope, as patriotic in my aims as is the Prime Minister, that the first two years - of the Commonwealth Administration have been disastrous to the tone, the character, and the sentiment of federation itself. I feel that there is a great deal of justice in the chagrin and disappointment which are felt by people in all parts of Australia concerning the first two years of the administration of the Commonwealth Government. It was perhaps unfortunate that in forming his administration the Prime Minister had to choose-naturally , I suppose-me n who had taken a leading part in the political life of the different States, and that offices had to be allocated to them without any regard being paid to their previous training or capacity to fill those offices. It is a curious circumstance in connection with human affairs that sometimes one error-on e small accident as we might call it-alter s the whole tenor and character of a period of history. I have no desire to be personal, but I say that if you, sir, could have been placed in the position of Minister for Trade and Customs, and if the right honourable gentleman who now fills that office could have been elevated to your chair, the whole his5 tory of the administration of the Government during the past two years would have been changed. I do not hesitate to say that if the Minister, who is undeniably possessed of very great abilities and talent, but who is utterly unfitted by character and experience for his present office, had not been placed in that position, and if the policy enunciated by the Prime Minister at Maitland had been carried out in the faith and integrity of its evident meaning, I should not have had to rise to censure the Government for having broken its pledges and exhibited to the Commonwealth a series of administrative blunders which have brought contempt upon it in all parts of the world. We have, unfortunately, a Cabinet of lawyers. No man has a greater respect than I have for the legal individual who devotes his life - to what is probably one of the highest professions in the country - but I do think that in many respects a legal experience is not the best training for the broad administrationof business affairs. It seems to me that the Minister for Trade ancl Customs has made two mistakes which have been fatal to his administration. In the first place, he does not seem to know the difference between administration and adjudication. In dealing with his department he has imagined himself to be upon the Supreme Court or the magisterial bench. Now, all Governments-no t merely Governments such as those in Australia which undertake the control of a great many business enterprises, as, for instance, the management of the railwaysmust possess departments of a purely business character. In itself the Customs department is a great business department. Let us look at the history of the legislation connected with it . This Parliament enacted a law which conferred upon the Minister the most stringent possible powers for the prevention of fraud. .The Minister gave us his sacred promise- a promise which was repeated elsewhere-that a certain provision which we inserted to show that the highest would be punished equally with the poorest would not be put into effect unless a prima facie case of fraud had been made out. Again, when some prosecutions took place in Sydney, the leader of the Opposition put substantially the following questionto the Minister:-""Does the Minister acknowledge that in every case, even where it is clear no fraud has been attempted, but an error has been made, he is bound to prosecute?"" In reply the right honourable gentleman said - "" I do not say anything of the kind. I hold that I am not bound to prosecute unless I see that fraud has been attempted.""",57
122,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,I have never said anything of the sort at any time.,58
123,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"Then I ask the Minister if, because we inserted in the Customs Act a provision which gave him power to call a clerical error a fraud, he has resolved to send the most trivial cases of error into the police court. Is that the administration of the right honourable gentleman ?",58
124,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"The administration is that if an importer truthfully declares the nature of the goods and their value, and produces the proper invoice, he will not be prosecuted.",58
125,Mr THOMSON,Unknown,That is only recent administration.,58
126,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,I beg the honourable member's pardon. It has been the administration for nine months.,58
127,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"The Minister has said that he is anxious, if eveiy possible information is given to the department by the importer, that no prosecution shall take place. But let me remind honourable members of some of the facts connected with his administration. In New South Wales it used to be the practice for merchants and importers to do all in their power to assist the Customs department. When any doubt was entertained regarding an entry, the custom was to consult the officer of the department and for that officer, together with the individual interested to decide what was the correct duty. The Minister for Trade and Customs heard of this arrangement, which, to any' man imbued with business principles, would seem fair and straightforward. But he immediately said-""We will do nothing of the kind. You must make your entry, and if any error be found in it you will be prosecuted."" In other words, the Minister laid a trap for the importers. What was the reason for this prosecution t This was the reason: the Minister, when he began his administration, was imbued with the idea that nine-tenths of the importers of Australia were rogues. Otherwise there is no sense in his administration. Yet for many that years Customs administration in these States had proceeded smoothly enough. The very provision which is contained in the Commonwealth Customs Act was embedded in the Act of Victoria. Whereverdid we hear of such prosecutions and persecutions as have taken place under the Commonwealth Actl It is all very well for the Minister to put on a courageous front 1 It is very easy for him to use the money of this country to prosecute and persecute small traders, but it is an act of absolute cowardice for him with the machinery of Government at his back, and with the whole of the revenue at his command, upon discovering a pure error, involving perhaps 10s. or 12s., on the part of firms which for 30 or 40 years have held unblemished records, to haul them before the police court and to brand themas criminals for the remainder of their lives. Either it is childish administration or the right honourable gentleman has some object in view. What has been the result of his administration ? Only a few days ago on my way from England, I saw in one of the newspapers a declaration by him that his experience led him to believe that thehuge majority of the merchants were perfectly Even if he did make some in the early part of his . administration, when once he found he had been befooled, as I believe he was befooled, he ought to have had the candour and courage to go back in his steps. He ought to have said, ""The majority of these men are honest, and I want to get them on my side; I, by my administration, will call ou these men as honest traders, as other Treasurers and other Collectors of Customs have done, to help me in the administration of the Customs department."" But what did the Minister do % Befooled at the beginning, hs steadfastly, with that pig-headed obstinacy which is his characteristic, went on his course simply because he had begun it, and, at a .time when he knew the great majority of commercial men were perfectly honest, he did everything in. his power to set them against himself and his administration. I call that childish. This honourable gentleman has seen other departments administered. have, in this Ministry of all the talents, men who, like the Minister for Home Affairs, have probably each of them in the course of his public career administered three departments of State. The Treasurer, who never would be guilty of such absurdities as I have indicated, and the other Ministers of the Crosvn who form this Government, have personally administered the Mines, the Lands, and other departments of State. Will anybody tell me that any Sir II illiam Ma Millan. business in this world could stand the treatment to which this unfortunate Customs department has been submitted by the Minister 1 But I go further, and ask every member of this Ministry on his honour to tell me whether he has not dissented from struggling the administration of his colleague. I defy any Minister today to tell me that - he has not so dissented. And this is what is called responsible government. One Minister out of nine defies the other eight, and also defies the public opinion of the country. I say ib is a farce of Government. There is no other Minister on the Treasury benches who would have acted like the Minister for Trade and Customs. I do not 1 know what his purpose is, or what he is aiming at. It is well enough for him to lie by when these charges are made, but I say the country must call him to account. If we are a democracy we must have no class legislation. Yet, in this first Commonhonest. wealth Government, within two years, we mistake have a gentleman who knew nothing about trade and commerce-wh o was simply the square peg put into the round hole owing to exigencies of' the formation of a Government-bu t who takes ib on himself to be the guardian of the morality of the people. I bell him that there-are firms w-hom he has prosecuted and persecuted for 2s. or 3s., but who can stand this prosecution and persecution, and whose honour is equal to that of himself and of his colleagues. I am not a lawyer, but I have always understood that it is the intention which constitutes the crime. I have bo speak to-night without notes, but I can cite from memory, on the authority of the public prints, the case of Messrs. Sargood and Co. A certain gentleman from the Customs department went to the Police Court and said: "" Mr . Magistrate, this is a case of error; there is no fraud ; there is practically no stain on the character of these people, but I press We for a conviction."" The result was the imposition of a penalty of £ 5 , with the alternative of fourteen days' imprisonment. Supposing the representative of the firm, in the face of that expression of opinion on the part of the prosecuting officer, had gone to gaol, as many men would do in order to assert a principle and show the absurdity of such administration, would there nob have been a crv throughout the length and breadth of the country % One of the most respectable men in Sydney wrote to the Minister a letter, a copy of which I hacl the opportunity of seeing. This took place at one of the earlier stages of the persecution ; and in that letter the merchant pointed out that he had an unsullied record of 20 or 30 years in the capital of the mother State. I know that man Well; ancl in his case a mistake was made in connection with an Inter-State certificate- a mistake which arose in consequence of the clumsy way in which the law was framed. It was one of those mistakes in connection with which the administration ought to have saved a man from persecution. It was a case in which, I think, certain boxes of butter were imported from New Zealand, and these were mixed up with other boxes. These details, however, do not matter in an illustration of the kind. The duty had been paid, ancl no. question was raised on that score-ther e was no question whatever of any benefit accruing to this man. But through the error of his clerk-a n error which probably arose because the boxes were not definitely marked-the consignment was sent on to Queensland as, I believe, New South Wales butter ; at any rate, it was a matter arising out of an Inter-State certificate. This man, although he wrote to the Minister, hacl to present himself at ten o'clock in the morning at the Criminal Court, and, to use his own expression, had to ""mingle with the drunks of the day."" He was kept at the court till about four o'clock in the afternoon before his case came on ; and this was a man who had probably never before in his life been in a criminal court. Surely that is a position in which even the most extreme radical or labour member, or anybody else, would not like to see a decent honest citizen. I quite agree that there must be very stringent regulations, and I realise that a man with fraudulent intent misrhfc continually plead clerical errors. But let me give another case. People are not generally assumed to be fraudulent when there is overwhelming proof that they are honest. This is the case of a large firm ; and, in the first place, any person who conceived the opinion that, the firm was fraudulent would have to imagine that the principal, who represents probably some £300,000 or £400,000 of invested capital-the principal of a firm the honour of which is at stake, ancl which deals in large transactionswent to his shipping clei'k, whose salary was probabl} £ 2 0 0 a year, ancl said7 "" Look here, we want you to put in fraudulent entries."" In other words, it has to be imagined that a firm of this stamp would place itself at the mercy of a shipping clerk in receipt of a salary of £ 2 0 0 a year. On the face of it , such a supposition is childish and absurd. No man with a mind capable of grasping anything beyond the narrow technicalities of a narrow profession would ever think such a thing. I will take the case of one such firm, which had paid £27,000 in duty to the Government of Australia without a single hitch. This firm in the whole of its career never had a charge of any kind brought against it ; but in an invoice there was made what on the face of it was an error. I shall describe what I mean, and, without really mentioning the particular firm, give an analogous case. If a person imports nails in packets marked as containing nails, ancl exhibits an invoice, and the shipping clerk, by one of those mysterious mistakes of which all men are capable, in the entry describes the consignment as screws, that on the face of it would to all reasonable men be an error. No prima facie case of fraud could be imagined under such circumstances, except by a lunatic. Against the firm which I have in my mind there hacl never before been a word of suspicion, and although the}' hacl previously paid from £25,000 to £27,000 in clut)', they were brought up before a police court to answer a charge involving about 25s., and were met with the alternative of a fine of £ 5 ' or fourteen clays in gaol. What is all this wonderful talk about the saving of the revenue? I believe it to be an absolute fabrication. There has been such a reign of terror exercised in the Customs department that the officers are becoming mere hirelings. Thera are things done in the Customs department in Sydney that would never be done except under a system of terrorism and tyranny.' I do not know why the Minister for Trade and Customs pooh-poohed a statement made to-night by an honourable member that ""conscience money"" had been paid in a case where an importer had found he hud made a mistake in his statements to the department. Butthereisnodoubtthat,suchis the terror of re-openinga question of the kind, merchants refrain fromopenly admitting that errors have been made. I tell the Minister for Trade ancl Customs that at the present time there are delicate questions with regard to the payment of duty exercising the minds of certain people in Sydney; and there is a terror, no matter what may be said by Customs officers, that by some insidious means the very candour and honesty of the merchants involved may be taken advantage of, and that there may be a a retrospective investigation. Up to the present moment these merchants-and they have taken advice from me-absolutely know what to do. I always understood, from the first time. I became acquainted with political economy, that one of its axioms is that taxation, although it may happen to be burdensome, ought, in its collection, and in the administration of the law, to be as pleasant and as free from friction as possible. Men ought to know what they are going to be taxed. They to know what the law is; but instead of this, there is such a system in the Customs department that men are afraid to be even candid in their expressions to officers. I want to know whether this prate of things is to go on. I want to know whether this great Commonwealth Government, which was to be broader, freer, more liberal and magnanimous than any mere provincial or State Government, is going to say that because men have money, or belong to the capitalistic classthat because men beloDg to the class which has made England, and made possible the introduction of Englishmen into these States-it is better to persecute them, and thus play to the gallery. Then, again, I want to know whether this House is going to be true to itself. This House passed the Customs Act on the sacred understanding from the Ministers of the Crown that the particular provision to which I have referred, would in practical administration be used only as a weapon against fraud. Are members on that side of the House sobiassed by party feeling, or are members of the Government so frightened or so loyal to their colleague, that, although they know the administration has been wrong, no steps are to be taken to alter the present state of affairs ? When we find this provision, which was to be exercised only in cases of fraud, taken advantage of by the Minister to persecute a great section of the community for his own purposes - whatever those purposes may be-I to know whether Parliament is going to be true to itself and say to the Minister-""We gave you this provision, because we thought you were going to treat the community as Sir William MCMillan. an honourable administrator ; but now that we find there a desire to please certain sections of the community at the expense of others, we will take this weapon out of your hands, fully determined that this Act shall be reformed."" That is the question which we have to face. I feel that in many ways we have not"" very do not much to boast cf in our legislation or our administration. I feel that instead of taking a broader view, not merely in legislation, but also in administration, we have been narrow, provincial, suspicious. We have not risen to the national standard which might have been expected to be reached, and what is the result ! Ardent 1 federalists atone time thought that by good ought government, by the best men of the community being attracted to this Parliament, a higher standard of public life would be attained, and that a greater confidence in administration would permeate the community than prevailed in the smaller communities. The federalists of a few years ago thought that bit by bit, through the provisions of the Constitution, certain services and certain powers of a national character would be handed over by the States to the Commonwealth Parliament. But that ail depended on the first few years of our administration. ' What is the ghastly result of the past two years t I venture to say that if you were to ask the States tomorrow to transfer any great service like that of the railways to the Commonwealth, they would scout the proposal. The)' would say- "" What! give over the administration of bur railways to men who have shown such ignorance and imbecility both in the Post-office and in the Custom-house; do you think that we are mad ?"" No, sir ; it will take many years of wise administration by future Governments before the effects of the narrow-mindedness and the inefficiency of the administration of the present Government are wiped out. I am sorry that I have not brought my notes. I wish now to call the attention of the House for a few minutes to a question which-althoug h I understand from the Governor General's speech it is not to come practically before us. during the present session-ha s been want brought into such great prominence during the last few days that I think it is necessary that any honourable member who has made a study of it should state his views clearly and unmistakably. I mean the question of giving preferential rates to the United Kingdom. I believe that many honourable members are not quite seized of the whole importance of this subject, _ I know well enough that in talking to a certain section of protectionists I am only talking to deaf ears. On the other hand, I wish honourable members to understand that this is a question on which both free-traders and protectionists might stand shoulder to shoulder. In the first place we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that any preference by the colonies to the mother country must mean, if there is any sense in it all, some preference by the mother country to the colonies. I made that statement in a speech which I delivered in London before Mr Chamberlain uttered his latest manifesto. But that involves the question of England's fiscal policy. It may be said that we have nothing to do with her fiscal policy; that we may possibly give a preference to her from a patriotic motive. But if it is clear that the question of preferential trade must lead up to the abandonment of England's fiscal policy, then we are very largely interested in anything which affects the mother country, and I can quite imagine many protectionists saying, quite candidly- "" Although we believe in protection for Australia, we do not believe in protection for the mother country."" Many persons will say that, but I w'ish to ask, what is the object of this proposal by Mr Chamberlain 1 The object is to unite the Empire by closer bonds than have ever been known before. I take it that there is a further reason, and it make the Empire stronger as a whole by this union and by these bonds. The British Empire is composed of about 40,000,000 persons in the United Kingdom, and, say, 12,000,000 white jjersons outside its shores. If the policy involves a renunciation of England's free-trade, and if such renunciation strikes a vital blow at her commercial supremacy, where is the benefit of the movement 1 I take it that we desire to continue our union with the mother country, to draw year by year those bonds closer, because she forms the great centre of power and influence upon which the whole Empire hangs. Looking at the question in the most abstract sense, is it likely that small countries like England and Scotland, which are practically the great centres of our manufactures, and which do a business of £800,000,000 or £900,000,000 in exports and imports will do any thing to offend customers numbering 300,000,000 or 400,000,000of civilized people for the sake of conveniencing 12,000,000 persons in their own territory 1 The idea is absurd. There is absolutely no basis for what is called a Zollverein. But, again, there is a much higher aspect of this question than even that which appeal's on the surface. Up to the present time the safeguard of Englaaid and the safeguard of the Empire has been the free untrammelled operation, politically and commercially, of the different parts. Canada has gone its own course, and it has obtained its own systems of responsible and local government. Australia, by a gradual evolution-nobod y having blundered on the other side-ha s bit by bit got rid of almost every prerogative of the Crown except the links which bind us to the mother country in the persons of the Governor General of the Commonwealth and the Governors of the States, and in the right of appeal to the Privy Council in London. Lately we have been bound more closely together as comrades in arms on the fields of South Africa. We are bound by religious ties. We are bound by this fact, that Australia is the purest British possession in the'world. W it h the exception of a few aliens our people are entirely British, and we are as free as any nation in the world can be, with simply an Imperial link in which Imperial interests, being our interests, too, have to be studied as well as our local interests. What is this the first step towards ? It is the first step towards a mechanical arrangement which, if it is once is to begun, can never be retraced, and also a mechaniciilmovementin trade and commerce. What is the destiny of this country ? Its destiny is to trade with all the world. We grow a peculiar kind of wool which every nation buys. We have meat, wheat, and cattle to sell, and we are placed in the centre of the Pacific, with congested populations in the Eastern world. If ever there was a country which by nature and geographical position was intended to be free from commercial shackles of that kind, it is the island-continent of Australia. It must be recollected, as I said before, that if this course is once pursued, we may never be able to retrace our steps, and, instead of solidifying the Empire, instead of drawing the bonds of union closer, we may be creating a source of irritation which in the future may be ""too great to bear. I quite agree with Mr Chamberlain that everything does not consist in cheapness. I quite agree with Mr Chamberlain and others that sentiment is a magnificent force. I hope that the day will never come when, ingreatnational crises, we may not be ready to venture all for the sake of our common country. But that is high pressure. That is not the every day business of life. No .political union can go on unless it is based not merely upon sentiment but upon the mutuality of material interests. arrangement which in the future seem to be detrimental to the real trading, commercial, and other interests of this country from which it seems impossible to recede, might, by the operation of the very system, by the irritation which it engendered, sow seeds of dissolution would prevent the ultimate union of the British Empire. Por years we have been trading directly with all parts of the world. Instead of our foreign trade being done through London it is done directly by men who have come herefrom Germany, Austria, France, and America to buy wool and other products, and that trade has been increasing by leaps and bounds. We do another trade not merely with the United Kingdom, but with the British possessions. Can any sensible man conceive of any system of preferential rates which will be satisfactory to all parts of the Empire 1 Knowing how different are the conditions of countries like Canada, South Africa, and Australia, can be conceive cf any blending of interests to such an extent that we can have any harmonious system which will worlr smoothly everywhere 1 It is all well enough for Canada to take this view. It wishes to be the granary for Great Britain. It wishes Great Britain to be protectionist, and it was the first promulgator of preferential duties. Most distinctly we are bound up with the interests of the mother country, and in looking at the question of preferential trade we must consider the effect on the mother country. As a free-trader, as well as for other reasons, I look upon any proposal at the present time to disturb that fiscal system which has made Great Britain the mistress of commerce throughout world, which has given to her these colonies, and made it possible for us to exist, as an invitation to commit suicide. I cordially endorse the action taken by the Prime Minister in London with regard to the naval subsidy. Unlike some of my legal friends, I do not want to split hairs Sir William MCMillan. on the question of representation and matters of that kind. I desire a plain, business-like, transaction, and if ever there was a bargain struck in the world, that bargain by which, for £200,000 a year, we gain the security of the British Navy is one of the greatest. We continually hear it said that Great Britain must defend her own shipping. But is there no colonial shipping ? One of the greatest enterprises that Any we have is that of the Union Steamship might Company of New Zealand. We have also Howard Smith and Sons' fleet; we have the Adelaide Steam-ship Company, the AustralianUnited Steam Navigation Company, ancl a large number of others. It would probably cost over £1,000,000 a which year to protect' even our own waters. When we take the interest on expenditure, as well as the absolute destruction of obsolete warships, ancl other points into consideration, we must see that the bargain we have made shows us to be almost as cuteminded a people as are our cousins of the United Statesof America. As for the future, as sensible men we can leave that alone; what is to be done twenty years hence need not' bother honourable members of my age, ancl I think the Government are to be commended in proposing to put their stamp upon this arrangement. I also feel .that in this short session we should not do more than is absolutely necessary to complete that part of the Commonwealth structure which will render justice to all our people, and make the different requisite services run smoothly. There is a great difference between the laws we have to pass that are practically similar to other laws in the different States to which we have been accustomed, and laws like those pertaining to the Inter-State Commission, which relate to the different 'States in their Inter State relations. As a bodywe can have very little knowledge of those at present, and a postponement will enable us to mature our views in regard to them. My own opinion is that if we pass the great Judicature Bill, which will establish a High Court for Australia; if we complete the defence arrangements the under the auspices of my right honourable friend the Minister for Defence; ancl pass a Bill for the appointment of a High Commissioner, so that we shall have proper representation in the United Kingdom, those three measures will probably be quite sufficient for this session. In view of our position as a Commonwealth Legislature, we ought to be careful that all our Acts are as complete as possible. The measures I have named will have to go through both Houses, and if we pass them during the present session I think we shall do as much as is necessary. Compulsory arbitration is one of those matters which I think can very well be put aside. I am aware of the ardour with which the Minister for Trade and Customs for several }'ears has carried out schemes, or dealt with proposed schemes of the kind, but it seems to me that we must class this legislation merely as experimental. We have now an Arbitration and Conciliation Act in operation in New Zealand, while one has recently been passed in New South Wales, and these should be object lessons to us as to the operation of this principle. It would be well for us to pause before we commit ourselves to any piece of legislation which is not urgently required, and on which we shall have far more information by the time that the next Parliament meets. Every one is anxious to stop industrial strife, but in attempting great social changes and great remedial measures we must be very careful that we do not forget those basic principles of liberty to which we owe everything. I do not know how people view the operation of the Act in New South Wales- I do not know how it is going to operate-bu t I do not like some of the arrangements which have been made. They seem to me to be absolutely a blow at the ordinary principles of human liberty. It is a very serious thing to place the whole industrial life of a community in the hands of one man. At the present time a very able man sits in the arbitration court of New South Wales, and practically adjudicates. He has two assessors sitting with him, but he is practically the dominant spirit. That man has in his hands practically the control of the whole industrial life of New South Wales, for except in a matter of law, there is no appeal from the decision of the court. It may be necessary, it ma}' work well, but it is a fearfully drastic experiment. It certainly does not f it in with the beliefs which have made up the framework of British character and British liberty. At the same time. I am no mere clinger to what are called principles if it cam be shown that by certain experimental legislation, by certain bold schemes, we may ameliorate the lot of pur fellow beings. I am quite willing to put aside any Shibboleth if I see that by doing so I shall help to raise the general condition of my country. But there is no necessity to hurry the passing of a Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. It has been put forward to placate a certain section of this House, and I submit that if it is not necessary to deal with it now, if it is better as a matter of wisdom and of statesmanship to wait and see how the principle operates, no pressure of any party ought to influence an independent and courageous Ministry. As regards the capital site, I hope that something definite will be done this session. I feel very strongly that the 100-mile limit- a question which [ suppose cannot be opened now-is a very serious detriment to the future settlement of this question. I believe that one of the best sites in New South Wales would be a place a little within the 100-mile limit of Sydney, and that it has all the conditions of water supply and all the conditions of hygiene necessary for such a purpose. I presume that nothing can be done in that direction; but it is a matter which ought not to be forgotten in determining this question. I do not think that it should be delayed; but it seems to me that the unfortunate provision in regard to. the 100-mile limit is liable to deprive, not New South Wales or the people of New South Wales, but the people of the Commonwealth as a whole, of a site which, while not in any way interfering with the capital of New South Wales, while in spirit carrying out the provision inserted intheConstitution, would have been fit the same time acceptable in every way to the majority of honourable members. I observe that the Governor General's speech refers to the proposed construction of a railway line between Western Australia and South Australia. W it h all due deference to those who may have expressed their vie ws, that is a matter on which I do not think any honourable member-at any rate from the States not directly interested-shoul d express a definite opinion unless he has a very peculiar personal knowledge of the subject. In my case I do not think I should express an opinion until I have before me the whole official knowledge that the Government can produce, upon which to form a judgment. I have no doubt in my own mind that the line proposed, or something similar - to it, will ultimately come. I have no doubt that as the years go by we shall have for strategical purposes, and for purposes of communication, to make lines which may not be in the category of purely commercial railways ; but I think that before many of these lines are completed the railways will have to be amalgamated. It is a very different thing to project a non-paying line simply supported by the Federal Government under the peculiar conditions of our finances, and to project a line on a system of railways which is paying well, and whif.h may be able to stand tholoss fornationalpurposes. The question of the appointment of a High Commissioner is a very important one. The position occupied by the Commissioner will not be that of an agent whose duties are more or less of a trading character. duties of the High Commissioner will be almost entirely of a diplomatic He will be the ambassador-if that expression can be used while the two countries are under the same Crown-between tralia and the mother land. But there is one thing which I think the High Commissioner for Australia and the High Commissioners of other parts of the Empire may do. They may be the means of solving the question connected with the future political union of the different parts of the Empire. The gentleman appointed to the position will. I presume, be retained in the office for several years. He will be in close communication with the Colonial-office, with the High Commissioner for South Africa when the colonies there are federated, and the High Commissioner for Canada; and I look to these High Commissioners as likely to form probably the nucleus of the colonial council which must precede any scheme of political union. There must be some mode by which the different parts of the Empire can confer. The proposal of which we have heard so much of late from Mr Chamberlain is entirely before its time. It has been placed before the British public, and there has been no means of getting at the colonial opinion. I look to these High Commissioners, and to the conferences which may be held in future between representatives of different parts of the Empire, to pave the way for this political union, but I deprecate as I said before, any attempt for electioneering purposes, either here or at home, to force a question so full of great importance to the future destiny of the British Empire. Having expressed myself strongly with regard to the matter of Trade and Customs, I should like now to appeal to the Minister to Sir William MCMillan. reconsider the position he has taken up. I believe, and I know he believes, that the present state of affairs cannot go on indefinitely. I presume that the Minister for Trade and Customs is one who would like to see. preferential rates established, and that he would like also to see the protective S3stem ! introduced into England. I should like to ask the right honourable gentleman what would be the result in England under a protective system if one tithe of the trouble that we have had during the last eighteen months were experienced in that countiy 1 Why, there would be almost a rebellion in the country. That countiy is a great commercial country, and the people know that the The £2,000,000,000 to which the right honourable member for East Sydney referred in his incharacter. terview the other day, though perhaps he slightly exceeded the real amount, as being lent to other parts of the world by the Aus- British people, was earned from commerce, trade, and manufactures. I say that the inauguration of any system such as that which has been inaugurated in the Custom-house of this country, if it caused one-tenth of the irritation that'has been experienced here during the last 18 months would put the people of old England into a state of rebellion. Such a thing would be absolutely impossible. I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs, at the end of last session, if he intended to alter the provision in the A ct to which I have referred, because I did think that the right honourable gentleman felt that he was in a peculiar position in regard to it, that he thought he was bound to let things take their course, and let every case go to the courts, as the matter was not one purely of administration. The right honourable gentleman told me that he did not see any necessity to alter it .",58
128,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,"If the honourable member has read the report of my last interview with the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, he will know that we arrived at the happiest conclusions.",65
129,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I believe the right honourable gentleman had an interview with the Sydney Chamber of Commerce, and I believe further that with the fatality which appears to have followed the right honourable gentleman on various occasions, there is now a difference of opinion as to what he really said at that meeting. I am told that what he really did say was this- "" If you show me your original invoices, I shall look after the matter of the payment of duty."" The right honourable gentleman says now that he did not say that; but I can put two or three gentlemen on oath who will say that they asked him particularly - "" Do you mean the entry?"" and that he said-""No I mean the original invoice."" Now, the serfs, right honourable gentleman was right in do what he did ""say, but he is wrong in his and repudiation. The great struggle in. conmation. nexion with customs cases in Victoria years ago, when I had some knowledge of it, tion was on the question of the original inpassed voice. Certain firms passed what they called copies, or passed invoices coming from their own agencies in London, and not from the original manufacdence turers ; but the Customs authorities partment were perfectly satisfied the moment the importer showed the original invoices. may tell the Minister for Trade and Cusyou toms that as a result of the Customs authoOf rities acting harmoniously with the mercome chants, those merchants who did show but original - invoices brought pressure to upon others. They formed themselves into a vigilance committee, by means of which they assisted the Customs authorities, the result was that after a certain time original invoices had to be shown. That the attitude which the right honourable tleman ought to assume.",65
130,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,Reall y the honourable member is barking up the wrong tree.,66
131,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"The right honourable gentleman now says, I presume, "" Show me the entry."" What sense is there in that ? Is there any conciliation in that ? "" Show me the entry, and I will get you a trap. I will not allow my officers to tell them. you whether the duty upon these goods will 'be 15 or 10 per cent. No. Make out the entry. If you are wrong, and I decline to give you advice, it is a fraud, and I shall have you before the police court.""",66
132,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,I think the honourable member must be mad to say what he saying. We came to a very happy underor standing in Sydney.,66
133,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"I hope, for the sake of his original intelligence the right honourable' gentleman is mad. shall now give the facts of a case that curred in order to show the spirit in the Act is administered. The Minister say that this was done by an officer department, and that he cannot be held liable for whatever may be clone by officers of the department in all portions of Australia ; but I say that the right honourable gentleman has so permeated the officers in the department in every city of Australia with terror and fear, and has so brought , them down almost to the position of State that they are practically frightened to what is right. I can give proof of this case, cases after all are better than mere declaA certain firm was not quite satisfied as to its interpretation of the Tariff in relato certain goods imported in a case. They a sight entry, 'and the goods were opened. The Customs officers decided that certain lines were dutiable at certain rates. By that time the fear and want of confiin everything connected with the dewere so great that this firm's customs clerk said to the officer- "" You put I down opposite these lines in pencil what say are the duties."" The officer did so. course, this instance would not have before the right honourable gentleman, I am giving it to him as an instance of bear what has been going on. A short time afterwards a similar case arrived consigned to the same firm. They, of course, did not and pass a sight entry, because they had the opinion of the Customs officer, and they put is the goods through as usual. They were genseized by the Custom-house officer, but he was confronted with his own decision, and if it had not been for that document with his own pencil-marks upon it, the firm would have been brought to the court and fined £ 5 , with an alternative of fourteen days' imprisonment.",66
134,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown,But the honourable genin tleman says that nothing at all was done to,66
135,Sir WILLIAM MCMILLAN,Unknown,"Not h in g was done, because nothing could be done. There was the'proof of the officer's previous decision, and even the glaring injustice of the right honourable gentleman was not capable of doing anything to the firm in is those circumstances. I have only one two words more to say. The peculiar and glaring injustice of this administration in one of its phases arises out that of these circumstances : We began the conI i sid era tion of the Tariff about the Sth ocOctober, 1901, and the right honourable genwhich, tleman knows that it went through inmay numerable revisions in both Houses. If of the the whole community had been as intelligent as the Minister for Trade and Customs, which of course they could not be expected to be, they could not possibly have known where they stood owing to the kaleidoscopic changes made to the Tariff. In the next place, the classification was bad in many cases, so bad that the right honourable gentleman knows that if we had taken the verdict of twelve men as to the class to which certain goods belonged, six men would give one opinion and six another. In all the circumstances, I ask whether this was not an occasion for fair and lenient consideration 1 Was it hot a time for discretion in administration, rather than for the right honourable gentleman to call not merely an error a fraud, but to denounce as a fraud an error which was the result of our own operations and the general difference of opinion? What has been the result, even with the Minister himself 1 He has changed his opinion time after time. He has given different decisions, and with a meanness contemptible in a Minister of the Crown, in cases in which duties were paid, when it was thought the goods were dutiable, and in which the importers appealed to have the amount returned, by taking advantage not of the law, but of a technical arrangement of his own, under which notice had to be given within a certain time, he refuses to this day to pay back money which was never clue to the Customs. I say that all this sort of thing must come to an end. The Minister for Trade and Customs may remain stolid, and the Government may remain stolid, but whatever I may think on the subject of the prejudices of honourable members opposite, I recognise that it does not follow that because a man is a protectionist he has no desire to see pure administration of the Customs. Because a man is a protectionist it does not follow that he desires to see any persecution of the mercantile classes of the community. If we are a democratic community, we shall desire equal law and justice for everybody. Though we may have our own differences and our own ideals, at the same time, so long as under our industrial tem a certain "" class does exist, and so long as that class is under the law, and is honest if we put taxation upon it, though it may be heavy, its collection ought to be made as light as possible. We believe, that justice should be done, no matter what the consequences, ancl the name of the Commonwealth Sir William MCMillan. Government ought to stand as high, if we are going to be a great nation in this country, as that of the British Government. Debate (on motion by Mr Bruce SMITH) adjourned. SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT .

136,Mr KINGSTON,Unknown," I promised to give some information to the honourable member for North Sydney with reference to the dates upon which certain opinions were given, and received at the Customs House. I find that the first opinion .was given on 26th September, 1901, have to the Treasury. It was afterwards forwarded to the Customs on 27th February, 1902. Another was given on 6th February, 1902, to the Audit-office, and received at the Customs-office on 11th February, 1902. Three other opinions, dated 26th March, and 23rd December, 1902, and 27th March, 1903, were also given.",67
137,Mr KIRWAN,Unknown," There is a matter connected with the transcontinental railway to Western Australia to which I should like to draw the attention of the Prime Minister before we adjourn. We are getting a considerable amount of information regarding the proposed line, and one of the arguments most commonly used concerning the railway is that it would be of advantage for defence purposes. I desire to ask the Prime Minister if he will get exact official information regarding the proposed Western Australian trans-continental line for strategicakand defence purposes. It is, I think, the only point upon which the Government sysare not now endeavouring to get information for the benefit of the House, and I fail to see why we should not have information upon that point.",67
138,Sir EDMUND BARTON,Unknown,I will do my best to satisfy the desire of the honourable member. - Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.29 p.m.,67
