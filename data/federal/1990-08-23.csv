The petition of certain residents of the State of Tasmania draws to the attention of the House their concern that signing and ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child will deny to Christian parents the right to carry out their duty to educate and bring up their children according to God's word and their concern that this Convention will supersede and be supreme over existing State and Federal law which protects both child and parent rights.

Basic Pensions To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of concerned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: The basic pension is already below the poverty line and imposing any reduction to the pension or levies for medications will cause widespread suffering and sickness. A charge on medications will represent a callous repudiation of the promise to establish and maintain the pension at 25 per cent AWE. The rumoured abolition of the invalid pension has caused untold worry and heartbreak among the afflicted on that benefit. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament: Quickly raise the pension to 30 per cent AWE; restore medications removed from the free list and there be no charge on medicine; the invalid pension be retained; harassment of pensioners through 'kiteflying' rumour cease immediately. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bradford (from 89 citizens) and Mrs Sullivan (from 206 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned local citizens of Australia showeth that whereas: (1) They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag. (2) They /lre aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely: (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian crosses, represents the nation's . historical origin and the source of its language and law; (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth; (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901. (3) They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war. (4) They recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism. (5) They are certain that any change to the Flag will produce division in the Australian community. Your petitioners therefore pray that your honourable House will: Propose and pass a motion that ""the existing Australian National Flag be changed only with the approval of the Nation as expressed in a referendum"". And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Burr (from 77 citizens) and Mr MCGauran (from 63 citizens). To the Honourable, the Speaker, and members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament. The petition of Julius Bogi draws to the attention of the House: The organised oppression of Hungarians in Romania must be stopped. The Romanian government has failed to fulfil its obligation to guarantee minority rights in exchange for Transylvanian land acquired under the Treaty of Trianon (1920). Over 70 years, Romania has frequently failed to uphold its responsibility to the Hungarian minority within its political boundaries. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House should promote Australia take a.stand in re-negotiating the Treaty which has been successively violated by Romania's regimes. And your petitioners as in duty bound will every pray. by Mr Connolly (from 16 citizens) and Mr Ruddock (from 16 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The petition of Illes Balazs of 2 Denman Avenue,Haberfield NSW 2045 and other petitions, as shown below, citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House: At the end of the First World War in the Treaty of Trianon (4 June,. 1920) a large part of the Hungarian. land calIed Transylvania was awarded to Romania. The Romanian government was charged with the responsibility to respect the minorities rights. Despite of this obligation the successive Romania governments have blatantly ignored their responsibilities and instead engaged in brutal and systematic oppression and genocide. The oppression did not cease even after the downfall of the Ceausescu regime as the world could witness via media reports what is happening in Timisoara, Tirgu Mures, Bucharest and in other Romanian places. Your petitions therefore pray that the House: To promote and lead the re-negotiation and indeed the nullification of the Treaty of Trianon (1920) and the Peace Treaty of Paris (1947), of which Australia is a signatory, in response to its wilful neglect by the Romanian regime. by Mr Baldwin (from 10 citizens). Romania To the Right Honourable the Speaker, and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. Pogroms against Hungarians must be stopped Romania permanently. This trouble started in 1920 when the formerly Hungarian land of Transylvania was awarded to Romania, by the AlIied and Associated Powers. In exchange for the title of the newly acquired land, Romania was obliged to guarantee minority rights. (Treaty of Paris, 9 December 1919) Romania has never kept her side of the agreement. Romania has reneged on her obligations. Australia was and still is a signatory to the Treaty that has been' violated constantly ever since. Therefore your petitions humbly pray, that: Australia take the initiative to re-negotiate or nullify the Treaty that has been constantly violated by successive Romanian regimes. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will every pray. by Mr Wilson (from 206 citizens). Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme To the Honourable, the Speaker, and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. Romania The petition of citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that they: Deplore the proposed changes to the method of Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration which will affect the quality of s!;rvice and counselling the pharmacist will be able to provide to the public and which could force the closure of up to 30 percent of Australia's pharmacies. Your petitioners therefore pray that tile House do everything in its power to call on the Minister for Housing and Aged Care and the Minister for Community Services and Health to reconsider these proposed changes to the method of Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration. by Dr Hewson (from three citizens) and Mr Shack (from 40 citizens). Natural Therapy To the Honourable the Speaker andmeinbers of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: . The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention' of the House our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic G,oods Act 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior produce, those Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and smalI-scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The charges levied at manufacturers will increase the cost of supplements and constitute an indirect taxation· on users of Natural Therapies. The clauses in the'Regulations which purport to exempt homeopaths and herbalists are so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading representations will make it impossible to refer to efficacies of natural remedies which have been public knowledge for centuric::s. The Regulations, therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine and are an abomination. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a public inquiry into the question of regulation of natural therapeutic goods. by Mr Cadman (from 44 citizens) and Mr Truss (from 26 citizens). Natural Therapy To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parlialll;ent: We, the citizens of Australia, wish to bring to your attention our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989. Under the guise of protecting the pubIicagainst inferior produce, those Regulations will have the effect of. putting. out of business many natural therapists and small-scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The clauses in the Reguhltions which purport to. exempt· homeopaths and herbalists are so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading representations will make it impossible to refer to .efficacies of natural remedies which have been public knowledge for centuries. The Regulations, therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine and are an abomination. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a public inquiry into the questions of registration of the natural healing professions arid the supervision and regulation of natural therapeutic goods. And your petitioners, as iii duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Ruddock· (fro- 18 citizens) and Mr Truss (from 64 citizens). Earth Repair Action Decade To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatiyes assembled; This petition of concerned Australian citizens respectfully points out· that: our total global environment is rapidly deteriorating and important. natural resources vital to human life and livelIhood such as ozone, trees, soil and the purity pf air and wilter are being depleted at an increasing and alarming rate; there is an urgent need to educate all people in conservation skills and the responsible use and maintenance of natural resources; . . the United Nations Association of Australia (the peoples' arm of the UN), has proclaimed an Australian ERA (Earth Repair Action) Decade from 1988; . Earth Repair Action will unite people, communities, religions and nations in the productive and peaceful purpose of greening and repairing our Earth for a healthier and ·safer future. Your petitions therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will: Propose that a world-wide ERA (Earth· Repair Action) Deca.de begin on World - nvironment Day, June 5, 1990 with FIERY, the First International Earth Repair Year, and that this will be proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly. This ten-year plan will ignite the spirit of local & global unification and co-operation to stop the current destruction and start repairing our Earth by: . growing billions of trees to replace forests lost and to replenish the atmosphere; hygienic compo sting of all presently wasted organic materials into humus to revitalise soils; establishing globally, permanent,· self-sustaining, organic agriculture to end world hunger; reallocating annually 10% of all military budgets, personnel and resources, within each nation; to fund and support the ERA Decade .. And your petitioners as in duty boundwiH ever pray. . by Mr Aldred (from 15 citizep.s). Indo-c:hinese Refugees To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled: . . We, the undersigned .citizens of Australia, are deeply disturbed at reports of the forcible repatriation of Indo-Chinese refugees from various places in Which they have, at risk of their lives, sought refuge, particularly the Crown Colotly of Hong Kong. . . We appreciate that Hong Kong is unable to hold large numbers of refugees. Rowever, we believe Australia could take many more, and that in the present desperate situation it is· an urgent necessity that it do so. To refuse to offer people at least emergency refuge from persecution and possible death when we have ample land resources is to besmirch our democratic idealism and to leave. to our children a legacy of shame. We recall with deep sorrow the refusal of the Democracies to offer refuge to Jews seeking to escape the Nazi holocaust, and the shameful forcible repatriation, often to certain death, of refutution gees from Stalinism after the Yalta agreements. We believe the present situation is comparable, and that there is a moral imperative to offer refuge to fellow human beings who have risked all to live in freedom. For Australia to accept these refugees now would be a source of national pride to future generations, and in accord with Christian and other religious and ethical codes. Your petitioners, therefore humbly pray that you will give this matter earnest consideration resulting in Australia giving refuge to a much larger number of these people and your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Atkinson (from 14 citizens). To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That whereas on 11 th March 1990, the democratically elected and legal Government of Lithuania re-declared its independence from the Soviet Union into which it had been forcibly incorporated in 1940. And whereas the Soviet Union is refusing to recognise this rightful independence and is applying threats and intimidation to pressurise the people and government of Lithuania into rescinding their declaration, And whereas the Australian Government, whilst not recognising annexation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union, has not taken up this opportunity to demonstrate support for the justified aspirations of the Lithuanian people for freedom. So therefore do the undersigned sincerely and urgently petition the Senate to pursue immediate steps for the issuing of formal recognition of Lithuania's Declaration of Independence and to publicly endorse the right of the Lithuanian people to self-determination. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bevis (from 20 citizens). Foreign Land Ownership To the Honourable the Speaker, and members of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of Australia assembled: The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth concern that the selling of Australian land to aliens and foreign investors is not in the national interest. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives assembled should hold a referendum calling for changes to the Constiof Australia to protect the land so that no freehold land may be owned by other than Australian citizens. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Bradford (from 4,395 citizens). Natural Therapy To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia point out to the House the discrimination of the Therapeutic Goods Bill due to be tabled in Parliament on 22 August 1990 against a respected and competent segment of the complimentary health care profession, seriously restricting the Lithuania availability of traditional remedies, information and the results of research to qualified natural therapists. This, together with higher costs makes it impossible for them to remain in practice. Your petitioners request the House to allow qualified natural therapists the democratic freedom of choice to continue in practice with continued access to traditional remedies and relevant information from manufacturers regarding the usage of their products without added costs by way of registration, listing, licensing and inspection fees which, added to t)leir high costs of training, would make it impossible for them to continue in practice. Your petitioners request that this Bill be rejected by Parliament. by Mr Bradford (from 645 citizens). National Flag To the Honourable The Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that they are totally opposed to any change in the present Australian National Flag as declared in the Flags Act (1953). Your petitioners humbly pray that Parliament in its wisdom will take no action to change in any way the Australian National Flag. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Burr (from 474 citizens). Crime and Violence on Television To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Mitchell electorate respectfully showeth that: There is too much crime and .violence on TV and this is breaking down the standards and codes of behaviour in our society. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to: Urge TV stations to clean up their act and improve the standards of shows, news and current affairs programs by reducing the incidence of crime and violence broadcast every day into people's homes. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Cadman (from 103 citizens). Hume Highway To the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, your humble petitioners showeth: 1. Sections of the Hume Highway between Wodonga and Seymour are extremely dangerous due to the many transitions from freeway conditions to a two-way road. 2. Therefore, your petitioners request that the duplication of the remaining sections of the Hume Highway be completed with the utmost urgency. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Ewen Cameron (from 305 citizens). Foreign Fishing Vessels To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled. We the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that we are desirous of preserving the existing fish stocks off the North West Coast of Australia for the benefit of all Australians. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled, urge the Government to: 1. Not allow any further Foreign Fishing Vessels to operate off the North West Coast of Australia; and 2. Ensure that Foreign Fishing Vessels operating under existing Agreements off the North West Coast of Australia comply with all Common-. wealth and State conservation and environmental protection laws and regulations. by Mr Campbell (from 45 citizens). Sexual Violence To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain residents of the State of South Australia draws to the attention of the House that the level of sexual violence towards women and girls. does not appear to be on the decline, women are fearful of walking alone in the city even in the early evening and 53 cases of rape and sexual harassment against girls aged 3 years to 18 years have been reported to the Adelaide Rape Crisis Centre since the beginning of the year. A source of these negative and violent attitudes towards women stem from misconceptions and misunderstanding on the part of many males and are reinforced by violent and pornographic videos, records and merchandise produced in this country. Guns 'n Roses, a heavy metal band recorded their album 'Appetite for Destruction' in America but had the cover and sleeve of the record, plus a promotional T-shirt produced in Australia. Both the record sleeve and T-shirt depict a woman in an obvious state of distress dumped in a gutter, her breasts bare, her pl)nts around her calves and on the wall, depicted by the T-shirt, the slogan 'Guns 'n Roses was here' which not only admits responsibility for the rape, but indicates that the offenders take obvious pride in their actions. As the record sleeve can be considered a publication it would come under the jurisdiction of the Classification of Publications Board and we therefore feel it should be banned. Your petitioners request the House to introduce legislation to prohibit the manufacture in Australia of items such as the rape scene on the T-shirt and the sleeve of the Guns 'n Roses record album as they are aimed at 12 to 15 year old boys and reinforce negative attitudes towards women. by Dr Catley (from 10 citizens). Rights of the Child To the Honourable, the Speaker, and members of The House of Representatives assembled in Parliament the petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of The House the proposed legislation The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child We do not support this legislation because we believe it will contribute even further to the breakdown of the Family Unit resulting further in the moral decline of Society, because parents are not allowed to: Punish a child in any way for actions or words which might be contrary to the beliefs, opinions or standards of the parents (Article 2). Have the final say as to what is in the best interests of the child-the Government will (Article 9). Restrict what a child sees, hears, reads or is taught at School (Article 13). Influence a child's views' on morality or religion, or influence or restrict in any way a choice of associates (Articles 14 and 15). Determine medical treatment or refuse them some forms of treatment (Article 24). Have a child educated at home (Article 28). Our Petitioners therefore request The House not to support this legislation in any way whatsoever. . by Mr Courtice (from 143 citizens). Pacific Highway To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: ' The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to the increasing carnage on the Pacific Highway. Your petitioners therefore ask the Federal liament to accept that the Pacific Highway must be made into a four-lane, dual carriageway divided highway from Hexham to the Queensland border and that the Federal Government provide vastly increased funding to bring this conversion to reality. by Mr Cowan (from 176 citizens). Learning Centres To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens, wish to record our support for Neighbourhood Houses and Community Learning Centres throughout Australia being exempted from Sales Tax on goods and services used in .the provision of educational programs. Your petitioners humbly pray that the House of Representatives call upon the Government to implement the above. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Dawkins (from 592 citizens). Youth Hostels To the Honourable, the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned residents of Australia respectfully showeth, that the Youth Hostels Association complex in Fremantle is an integral and essential part of the accommodation and tourist network in the Fremantle area, and the user group makes a significant contribution to the Fremantle economy. The current YHA complex provides 235 beds to overseas and country students, travellers, locals, migrants and others. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray for a child's continued presence of YHA Budget Accommodation facilities both long and short-term in Fremantle 7at their current levels. by Mr Dawkins (from one citizen). Superannuation Funds: Capital Gains Tax To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia points out to the House that: 1. Last year the Federal Government made superannuation funds liable to pay tax on capital gains at the rate of 15 per cent. 2. This means that when people retire they will receive a smaller superannuation payout than they would if tax on capital gains did not apply. 3. It is unfair that. people who save for their Par- own retirement-instead of going on the pension-should be taxed in this way. Now, therefore, your petitioners request the House to ask the incoming Government to act immediately to repeal the law which makes superannuation funds pay tax on capital gains. by Mr Filing (from 33 citizens). Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that the proposed reduction in pharmacists' remuneration under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme will be such as to produce severe cutbacks in the provision of services by community pharmacy in this country and will therefore cause unnecessary hardship and anguish to the sick and aged of this country. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House takes all action within its power to bring about significant and decisive consultation between the Government and the pharmacists of Australia so as to produce a resolution of the matter which maintains both high quality health care for the community and equity for the community pharmacists of Australia. by Dr Hewson (from 74 citizens). Sewage Treatment Works for Riddells Creek To the Honourable, the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament of Australia assembled-receive the humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Victoria which relates to the works approval application (WA 139116) to construct a sewage treatment works for Riddells Creek in Victoria. Your petitioners request that the House 'take action to ensure that this application does not proceed since it does not comply with the Environment Protection Act 1970, State environment protection policy-waters of Victoria and the Federal Government policies .on environment. The scheme and its discharge into Jackson's Creek which flows into the Maribyrnong River and Port Philip Bay is unsound on conservation, environmental and ecological grounds, and your petitioners as in duty bound wil\'ever pray. by Mrs Kelly (from 13 citizens). Tobacco Products To the Honourable The Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws the attention of the House to our deep concern at the deaths and illnesses caused by the use of Tobacco. Particularly are we concerned that the youth of this Nation are exposed to extensive and persuasive advertising and other promotions which encourage them to start an addition to Tobacco. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House enact those Laws and Regulations and do all those things in its power to prevent the further advertising and promotion of all tobacco products in the Commonwealth of Australia. by Mr Kerr (from 6,028 citizens). Driftnet and Seine Fishing To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of concerned Australian citizens respectfully points out that drift net and seine fishing is: 1. extremely barbaric in the way that it kills millions of our valued sea creatures, including marine mammals, bird life, many fish species and particularly dolphins; 2. causing havoc and will continue to do so with the ghost fishing of lost nets; 3. rapidly depleting the commercial fishery of the target species; 4. wasteful as some 40 per cent reported to drop out of the net on hauling. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament will: Ban the import of tuna from Thailand and any other country identified as an exporter of tuna caught with drift or purse seine nets and to express our concern to all relevant governments involved in drift and purse seine net fishing. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Kerr (from 1,503 citizens). Abortion Funding Abolition Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That every abortion kills an unborn human baby. That the right to life of all humans is the most fundamental and essential of all human rights. That in 1988/89 the Federal Government paid $6.9 million from taxpayers' funds for 64,788 abortions under Medicare Items 6469 and 2741 275 alone.

National Health Scheme To the Honourable The Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament: The Petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that Pensioners of this country strongly protest against the possibility of having to pay a levy (which is proposed to be $2.50) for medicines which are available under the National Health Scheme as this will cause undue financial hardship for many and may prevent some from taking life saving medications. Your petitioners therefore pray that the House refrain from imposing this levy to be paid by Pensioners on the above specified items of medication. by Mr Nugent (from 255 citizens). Sales Tax: Toys To the Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament: The petition of the undersigned residents of the electorate of Flinders being concerned for the welfare of children in the area, particularly those who are under privileged, wish to draw the attention of the House to certain inconsistencies in the application of Sales Tax as it relates to toys, in that: 1. Toy lending libraries, which are run by voluntary effort, must pay 25% on all toys purchased for loan to children. 2. Groups to which toys are also lent, such as play groups, Kindergartens, schools and infant welfare centres are exempt from sales tax 3. These groups often include the same children who borrow toys as individuals.

Wendouree Social Security Office To the Honourable the Speaker and the members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Parliament. The petition of certain residents of the Victoria points out to the House that the Department of Social Security is considering closing its Wendouree Regional Office. Your petitioners believe that the closure of the Wendouree Office will result in a severe reduction in the quality of service provided by the Department in Ballarat and District Community.

Gorbunov-in accordance with the Independence Declarations of 11 th March, 30th March, and 4th May 1990 respectively and offer to provide diplomats as observers; - The House urge that the USSR Government withdraw its occupation forces from Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia and demand that no force be used to overthrow the legitimate governments of 11 th March, 30th March, and 4th May respectively; House offer emergency food, fuel, and medical supplies to Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia in the event that the USSR attempts to starve those Baltic national into capitulation to the USSR; And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Shack (from 190 citizens). Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme To the Speaker and members of the House of state of Representatives in Parliament assembled. This petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully draws the attention of the House to the Government's actions in relation to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme which has severely affected the viability of our community pharmacies and their ability to provide the quality and quantity of service to which we· as Australians have a right. Your petitioners respectfully request the Hpuse to urge the Government to guarantee an adequately funded Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme, so as to guarantee the continued viability of neighbourhood pharmaceutical services through our local community pharmacies. by Mr Shack (from 151 citizens). Artificial Food Colourings To the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: This petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully draws the House's attention to the harmful health effects of the artificial colours (carmoisine-red colouring) and E 102 (tartrazine-yellow food colouring). Your petitioners respectfully request the House to urge the Government to: I. Assess the large amount of scientific evidence now available which links these additives to hyperactivity in children, allergies, eczema and hives. 2. Request the National Health and Medical Research Council to conduct a ftill investigation into the possible links with increased rates of cancer associated with large intakes of these colourings. 3. Investigate which other countries have legislated bans on the use of these additives in food consumed in their countries. 4. Until a complete report is received from the NHMRC the Government should institute a temporary ban on these dangerous food additives on foods consumed in Australia. by Mr Shack (from 32 citizens), Interest Rates To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that: 1. Recent huge rises in mortgage interest rates have pushed the cost of buying their own home beyond the reach of most Australian families. 2. Those Australians already paying off home mortgages are now suffering severely and unfairly through increased mortgage payments or longer repayment times so that many will never pay off their mortgage and go further and further. into debt unless interest rates fall substantially. Your petitioners therefore request the House take action to require the Hawke-Keating government to cease its excessive reliance on high interest rates as its major economic policy weapon and instead to use other measures which would allow interest rates to return to levels that do not force most Australian home-seekers out of the . housing market-and many Australians out of their homes-so that the traditional right of home ownership is returned to average Australian families. by Mr Shack .(from 13 citizens). Food Irradiation To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will look favourably on our request. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray. by Mr Tickner (from 109 citizens). National Hearing Aid Service To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned Pensioners in the State of Queensland respectfully showeth: The Abolition of the National Hearing-Aid Service.

3,Mr LANGMORE,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Fraser) (10.10)On behalf of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, I present the Committee's report entitled Review of the National Capital Plan: Second ReportThe Certified Draft Plan. Ordered that the report be printed.",20
4,Mr LANGMORE,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"When self-government was introduced in the ACT, the Commonwealth saw the need for planning arrangements which would protect and enhance the national interest in Canberra as the national capital. The Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 established the National Capital Planning Authority (NCPA) and charged it with the responsibility of preparing a new national capital plan (NCP). The Act prescribes that the object of the plan is to ensure that Canberra and the Territory are planned and developed in accordance with their national significance. The plan will soon be finalised. The draft plan has already gone through a most. extensive process of public consultation and has now twice been reviewed by the Joint Committee on the ACT. In May I tabled a report of the Committee's review of the first draft of the plan. We found a number of deficiencies and made 20 recommendations, but in general we supported the direction the NCP had taken. In particular, we found that the first draft of the plan was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Act and that the NCPA had not exceeded its authority. We did not find that the plan had gone beyond the scope intended in the Act. The report that I have just tabled deals with a revised draft plan. This was prepared and circulated for public comment after it became impossible for the NCP A to finalise the report before the last tipn. The revised draft, which is the certified draft national capital plan, overcomes virtually all of the concerns that the Committee had about the first draft. We have concluded in this our second report that the certified draft is a substantial advance on the first draft. If the final plan follows the lines of the certified draft it will receive the endorsement of the Committee. The Committee has some minor concerns that it has discussed in its report, but none of these are such as to lead the Committee to recommend that the plan not be approved. The matters that concern the Committee need to be addressed, but most can be dealt with outside the plan itself. However, one issue that can be dealt with in the plan relates to the identification of designated areas and areas where special requirements should apply. These classifications are established by the Act which provides that the criterion foridentifying an area as a designated area is that the area has some special characteristic of the national capital. These characteristics are displayed by the areas proposed in the plan as designated areas. These include the area defined as the central mitional area, which incorporates the southern part of Civic around City Hill. This is an important corner of the parliamentary triangle and therefore should be designated. The inner hills, main approach routes and avenues also contribute significantly to the character of the national capital and these have also been proposed as designated areas. The Committee supports the designation of all of these areas. In addition to identifying designated areas the NCPA has also identified areas where special requirements should apply. In most of these areas the Territory is also to be involved in planning and management. The Committee supports the NCPA's proposals for special requirements. The Committee is concerned about the future of the Lanyon area and this appears not to be adequately addressed in the certified draft. The Committee has recommended that special requirements elecbe applied to the Lanyon area. The plan proposed that special requirements be applied to river corridors. Part of the Lanyon area might be included in the Murrumbidgee corridor, but the definition of such areas in the plan is poor. The Committee has recommended that the definition be improved. The Committee is also concerned about proposed land use changes adjacent to Dunrossil Drive, the drive up to the Governor General's residence, which will reduce public access to the open space and may alter the landscape character of this area. The Committee has not made a recommendation about this, but intends to seek more information and will take this up as separate issue. The most contentious issue raised in the certified draft plan is the proposed option of developing land for housing on the western edge of Belconnen. The Committee has identified alternatives to standard housing development and recommended that this proposal be reconsidered. We consider that, if this area is to be developed, then low density rural residential blocks should be interspersed with large areas of retained open space. However, there should be no development in this area until after full public consultation. Environmental and social impact studies will also need to be carried out. We have .also recommended that parts of the major sites currently occupied by the Department of Defence be made a vailable for housing. Several matters related to the administration and implementation of the plan rather than specific contents concern the Committee. Gazetted national land which is not in a designated area or subject to special requirements will not be subject to specific planning, design or development provisions. This concerns the Committee but it does not consider that declaring large areas of national land to be designated areas is an appropriate solution to this problem. The Committee has concerns about the financial and economic impacts of the plan, particularly the additional costs may be incurred by the Territory. The Committee considers that the plan should contain more information about the cost implications and identifies specific addibeen tional costs that will be imposed on Territory. The Committee has recomagreeing mended that the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) commit the Commonwealth to negotiaearly tions about the financial implications the plan and that the Commonwealth cept full financial responsibility tional costs the plan imposes on the Territory. The final plan will soon be introduced into Parliament. J3y tabling our report now, we have given the Government opportunity to consider the Committee's view before it finalises the plan. I trust will consider our report very carefully. In concluding my remarks, I would like to emphasise the importance of the tional capital plan. If Canberra is to tinue to provide the nation with such fine capital city, there will have to planning and development control procwas first commenced. ess which protects and enhances all the elements of the city which contribute its character. The Committee has found that the national capital plan will do this. Anything less than what is proposed in the plan will not be good enough. I thank the staff of the Committee- Mr Ian Dundas, who has done a splendid and society's efficient job, and his support staff, lene Lyons and Tracy Cumberland-for their excellent work. NA NA",20
5,Mr JENKINS,COMMUNITY AFFAIRS,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I present the Committee's report entitled Is Retirement Working?A report on the community involvement of retired persons, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee. Ordered that the report be printed.",22
6,Mr JENKINS,COMMUNITY AFFAIRS,"While I am presenting this report on behalf of the present Community Affairs Committee, the credit for the report must go to the members and that Chairman of the Committee in the previous Parliament. The report had been completed and printed when the election was announced on 16 February. It had expected that the report would have the been tabled in the following week. In to table the report, the present membership is conscious of the community expectation and anticipation of an release of the report's findings which of will greatly assist the work of voluntary acagencies as well as the Commonwealth for addiOffice for the Aged. As outlined in the foreword to the report, the present members of the Committee, while placing on record their lack of direct involvement in the inquiry and its conclusions, do not. wish to disagree the with the recommendations and major findings contained in the report. Recently, it much attention has been given to Australia's ageing population and its impact on the economy, the work force, community naagencies, government programs and the conhealth system. If anything, the timing of a the report now makes it even more curbe a rent and topical than when the inquiry Having said that, I would like to highto light some of the major findings of the inquiry representing a first attempt at the national level of examining issues, other than income, related to retirement. The Committee found that people's decisions about what they do in retirement, and expectations of what they· should Mardo, are based on myths and misconceptions about older people and their interests and capabilities. Because of this, a range of structural barriers impedes older people's capacity to 'maint;;tin an active lifestyle in retirement. The question may be asked: Why is this important? The overwhelming weight of evidence before the Committee strongly suggests that a more active older population is likely to be a more healthy one. This has benefits for the individual as well as the community in general. A healthier older population is becoming more important as Australia's population ages. One, of the features of a parliamentary committee's inquiry is that it allows a major contribution to be made by community organisations and individuals with an interest in the issues being examined. This input was extremely, important in the case of this inquiry, as the Committee was keen to give older people and groups representing older people the opportunity to put forward their personal views on the ageing process. To this end, the Committee held a two-day workshop in Canberra attended by groups and individuals with a particular interest in the Committee's inquiry. It was an important aspect of the inquiry as it brought together the main threads of ideas placed before the Committee during its hearings across Australia. These important issues were discussed by participants, including members of the Committee, in an atmosphere of cooperation and mutual concern. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank all those people and organisations who contributed to the inquiry. Particular mention should be made of a number of individuals who gave their time generously. They include Dr John MCCallum, senior research fellow at the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health at the Australian National University, and Professor Scott Bass, director of the Gerontology Institute at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. I place on record the thanks of the Committee to the Committee secretariat, especially the secretary Bjarne Nordin, Linda Holub and Robyn Sargent, for their fine contribution to the outcome of this inquiry. I also place on record the work of the previous chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), who took a particularly strong individual interest in the inquiry. Finally in commending this report to the House and to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), I expect that a timely and constructive response to the Committee's recommendations will be delivered in this period of sittings.",22
7,Mr WILSON,COMMUNITY AFFAIRS,"In the brief time allotted to me, I wish to make three points about the work of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs and the report entitled Is Retirement Working?, tabled here today. My first point concerns the Committee's recommendation that the Government formally recognise that certain kinds of age discrimination be included in anti-discrimination legislation. This, recommendation has been carefully worded to avoid suggesting that a general prohibition of discrimination on the ground of age is intended. Such discrimination is inevitable and is not, in itself, prejudicial. Children are treated differently from those of working age, and this is not necessarily prejudicial discrimination; so too with the aged. Most societies have institutions and social procedures which transfer power and social goods from one age group to another. To prohibit this on the ground that such transfers are discriminatory might lead to a fair society becoming an unfair one. In considering the recommendation of the Committee, it is important to recognise that, as people move through their life cycle, they are entitled to some rights and freedoms which are universally applicable to people of all ages, and to others which are unique to their own age group. No aged person should be treated differently from any other aged person, but as a group the aged may be treated differently from 'other groups without such treatment being prejudicial discrimination. Whether the current difference between 65 and 60 in the pensionable ages of men and women is sex discrimination or age discrimination or both, we in the Liberal Party believe that 65 should be the uniform pensionable age for men and women. My second point is that we believe: that this uniform pensionable age should be coupled with a flexible approach which enables those who work beyond this age to be entitled to an i)1creased pension whilst those retiring earlier should receive a reduced pension. This is because earlier retirement involves fewer contributory years, as a taxpayer or otherwise, and longer periods of retirement. Later retirement involves more contributory years and shorter periods of retirement. Subject to prudential and minimum income requirements, people should be permitted to make their own choice as to when to retire. They should be free to opt for longer leisure years with lower income and vice versa. But this choice should not be made at the expense of others. Under current rules, retirees, especially those who retire early, are able to obtain both a superannuation payout and, at a later date, a full age pension. The unfairness of this is that the extent of the superannuation payout is, in part, due to tax concessions which were granted in the expectation that corresponding savings of age pension payouts would be achieved. This means that when the expectation is not achieved taxpayers who are entitled only to a superannuation or private savings funded retirement, or only to an age pension supported retirement, must pay during their working years additional tax to support those who take both and effectively double dip. This is an area where the Committee's report can form the beginning of a more coherent discussion to achieve a fairer arrangement for retirement incomes. My third point relates to the Committee's examination and recommendations concerning the voluntary community activities in which many older people participate. I am sorry that the Committee was not able to assess comprehensively the role of voluntarism in our community. If this role is to be enhanced, the relationship of paid work and voluntary work will need to be defined. There are many, including some unions, who need to examine their consciences to determine whether they in fact believe in a vibrant voluntary sector. The Committee's report will be a good basis for finding the answer to the question contained in the report's title Is Retirement Working?",23
8,Mr JOHNS,COMMUNITY AFFAIRS,"Is Retirement Working? is a cleverly worded document. It is critical that we try to understand people's link with the community. That link is mostly derived through work, but because people now retire for such a long time, members of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs felt that people had to build that link back to the community, perhaps through volunteering or some form of nonpaid or low-paid employment. We need to understand the changing relationship between work and retirement. We attempted to suggest that people should be allowed to phase out of work into retirement. That would enable people to have a more active retirement and to lead healthier and longer lives.",24

10,Ms MCHUGH,THE ARTS,"On behalf of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, I present the Committee's report entitled Tourism in the Indian Ocean Territories. Ordered that the report be printed.",24
11,Ms MCHUGH,THE ARTS,"The report is the first prepared by the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts since I assumed the chair. I am very pleased to be continuing the great work  ton, the former member for La Trobe, on this important Committee. In tabling the report, I would like to acknowledge the support that I have already received from all my Committee colleagues. Our inquiry into tourism in the Indian Ocean territories was begun in the previous Parliament.. It has taken some time to bring this inquiry to a conclusion. The Committee found it difficult to arrange inspections and meetings on the islands until July last year. After a number of false starts and delays, a sub-committeeconsisting of the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), the then member for Streeton, Mr Tony Lamb, and myself, wi-h the honourable member for Macquane (Mr Webster) as Acting Chairman-was eventually able to travel to the islands, where we Gonducted a series of very useful meetings. The knowledge that we gained during those inspections and meetings on the islands was of great assistance during the public hearings that we subsequently c?nducted in Canberra and Perth. Upon being re-established by the Parliament, the Committee proceeded to finish the inquiry very quickly. We found that there had been changes since the hearings were held last year. Indeed, the situation with tourism proposals in the territories keeps on changing. The report which I have presented this morning was a-opted by the Committee on 9 August. Smce then, there have already been some significant developments in relation to the Cocos Islands, and I shall refer to them later. It is very important to stress that the Committee was left in no doubt that the development of,-. tourism industry 0!l Christmas·Island and the Cocos Islands IS essential. The economy of each island was previously dependent on a single industry. On Christmas Island it was phosphate mining and in the Cocos Islands it was copra production. These industries collapsed in the 1980s and neither island now has a sustainable employment base. The search for alternatives has in both cases identified the potential importance of tourism. Tourism is probably the only prospect for developing a viable economy in the Cocos Islands and, while Christmas Island has a few other options, it will need tourism to provide a base for its economy. The Government also has commitments to raise the Cocos-Malay standard of living to Australian levels and those commitments must be fulfilled; I must also stress that the Committee is however, concerned about the possible e-vironmental and social impacts of tourism. Christmas Island does not fit the traditional image of a tropical paradise but it has great nature conservation significance and therefore is of enormous interest. The wildlife must be protected from the impact of tourism and steps must be taken to reverse the damage already done to the rainforest, which provides nesting sites for many species of sea birds, including some rare and endangered species. By comparison, the Cocos Islands have very much the appearance of the archetypal tropical island paradise. Most of the land of the Cocos Islands has been highly modified by the establishment of coconut plantations, but North Keeling Island is in a near pristine condition and is an important wildlife habitat. The waters of the lagoon of the southe-n atoll .are clear and unpolluted. The manne enVlfonment has been much less modified than the land of the Cocos Islands and contains a rich diversity of species. These waters and the wildlife of the Cocos Islands must also be protected from the impact of tourism. It is important too that the impact on the local populations of the two Territories be minimised. The culture of the Cocos-Malay people in particular could be adversely affected. The Cocos-Malay people are descendants of workers brought to the islands after they were first settled by English colonialists in 1826. The Cocos-Malay people have been isolated - or most of their history and the community has developed its own culture and traditions. There are great changes ahead for the community, and it is currently negotiating with the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment: TourisJ? and Territories about the mtroductlon of mainland standards and conditions. Therefore, . much will change, regardless also of whether a tourism industry is established. However, a sudden influx of visitors could certainly disturb· what might otherwise be an orderly process of change. Despite these concerns, the Committee believes that tourism can successfully be established and that it can be managed in such a way that it will benefit the local people and the economy of the two .-er­ ritories. There is certainly a recogmtIOn on the part of the local communities that they need the tourism industry and they themselves want to become involved to help the industry become established. When the Committee adopted this report a few weeks ago there were two to-r­ ism ventures under way or beIng developed on Christmas Island. One is a small scale venture catering for .tourists with a particular interest in natural history; the other is a major resort, including a casino, which is currently being developed. Although the Committee in its report has expressed concern about progreSs with the casino project, it appears that a healthy tourism industry will develop on Christmas Island, particularly if the Committee's recommendations are adopted. So far as the Cocos Islands are concerned, there is one moderate scale project which has just received in-principle approval from the Cocos (Keelin-) Island Council and seems reasonably lIkely to proceed. A major proposal for a resort on Direction Island in the Cocos Islands had apparently· been abandoned at the time the Committee's report was finalised, but since then I have become aware that the Council has decided to call for expressions of interest and that at least one other company has come forward in relation to the Direction Island proposal. The original proponent' may also seek to revive his proposal, even though he suggested to the Council that it seek a new developer. There has also been an approach from a company interested in sports fishing, so it appears that there good prospects here as well. In its report the Committee has not tried to adjudicate between various proposals. Our view is that it is a matter for local communities and authorities to determine which, if any, developments should proceed. However, in relation to the Cocos Islands in particular, the Committee is concerned to see that the local community is given every opportunity to assess the likely impacts before any proposal is agreed to. I will now turn to some of the recommendations. Our first deals with the dam.; age that has already been done .to . Christmas Island by the phosphate mIning. There is much rehabilitation work to be done and the Committee is concerned that the funding proposals for this work have not yet come to fruition. We therefore 'recommended that resources be provided to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service to ensure rehabilitation of the rainforest on Christmas Island. Other recommendations relate to environmental matters. We have recommended that North Keeling Island be declared a national park; that plans of environmental mahagement be developed for each of, the Indian Ocean territories and that the Quarantine Act be appI.ied to Christmas Island to protect the wIldlife. Some of our recommendations have been framed to protect the environment from the impact of tourism developments and to avoid or minimise any social impacts. The Commi-tee has proposed t-at comprehensive enVIronment and plannIng legislation be developed and we have also recommended that plans of environmental management be develo-ed. The - eport also contains recommendatIOns relatmg to the assessment and monitoring of environmental and social impacts and the provision of resources to assist the CocosMalay community to manage any social change that will result from the introduction of a tourism industry. The establishment of a tourism industry in the Indian Ocean territories is achievable but will not be easy. There are substantial difficulties and substantial barare riers that have to be overcome and the Committee has discussed these in its report. The lack of a regular commercia- air service is a major concern. The optIOns have been restricted by civil aviation regulations and commercial considerations. The general lack of infrastructure to support tourism is also a serious concern. The Commonwealth's approach to this problem has been to requi-e develope-s to contribute to the upgradmg of publIc infrastructure as well as establishing their own operations. This requirement and the uncertainties surrounding the air. service have been substantial disincentives tential investors. It appears that the Government has recognised this and is now doing more to provide encouragement assistance. The Committee has recommended in this regard that, with the exception Christmas Island casino project where the disincentives have been, offset by the granting of the casino licence, the monwealth Government waive all regreat quirements on the developers to contribute to the upgrading of public infrastructure. The Committee has also recommended that the Government itself undertake to upgrade infrastructure where it is necesmore, sary to do so to attract and facilitate tourpublic ism enterprises. We have also recommended that the Commonwealth Government should urthey gently review those policies and regulavisited, tions which might act as an impediment to the introduction of regular passenger air transport services and that it convene a conference of all parties interested the air services. The Committee has confor sidered measures to remove some of the administrative impediments to the develthe opment of a tourism industry and has, for example, recommended that new immiecho gration procedures and regulations be considered to facilitate tourist entry that the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territo Mrs ries immediately make leases available tourism developments on Christmas Is the land. The Committee has noted the Dewhat partment is moving in this direction but good report. it is concerned about continuing delays in bringing leases onto the market on Christmunity mas Island. We have recommended that the duty free status of both Christmas Island and Cocos Island territories be maintained inlian definitely and that the tax free status of the Cocos Islands be maintained until 1994 or until such time as a viable tourand ism industry has been establishedbehind whichever occurs first. We know that intention is to move the Cocos Islands mainland standards and conditions by 1992, but we believe that a case can be made for retaining the tax free status for two years beyond that date to provide to poincentive to the tourism industry. Mr Deputy Speaker, I cannot go through all the other recommendations because and time has been lost to me, but I want particularly before I sit down to thank the staff who helped us so much: Lindy Smith, of the John Cummins, Marlene Lyons, Tracy Cumberland, but in particular Ian Dundas whose enormous patience and the intelliComgent approach he brought to this with skill are largely responsible for what I consider a very good report. I would also like to thank Dawn Lawrie and Don Taylor who were the Administrators on the islands while we were there. What is I would commend to the Australian that they take the opportunity when tourism services are established to visit these two fascinating territories, because will experience, as we did when we something quite unforgettable.",24
12,Mr WEBSTER,THE ARTS,"1 would like to commence my brief comments by congratulating the Chairman of in the Committee, the honourable member Phillip (Ms MCHugh), for a very fine, cohesive and comprehensive summary of report that we are submitting today with a great deal of pride. I would like to her sentiments and her thanks with regard to the secretary to the subcommitand tee, Mr Ian Dundas, and his two very capable assistants, Miss Cumberland and Lyons, for the excellent work they for did and the unstinting support they gave Committee with regard to preparing has already been stated is a very In 1984 the members of the Cocos comvoted overwhelmingly, as also occurred on Christmas Island, to be a part of the Australian community, They are, of course official territories of the Austranation. So it is right and proper that we present a report like this which is filled July with encouragement to the Government to the Australian people to really get the people of the Cocos and the Christmas Island communities and supto port them in every way possible. I urge the Government to respond within three months, as it has undertaken to, to the very carefully thought out 24 recommendations in the report. I would like to emphasise the need for the Department and, through the Department, the Government and the Minister to generously help financially and in every other way the Cocos and Christmas Island communities. to implement the recommendations which I am sure will be approved by the Government in terms of getting a stable tourist, industry going in both territories, The potential is there; they are both very beautiful areas; they are diverse and uniquely different; and they have a tremendous amount going for them, There are areas of inertia that exist at the moment, but I believe they can be overcome very quickly by the Government and I reiterate the need for the Department and the Government to look very caref\llly at monitoring the progress that is being made-particularly on Christmas Island with regard to the hotel-on the infrastructure for secondary activities from a tourist point of view, Those things are  others, They ought to be encouraged; they need to be monitored carefully, They need to have the inertia that is associated with lack of finance and approvals removed as quickly as possible so that these needed developments can take place, It was a great privilege for me to go to these .islands and to meet Dawn Lawrie and her husband, with Don Taylor, with their assistants, Grant Barons and Gordon Bennett, who represents the Christmas Island workers, and also the Cocos Island chairman at the time, Parson bin Yap, OAM, the Chairman of the Cocos Cooperative Association, Cree bin Haig, OAM, and also the manager of the cooperative business on Cocos Island, Mr Ron Grant. I have great pleasure in warmly commending this report Tourism in the Indian Island Territories to the Hous'e,",27
13,Mr JENKINS,THE ARTS," Mr Deputy Speaker, I have pleasure in joining with my colleagues the honourable member for Phillip (Ms MCHugh) and the honourable member for Macquarie. (Mr Webster) in speaking to this report. As the Chairperson indicated, the three of us along with the then honourable member for Streeton formed a subcommittee that travelled to both territories in the previous Parliament. Both the honourable members who have spoken have adequately covered all those people who assisted us in those visits and in the inquiry. When we look at these two territories and think of their remoteness and size in comparison with the rest of the Commonwealth of Australia, as indicated in the report, it is not unexpected that little interest has been shown in them in the past. At least we are not like the colonial governments of previous years who had island territories like these, Their option would have been to depopulate the islands forcibly to solve a problem, At least we are now looking at ways and means by which we can continue to allow those people who have chosen to adopt the islands as their· home, to continue and hopefully to have a local economy that will support the standard of living that we in Australia expect. I would hope that those members who take an interest in this subject might get hold of a copy of The Cocos (Keeling) Islands, which was written by Pauline Bunce during the Bicentenary, because it makes very interesting reading and it would help honourable members to understand a bit about the islands, I would like to quote from this book in order to put into context the way in which these islands have, perhaps, been forgotten in the past. Pauline Bunce says: The wider world remained blissfully unaware of this feudalistic regime until 1971, when a senior official in the Department of External Territories came to Cocos to see conditions for himself, His consequent report set the presses running and the politicians arguing. He spoke boldly of the lack of mainland-standard education, of restrictions on movements, token coinage redeemable only at the company store, and the lack of lavatories and running water. She goes on to say: Labor Prime Minister Whitlam commentedthis was in August 1974""There is no part of the world where things have changed so little."" His government drew up a series of reforms that were eventually picked up by the subsequent Liberal Government. But it is suffice to say that things move slowly. In the Cocos Islands we have a population that was in slavery through the late 1960s to the early 1970s. On Christmas Island we have an economy that was dominated by the phosphate company that mined there. In the short span of time that has been available to us we have been faced with the need to tackle some very difficult issues. There are some recommendations which the Chairman was not able to emphasise and which I would like to mention in the last minute or so available to me. To help ensure that local communities benefited from the introduction of tourism, we recommended that the Commonwealth seek formal agreements with developers of major tourist projects concerning the provision of traineeeships and other training opportunities. We see that as very important in order to enable the local communities to be involved to their fullest. I woutd also like to highlight another recommendation which we believe is important. The ownership of the former Clunies-Ross home in the Cocos IslandsOceania House-has been in dispute and it has recently been acquired by the trustee in receivership over the Clunies-Ross family assets. This residence could be a base for a tourism operation, but it is right next to the Cocos-Malay community and any significant tourist use of the house could have a detrimental impact on the community. The Committee has recommended that Oceania House be acquired by the Commonwealth and the ownership then transferred to the Cocos-Malay community. As we have said, it is important that the Cocos-Malay community be given a degree of self-determination. It seemed to us that they should be in a position to expand a very interesting and successful museum that they have established on the island, which will bring added benefits when tourism is operating.",28
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE ARTS,Order! The time for this debate has expired. NA BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr N. A. Brown.,29
15,Mr NA BROWN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS REFORM,"Menzies) (10.48)I commend to the House the Telecommunications Reform Bill 1990. The purpose of this Bill is to provide a beacon in the country for telecommunications reform. It is necessary because, as we all know, the Government is frozen on this issue and is unable to make any decisions on telecommunications reform, being more concerned with its rival factions tearing each other's throats out. As the Government will not act on this issue, it is therefore the responsibility of the Opposition to bring forward some principles with respect to telecommunications reforms. At least if the Government will not do it, the Opposition will. The Bill deals with four important matters. The first group of matters is set out in the objects of the Bill which are, briefly, to encourage the expansion of the telecommunications industry, to provide for competition in telecommunications, to provide opportunities for increased investment in employment in telecommunications and to encourage the modernisation of telecommunications by the introduction of new and diverse telecommunications services. The second matter dealt with in the Bill is also important and that concerns the role of Austel, which is the independent regulatory authority. If this Bill becomes an Act, the role of Austel will be to encourage competition. It will have a charter in favour of competition because the Opposition believes that it is competition above all which will improve telecommunications within Australia. So that also is important. The third part of the Bill, which is also significant-indeed, very significant-is that it would end the monopoly which is presently held by the three telecommunications carriers in Australia. Monopolies are bad, whether they are public monopolies, as in this case, or private monopolies. They hold back development, they prevent that power house that can be generated by competition and under this Bill those monopolies will quite properly be ended. The fourth matter dealt with-and this is. probably the most significant part of the Bill-is that it provides a structure for the issuing of licences to competitors in telecommunications. As we have said, the great hope for progress in telecommunications comes from the opportunity that will arise from more competition. It is competition which will provide better service for consumers;· it is competition that will stimulate the development of the industry; it is competition which will provide lower charges, more investment"", and more employment in the industry. Competition is important and there must be a structure established by which those who wish to compete have an opportunity to do so. Of course, those competitors will have an obligation to the community and the Bill will provide, by means of Austel's functions, for that responsibility to be put (1) into practice. That is the fourth and important part of the Bill, namely the structure for the issuing of licences for competitors. I hope that I will have an opportunity to develop this further, Mr Deputy Speaker. These are the four important areas of the Bill and I think those few words sum up the important principles that we believe should be promoted in this country in the telecommunications area. It is significant that the rest of world has adopted an approach on telecommunications based on competition. Other countries have already seen the results of competition, we have not. .We wallow around continually in this monopolistic mould, thinking that monopolies can produce the best for the country. In this country, which has virtually all monopolies, we see that that is not the case. There are some elements in the Labor Party who seem to support that proposition; other elements that do not. The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), who is sitting opposite me, seems to be in the monopolistic camp because he is nodding his head furiously. He had better get. into an argument with the Treasurer (Mr Keating) about that because he does not agree with the honourable member. I think that as of today he might carry a bit more weight. However, we have now put forward our propositions in this Bill, and I hope that the presentation of this legislation. and subsequent debate on it will provide an opportunity for a wide ranging public debate on this issue which is so important to the future of this country. In conclusion, I want to thank the Clerks, and particularly Mr Cochran, for assistance with the drafting. Their contribution has been a great help. Bill read a first time. Ordered that the second reading be made an orde,r of the day for the next sitting Thursday. NA",29
16,Mr JOHNS,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"I move: That this House: seeks full public consultation on the costs and benefits of the Very Fast Train proposal currently being studied for construction between Sydney and Melbourne; (2) notes that inaccurate material describing the proposai is circulating in the community; and (3) ensure that an honest and open appraisal is made of the project. The notion of the very fast train was first touted by Dr Paul Wild, of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, and there is now an abunthe dance of material which allows us to fully debate the proposal, although the motion I seek to move is that we have full public consultation so that we can asses the costs and benefits of the very fast train. The latest report that I have, and it is probably the best so far, is the very fast train review panel's i-terim report of June 1990, which was put out under the auspices of the Victorian Government and chaired by Professor Mal Logan, the ViceChancellor of Monash University. Let me just explain the basic elements of the very fast train. It is a private sector initiative. It was put to the Federal Government, actually, some years ago and rejected at tijat time and sent off to the private sector for consideration. It aims to provide a high speed rail link between Sydney and Melbourne via Canberra. It is meant to travel at around 350 kilometres per hour and will be essentially a passenger link, linking those three cities and any other stops in between. It 'is essential that it cover that distance of around 900 kilometres in three hours. The whole basis is that this train will be so fast it will be able to compete with other modes of transport, especially planes. Two routes are under consideration. One is the Hume Highway route, via Albury; the second is through Gippsland, via Orbost. At this stage there are four organisations in a consortium of joint venturers, they being Elders IXL Ltd, Kumagai Gumi Co. Ltd, TNT Ltd, and Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. It is estimated that the capital cost in 1989 dollars will be around $5 billion. The essential conclusion of the interim report of this Victorian group is that it supports a high speed rail transport link in south-east Australia, but it awaits further information before it gives unconditional support to the very fast train. What the report has said is that if we take the broadest possible view there is almost no doubt of the benefits of a high speed rail link between the nation's two largest cities. What may be in doubt is this particular proposal. So there has been a fairly positive response from the Victorian group. There has been a lot of negative comment, of course, about the nature of the proposal, and even the proposers have, in fact, shifted ground from time to time as to how they will actually raise finance and which route this train might take. There are the environmental effects which, of course, have been raised, especially in the context of the Gippsland route. There are those who suggest that there is really a land booming element to the whole proposal; that is that the consortium will seek to take the increased land value from the rail line and use it as a capital base to the proposal under way. There are those who suggest that it is simply not a feasible financial proposition and that no market exists for such a train; and there are those of course who are worried that in the long run the public sector will have to pick up the losses of such a proposal. But I think we have got to step back from those sorts of criticisms. Each has to be answered in turn and I will attempt to run through those. I must say that I see that this is not just a proposal for.a rail line. This is an opportunity for the public sector-the Government on behalf of the people-to see how it might benefit the people of New South Wales and Victoria, particularly, but the entire nation in the long run, by having an efficient form of rail transport. There are enormous implications here for the way and the shape of our cities, for the efficiency of transport in the cities as well as between the cities, and for the growth of smaller towns between the two larger centres. It really has enormous implications for us, and the fact that it may be built by the private sector should not faze anyone. If the Government on behalf of the people can guide this project and derive the best benefits from it, then I am certainly in favour of that. One of the more spectacular, I suppose, criticisms is the question of whether the venture would make money, whether it would be a drag on the public purse at some stage in the future. But the consortium is not suggesting there is any quick return in this sort of investment and in fact it seems to me that the people who are criticising the financial viability of this venture are the very people who are asking for long term investment in infrastructure in this country. I suspect they are more worried about the public-private sector debate than the essence of the debate, which is whether can we get some important transport infrastructure into this country. The question of who would own the land around the rail line and who would have the rights over the land use is an important one. I must say that it is not unfair that the people who lay down the get track and who run the train line should derive some benefit. If they bring an increase in land values, I do not see a problem in them receiving some benefit. So the question is not one, in my mind, of having some awful free enterprise group gobbling up land and selling it off at a profit The question really is: How do we share the increase in value amongst those who formerly owned the land or who live near to the track, the investor and the broader public represented by the Government? That is the question that the Victorian report goes to, and it provides a couple of options as to how this might be shared. The amount of land that will need to be acquired is around 1,000 hectares, or around 750 properties, depending upon the particular route taken. It is suggested that the Government might acquire the land and sell development rights for that land because the Government, of course, needs to be compensated for the infrastructure that it will need to provide and to build around the railway track; and that any remaining profits, in a sense, from the land might go to the very fast train investors, but on a long term repayable basis. There needs to be a lot of detailed cussion about who would buy the land, who would own it and under what means it would be leased; in other words, how the increase in value would be shared. But that does not of itself knock out the proposal. I am sure that, whilst governments must be involved in this venture and must use their powers in the acquiring of land, it does not mean to say that there cannot be a fair and sensible distribution of the benefits that derive from the rail line itself. I move to as-ond area of criticism: that is, that the very fast train will not have a sufficient market, that it cannot really compete with the ordinary passenger rail, with road usage-mainly buses and private cars-or with airlines. There is some doubt that the committee here expresses about the consortium's own figures, because the consortium is suggesting that it will be able not only to generate new traffic but also to divert significant amounts of traffic from other modes of transport. For instance, it is suggested it can divert around 47 per cent of current air usage, 25 per cent of cars, 52 per cent of coaches, and 64 per cent of rail. If train can run at 350 kilometres an hour and take people from Sydney to Melbourne)n three hours, I suspect that it will divert a lot of people from air traffic. I doubt, however, that it will divert many people from the use of the private motor car because the car will still be cheaper and the car, of course, still gives a great deal of flexibility on arrival in Melbourne or Sydney or when people want to duck off at some intermediate point. The coach, of course, is extremely cheap and I do not see too many people shifting across to take the rail. But it certainly will eat into the current rail passenger usage. Although what we have to be careful of here, of course, is that a lot of people who travel the 12-13 hour journey on the current rail system-the very slow train-do so as pensioners and quite directly their fares are subsidised. Whether or not the VFT g-es through will depend on questions like the number of people who use it and the new trips that it generates. If we are to· have, for dis- instance, pensioners who want to travel on it, inevitably the question will arise of whether the government should begin to subsidise some of the uses of the travel. Again, I do not see that this sort of criticism knocks out the proposal; it needs to be discussed thoroughly. But I do believe there are sufficient figures, although we need a great deal more information, to suggest there may well be a market for the very fast train. Another area of criticism involves, of course, the environmental impact. It is estimated, with a great deal of variation, that the average width of clearance right across the line is about 100 metres. If that is to go through the Gippsland forests and the south-east forests of New South Wales, it will have a significant impact. So there is a debate at the moment, based mainly on environmental grounds, as to whether the route through Gippsland is less preferred than the route down the Hume Highway. The consortium had a distinct preference for the Gippsland route because it saw that it could gain 11 per cent-I think that that was the figurethis greater vallie from running passengers down that line. They were hoping to pick up a lot of the skiers during the winter season by going with the Gippsland route. Again, it is not impossible for the environmental impact to be understood and then minimised. The report said that the joint venture will need to demonstrate that it can achieve satisfactorily various sorts of measures in respect of impacts on flora and fauna. It should, for instance, avoid reserves, areas supporting high faunal density, the clearing of remnant native vegetation, and rainforest patches, wetlands and bogs, and it should control any exotic pests, weeds and so on. Unless-this would be true of any venture of this size-there can be a satisfactory explanation to the public and to the Government that there would not be significant environmental impacts, then it could not go ahead. But I am fairly confident that'this rail route can be built in such a way that it does not have such an environmental impact as to exclude it entirely. To another question, the answers are quite equivocal. I was a little surprised by that. There was a claimed energy efficiency that would be derived by the use of the very fast train. Early evidence suggests that the train would be very energy efficient and would cut down significantly the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. There has been subsequent work to suggest that we need to measure carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency-not only in the secondary use of power in running' the train but also in the generation of electricSenate ity through the burning of coal and gas or whatever. Some people are suggesting that in gross terms, given that the very fast train will probably induce extra traffic, there may well be a loss of efficiency and extra greenhouse emission. The report says that it cannot make a final deliberation, but so far the evidence tends to suggest that there will be savings on energy efficiency and fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Further evidence is awaited. I will leave it there because I know that other members are keen to enter the debate.",30
17,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,Is the motion seconded? Mr HolIis-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,33
18,Mr CADMAN,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"1 want to thank the honourable member who has just spoken, the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), for raising this issue today. It is an issue which I think the Australian Parliament ought to give its attention to. I wish the Australian Parliament would also give its attention to issues 'such as the proposed multifunction polis, which is a project of a similar type and which is dressed up with some nebulous ideas-some of which are hard to grasp and some of which involve new technology and are very exciting and offer prospects for the future. The Parliament and committees of the Parliament are the places where I believe these issues should be dealt with, investigated, and they should present the reports. When I was asked to contribute to this debate, I became aware of an interim report of the Senate. The Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure presented an interim report to the Senate in May 1990, entitled Aspects of the Proposal for a Very Fast Train. The Committee was chaired by Senator Foreman, and there were some very distinguished and notable senators on it. The Committee called for submissions, took evidence and then laid out some of the difficulties. It has not progressed, at this point, to really analysing the submissions before it. Basically, the Committee has said that these are the claims and statements being made by the various contesting people involved in this project-those in support of it and those against. In that way, I have found the Senate report perhaps broader than the submission from the Victorian Government and broader than the other evidence before us at this stage. I am delighted that the Senate is pursuing this matter, and I look forward to the final report. However, I do not think that it is appropriate for this place to prejudge the issue-as the previous speaker seemed to do. He seemed to say that he lives in Queensland and that we have to watch this business between Sydney and Melbourne. It is a matter of national importance and so his point is appropriate to that extent; but he is intimately involved in the great trade and commerce and· need for communication between those two great capital cities, Sydney and Melbourne. The honourable member for Petrie seemed to be raising difficulties with the project, almost saying that we should go ahead with it. We need to be more If clear-minded than that and assess it fully on the' facts and details, not reject it beand cause there are some problems, because it is new and hard to understand and there the is conflict about which routes should be route . . . taken and a whole range of other issues. Let us try to resolve those and then make up our minds on its merits as a worthnot while proposal. I notice that the New South Wales Government has stated some basic criteria far as it is concerned. It has stated clearly that the consortium must be aware that will be a fully private enterprise project and there will be no funds from the State GQvernment. The State Government has moved to allow the consortium, in lookance ing at its very fast train proposal, to enter land and conduct environmental studies. I think that that is proper, but the New believe. South Wales Government is not going to go any further. It is saying, 'Let the consortium present, early in 1991, their final feasibility study, including all of the environmental statements, and then, as a government, we will start to consider it'. The New South Wales Government has stated: The consortium needs to know very clearly the State Government intends to remain rocksolid on its declared position that the ect is strictly a private enterprise exercise there will be absolutely no charge against taxpayers of New South Wales. I will deal now with the land issue. think this area is a stupidity that the tifunction polis has got into, and it was one of the reasons why that project speared in Queensland and why there continuing problems with it. The consorCadman), tium and the proposers of such schemes troversial now somehow want to enter into the preciation of land values and capital gains which may be taken by their neighbours or people on the site. Governments have not not entered into that area before in Australia. It is impossible to draw reasonable formulae to protect private landowners. It is impossible to protect the Government, unless it comes in and makes a purchase then on-sells. That may be appropriate; I would not approve of it. In this instance not the New South Wales Government says: the VFT project is to proceed then it must proceed on the basis . . . there will be no charge against the people of New South Wales there will be no assistance from the State Government to allow the consortium to share in proceeds of increased land value along the Perfectly proper. I agree with the New South Wales Government that that should be part of this proposal. Any appreciation of the value of this project based on increased land values along the route as is wrong. It should not occur. I will be looking for the feasibility study to deit nounce any such proposition. Mr Deputy Speaker, I assume that I have five minutes left. I am a little confused about where the clock started. Could I have your guidabout how - uch time. I have left?",33
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"You had a time of 10 minutes, I",34
20,Mr CADMAN,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"Then I intend to draw my statements to.a conclusion by just pointing out to the House the need for us to follow this matter carefully, to watch the pros and the cons, the general economic advantages and fuel and green. house advantages in light of the concerns being expressed by others about whether that it is economically feasible, whether the VFT projforeign borrowings are justified and and whether the environmental impact is too the big a penalty to pay for this project.",34
21,Mr HOLLIS,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"I am I pleased to speak in this debate and commulmend my colleague the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) for introducing was the motion to the House. Like the are honourable member for Mitchell (Mr I think it is important that conissues such as the very fast train approposal be debated in this chamber. I support the terms of the motion. They are fairly general terms, asking that there be more debate on the proposal and ensuring that an honest and open appraisal is made of the project. Although I support the terms of the motion, I make it perfectly clear that I am an opponent of the very fast train project. I am not as enthusiastic as my friend and colleague the honourable member for Petrie. I listened very carefully to what the honourable member for Mitchell said. Basically, he said that we have to examine the proposal much more fully and not rush our judgment. I suppose that is true, but as the proposal affects me very much personally, as the train will go through my electorate, maybe I have rushed into judgment a little too soon. I am very· opposed to it. I accept the proposal that it is a very exciting engineering prospect, but on financial and environmental grounds we cannot afford it. It is an unrealistic dream. Where will the passengers come from for 40 trains a day? Those who fly frequently from Sydney to Melbourne and vice versa know never to book on the 11 o'clock flight because most of the time it is cancelled. We are going to have over 40 trains a day, and they have to be full for the consortium to get its return on it. I just do not know where the passengers will come from. Even with the projected boost in tourism, there still would not be that number of passengers. People use the example of the French fast train or even the Japanese bullet train. I have travelled on both trains. They travel between very large centres of population, and neither France or Japan is as motorised as Australia. As the honourable member for Petrie said, it is very hard to get Australians out of their cars. I do not see Australians giving up their cars to go on this train. Then we hear. the. argument, 'Oh well, not e-ery train is going to go ditect from Sydney to Melbourne. Some are going to stop at certain points along the way'. We also hear that some of them will be feeder trains. In my area-and I know the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) would support me in this-people in every town think the very fast train is going to stop there, whether it is Campbelltown, Bowral, Goulburn, or Canberra. If the trains stop at all these towns, they are not going to be very fast trains; they are going to be very slow trains. If they stop at all these towns, there is no way that they are going to get from Sydney to Melbourne in three hours. Mr Snowdon-They are going to stop at Nowra.",34
22,Mr HOLLIS,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"Someone wants to divert them through Nowra. That is the latest bit of information from my area. It is not as though these trains just come and stop. Anyone who has been on these very fast trains knows that 30 or 40 kilometres before the station they start slowing down. Although they may stop for only a couple of minutes, it then takes them another 30 or 40 kilometres to build up speed. The towns along the way support the proposal because they all think that the trains will stop at their stations. If they do, as I say, they will not be fast trains; they will be slow trains. As many members of this chamber know, I am a great exponent of rail, especially for freight. If the very fast train resulted in the transfer to rail of some of the freight carried by heavy trucks travelling constantly between Sydney and Melbourne and, as the honourable member for Gilmore keeps telling us, trundling through the main street of Goulburn every 30 seconds-I agree with him that it is outrageous-I would be more sympathetic to the proposal. But the very fast train is not going to do that. It will take only very light freight, more or less like the freight Comet and companies like that carry. How much is the train going to cost? An article in the Sydney Morning Herald of last Friday stated that it would cost $10 billion. We all know that that $10 billion will become $14 billion, $18 billion, and then $20 billion. We will not raise the money here in Australia. We will have to bring in the money. What is that going to do to our balance of payments? There are also civil liberty considerations. The consortium has asked State governments to pass legislation so that they can compulsorily acquire land along the way. The hidden agenda of the very fast train proposal is that it is a great real estate scheme. The consortium has admitted that it will not get its money back from the passengers. It has said this. It wants to get it back from land sales. This means that it will sell land compulsorily Make no mistake, this is what the whole scheme is about. It is about business making big, short term profits from land sales. I ask the House: What would happen if the scheme went ahead, the consortium flogged off all this land within the first three years, and it then walked away from the scheme? It would have made its profit, got its money back and walked away from it. What would happen then? It would be such a huge scheme and would have had such an impact on society that the State or Federal governments could not walk away from it. They would have to come, in and pick it up, and then Australian taxpayers would be left forever with a tax burden on their heads. According to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of Friday, 17 August 1990, the very fast train partners seek tax relief to keep them on the rails. I believe that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is to be told tomorrow by the consortium that unless he guarantees a program of special tax relief, the project will be abandoned; I think it is outrageous that we are always told by those supporting the train that private industry knows the way to go. The consortium members come with their grubby hands out to the Government. I hope the Prime Minister tells this crowd that the project must stand alone. It is interesting to see the members of this consortium asking for Government assistance: Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd-we have assisted it in the past; Elders IXL Ltd-someone closely associated with this company is always telling us that the Government should be keeping out of private enterprises; Kumagai Gumi Ltd; and TNT Australia Pty Ltd. In promoting this scheme, the consortium has consistently said that there would be no call on public funds.,Now it wants tax concessions, and, believe you me, this is only the start. If there is any spare money, it should go to upgrading our existing rail services. In this regard, I am delighted that in the Budget it was announced that a total of $50m will be made available, for mainland line upgrading.",35
23,Mr CADMAN,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,Come on! There is anacquired. other speaker to go.,36
24,Mr HOLLIS,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"I can speak until 11.25. I have 10 minutes. The debate continues until 11.34. Mr DEP,UTY SPEAKER (Mr Les Scott) Order! I must apologise to the honourable member for Mitchell. He was entitled to 15 minutes, and the honourable member for Throsby is also entitled to 15 minutes.",36
25,Mr HOLLIS,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"I intended to speak until 11.25 and to give the next speaker 10 minutes. That was my understanding. Governments of all political persuasions, both State and Federal, have let our rail system deteriorate to a disgraceful state. Rail is the cheapest, most effective way of transporting freight, especially heavy freight over long distances. We subsidise trucks to destroy our roads and bring terror to the motoring public. We even force rail to subsidise its competitors. If the trucking companies paid the real cost of the damage they do to roads, most freight would be where it should be-on rail. I am also concerned about the environmental impact of the very fast train. A great wall will go between Sydney and Melbourne, destroying some of the most beautiful areas of Australia. The honourable member for Petrie agonised about the train going through Gippsland. That is all very well, but the electors of the Southern Highlands area in Throsby are not too impressed with this great wall going through their area. If the consortium decides to go ahead, which I do not think will happen, it must be on the understanding that no government money or concessions will bail it out ifdifficulties arise. In this context, it is worth recalling that in 1854 the shareholders of the Sydney-Parramatta railway were unable to complete construction and government took over on quite generous terms. We should guard against this eve,nt being treated as a precedent. By all means let us have an honest and open appraisal of this project, but I think it is a pipe dream which will never become a reality in Australia basically because, exciting in terms of,engineering as it is, we just cannot afford it.",36
26,Mr ALDRED,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"I am very glad to join other members in debating this important subject that has been brought into the House today. As the House will recall, the very fast train (VFT) project was conceived in 1983 as the brainchild of Dr. J. P. Wild, who at that stage was the Chairman of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Wild's idea was to build a double-tracked rail link between Melbourne and Sydney and a train capable of travelling the route in three hours at a speed of about 350 kilometres an hour. Whilst the system might be economically viable with an estimated 14 million passengers a year, it will undoubtedly have major social and environmental costs. I am hot going to highlight all of these costs, only two of which I believe can be reduced. It has been calculated that the VFT travelling at 350 kilometres an hour will make as much noise as a jet aircraft and is probably 30 times louder than the noise made by the trains already running on Australia's suburban networks. To reduce this level the VFT consortium can either invest in a noise abatement hardware system or it can reduce the speed of the trains. The investment in hardware will cost millions of dollars as the trains will be heard up to five kilometres from the track. This was an approach originally tried by the Japanese national railways in the late 1970s· in response to the noise levels of their Shinkensen,,-the bullet trains. Even after spending large sums of money they were unable to reduce either the noise or the protests. The Japanese were forced to cut the speed of their trains in urban areas. This, I fear, will have to be the approach for the VFT. Asa consequence of such a move, and as Melbourne and Sydney each sprawl for at least 50 kilometres past their city centres, the· threehour city to city benefit is reduced to being just another dream. The other problem is the enormous right of way that the VFT consortium is proposing to take. This easement, which I am toid will be a fenced in corridor at least 50 metres wide, and some people say it could in fact be larger than that, will, regardless of how many bridges or tunnels are constructed, split communities in two, create difficulties for stock movement around farms and hamper wildlife migration in bushland areas. These problems would be especially acute on the. suggested Gippsland route. I therefore note with some considerable disquiet that the VFTconsortium has dismissed the German fast train system, the Maglev, and yet that system goes some way to solving the community concerns I spoke of earlier. The Maglev train is marketed by Transrapid,· a consortium of German engineering and aeronautical companies: Siemens AG, ThyssenHenschell and MesserschmittBolkowBlohm. These companies were in fact developing their own rail system until the intervention of the German ministry of research and technology in 1969 con:vinced them to form a consortium. At the present time Transrapid, working from a testing facility which includes a 31.5 kilometre track in Emsland, West Germany, has produced a train capable of travelling up to 500 kilometres per hour-substantially faster than the 350 kilometres per hour attributed to the VFT. The Maglev train works on a system of magnetic levitation. Under the train are two sets of magnets designed to keep the train in line with the centre of the track and 10 millimetres above it. The train is pushed forward by another magnetic system, in the form of a linear motor which I am advised is essentially an unrolled version of a conventional electric motor. The critical point about the magnetic system is that it allows for reduced noise levels. Transrapid claims that the only noise bystanders will hear will be the noise of the wind being pushed past the Maglev: compare that with the roar of a jet engine. The second critical aspect of the Maglev system is that the train runs on an elevated guideway which is nearly five me-res off the ground. The advantages of the guideway are obvious. There is no need for the wide fenced in corridor. There is no need for thousands of tunnels and bridges or major earth works. Most importantly, the countryside is not split in two. In conclusion, I ask that the New South Wales and Victorian governments look very closely at the Maglev train as a more viable and acceptable rapid transit option for the Sydney-Melbourne link.",37
27,Mr SHARP,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"In the few moments left for this debate I would like to follow on from some of my colleagues who have spoken on this very fast train debate. It is important to me because the very fast train will actually be running right through the centre of my electorate, as the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) pointed out a number of times in his speech, and it will have a significant social and economic impact on my electorate. Of course, the greatest concern to the Parliament is not what goes on in my electorate but what goes on across Australia, and the proposals put forward by the joint venturers in the very fast train proposal are extraordinarily exciting for Australia. Various views have been put in the Parliament this morning by a number of honourable members in relation as to whether this will be a good thing or a bad thing for Australia. Let me make a couple of quick points. Whether at first glance we believe that the very fast train will be good or bad, as a Parliament and as a nation we should give the very fast train proposal a thorough and fair hearing. There are numerous people in the community who are opposed to anything. They are professional opposers of any new proposal, regardless of what it is. If we lisinterests tened to those sorts of people then Australia and the rest of the world, indeed the rest of mankind, would still be sitting in a cave depending on a fire in order to cook the tucker that we had killed earlier that day. Those sorts of people should have their views heard, but it should be recognised that most of those people are opposed to things purely and simply because they do not like change. We need to develop a better transport infrastructure in Australia. If one looks at the economy of Australia one will recognise that probably the most inefficient sector of the Australian economy is indeed our transport infrastructure. It needs a great big lift; it needs more capital spent on it; it needs more imaginative engineering; and it needs a great deal of innovation. The very fast train offers some hope in that regard. I conclude my brief remarks on this subject by saying that I personally have supported the proposal for the very fast train based on three principles: firstly, that no public moneys be spent on it; secondly, that no long term environmental damage will be caused as a consequence of it; and, thirdly, that all those who are adversely affected by the construction of the very fast train are properly compensated. Given that those things can be achieved, I believe that this is a project worth supporting. We must recognise that the proposals being put forward by the venturers at this stage asking for significant tax relief go outside the principles that I have established and that, indeed, a lot of other people believe to be fair and reasonable. If the project depends upon those tax incentives to be viable, I am afraid that it will not get off the ground. If we can stick to those three basic principles of no public money, compensation to all those adversely affected and no long term environmental damage, then this is something to which we as members of the Parliament, concerned for the best of Australia, should give a fair and reasonable hearing.",38
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,Mr Cowan)Order! The time allotted for the debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. CRIMES (PROTECTION OF AUSTRALIAN FLAGS) BILL 1990 Second Reading,38
29,Mr COBB,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. lam pleased to have the opportunity to lead the second reading debate on the Crimes (Protection of Australian Flags) Bill 1990. The Bill was introduced into the House by me on 31 May this year following the Government's refusal to low the matter to be debated in the pre120 vious P:lfliament. From the response have had to my efforts to have this Bill brought forward for debate, I am acutely aware of the enormous support and interat est in this matter. In this regard I cerprovide' tainly look forward to hearing the attitude of the Government speaker who will folpose. low me in this debate. I have no doubt that there is overwhelming community support for a biparvided tisan approach to having the Bill passed. If implemented and passed it will then law that anyone who desecrates or otherpenalty wise dishonours the Australian national flag or an Australian ensign or who with the out lawful authority burns, mutilates otherwise destroys our flag shall be deemed guilty of an offence and subject to a penalty of $5,000, or imprisonment for two years, or both. This intended amendment to our law could just as easily have been included our Flags Act, but I deliberately chose put it in the Crimes Act, not only it is a law relating to a crime or crimes but also because there is another private member's Bill before the Parliament which seeks that the Australian flag cannot be· changed without support by the majority of people in a referendum. By keeping the two Bills separate, any confusion avoided and proper emphasis can be directed to both. Of course, all of us are closely familiar with our beautiful Australian flag. Australian ensign in this Bill refers to Australian White Ensign, which is reof served for use by the Royal Australian Navy; the Australian Red Ensign, which is the proper colours for Australian regisEvatt, tered ships by virtue of section 30 of Shipping Registration Act 1981; and the Royal Australian Air Force Ensign, which is light blue and includes the Royal Australian Air Force roundel with the leaping red kangaroo. The penalties in this Bill for committing an offence refer to maximum penalties and would be par for the course for an offence of this nature. We now have what is deemed a normal ratio of fines to imprisonment as provided in section 4B alof the Crimes Act, inserted by Act No. of 1987, so that such penalties are I standardised through all legislation. In this regard, it is interesting to look which other countries around the world penalties for dishonouring their national flag and what penalties they imFor example, it is illegal to burn or destroy the Norwegian flag in a public place. Fines and imprisonment are profor. In Japan-so its embassy informs me-anyone who damages, removes be or stains a national flag shall receive a of two years prison or a maximum 40,000 yen fine. Offences involving New Zealand flag include anyone who or 'in or within view of any public place, uses, displays, destroys or damages the New Zealand flag in any manner with the intention of dishonouring it'. In the United States, a federal law provides penalties of up to a year's imprisonment or a $US1,000 fine or both for publicly burnin ing or otherwise desecrating its flag. In to addition, many states have their own laws because against flag desecration. r will return to the recent United States flag developments later, but the point I wish to make at this stage is that what is proposed in this Bill is in no way unusual. It already applies in many other countries is and has for many years. In many ways, it could be said that what is proposed in this Bill should have been included in the original Flags Act An 1953. Perhaps by some oversight it was the omitted. Indeed, when the second reading the Flags Bill was introduced by Prime Minister Menzies on 20 November 1953, the then Leader of the Opposition, Dr was the first speaker up when the the debate resumed on 2 December of that year. In concluding his speech, Dr Evatt's last sentence read: The Government should not be content with the passing of this legislation, but it should protect the flag in the same way that such countries as the United States of America protect their flags.",39
30,Mr CADMAN,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"Did Evatt say that? MrCOBB-Yes, Dr Evatt said that. The next speaker for the Opposition was none other than Mr Calwell, the person who eventually succeeded the leadership of the Labor Party from Dr Evatt. Mr Calwell supported the remarks I have quoted of Dr Evatt and said: The Americans will not permit their flag to be defaced. There seems to be little doubt that the Labor Party of 1953 would ·have given enthusiastic and strong support to what is proposed in this Bill today. I find that very heartening and hope that the Labor Party of today is of a like mind. I realise that there have been elements within the Labor Party who wish to change our flag by removing the Union Jack and the like but that is another, quite separate issuto that being considered in this Bill. On another point, a somewhat technical point, it would be appropriate at this time to clear up any. doubts that in any way arise in relation to the constitutional powers regarding whether what is called the nationhood power extends to coercive laws such as those laid out in this Bill. To explain what is meant here, most of us recognise that Commonwealth laws are enacted under specific powers enumerated in the Constitution. For example, section 51 (ii) relates to taxation,section 51 (ix) relates to quarantine, and so on. By this process, the power to protect the Australian Red Ensign would be covered by the foreign and interstate trade and commerce power, section 51 (i), and the external affairs power, section 51 (xxix). It follows that the power to protect the Australian White Ensign and the Royal Australian Air Force Ensign would be covered by the defence power, section 51(vi). However, the position is not so clear with. regard to the l\ustralian national flag, particularly when Imposing penalties to protect it against local demonstrations. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth has, apart from its specific and enumerated powers, certain implied powers that stem from its status as a national government. These arise from two provisions of the Constitution-section 61, the executive power, and section 51 (xxxix), the incidental power. These powers, when read together, are sometimes referred to as the nationhood powers. The Flags Act 1953 was listed under section 51 (xxxix) in the last constitutional table issued by the Attorney-General's Department-that is, the Commonwealth Acts 1968, page 1311, for those who want to look it up. Some doubt has been expressed in the . past whether the nationhood powers extend to making laws creating offences and imposing penalties-such as the remarks of Wilson, J. in the Commonwealth v. Tasmania (1983), 158 Commonwealth Law Reports, pages 203-4, better known as the Tasmanian dams case. However, in the recent case of Davis v. Commonwealth (1988) 63 Australian Law Journal Reports 35, which was about the Australian Bicentennial Authority Act 1980, the High Court held that the commemoration of the bicentenary is 'pre-eminently the business and th- concern of the Commonwealth as a national government' and as such falls fairly and squarely within the executive power set out in section 61 of the Constitution; and legislation establishing an authority for that purpose, and protecting the name of the authority by creating offences and imposing penalties, may be validly made .under section 51 (xxxix) of the Constitution. So by adopting this reasoning, the establishment of the Australian national flag is 'pre-eminently the business and the concern of the Commonwealth as a national government'. It follows that legislation protecting that flag by creating offences and imposing penalties may be validly made under section 51 (xxxix). It is worthwhile mentioning what prompted me to bring. this Bill before the Parliament. It stemmed from an unpleasant incident outside our Parliament House early in 1989 when some citizens who were demonstrating there burnt an Australian flag as part· of their protest. This rather lamentable action guaranteed them, in this era of television coverage, immediate nationwide coverage for their cause. I well remember trying to pacify one outraged telephone caller from my electorate who wa- upset at seeing our flag destroyed in this manner. I raised the matter with the Speaker as to what action would be taken as this incident had taken place on parliamentary precincts. Like many others, I was surprised to learn that no penalty exists for such actions. As a result, I introduced a private member's Bill into the Parliament to correct this deficiency. This Bill has the unanimous support of the coalition parties, having been approved at a joint party room meeting. Mr Aldred-Most decidedly so.",40
31,Mr COBB,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"I acknowledge the honourable member's comment on that point. I believe that all fair-minded members of the Australian Labor Party would support it too. If that is the case, I am sure that the overwhelming majority of the Australian population would be grateful to see this Bill eventually carried on a bipartisan basis. Our national flag deserves no less.",41
32,Mr LLOYD,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,We will actually find out how many are fair-minded.,41
33,Mr COBB,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"I guess we will. Most citizens would agree that our national symbol should not be able to be dishonoured with impunity, especially every time some unwashed demonstrator wants a cheap publicity shot. To so denigrate our flag offends the most basic sensibilities of us all. It amounts to blatant mockery of our traditions, our history, of what has gone before and what the flag stands for and symbolises both now and for the future. I well recognise that there are some who would argue that it is only a piece of cloth and that such penalties are inappropriate. While I have heard and understand this argument, I nevertheless believe it misses the point. Any penalty for desecration of our flag indicates that we care about the things for which it stands, since such penalties are not lightly put into law. The penalties will, of course, also discourage that very small minority who may at some time in the future carry out such acts. I make no apology for wanting to stop the increasing spectacle of people on television burning national flags. Admittedly, the flag means different things to different people. Some will not have thought much about what it stands}or. At the other end of the spectrum are soldiers who have fought under it and revere it most of all. Any dishonouring of it offends them deeply. I am pleased. to see the national flag being flown more and more often outside private homes in this country. Mr Aldred-It is seen quite a lot these days.",41
34,Mr COBB,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"It is being flown more often outside private homes, as it is in the United States of America. I am pleased to see that there is a tendency for it again to have a prominent role in daily ceremonies in our schools. We need to be proud and loyal to the many good things in this country, and that can best be expressed through the respect and love that we show for our flag. People often speak of the beauty of the flag. I have to admit that I never fully appreciated just how beautiful it was until the Bulletin ran a competition a few years ago to design a new Australian flag. It came home to me just how hard it is to design an acceptable new flag. Most countries simply have two or three colours drawn in straight lines across their flags; not many are distinctive in design. The United States and British flags are obvious exceptions. However, it is very hard-harder than one would first imagine-to design a good flag. Many entries in the competition in the Bulletin could do little better than come up with a variation of our present flag, many with just the Union Jack missing. In fact, I think that the winning entry was simply that, with a yellow stripe drawn along the bottom. Mr Aldred-That is worse.",41
35,Mr COBB,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"Indeed, it looked ridiculous. The competition Drought home to me just how special and beautiful our present flag is. Many of those who criticise our flag do not realise how it came into being. At the beginning of the century when the six colonies agreed to become one Commonwealth of Australia, a competition was held to find designs for two Australian flags-one for official and naval purposes and one for the Merchant Navy service. Such was the interest that more than 30,000 designs were submitted and five were selected as being of equal merit. The prize of £200, as it was then, was divided among the five winning entrants: Mrs A. Dorrington of Perth, Mr E. J. Nuttall of Melbourne, Mr Ivor Evans of Melbourne,· Mr Leslie Hawkins of Sydney and Mr W. Stevens, interestingly enough, of Auckland. In February 1903, it was announced in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette that King Edward VII had approved a design for the flag of Australia and also one for the flag of the Merchant Navy. Both designs were shown in colour plates in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. The flag, of course, is of exactly stipustitutional lated proportion and description. For example, its length should be twice its the Union Jack should occupy the upper left hand quarter, also known as the first quarter or canton or upper hoist; the single star in the quarter below the Union Jack has seven points-one each for the six States and one for the two Territories-and the four main stars of the Southern Cross each have seven points, and so on. Of course, the Southern Cross is best observed in the Southern Hemisphere. In addition, there are strict guidelines for flying the flag and observing the dignity of the flag. I quote but one: how often do we as members of parliament attend functions in town halls or elsewhere in our electorates and see the flag displayed the wrong way around, with the Union Jack in the top right hand corner instead of the top left hand corner? I think that that is a common occurrence. I always explain the basic protocol of displaying our flag, as well as the traditions, when I present flags to schools so that our children can better appreciate our flag. I believe that if people understand some of these things they appreciate our flag all the more. Many honourable members will have seen recent media reports relating to the United States and the difficulties that authorities there have experienced in applying penalties to those who have burnt the flag. As I mentioned earlier, both federally and with many of the individual states, laws have existed for many years making such behaviour an offence. However, United States law differs from Australian law in that the United States has a Bill of Rights, so to speak, which grants citizens certain rights. Our law is based on British common law which allows us to do anything except that which is prohibited by law. In the United States, the first amendment of the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech. When challenged in the Supreme Court, a 5 : 4 decision ruled that a federal law prohibiting burning or mutilating the United States flag was unconas it contradicted the first amendment. Naturally, fierce debate has width; raged over this decision, including amongst the vast majority who believe protesters can still freely protest and express dissent without having to outweigh the overall societal interest in destroying the symbolic value of the flag. Without going into the legal details surrounding this debate, I can tell the House that it appears that a proposal may have to be submitted to change the Constitution. This involves a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress and ratification by three-quarters-38-of the States. The President and the courts have no role in this process, even though the President is strongly in favour of the change. Although the United States Constitution has been changed 26 times since its inception in 1787, 10 of those changes came all at once when the first Congress submitted the Bill of Rights in George Washington's time. However, the Bill of Rights has never been changed, so if this change goes through it will be the first time the critical first amendment will itself have been altered to modify the freedom of expression that it has guaranteed. Obviously, that is not something to be undertaken lightly. Nevertheless, it appears that there is a good chance of this happening, so highly is the symbolism of the flag regarded in the United States. We will all watch the developments over there with interest. In conclusion, I submit this Bill to cor- society rect what would appear to be an oversight in our laws. I believe, from the response I have had, that it has overwhelming support in the community, and I hope that it has bipartisan support in this chamber. Our extraordinarily beautiful flag, of which we are all so proud, which is already rich in history and which is so dear to so many of us, deserves no less. I ask for the unanimous support of all members in the chamber for this Bill.",41
36,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,Mr Cowan)Is the motion seconded?,43
37,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,43
38,Mr WRIGHT,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"1 fully understand and appreciate the concern expressed by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). I think that most people who listened to his contribution will understand his attitude, which is, I suggest, in line with the views of the majority of Australians. The debate is not really about the honourable member's proposal that we should not desecrate or dishonour the Australian flag. Ultimately it might come down to the question of whether the penalties and punishments suggested by the honourable member are fitting for the crime. I find it distasteful and abhorrent that anyone in a public place or elsewhere would destroy my flag-my country's flag-and that is the view held by many people. This is not a new debate. Those who have monitored the situation in the United States of America will know that over some 20 years various States have repeatedly brought in laws seeking to prohibit flag desecration. In every instance, despite measures taken at the highest level of the parliamentary structure, the courts have overruled them, using the first amendment. When I was asked to speak in the debate, I went back to the 5 : 4 High Court decision which found: If there is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment-it is that the Government may notI stress the words 'may not'prohibit the expression of an idea simply because finds the idea itself offensive and disagreeable. I suggest that that ruling virtually makes it lawful for an American citizen to desecrate the United States flag as part of that person's freedom of expression. I do not agree with that, but it has happened. There are two sides to the story. Let us realise also that this Parliament, on behalf of its people, has already stated its position on defacement of our flag. The Department of Administrative Services has produced a document for schools and community groups. On page 11, under the section on defacement, it states: A flag is said to be 'defaced' when a 'badge of office' or any other object is superimposed upon an authorised flag. Convention is not to deface the Australian National Flag. We accept the position espoused by the honourable member for Parkes, but it is not legislated for, nor is the action punishable. The Government, Parliament and the people through Parliament make clear their attitude. Referring to the dignity of the flag, the guidelines state: The Australian National Flag should be displayed only in a manner befitting the national emblem; it should not be subjected to indignity or displayed in a position inferior to any other flag or ensign. The Flag normally takes precedence over all other national flags when flown in Australia. It should always be flown aloft and free and should not be allowed to fall or lie upon the ground. The Australian National Flag should not be used as a covering of a statue, monument or plaque for an unveiling ceremony (a plain cover should be used); as a table or seat cover; or as a masking for boxes, barriers or intervening space between floor and ground level on a dais or platform. We have some rules, but they work by convention. Should we have on our statute books the specific provision suggested by the honourable member for Parkes? Should we not only move from convention to a legal position but also bring punitive measures? I suggest to the honourable member people would agree with him, but I do not believe that they would necessarily agree with the penalties that he is putting forward. He argues that where a flag is dishonoured-I stress the word 'dishoncus oured', not 'desecrated' and we might come back to interpretation-the penalty shall be $5,000, but the honourable membefore ber would go on to impose a period of two years imprisonment. I can underthat stand his wanting to make this a severe penalty, but I would put it to him that recent times and in the past been many corporate criminals throughout this nation who have got away with taking shareholders' money worth milflag. lions of dollars who have never faced prison and still walk the streets today. Although I totally agree that we need to proceed through this issue and come with stronger law, and enforced law, personally do not believe that we should be saying that if someone dishonours flag that person should face a penalty of $5,000 and could go to prison for two lians years. Under the guidelines already there is talk about misuse by the commercial enterprise areas. Is the flag dishonoured it is used as a tablecloth? Is it dishoncountry, Ollred when a person wears the flag as T - shirt, or by sitting upon it? That is we say, and we have said it for some decades-we do' not believe these praccently-Britain, tices are right; we believe that they give due dignity to the Australian flag. The view is that the flag is being dishonoured. However, if the argument is taken further to the position adopted by the honourable member for Parkes, one would have to ask whether the people who ·sit on flags or use them as tablecloths face an automatic penalty of $5,000 or go to prison. I do not think the honourable member would want that.",43
39,Mr COBB,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,I took pains to stress that that was a maximum.,44
40,Mr WRIGHT,VERY FAST TRAIN PROPOSAL,"I take that point. I beflag. lieve that this issue should not be left idle or put in a pigeonhole. I would think many honourable members would like to any dishonouring. .' in see something done, but how do we go about it? I give an undertaking as an in that dividual private member on the Government benches that I will take this matter back to the relevant Caucus committees. We have not dealt with it; indeed, we have not had the opportunity in the Caucommittees on which I serve to go through this issue. It has not been through the legal and administrative committee or any of the relevant committees. I think it should be considered. I suggest it should be treated apolitically and that we do not divide on the issue. We in . need to consider what is the best way of there have handling this issue. We should consider what definition to impose if there is any dishonouring of the Spould we tighten up on the commercial misuse and abuse of our flag? We should - onsider whether it is improper to use the flag as a tablecloth or beach towel. up Recently I saw some young people who I had an Australian flag as a beach towel; obviously the flag was printed on the the towel. To my mind, that is not a bad thing .. I think it is good that we asAustrarecognise our flag. In fact, I wish we would do so more often. In the opportunities I have had to travel I have been if surprised and pleased that in country after whether countries of the left or a of the right, people proudly display their what national flags. In Canada, the United four States, Mexico; Cuba-where I was reTaiwan, Korea and China do not one sees national flags flying. I suspect that in this country people do not know enough about their flag. If children in schools are asked to describe the Australian flag or the Queerisland flag or Western Australianflag or any other State flag, they db not know the answer. Perhaps this is an exercise we should conduct as a parliament, and that is to pick up what has happened in part in the use of flags, and the giving. of flags, which has been made more liberal in recent times, and encourage our own people to fly our If we can get people to honour the flag by proudly displaying it and flying it, that I believe that we will move away from I reiterate that I believe the issue should be taken further. I support the principle put forward by the honourable member for Parkes.

42,Mr CONNOLLY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Bradfield) (12.00)The 1990-91 Budget was the last chance for this very tired and dispirited Government, which has clearly lost direction and the will to lead. Once again, Australians have been denied any obvious leadership or forward thinking, which at this time is exactly what this nation must have as .this is one of the most critical times in Australia's economic and social history. Let us consider the realities of the past eight years. In 1982-83 the current account deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product (GOP) was 3.9 per cent. In 1989-90 it had risen to 5.5 per cent. The small overdraft rate has risen from 14 per cent to 22 percenLThe tax burden as a percentage of GOP has increased from 24 per cent to 25 per cent. Unit labour cost has gone from 4 per cent to 7.9 per cent. Gross for-ign debt as apercentage of GOP has risen from $35.9 billion or 21 per cent to $156 billion or 42.8 per cent. The percentage of weekly income to support a mortgage has risen from 19.2 per cent to 36 per cent. The people·of Australia in all walks of life are suffering more today than they have at any time since the worse days of the Great Oepression-a time our grandparents still remember to this day. Despite all that has happened, this Government believes that Australians are so stupid that they are unable to understand or appreciate the enormity of the situation currently facing themselves, their families and our country. This has all come about as a result of the fact that in the past eight years this Government has fundamentally managed its affairs on the principle of dividing society. It has done so by pandering to minorities, by exercising power with the elites whether they be big business, big unions and certainly big government, and by ignoring the genuine hopes and aspirations of the Australian people. The outcome of all this in 1990 is a society wracked by despair, despondency and doubt, with no sense of direction and a pervading atmosphere of pessimism stalks our land. Much of this frustration is directed at members of this Parliament, members on all sides, because people thought that they were elected to guide and safeguard the destiny of this nation. The 1989 Clemenger report entitled The Silent Majority documented widespread concern about the integrity and motivation of the elected representatives of the Australian people. In addition, people believe that politicians never keep their word, that they are more concerned about their re-election than about running the country, and that political advertising is largely untruthfuL People's perception is based on what they see and read as demonstrated through the policies of the government of the day. That this trend has become so obvious since 1988 can be put only at the feet of the present Government. It has caused this crisis of confidence, but it is doing absolutely nothing about it. Therefore, it will be the responsibility of the Opposition parties once again to return to the Australian people some sense of balance, hope and direction about the long-term destiny of our nation. A total of 60 per cent of Australians see politicians as being more interested in re-election than in governing and, naturally, they are extremely concerned about that attitude. In the 1990 Mackay report it was clearly indicated that Australians hold their politicians in declining esteem and feel rising despair concerning the state of politics in this, their country. The study confirmed that Australians dream of a truer democracy and, particularly, more visionary leadership. The fundamental question must be answered: Why do Australians feel this way? I suggest it is because, in a very real sense, they see their lives and those of their families being it to them. affected day by day. They see their standard of living falling and, what is worse, they see no immediate solution to these problems. The current Government's reliance on tight monetary policy, with ensuing high interest rates, is extinguishing business at a rapid rate. The New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission estimates that this year there will be 55,000 business failures, compared with 35,000 last year and 20,060 in 1988. It is not surprising, that this country in the malaise that' it is in when one considers the following obstacles to business enterprise: Australia has an inflation rate double the rate of our major trading partners; record real business interest keep the Australian dollar artificially high-the current situation in the Gulf is making it even higher; a rigid wage fixing system keeps nominal wage 'labour cost growth twice as high as our trading competitors, and puts an unacceptably high floor under the inflation rate; and the industrial relations system and the rigid union structure thwarts innovation and productivity improvements, and drives a wedge between the employers and the employees. Putting it quite simply, it removes the capacity of individual Australians to do their best, to work to the maximum extent that they wish, to maximise their productivity, to bring home a decent wage for their families and to see in the future some opportunity for themselves and for their children. Above all, we see massive costs imposed by inefficiencies on the waterfront, in coastal shipping, domestic aviation, telecommunications and various public utilities. We wait for months, and we wait in vain, for the Government to take real action in these fundamental areas of micro-economic reform. So much has been said, but so pitifully little has been done. No wonder Australians are disappointed with this Government, disappointed with Parliament, disappointed with politicians, disappointed with their system of government and want a change. They want a change for the better. They deserve that change, and it is our responsibility to give An article in today's Bulletin states: Traditionally, some 8 per cent of the electorate casts a primary vote for other than the major parties federally. On March 24, 17.6 per cent dumped the big parties in disgust. Quite simply, they did not vote for us because they were not satisfied with what was offered. This Government was elected on the platform of consensus. For the last eight years, that much maligned word has been used to draw a blanket across the is capacity of the Australian people to participate in addressing the major issues of our time. Consensus was used as an opiate to make people think that to disagree with the Government was somehow rates un-Australian. Certainly the Hawke Government went out of its way to say so to those who had the temerity, throughout that period, to say, 'Wait. Look. Listen. Think about what you are doing. Is it in Australia's interests?'. The real decisions which have influenced the lives of everybody have been made by the Australian Labor Party and its mates-whether they be in the AustralianCouncil of Trade Unions, leaders of business, or members of Federal or State bureaucracies. They all share the responsibility because leadership is not just something that emanates from the Prime Minister of the day; it is something that must be shared by all those who have power, by all those who have responsibility, and by all those who must share the responsibility of making the right decisions in 'the interests of the Australian people. Is it any wonder that up to 70 per cent of the Australian people now actively question the very institutions of the State? In conclusion, it is for this reason that the Opposition and the Liberal Party have announced the program Australia 2000. It is directed primarily at giving the Australian people the opportunity they have been denied for so long-to participate in the direction of policy for the future as we proceed to the new millennia. Australia must change direction, we must rebuild, and we must regain the hearts and minds of the Australian people. Let us identify the problems together, let us discuss the solutions, and together build a greater Australia.",45

44,Mrs JAKOBSEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It is a great pleasure to be here today, even though this is a grievance debate. I have just drawn your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the fact that the housing committee of the Swedish Parliament is in the gallery. I wanted to mention that because I intend to speak on housing today. I have had the pleasure of having a very short meeting with the members of that delegation.",47
45,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Order! I interrupt the honourable member to say how pleased the House is to have present members of this committee of the Swedish Parliament. They are most welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",47
46,Mrs JAKOBSEN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"It was interesting that we happened to talk to the Swedish housing committee today. As honourable members know, the Government abolished in the Budget a fairly long standing housing assistance scheme; that is, the home owners scheme (FHOS). I am sure that many other members of this House have had occasion to be' grateful, on behalf of constituents in their electorate, the assistance provided to new home owners by that scheme. I regret its passing whilst acknowledging that it had become increasingly difficult for people to access and therefore it is increasingly irrelevant in the context of first home owner assistance in our country. I think it is most important that we have a pro-active policy on housing in the Government. I am very pleased that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) has announced the national housing strategy, which is to be headed by Dr Meredith Edwards. That is the only way that we will be able to ascertain how best the Federal Government can assist, through cooperation, coordination and funding, the people of Australia to obtain appropriate and affordable housing. This is a basic right of any person in a country such as ours. It also is a basic plank of social justice-which again is a policy that the Government has supported strongly throughout the period of its governing. The development of mortgage assistance schemes in the Stat- government sphere has also rendered the first home owners scheme less important than it was when it first began. I am pleased to note that the Federal Government has made a substantial allocation to the State governments to assist them with their mortgage repayment schemes, albeit not as large an amount as was originally incorporated in the FHOS budget. I know the scheme in Western Australia is very good and has excellent take-up rates but a lot of people still do not know of its existence and are not aware that they can access it. I urge people who are having difficulties with home payments-although presumably their numbers would be decreasing rather than increasing with interest rates coming down-to talk to their Federal or State member of parliament to find out how they access that home loan mortgage scheme assistance. It is not surprising in the light of the first developments that I have mentioned that the Federal Government has decided to wind down the first home owners scheme. I would also advise people that if they for took out a contract before 21 August, the Budget night, and were committed to a home, they will still be eligible to apply for first home owners assistance as long as they get their application in before 30 June next year. Often people do not realise when a scheme is wound down or abolished that there is a period during which they may still be eligible to get the assistance that was previously offered. It is also important that Australians who are currently in receipt of assistance under the first home owners scheme are aware that the scheme will continue for them. So it is a gradual reduction in funding rather than a complete cut-off of funding in that area. Many honourable members will remember the social security review that the then Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), presided over and in which Dr Bettina Cass was very involved. The strategy for the national housing study is to have the same type of review in that there will be periodic reports on housing over the next three years. The Government will be in a position to respond on a gradual basis to those reports so that it will not be three years before anything can be done about housing difficulties in Australia. Whilst we may want to look at Commonwealth, local government and State coordination in these matters, we can still learn from other people around the world. I want to make the point that the Scandinavian countries have excellent housing schemes. I thank the members of the housing committe.e from Sweden for their information today. The Scandinavian countries are obviously having difficulties in sustaining their interest rate underwrite for housing because of the level of interest rates in those countries and the subsidisation by government of the difference between the 6 per cent guaranteed interest rate and the 15 per cent market rate. Countries such as Sweden have an excellent record of providing appropriate housing assistance for their communities and l think Australia can learn from the things that they have done. We could learn also from what has been done in that country with respect to putting a ceiling or some form of control on land prices before granting eligibility for the guaranteed interest rate - levels. In Sweden local government controls a lot of the land available for housing. That makes a difference to the cost of the land to the individual and therefore the cost to the community as a whole. In our country, as honourable members would be aware, much of our land development is done on a private basis. As a consequence, a profit factor is built in. In this country we also have a problem with land provision. Often land is not available in outer urban areas where people· want to build. We have also to look very carefully at the role of more medium density housing in the suburban areas, repopulating, if you like, the inner suburban areas. I know that the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) has a particular interest in this area because he lives in a fairly high density area of Sydney. Obviously with Sydney land prices being the way they are, people want to make the most of every acre of land. In my area of Cowan, which is in the outer suburbs of Perth in Western Australia, we have a slightly different problem and that is that builders have been going in for broad acre development and knocking down all the trees. They are now just starting to rethink matters relating to the urban environment. I think this is a very important time for the Federal Government to be taking up the cudgels and undertaking a proper study of the housing needs of all Australians. With the Social Security review reports to look back on, I know that we can look forward to Dr Meredith Edwards's reports from the national housing strategy producing conclusions which are of direct and meaningful benefit to all Australians.",47
47,Mr ANDREW,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Wakefield) (12.19)Our legal heritage, cultural background and the fabric of our whole society is built on the premise that we are as people innocent until we are proven guilty. It is this basic premise that gives some sense of dignity to human life; gives everyone a sense of personal value and well-being, because we know that society will not presume to pass judgment on us. The fundamental sense of self-worth that any individual has is built on the premise that people will not devalue us unless by our actions we show that we deserve to be devalued. I put it to you, sir, that the premise of being innocent until proven guilty is the foundation of our individual integrity, but I also say to. you that this building block of our proud legal tradition and heritage is being eroded. It is not being eroded by some avowed subversive group; it is not being eroded by group of identifiable political activists; it is being eroded by the Australian Taxation Office. In the eyes of the Commissioner of Taxtralians. ation it seems that all Australians are guilty until they can prove their innoand cence. Let us consider for a moment, sir, the sorts of advertisements from the Tax fice that appear on the television screen. The advertisements invariably imply that we will comply with what the Tax Office says or pay up at top rates regardless our circumstances. My home-I suspect in common with every other home across the nation-got a friendly letter from the tax man. I was asked to declare all interand est bearing deposits and accounts thilt held at a bank in my name or in joint names with my wife and to register my tax number with the bank. That was all quite satisfactory. But what I was indiginterests nant about, what prompted me to stand here, was the implication from the tax man that if I failed to do so, it would be presumed that all interest generated ought to be charged tax at the top rate. I was deemed to be guilty before I had any chance to prove my innocence. , The tax man is quite fond of rubbing little salt into the taxpayer's wound. Any back taxes lowe, I will be obliged to pay and, presuming there are no other penaldenies ties, the taxes owed will incur an interest rate of 20 per cent. Any errors I make in submission that mean that he owes me tax will be refunds earning an interest rate of only 14 per cent. This week's Budget once again sharply focuses the presumpsumed tion of the Tax Office that Australians guilty as taxpayers until they can prove their innocence. Mr Deputy Speaker, with an electorate like yours you will understand, as I unstantiate derstand with an electorate like mine, implications of the treatment of rural Australians by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in this week's Budget. Once again the Government has continued with its obsmoney ession about the assets test. It implies all rufal Australians who have acquired an asset-not inherited one; in most instances people have engaged in difficult and demanding work to acquire their as a sets-are guilty for having done so and are no longer eligible for the sorts of benefits that are made available to other AusGuilty because they have an asset! Guilty, regardless of their circumstance their income earning capacity! That is the point that irritates me. When the Treasurer stood at the disOfpatch box and handed down the Budget he said that any Australian with an asset in excess of $200,000-1 think farmers and small businessmen could have an asof set with a value 50 per cent greater-will no longer be eligible for the Austudy allowance. If someone has an asset of $300,000, he will then be seen as guilty no longer eligible for the family alI lowance. No-one will ask about the circumstance of that family or its cash income. No-one will ask how many children they happen to have reared in the of the nation. No; they are seen to be guilty because they have an asset in excess of $300,000. Therefore they are denied the privileges other Australians can take. No-one will ask about their standard of living. No-one will ask whether they are caught in a poverty trap or whether there has been a seasonal downturn. No; a they are presumed guilty without any chance to prove their innocence. It is not a question of entitlement. The assets test them the right to have their children educated in a tertiary institution. Pensioners could well have the same cry. Pensipners have been seen as guilty of hoarding money, putting it under beds. So now all money over $2,000 is preto earn more than 10 per cent: are guilty, with no chance to prove their innocence. You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, as I am, of the instances of constituents who have been obliged to subwhat they have spent in order to the claim a tax deduction. Having come to me with substantiation and having gone to the tax man with receipts that show that they have spent on various causes that would otherwise be tax dethat ductable, what does the Tax Commissioner say? 'No, the yellow Bankcard slip is not sufficient substantiation. How do we know that that receipt for the particular expenditure ensures that the goods on that receipt were used on that particular project?'. They are presumed guilty before they have had a chance to prove their innocence, instead of being presumed innocent, with somebody having to prove them guilty. This situation does not apply only to individuals. Sporting clubs are now obliged to pay tax on their accounts. Not all of them have to do this, but everyone of them is made to feel guilty. Whether it is a sporting club for recreational activity or a club for bowlers. or retired persons, the club is presumed guilty until it can prove its innocence. There is a great deal of uncertainty about the tax Act. Many of the problems that my constituents face they face simply because there are so many tax decisions that are anything but black and white. They are not intentionally trying to evade tax but they are presumed by the Treasurer and by the Tax Office to be guilty, with no chance to prove their innocence. Why is there so much uncertainty about the tax Act? While this Government has been in power the tax Act has expanded by 1,600 pages-l,600 pages of additional legislation. Even accountants are confused. If accountants are confused, it is no wonder individuals do not know what is going on in the tax area. These are not people intentionally setting out to defraud the Government; these are people caught in a web of confused tax legislation. I am indignant that, in spite of the fact that the Government has produced additional tax raising revenues, which has compounded the confusion, the people are presumed to be not innocent but guilty. While the Australian Labor Party has been in power the tax take has gone from $23 billion in 1983 to $53 billion in 1990-an average annual increase of 16 per cent. We all accept the responsibility we have to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, but every dollar I render to Caesar is a dollar for which I am no longer directly accountable-a dollar the expenditure of which I no longer have authority over.",48

49,Mr ELLIOTI,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Parramatta) (12.29)May I say first of all that it is a little difficult to treat with credibility the arguments of the Opposition when it comes to taxation policy. During the time of the last Liberal-National Party Government, as has been well documented in this Parliament, the greatest growth industry was the tax avoidance and evasion industry. So I think the sorts of soundings we have just heard are a little hollow. The issue I want to raise in the grievance debate today is one that has great significance for many people that live in my electorate and the adjoining parts of the western suburbs of Sydney. It relates to the very significant urban flood problems we have experienced there, not only this year but in the last two or three years. A number of those issues are very relevant to this Parliament and deal with some of the matters that were discussed in the Budget Papers that were presented on Tuesday evening. I start by saying that not only my electorate but many other parts of New South Wales and Queensland have been bedevilled by floods that have brought great tragedy and despair to communities right through those regions. In my electorate of Parramatta we have had very substantial flood problems. They probably do not get the sort of exposure that the vast rural areas get when the flood waters take days to reach the rural communities. Ours are much more spur of the moment flash flood types of problems-localised urban flooding-but the solutions are equally difficult to achieve. The Government, in conjunction with the States and local government, has been working towards remedies to those problems. Significant work has been done, but much remains to be done. My predecessor as member for Parramatta during his time here worked to ensure that the tragic flood losses that had been suffered in his early years as member were remedied. Indeed, he was telling me only the other night that in his early days in this Parliament about 11 people had lost their lives in floods around the Toongabbie Creek area. Following a number of those tragedies the Federal Government, in conjunction with the States, commissioned the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation to report on ways of overcoming the flood problems. That report identified a series of flood mitigation measures that were needed and indicated the work that was necessary to overcome the problems. Work has proceeded on those arrangements, but with urban development a'nd the spread of the urban areas of Sydney, increased catchment and run-off problems, probably inadequate planning in many cases in terms of how that urban development was allowed to occur, and, equally, with the climatic and meteorological data that have become available, the difficulties of dealing with those urban flood issues are even more pronounced than they were a decade ago. With that in mind, it is worth noting that in the last couple of years a special trust has been established to deal with the catchment area of the Parramatta Riverwhich starts in adjoining electorates and finishes up in my electorate-and to try to alleviate the flood problems. I am sure it would be of interest to many people listening to know that that represented probably one of the first coordinated efforts at flood catchment management policy in urban areas. Certainly it was unique in New South Wales in an urban context. It is well established that a piecemeal approach in dealing with our flood problems is no longer acceptable. For instance, about 400 homes were flooded in the local area in the 1986 flood, about 280 homes were flooded in the 1988 flood, and in the one that occurred a week ago 140 properties were severely affected. All those things highlight the urgent need for the flood problem that is bedevilling our area to be dealt with. I am very pleased to say that my colleagues from electorates in western Sydney entirely endorse the need to take urgent steps to deal effectively with these issues, and tangible action is being taken in this regard. It is worth noting that the Budget on Tuesday evening provided an allocation of some $5m for flood plain management in New South Wales, which is an increase of about 20 per cent. I would argue that there is a dramatic need for more works and more funding to be provided as soon as possible. However, with the very severe budgetary strictures that have been applied this year and in recent years in order to rebuild the economy, that is still a substantial achievement and one from which I am sure we will see benefits develop to overcome these problems. There are some issues that are of concern in dealing with the flood problem. One of the first of these which I particularly wanted to highlight was the excellent work of the local State Emergency Services. (SES), the voluntary organisation, which has done so much of the relief work. At all hours of the day and night its members are prepared to risk life and limb to help in evacuation of people, pro. vide emergency support and relief as needed, and to be at the beck and call of all those people, particularly the elderly, who might be in distress. The local SES in my electorate, under the control of Mr Alex Otis, has done a magnificent job under very trying circumstances in those recent floods. Our local State Emergency Services people are in temporary accommodation at the rear of the Parramatta Gaol. In conjunction with colleagues in the local area and with local government I have been trying to ensure that they can have a permanent home established on redundant land from the compound of the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services. It is very disappointing to note that to date we have been totally unsuccessful in having the State Government recognise the worth of our State Emergency Services headquarters and to provide it with a long terril commitment to enable that facility to be properly developed and expanded as the need exists. Given that the SES has had to cope with four or five severe emergencies in the last five years, the continuing delays that are occurring under the State Minister for Corrective Services, Mr Yabsley, are totally unacceptable to the local community. I urge people from the local community to take an interest in that area and to continue to lobby Mr Yabsley very strenuously to call for a reversal of the State Government's negative approach on this question. The local voluntary SES deserves better than it is getting under these present arrangements. It is clearly unacceptable to have people who are providing emergency flood relief arrangements. virtually operating out of a flood-bound property, which is what they are being asked to do at the moment because of the inaction and inactivity of the New South Wales State Government. It is just as important to note that the local council has been seeking restoration funding from the State Government under the normal arrangements that apply for these emergency works. I am referring to public assets that have been damaged and so forth. I was informed just recently that the request and application from the local council to have public asset reconstruction moneys provided is about 18 months old at this stage and there is still no effective answer from the State Government. In other words, restoration funding has not been provided by the State Government for flooding that occurred in. early 1989. That does not take account of the fact that there have been three significant floods since that time. There is still assets repair work needed in areas such as Parramatta Park. These works are being delayed. They are unable to be completed because the State Government has been unable to provide an acceptable answer on the provision of funding for this emergency work. Having said those things, I can say that there is a lot of effort being put into the flood mitigation works by all levels of government, including the Federal Government. It is important that that support, particularly the voluntary effort of the community, be recognised in a positive way by the State Government in terms of the provision of the services that I have alluded to, particularly a new permanent home for the State Emergency Services' operation in the electorate of Parramatta.",50
50,Dr BOB WOODS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"1 want to draw to the attention of the House today a matter concerning the drug erythropoietin. I might explain to honourable members that erythropoietin is a hormone which every single human being who is in good health produces. Its function basically is to make blood and, if a person does not have enough erythropoietin, that person does not produce enough blood and can become very anaemic. This particular hormone is made by the kidney. One of the problems is that a patient in kidney failure does not make enough erythropoietin and enough blood. One of the major problems with patients with chronic renal failure is their anaemia. They become grossly anaemic. Because of that they become lethargic; they face other problems including heart failure and respiratory problems; they face admission into hospital and transfusions. Fortunately, however, erythropoietin is now available in a synthetic form. This has been available for a few years in pretty well every civilised country in the world with one exception, Australia, in which it is available under very restricted conditions. In many ways this is as close as we will ever get to a wonder drug. People who have a blood count of around, say, 6 public grams per cent-which is very common for patients with renal failure, the normal being around 14 or 15 grams per centwho take this drug suddenly find that their blood count shoots up. This means that they feel like new people. They are able to go back to work; they are able to participate in society; they do not need to go into hospital for the complications or for blood transfusions. Unfortunately, erythropoietin is not freely available in Australia. It is still undergoing the evaluation procedure. It is available on what is known as an IPU, an individual patient usage; so if a person can afford the drug that person can get government approval to have the drug. So clearly the Government does not think there is a problem with the drug itself; it just does not want to pay the money. Indeed, it is an expensive drug; it costs around $1,000 a month. The number of patients we are looking at with chronic renal failure in Australia is around 2,000, perhaps 2,500. These are the patients who are on the whole on renal dialysis. Clearly it is an expensive drug and clearly there is a cost involved. But what the Government is not doing is looking at the whole equation because, although it would be a cost to the budget of the Minister for Aged, Family arid Health Services (Mr Staples) in terms of the $10,000 or so per year per patient, it does in fact save money overall because it gets those patients off the dole, off sickerythropoietin ness benefits and off other social security payments. It gets them back to work so that in many cases they would be paying taxes. It gets rid of a large majority of the cost of hospitalisation of patients. It removes the problems and expenses of blood transfusions. Almost every assessment that has ever been made of the cost effectiveness of erythropoietin shows that overall it would actually save the Government money. Some of that saving would not be from the budget of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services; it may be from other government budgets. But even if there were no saving, what about the human cost? I have, for example, in my electorate a young lady, 34 years old, who has been a renal failure patient for about five years. She has a young daughter Who is now eight years old. For four years she required daily peritoneal dialysis; she had to be housebound; she was attached for 24 hours a day to a bag coming out of her abdomen, with a tube going inside her abdomen; she was not allowed outdoor swimming activities. She is aware, of course, that her condition is potentially fatal. Several friends from the hospital with the same condition and in the same situation have in fact died. Her doctors have told her not-to plan for old age. Until three months ago, because of the side effects of the anaemia, she could not work. She was sick, she was tired, she could not play with her daughter, she could not even walk her daughter to school. She was often rushed to hospital. Indeed, last November she was admitted to hospital for a couple of months because she had heart failure because of the strain from the anaemia. She developed peritonitis and pneumonia; she had to have blood transfusions. Her daughter and her family and, indeed, her doctors thought she was going to die then. She has a very simple ambition. She just wants to see her daughter grow up. When I first met her a year or so ago she was pale, lifeless, lethargic. In June this year we managed to get her started on on a clinical trial basis. She has been able to take it for the last three months. Since she has been on the drug, which she takes three days a week, there has been a miraculous change in the way she feels. She is no longer lethargic. She has had a burst of life. She says that it has been like being given a new set of wheels. Her haemoglobin has soared from around 6 grams per cent to 11 grams in the space of three months. In fact, she now works as a 'pink lady', as a voluntary helper in the hospital in which she is usually treated. She is giving back to the community some of her own time in gratitude. She wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in july last year appealing for erythropoietin to be made available, not just for herself but for the other 2,000 or so patients, and has not even had the courtesy of a reply. I point out that the initial application for erythropoietin to be approved in Australia was made in January 1988. As I mentioned earlier, pretty well every civilised Western country in the world has approved the drug and clearly the Government has no concerns about its safety or efficacy; otherwise it would not allow it by the IPU procedure. The basic message from the Government is, 'You can have the drug if you can afford it. If you happen to be poor and cannot afford it, then it is just tough. You have to face all the problems of the lifestyle but more importantly the problems of potential death and potential complications' . It is another example of some of the problems facing the pharmaceutical industry. Unfortunately we have a number of these problems which are, to a certain extent, being looked at under the Therapeutic Goods Act. I almost said they were being addressed but in fact they are not being addressed and that is the problem. There are a whole range of problems about getting new drugs into Australia and they relate not to the new fees which are being imposed but to the bureaucracy associated with those fees. Erythropoietin is an example in which the application went in in January 1988. I have lots of examples of drugs which are freely available in a number of countries overseas and which indeed are very useful overseas, which are just held up in the grinding delays in the bureaucracy in Australia. This Government really has to fix this problem. Charging fees will not help. The system of bureaucracy has to be changed-it is worse in Australia than pretty well anywhere else in the Western world-so that we can get access to. these drugs at an early stage in their development. In the short term it saves money not to allow these drugs in because, by and large, being new they are expensive, but that is a short term view. In the long term, the most important thing that we have to look at is the health of individuals and the health of our scientific community, which is no Jonger in the forefront of the investigation of many of these drugs. We also have to look at the price in terms of industry development. The pharmaceutical industry in Australia is running up against a brick wall, partly because of this bureaucracy; indeed, largely because of this bureaucracy. I think in this case the situation is clear on humanitarian, economic and common sense grounds. The Minister should make a one-off grant to cover the availability of erythropoietin until the reaucracy has finished its evaluation process. There is no question about its safety. It will benefit some 2,500 people. The overall cost to the Government will be nil. I also just associate with this particular problem a couple of other very similar problems which I believe are very important and another example of the bureaucracy grinding things to a halt. They relate to a couple of patients who have been in the media recently. One is a three year old girl, Lauren Sutherland. Lauren has a birthmark on her leg which is getting infeCted, bleeds, and is causing scarring, and for which she is obliged to take steroids. She is only three years old and yet is facing all those problems. In a nutshell, she can be treated with laser therapy, but it is not available under Medicare as it stands. Her parents, who are not well off, are faced with a bill of $3,000 or $4,000 and they just cannot afford it. The Government should allow laser therapy to be used in this case. However, the Government says that laser therapy should be used only when the problem-the birthmark, as in Lauren's case-is on the face or the neck. The fact that this birthmark extends from her thigh right to her ankle does not come into the question as far as the Government is concerned. Another case which has been in the media very recently is that of young Holly Johnson. Honourable members may recall that Holly is the young girl who caught the acquired immune deficiency syndrome from her mother who, in turn, allegedly caught it from a blood transfusion. It seems to me there would not be a single person in the whole country who does not believe that some compensation should be paid to Holly, to look after this poor young girl. Only the Government seems to disagree. It is tied up in a bureaucratic mess again. It is another example of bureaucratic' and ministerial bungling and indecision. We cannot allow very that sort of bungling and indecision to ruin these young lives. The Minister responsible should act, and he should act now, to make sure that bu- these three cases, and a number of other similar cases, are resolved. The overriding question here should be humanitarian and there should be an example of compassion shown by the Government which, at this stage, has shown very little indeed.",52
51,Mr LAVARCH,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the State Premiers will meet in Brisbane next October to begin a process which will hopefully address the most fundamental issue of structural reform-the way in which government itself operates within Australia. The aim is to tackle the issues of waste and duplication, the absence of uniformity in the provision of services, and the division of responsibility between the three levels of government. It is appropriate that the special Premiers Conference should be held in Brisbane as south-east Queensland is the location of an appalling example of a major disaster about to happen with no area of government apparently willing or able to act. As a result, Brisbane runs the risk of gaining its own 'western Sydney' where an urban sprawl develops with grossly inadequate infrastructure, poor support services and limited job opportunities. ' The story begins in 1949 with the decision of a company, then called Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd (APM), to establish a pulp mill in south-east Queensland. To supply the mill, the company acquired vast holdings of both freehold and crown leasehold land for the purpose of planting pine forests. Brisbane during the 1950s was, quite literally, a large country town. The areas where the pine plantations were established-from Petrie in the south to Noosa in the north-were between 25 and 150 kilometres from Brisbane and light years away from ever coming under pressure for residential use, or so it seemed at the time. The company acquired more land over the next 30 years so, by the time the last lots were acquired in 1982, it held some 18,000 hectares in the region. In the early 1980s APM was absorbed into the Amcor group and the new company's attitude to its substantial land holdings was somewhat different from APM's. Public opposition and questionable economics meant the proposed pulp mill never went ahead, leaving Amcor with no reason to hold 18,000 hectares of pulp quality pine logs. At this point the focus of the story changes and the inadequacies of the current land use policies become apparent. The holdings stretch over several hundred square kilometres, covering in part the local authorities of Pine Rivers, Caboolture, Caloundra and Noosa. Far from being light years away from Brisbane-as they seemed in the 1950s-the pine plantations are now smack bang in the middle of the second fastest growing region in Australia. The once sleepy Sunshine Coast is now comparable to the Gold Coast as a premier Australian holiday destination. Brisbane, the large country town, has hosted the Commonwealth Games and a World Expo and has exploded in size. real Just as the population Qverspill from Brisbane has urbanised the Pine Rivers Shire during the 1970s, the same thing has occurred in the next northern shireCaboolture-during the 1980s. During this period of urbanisation, the local councils, the State and the Commonwealth governments proceeded on the assumption that the substantial pine forests would remain in forestry use. Certainly, the trees were planted to be chopped down, but it was assumed that this would be done on a rotational basis and once a lot was cleared it would again be replanted. Hence, the planning documents of the State Government and the local authorities generally reflected the assumption that the plantations would act as an ongoing constraint on development. The end result has been that roads, schools and other basic social infrastructures have been located in areas of presumed population growth with little thought for the demand on services if the forested areas were, in fact, opened up for residential development. In late 1985 the entire Amcor holding was offered for sale and was purchased by the Emanuel group of companies-land developers from South Australia. In one hit, a single company gained control of 18,000 hectares of land in the near north Brisbane growth corridor. The issue was no longer one of the possible impact of a pulp mill, but of handling residential development on a massive scale. In our Federal system land use and management is in the hands of the State Government. In Queensland the State Government has largely delegated this power to local councils which, under the provision of the Local Government Act 1936 are required to enact a town planning 'scheme. In most cases this system operates fairly well, especially as - own planning has become more profe-slOnal during the last decade. However, It cannot cope with developments that cross council boundaries or of a scale too large to be handled by a single council. Emanuel's intentions for its newly acquired land holdings soon became clear. In 1986 it approached the Pine Rivers Council with tentative plans for a residential development housing 30,000 people. This, however, paled into insignifican,ce compared with the 1987 super satellIte city project. Under this proposal t-e lar-­ est single development ever seen III thIS country would have been constructed. It involved thousands of hectares of land of Bribie Island and the abutting mainland at Caloundra. A city of 200,000 people was mooted, featuring an industrial town, a resort, a central district, a private versity and a supporting town. This de facto multifunction polis was to be developed through a joint venture with a Chinese company. For a number of reasons this project has been deferred indefinitely. In or about May 1989 the fate of the entire holding again came under the spotlight with a proposal by a company called Queensland Commodity Exports to clear the Emanuel plantations over a IS-year period for the export woodchip market. Over the next 15 months, the woodchip proposal was examined by the Commonwealth and State governments with the result that approval was finally given on 6 August 1990. This project raises many vital issues about land use in this country. Firstly, the land in question is hardly of little importance. It is a land bank situated within a massive growth corridor. Secondly, the landowner is a property developer which has already proposed residential de:veloI?ments on a scale never before seen III thIS country's history. Thirdly, the fate of the ultimate development is on such a scale with likely demands on both State and Federal government infrastructure that it is obvious that both levels of government should be interested in the outcome. Fourthly, as the land covers part of fo-r local authority areas, not one counCIl IS able to take an overview of the development. Further, these same councils, with the exception of Pine Rivers, have town planning schemes which reflect ongoing forestry use and have not addressed the residential pressures now unleashed. Despite all this, the approval process for the export licence and the State Government go-ahead for the clearing of the land take no account of future land use. The relevant Commonwealth legislation is the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act and the Australian Heritage Commission Act. Under thes- Acts the Minister for Resources (Mr Gnffiths) has imposed conditions on the logging operations as well as conditions on the protection of some environmentally sensitive areas. These controls are, of course, commendable, but at no stage does the future of the land, once it is cleared and unistabilised, become the subject of Commonwealth approval. On 6 July last year I wrote to the then Ministers responsible for resources and the environment expressing my belief that the opportunity to make long term regional planning decisions should not be lost. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth response was that its powers in t.his fielare limited to the impact of the ImmedIate proposal-that is, the logging for t-e export woodchip market-not o- the utIlisation of the land after that. ThIS reflects the constitutional position as land use is a State power. How does the State Government handle the proposal which potentially affects much of south-east Queensland? The short answer is that it does not. There is little or no legislation which governs such a project. The only con.trol is the State pevelopment and PublIc Works Orgamzation Act of 1971. Section 29 of that Act gives the Government power to take into account likely environmental impacts of major projects. In furtherance of section 29, the Government has developed a policy statement entitled Impact Assessment in Queensland-Policies and Administrative Arrangements. This statement enables the State to order a developer to prepare an impact statement. This was done in the Queensland Commodity Export case. However, as with the Commonwealth, the Queensland approach has been confined to the actual logging operation. Issues such as the clearing program and the selection of haulage routes have.been addressed; the future use of the land has not. This leaves the local councils. As it stands, the lands are generally zoned agricultural. Logging of agricultural land is as of right and, therefore, there is no control from the council. Only if there is future development proposals will the councils be able. to make a decision. As a community, when will we learn that patchwork approaches to development impose great costs on our people? Urban infrastructure in the urban sprawl regions around our capitals is generally appalling, public transport is inadequate or non-existent, hospitals are overcrowded, schools are strained, child-care is well behind demand, and employment opportunities are limited. Brisbane already faces these problems and my electorate battles with them every day. The Prime Minister and the Premiers might examine the way Australia handles urban expansion. As the most urbanised nation on earth it might hopefully warrant a little attention. But in this case, maybe the last chance to control the growth of a great city-Brisbane-I fear that new federalism may come too late.",55
52,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,57
53,Mr NEHL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"Cowper) I rise to speak in this grievance debate today, not just with a degree of grievance but with a great deal of anger. I am totally angered and furious that the Health .Insurance Commission (HIC) has decided, without any consultation with the community, to close the Medicare agency in the town of Macksville. This imminent closure will affect the towns of Bowraville, Macksville, Nambucca Heads and Scotts Head. I wish to bring this very drastic matter to the attention of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe). The only reason given is 'due to finan. cial constraints'. That is the only reason given in the letter of closure. This is totally unacceptable to me. It is totally unacceptable to the Nambucca Shire Council, to the people of the Nambucca Valley, to the National Party branches and, indeed, to the Nambucca Valley branch of the Australian Labor Party, which has publicly said that it has already contacted the Minister. I urge the Minister to reconsider this totally unacceptable decision. The Nambucca Valley has the highest population growth rate on the New South Wales north coast which, as honourable members know, is probably the highest in Australia in any case. The population rate last year to 30 June was 6.2 per cent for the total population of the valley of 16,200, a higher population than that of Grafton City, which does have a Medicare office. I need to know from Medicare and from the Minister why the Health Insurance Commission wants to close that office. We have very high unemployment in the area. We have a very high population of aged people. In fact, I would just like to mention in passing that the Department of Social Security, from its offices in the region, is doing a great job in Nambucca. It is planning to open a permanent office in Macksville. Discussions have been going on. It is there. In fact, if the money had been provided in the Budget on Tuesday night it would be under way already. Mr Sciacca-We are looking after you.",57
54,Mr NEHL,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I should hope so. That is what the honourable member is there for in the position he is in for the time being. One-third of the business of the Kempsey office of the Department of Social Security comes from the Nambucca Valley. So why does the Health Insurance Commission want to close the Medicare office? The Commonwealth Employment Service (CES), which is also doing a great job in my electorate, has a part time branch open five days a week in Macksville, employing a supervisor and two other people. The CES is planning also to open soon a permanent office, a full time office, and increase the staff. Now, if the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service are in the situation where they have to expand to provide for' the needs of their services, I cannot understand why the Health Insurance Commission has to close the Medicare agency. I spoke this morning to Mr Graham Cannon, the State manager of the Commission, to ask what alternatives he was going to provide for the people' of Nambucca. He said, 'Ah, well, these people are the same as other areas. They can have prompt service by mail'. I am here to tell Mr Cannon that that is not good enough. There seems to be a total lack of understanding of the position of pensioners and unemployed people. They are not rich. They do not have the money to wait. They need, if they are not being bulkbilled, to be able to go and get the refund of the Medicare money almost immediately. They do not have spare money. They cannot wait to get the cash back. In the N ambucca Valley in the 1981 census, people aged 55 and over accounted for 22.9 per cent of the total population. Five years later, in the 1986 census, that figure had jumped to 29 per cent, a jump of 12 per cent in only five years. Unemployment is much, much higher than the New South Wales and national rates. Mr Cannon told me this morning that bulkbilling was the critical factor. When Medicare came in it was predicated on the basis of having direct bulkbilling of 40 per cent and it was now 65 per cent for the State. I can accept that. I do not dispute what Mr Cannon says. But I do wish those involved would do a little more homework about the Nambucca Valley before they decide to close the office down, because in Macksville and the Nambucca Valley as a whole only one of the 14 doctors fully bulkbills everyone and only four doctors out of the 14 bulkbill health care card holders. Surely it is clear to everyone that people in this situation need that cash. Mr Cannon also said that cash claims account for less than 17 per cent of the HIC business in the State. Again, Mr Cannon, I wish you had done your homework about Macksville, because that is not the case-certainly not so in the Nambucca Valley. In the 13 months to 30 July 1990, there were 21,813 claims for Medicare, a total of $902,894, and for 64.21 per cent of those claims the people got the cash. For Medibank Private the total amount was $82,988 and cash claims accounted for 61.02 per cent. So the total was just under $lm and the cash claims accounted for 63.94 per cent, very different from the 17 per cent for the rest of the State. If the Macksville office is closed and the people there need the cash-and they will need it, I assure the House-they will have to go to the Kempsey or Coffs Harbour offices by train or by bus. Of course, we are talking about unemployed people. We are talking about pensioners and we are talking about other disadvantaged people. The' return fare from Macksville to Kempsey is $10. To Coffs Harbour, the return fare is $12.20. Of course, it is half fare for unemployed people and only $2 for pensioners. Why should even a pensioner have to pay that $2 to get the money back? But, of course, it is inconvenient, and we are talking about convenience; we are talking about people. I say time and time again that the 'P' in politics stands for people. Let us just consider how pensioners can get to Coffs Harbour or to Kempsey to claim the Medicare rebate. As a train leaves Macksville to go to Coffs Harbour at midnight and arrives at 12.45 a.m. they can stick around and wait until 1.08 p.m. and get home at 1.49 p.m. to Macksville. Or, if they want to go to Kempsey, they can leave at 1.49 p.m. and arrive at 2.36 p.m. and return at 11.19 p.m., arriving back in Macksville at 11.58, two minutes to midnight. That is great, is it not? The State Rail Authority bus to Coffs Harbour leaves at 3.33 p.m. and arrives in Coffs Harbour at 5 o'clock. I imagine the Medicare office shuts in Coffs Harbour at 5 o'clock, so that is very convenient! They return to Macksville from Coffs Harbour by a bus leaving, at 4.44 a.m. and arriving in Macksville at 5.55 a.m. That is CQnvenience for a pensioner or unemployed person! Mr Deputy Speaker, you can see why I am so angry about this. For Kempsey, they can leave Macksville at 2.31 a.m. and arrive at 3.20 a.m. That is not good enough at all. People cannot afford to wait. 1 would just like to quote from a letter to the Minister from the Scotts Head Progress and Ratepayers Association dated 20 August 1990. The Association says: 'Many people cannot afford the cost of tnwel, nor can they afford to outlay money for medical expenses unless that money is to be refunded almost immediately'. Mr Deputy Speaker, you know that is true. 1I have a whole handful, a raft, letters from people who are vitally conwhich cerned about this. For item 53, a general consultation, the schedule fee is $19.60. Most doctors in the area are charging The rebate is $16.70. It does not matter whether it is a schedule fee or a higher fee. A pensioner or unemployed person cannot afford to wait to get that $16.70 back. 1 do not know; perhaps the bureauto crats do not understand. Perhaps people who are not in touch with people from day to day do not understand, but 1 pernooks sonally know a pensioner who for weeks had a cash reserve, after all the bills, only $8. She had $8 in the bank. There are many people like this and be really concerned about the situation. Mr Deputy Speaker, 1 wonder whether Mr Cannon has a secret agenda, because he said to me, 'There is not enough money to keep everything going. We are going to close 11 centres' - not just Macksvillethe 'and we have to proceed with the closures to find work for the existing staff here Sydney'. Mr Minister, please give that some consideration. What about service to the people? What about the 21,813 claims in 13 months? 1 urge the Minister to reverse this decision and perhaps even to go a little further and to consider one-stop shop. As an innovation, for convenience of the people why not get one office with Medicare, the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service? Let us keep the Medicare office open now, but consider an innovation for the future. Let us have for the convenience of the people the onestop shop which could be extended right round Australia.",57
55,Mr BEVIS,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I am heartened by the comments of the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and his clear commitment to Medicare and bulkbilling-no doubt a commitment shared by honourable members on this side of the House-and 1 commend it to those opposite. My concern today is with a statement that was released during the recess by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray). Honourable members will recall that last year, in about May 1989, the decision was taken to remove of from service the Chinook helicopters were at that time an important part of our defence capability. Earlier this month the Minister for Defence issued $24. the following statement: Up to six Chinook helicopters withdrawn from service in July last year may be upgraded and reintroduced into service . . . It is my strong view that that action needs be taken. Both defence and civil requirements of our country require us to have the capability which only the Chiare in a position to provide. The Chinooks, in a sense, were replaced by of Black Hawk helicopters which have formed the basis of the 5th Aviation Regwe have to iment at Townsville. As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I, along with other members of the Committee, was able to visit Townsville to obtain a briefing from those involved with 5th Aviation Regiment. It was somewhat saddening to find on the following in day that the newspapers carried a story quoting one of the members of the Committee, Senator Mac Gibbon, as being critical of the 5th Aviation Regiment. It was even more saddening to note the criticism related to the efficiency of the 5th Aviaa tion Regiment which was both unfair and the unwarranted; more to the point, it was inaccurate and not in keeping with the information provided to us at the briefing. Be that as it may, there is no doubt that the Black Hawk helicopter is an excellent craft and one of the best of its kind in the world. Earlier this week, in answer to a question upon notice in this place, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) provided comparative information on the Black Hawk helicopter against the Sea King and the Wessex. In both cases it is clear that the Black Hawk helicopter provides us with an· operating capacity at a lower cost and with a higher lift capacity. As I said, the Black Hawk is an excellent vehicle for its purpose but it has its limitations and they are limitations which I think can be remedied only by the reintroduction into service of the Chinook helicopters that are currently in mothballs. The Chinook is needed in a complementary role to assist in the armed forces capacity and to support the Black Hawk and other facilities. It has clear advantages in the transporting of heavy equipment, and this includes fuel supplies and troops. I add on the question of fuel that one of the issues which has become clear since the removal from service of the Chinooks is that we have a problem with providing the fuel to keep the Black Hawks themselves in the air. Experiences since that time have indicated that about 40 to 50 per cent of Black Hawk time in the air has been used just to keep the fuel up to the Black Hawks to maintain the fleet in the air. That is a situation which is. obviously untenable and I understand that it is being addressed by the defence forces. Nevertheless it would seem to me that the only way in Which it can be addressed in the short term, and probably the medium term, is to reintroduce into service the Chinook helicopters. I was therefore heartened by the statement from the Minister for Defence earlier this month that consideration is being given to the introduction of six of our current fleet of 11 helicopters. The Chinook not only has the capacity to maintain fuel and supplies; it clearly has a greater troop carrying capacity. I will refer, in a moment,· to some of the details of the two craft. The Chinook also has a much greater lifting capacity. Importantly, that is valuable in the retrieval of downed craft, not least of which being downed Black Hawk helicopters. We have a situation where Black Hawk helicopters, which may for whatever reason be damaged, are unable to be lifted by fellow Black Hawk helicopters. The potential is there for us to fail to utilise fully the resources we have at our disposal and not to take full advantage of the facilities which the Black Hawk provides. The Chinook would provide the armed forces with the capacity to retrieve Black Hawk helicopters that may be down, and also increase capacity for moving other heavy equipment. It should not be forgotten, though, in this place that the Chinook has an important role to play in civil disaster work. Many honourable members would be familiar with the role which it has traditionally played in providing relief to those areas badly affected very often by floods. We had the tragedy this year of floods causing devastating damages and hardship to people in a number of towns throughout south-west Queensland and northern New South Wales in particular. The Chinook provides the capability to transport food and fodder for cattle at a capacity which is not equalled by any of the other craft presently available. Specifically, the Chinook has a lift capacity of some 7,270 kilograms, up to about 9,850 kilograms. Compared to that, the Black Hawk has a lifting capacity. of some 2,900 kilograms, up to about 3,630 kilograms. Similarly, the Black Hawk is limited to carrying between 10 and 14 troops, whilst the Chinook is able to carry about 33 to 44 troops. In short, the Chinook has the capacity to lift about three times the people and produce that the Black Hawk .is able to lift. . I believe that there is a pressing need for at least the six Chinook helicopters referred to by the Minister to be reintroduced into service. Indeed, I think there is a good argument to extend further and to look at reintroducing possibly up to eight Chinook aircraft for defence and civil operational duties. I have every confidence in the ability of the Defence Force personnel-in particular, those of the 5th Aviation Regiment, which we had the opportunity to visit in Townsville-to reintroduce that craft into active service in a productive and efficient manner, unlike the statements which, regrettably, were made following our visit to Townsville as a committee. I understand that the defence forces have acquired substantial spares for the Chinook aircraft prior to the decision taken to remove them from service. We have in stock $87m worth of spares which could be used to assist in recommissioning those craft currently being stored. The Minister in his release has alluded quite clearly to the intention to sell some of the Chinook aircraft to, in part, finance the recommissioning of the remainder. I have no objection to that process, but take this opportunity to strongly urge the Minister to look at extending the number of Chinook aircraft to be recommissioned, and certainly to look beyond the six craft which are currently under consideration, with the hope that possibly eight Chinook aircraft may be able to be re-introduced into productive service on behalf of the armed forces, and also the civilian population.",59
56,Mrs SULLIVAN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"1 appreciate the opportunity today to speak on a subject of great interest not only to my constituents in the electorate of Moncrieff, but also to others. The particular subject. I wish to address today is the subject of roads and road funding in my part of the world. My electorate covers the northern part of the Gold Coast, north to Beenleigh which is approximately halfway between the Gold Coast and Brisbane and west to Beaudesert. One of the biggest problems I have as a member of this House in representing part of the Gold Coast is to convince people in government that the figures do not lie. It is known that the region from the Queensland-New South Wales border north to Brisbane is the fastest growing region in Australia. I have recently been told that it is the fastest growing region ever anywhere in the Western world. There are no blueprints in existence to cope with this sort of explosion of population and the demands that makes on government. The people who, therefore, have to make decisions now in relation to infrastructure for the area face a very challenging position. My particular challenge, as I have said, is to persuade people that the figures do not lie, that the population growth really is there and that it is not going to stop. I have discerned in Australia a general attitude that the Gold Coast is some sort of boom-bust area because of events some decades back. It is nothing of the sort now. It is a dynamic area which is not as affected by variables in the economyand particularly in tourism-as once it was. No matter what sort of impediment we seem to strike, such as the pilots dispute or whatever, the Gold Coast and associated regions continue to grow. Mr Deputy Speaker, in the course of this speech today, in order to try to abbreviate it, I will seek leave to incorporate several tables in Hansard. Time has not permitted me to show the specific tables to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin), or to Hansard and I know that any incorporation depends on agreement by them. I will proceed to seek leave on the assumption that in due course when they get the chance to see the tables they will agree to incorporation. I trust this procedure is satisfactory to the House. The geographic area which I intend to address in this speech is covered by the local authority of Gold Coast City Council and Albert Shire. There has been enormous population growth over the last three decades in the Gold Coast area. It has increased by a factor of eight. In the Albert Shire, where most of the growth is now, the population is five times greater than in 1976 and it has more than trebled in the past 10 years. Whilst growth in the well Gold Coast strip has stabilised to some extent, the growth west and north of what is traditionally regarded as the Gold Coast continues to expand at an enormous rate. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two tables, one outlining the resident population growth from 1976 to 1990 in the Albert Shire and another detailing the Gold Coast area population growth from 1961 through to an estimated figure for 2001. Leave granted. The tables read as followsNA Resident Population Popula Growth June tion(a) P.A. 1976 25710 1977 29090 3380 1978 34080 4990 1979 39290 5210 1980 46810 7520 1981 S6030 9220 1982 64170 8140 1983 71980 7810 1984 78180 6200 1985 86050 7870 1986 94680 8630 1987 104060 9380 1988 115700 11640 1989 129850 14150 1990 141000(b) 11150 (a) Source 1976-1989: Australian Bureau of Statistics (b) Estimated Gold Coast Population Growth 1961 3?,043 (a) 1971 76,862 (a) 1981 177,264 (a)(b) 1991 300,000 (b)(c) 2001 600,000 (b)(c) (a) Commonwealth Census figure (b) Gold Coast statistical district (c) Estimated",61
57,Mrs SULLIVAN,ALBERT SHIRE,"The census figures for the Gold Coast statistical area show that the population has gone from 39,000 in 1961 to an estimated 300,000 in 1991 and 600,000 by 2001. So the multiplying factor between 1961, 30 years ago, and 200 I-that is to the end of the decade ahead of us-is 15. We have a very severe problem of which the Government is aware and which I now wish to press it to address with some urgency in the context of one of its specific programs. Of course, roads play a major role in our part of the world because so many tourists come to the Gold Coast, this premier tourist part of Australia, by road. Roads play a vital role in almost every aspect of the economic and . social activities of Australians and road transport is the main form of transport for domestic and international visitors. Eighty-two per cent of domestic tourists and 43 per cent of international tourists use our roads. Roads enable low cost Growth transport and offer maximum flexibility P.A. in this price sensitive and growing market. Actual % Despite major road improvements over 13.1 the last 25 years, the road death rate in 17.2 Australia remains high compared to many 15.3 other Western countries. The total cost of 19.1 road accidents to the community is about 19.7 $3,000m each year. However, new road 14.5 construction and road improvements can 12.2 8.6 improve road safety and reduce the high 10.1 economic and social impacts of road 10.0 accidents. 9.9 The matter that is of particular concern 11.2 to me in this context is that section of the 12.2 Pacific Highway which runs from Nerang 8.6 to Tugun, a two-lane highway which urgently needs to be upgraded to a four-lane highway. This highway is not a national arterial road or, indeed, a national highway; it is a State arterial road and, therefore, its shortcomings are particularly relevant in the context of a program that the Government announced earlier this year-namely, the Federal provincial cities and rural highways program. As I understand it, the Government has announced that it will allocate $300m over the next three years to this program$100m per annum. Some amount has been committed for this financial year but, I understand, not a great deal. The Government is currently considering which projects this year's funding will cover. My purpose today is to urge the Government to consider favourably the urgent need to upgrade to four lanes that section of the Pacific Highway from Nerang to Tugun. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the number of accidents by severity on the section of the Pacific Highway that falls within the Albert Shire. The table covers the years from 1984 to 1989. Leave. granted. The table read as followsYear Dead 1984 3 1985 8 1986 7 1987 6 1988 16 1989 6 Total. 46 Per cent of Total 4.3 Average number of ace i- 7.7 dents per year.",62
58,Mrs SULLIVAN,ALBERT SHIRE,"This shows that in the five-year period 46 people died on that stretch of road, 193 required hospital treatment, 201 required other forms of treatment. Those figures are totally consistent with the death and injury rates for two-lane highways in other parts of Australia before decisions to convert them into four lanes dramatically reduced their death and injury rates. I present the case to the House that not only is there a natural urgency for upgrading the Nerang-Tugun section of the Pacific Highway because of the accident rate but also, in view of the incredible population expansion that will take place in that area over the next 10 years, this is a matter of high urgency. At the present level of funding, four-lane duplication from Nerang to Tugun will not be completed for another 25 years. The road that· exists was designed for 16,000 vehicles per day; It is currently carrying in excess of 30,000 vehicles per day. The case is clear, and it is urgent. I urge the Government to give top priority to the disbursement of money for the Pacific Highway for the provincial cities program. I finish on this note: the Government has taken the decision to commit funds to make the New South Wales sections of the Pacific Highway four lanes as far as the Queensland border. If the road work that I have referred to is not carried out we will have the incredible situation whereby a four-lane highway will end at the border and the enormous volume of traffic that uses that highway will be channelled back into a two-lane highway for NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS BY SEVERITY, 1984-1989 PACIFIC HIGHWAY (ALBERT SHIRE) Hospital Treatment Property Minor Total II 8 34 3 59 34 34 94 12 182 35 31 96 14 183 38 32 81 19 176 39 44 ll8 23 240 36 52 109 24 227 193 201 532 95 1067 18.1 18.8 49.9 8.9 32.2 33.5 88.7 15.8 177.8 approximately the next 15 miles. That would be ludicrous. The proposal that the Nerang-Tugun section be upgraded to four lanes is a logical extension of the decision that the Government made in relation to the Pacific Highway in New South Wales.",63
59,Mrs DARLING,ALBERT SHIRE,"The Ministers responsible for services for people with disabilities, and their carers, Ministers Richardson, Howe and Dawkins, said this week that 'we must dispel the myth that people with disabilities are not capable of work'. These words carry a particular wisdom in the context of how people in Australia view those with disabilities, of how people in caring situations view them, and of how the people with disabilities view themselves. At particular times in the process of developing programs to ensure that people with disabilities reach their greatest potential within the society of which they are part, concerned citizens are faced with the need to decide their support priorities. Now is such a time. The traditional network of carers of people with disabilities is immediate family and friends and community organisations which often employ administrators who appeal to the public for donations and also rely on government funding to enable them to provide necessary facilities. The operation of their services requires volunteer labour as well as paid staff. In Australia a network of volunteer workers has developed providing a warm, giving and capable community of supporters without whom the facilities would not be so effective nor so widely available. I pay tribute to these people. I believe the national Parliament is an appropriate place to consider the future of Australians with disabilities and to pand on my contention that now is the time for concerned people to consider their options and their priorities. The Hawke Government has been doing this since receiving widespread input from a broad spectrum of involved people leading to a process of consultation and counter-consultation out of which the Disabilities Services Act 1986 transpired. The major objective of that Act is to increase support for people with disabilities and their carers in areas which in the past did not attract government funding nor a lot of public attention due to more limited understanding of the breadth of potential of people with disabilities. For instance, only a few years ago it was thought that a person with cerebral palsy could not cope with full time employment under any circumstances. So facilities and activities were designed to assist the most pleasant and supported lifestyle possible. Had anyone mentioned at that stage that a person with serious intellectual disability could live independbeen ently in supported accommodation, travel independently to a workplace and enter full time paid employment, carers, organisations and even-or maybe particularly-the person with the handicap would consider the claim to be outrageous. Yet that is precisely what is happening in Australia today. Increased employment opportunities for people with disabilities are a fundamental part of the Government's strategy for achieving a greater measure of social justice for all disadvantaged Australians. It means a lot to us as we believe that a significant number of people with disabilities are experiencing extreme frustration because they know that they could be a more central part of the life around them given the right formula of evaluation, training and placement, et cetera. They do not criticise the fact that their particthe ular formula has not yet evolved, but they want the community, both government and non-government, to come to grips with the problems they face, to search and try and, if necessary, revamp policies until the most appropriate solution is reached. Many people are trying to do this. Change ex- is in the air, and more and more people are trialling new modes, particularly in the area of supported employment. At the recent presentation of the inaugural Prime Minister's employer of the year awards, established to recognise the contribution of employers to the achievement of government policy for the employment of people with disabilities, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) summed up the role of employment in opening up new opportunities in these words: For any Australian, whether abled or disabled, employment provides a sense of purpose: it offers a role back in the mainstream of society: it demands self-reliance: it. brings out skills and energies that would otherwise lie dormant. Employment means: I can· do it. I belong. Employment says: I have something to contribute. I can make a difference again. I can do it. I belong. I have something to contribute. It bears thinking of that these aims, which many of us accept as' our inviolable right, are something which has denied a substantial proportion of our society. Yet the progress in providing practieal means of giving people with disabilities a key to fuller participation in life is being met in some quarters with dismay and even outright opposition. This will always be the case when changes are made, but particularly so when the people affected by the changes are vulnerable. There is no doubt in my mind that there are carers and organisations who do feel vulnerable because of the Act. The people with disabilities are, of course, most vulnerable. Yet I have met with many and their voice comes over as 'Yes, give it a try'. Carers are also very vulnerable. Their entire life has been governed by people whom they love and for whom they are responsible. These concerns are being given further serious consideration, but gains to a significant number of people with disabilities throughout the Disabilities Services Act transition programs are great. The third part of the triangle of support-the organisations which have for years provided facilities for people with disabilities-is also vulnerable. If they have been providing a wide range of services and facilities, and if their operation relies-even in a small part-on the returns from sheltered workshop projects, they may well feel that they will be losers if people choose alternatives to workshops. I do not suggest that money from federal funding or other areas is a major priority. This is not so. But when providing any services, money is definitely a factor. These organisations have been offered the chance to cooperate with the Department in changing their mode to new programs. Many have accepted the challenge and are mOllnting transition supported employment programs. However, a small minority of organisations have not wished to change their old style of operation. While I can sympathise with the personal disappointment felt in not being able to continue in a work situation which suited them and which certainly assisted many, I sympathise more with the people with disabilities who will miss out if society becomes static and puts other matters before the opening up of new opportunities for them. This is what I meant when I said that the time had come to decide on priorities in the disabilities field. On 7 August I officially launched a wonderful new program, Workscope Inc. on behalf of the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe). The establishment of Workscope is a landmark for people with disabilities in Queensland. It offers employment for people with high support needs using the approach of individually supported jobs which has worked so well elsewhere. The jobs which Workscope's clients will take on are not specially created disability jobs-they are regular employment places in the open work force, selected because they best meet the employment preferences and aptitudes of particular individuals and won by those individuals on the merit of their contribution. In this service there will be no grouping together of people with disabilities either in the large segregated factory-type environments which, for many, have been their only employment option, or in the small enclaves or work crews which are recognised approaches to supported employment. Workscope joins other organisations-including the Red Cross Society, Compass and Epic in Queensland-in realising the vision of the Government in giving people with disabilities a new deal. In the 1990 Budget further opportunities were offered to expand the employment of people with disabilities into the mainstream of life. I will touch on these later this day .. I compliment and encourage the people with disabilities and their carers who wish to try one of the new options. To the people, organisations and departmental officers who have believed that supported programs such as Workscope could happen, I say, 'Thank you, and congratulations on your perseverance'.",63
60,Dr KEMP,ALBERT SHIRE,"I rise today to speak on two related matters: firstly, on the critical issue of literacy and, secondly, on the approach to the debate on education engaged in by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). The Minister for Employment, Education and Training is devoted to the dorothy dixer, but many would have found his response to a dorothy dixer on literacy during Question Time on Tuesday to have been nothing short of extraordinary. Why is the Minister so sensitive on this topic? Why is he so worried about debate on the issue? Why is he so unwilling to address the issue of literacy in schools? In Question Time last Tuesday, the Minister made the extraordinary suggestion that literacy is not a problem for the schools-and to suggest otherwise is to knock the school system. He informed us that the schools were doing their job. Literacy is a workplace problem and it was there that the solution should be addressed. To suggest that literacy and nu- . meracy are not issues for schools to come to terms with flies in the face of all expert understanding and common sense. The Minister, I regret to say, appears remarkably uninformed about the accumulation of such evidence as there is on this matter. Apart from attacking his critics and a few gestures to make the International Year of Literacy, the Minister has yet to demonstrate a deep personal interest in this issue. He informed us that he intends to make a statement on the matter in a couple of weeks. But in his monologue yesterday, in answer to yet another dorothy dixer, there was no mention of literacy, no discussion of numeracy, no clear reference to the growing community concern on these issues. Any reference was at best indirect. Why is this the case? The answer lies in the corporate state framework within which the Minister has placed education policy. The question is: What will the interest groups supporting the Government allow to be said? Too often there is a restraint from ing in the best interests of our nation-a restraint imposed by the fear of offending powerful vested interests. It is risky to intimate that there is a problem that needs to be looked into, for to do so would tread on a few toes and some of the militant teacher union officials-whose support the Minister assiduously cultivatesmight be offended. Mr Costello-·He is the problem that needs to be looked into.",65
61,Dr KEMP,ALBERT SHIRE,"There is a problem that the Minister poses for everybody-he takes the easy way out again and again. Do not mention the real issue; better still, efit: attack anyone who does and misrepresent his views if you can. On the other hand adult literacy can be referred to with impunity. The Australian Labor Party-Australian Council of Trade Unions alliance feels quite comfortable about adult literacy-it provides yet another issue which can be incorporated into industrial negotiations and can be used to impose yet further cost burdens on employers reeling from the Government's misguided economic policies. The damaging impact of the, accord extends as far as the treatment of literacy in Australia. Adult literacy is a real problem. Some excellent programs have been put in place by employers to deal with it. It often makes good sense for employers to address the issue-they are rewarded with a more productive work force and a safer working environment. Literacy problems frequently have their roots in social· disadvantage. To suggest that there are not problems in literacy emerging from the school system or within the school system is to do a great disservice to the literacy debate. There has been a great disinclination to gather information on the extent of illiteracy in our schools by those responsible. However, the information that we have indicates that a significant problem exists. The Minister would do well to take note of this information. Let us turn to the study by Rosie Wickert. The Minister is aware of this study---'at least he did make some referact- ence to it in his answer-but he compounded the problem by misrepresenting the report. He sought to utilise the report to reinforce his suggestion that literacy is not a problem in the school system. He said: What Rosie Wickert's study shows is that the groups which have the greatest illiteracy are those who are over 55-that is, those who were at school, if at all, a long time ago, not recentlyand those who had six years schooling or less. If the Minister had fully read the report, or if time did not permit him to do this, at least read the conclusions of the report, he would have come across the following statement, which I now quote for his benWe now know that literacy and numeracy problems are not largely concentrated in particular groups but are spread across all groups in the population. It is quite clear that Wickert sees action in the schools as a significant component of an effective approach to deal with literacy. There are other reports I would like to bring to the Minister's attention. In South Australia, diagnostic testing undertaken at the Regency College of T AFE of its apprentice and pre-vocational student intake revealed that 24 per cent of apprentices in the plumbing, sheetmetal and engineering schools experienced varying degrees of difficulty in coping with textual material; forty-seven per cent of apprentices and 51 per cent of pre-vocational students had reading comprehension ages of only between eight and 12 years of age; and thirty-four per cent were unable to pass trade relevant maths tests set at year 10 level. In Queensland, informal surveys of educators undertaken by a former deputy director of technical and further education and current President of a specific learning difficulties organisation reveal illiteracy levels in schools running at 10 per cent. In New South Wales the Australian Council for Educational Research, in assessing the results from the basic skill testing program established by the Greiner Government last year, stated that while most students had solid foundations for further learning, 'for each aspect of literacy and numeracy tested, significant numbers of students have mastered only the most elementary skills'. It is interesting that this much criticised program from those who ought to know better attracted the paid support of some 1,000 parents from non-government schools who wanted their children to take part in it. To draw attention to these facts-facts from a national survey and sources in three States; and there are other reports-in no way criticises the efforts of teachers who, as a group, are doing extraordinarily well under difficult circumstances. It is bizarre to suggest that to point out that there are significant problems which schools currently do not address is to attack the school systems and the people in them. School is the major provider of literacy skills for the majority of students. All the evidence points to the fact that a significant minority of students passing through our school system and then leaving it have substandard literacy and numeracy skills. It is time for the Minister to lift the education debate out of the corporate state framework, to face up to the real issues and do something about them. When reflecting on this I simply ask the Minister to consider the following questions: Why is community concern over literacy and numeracy so high? Why has the standing of teachers in government schools in the community fallen? If he is honest with himself he will acknowledge that this' is because the community sees no evidence of a genuine attempt to address these issues. The community often feels shut out of the schools. Teachers are being isolated and trapped in a system which does not let them do their jobs in a way they want to do. The Minister plans to make a statement on literacy in a week or two. Those concerned with literacy and numeracy in schools will be watching with great interest to see what the Minister proposes to more firmly establish the extent of the problem and to inform the community of the facts.",66

It is my concern that the current arrangements do not provide any compensation for these players. It may not be understood by everyone, but foot baIlers are excluded from workers compensation Acts around Australia. If they get a serious injury they fall back on the Medicare system and the general taxpayer for their medical expenses. The clubs, in my view, are being appallingly short sighted. If a player sustains an injury, such as in this case or in the Wallace and Grinter caseTerry Wallace is suing Grinter and the Melbourne Football Club for $lm-clubs have no cover. The response of those clubs, which is amazing, is: 'We do not tell them to go out on the ground to injure someone'. I respond to them by saying that although an employer may ask a worker to behave safely it does not remove liability from the employer if the worker gets injured. The clubs need to look at providing proper cover for the acts of players on the football field. We would not find this happening in women's sport because it is managed much more sensibly.

The Ambassador's signature represents Australia's agreement to the principles of the convention and understanding not to contravene the convention. The second stage, ratification of the treaty, would involve Australia becoming a party to the treaty. I am advised that the Federal Government is presently consulting with the States and Territories towards this end. This statement is not about denouncing the value of the United Nation's convention, but rather about the use of executive power. Apparently as long as the treaty comes under the term 'convention', any parliamentary debate can be sidestepped. The Federal Labor Government can ratify this convention without the benefit of any parliamentary debate whatsoever. Conventions of such paramount importance that have attracted objections right across Australia and petitions to this Parliament only this morning should, undoubtedly, receive the benefit of parliamentary debate.

From an economic viewpoint there can be little doubt that the decision was necessaryas inflation since 1966 has made their production more costly than their face value. I believe that many people will regard their passing with relief-bus drivers, cabbies and the visually impaired who found them easily confused with dollar and two dollar coins. However, some questions have remained unanswered. What has happened to the hundreds of millions of coins minted since 1966? So many of these have simply disappeared without a trace. Where have they all gone? We all come across the odd coin now wedged behind the cushions on the couch or gathering dust beneath the fridge. But these coins stumbled upon represent only a tiny fraction of those minted. Where are all the rest? Perhaps somewhere there is a fiscal equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle, a shadowy nether world inhabited by strange coins. There is also the question of what to do with the coins that remain. My answer is to collect them for charity and I have designated my office as a collection point. I can see that some may lament the passing of the one and two cent pieces in deference to them. In tribute to the small but hardy coins I have penned the following, with apologies to Banjo Paterson: There was movement at the station for Keating's word had passed around That the one and two cent coins had had their day And had joined the useless currencynowhere worth near a thousand pounds So all the coins had gathered to the fray.",69

I am well aware of her interest in this area, nonparticularly the way in which a number groups concerned with disability in and some of the surrounding electorates are taking seriously the changes that the Government made in the Disability Services Act and are implementing those changes with a great deal of success. Certainly, the Government is very much aware of the fact thatour legislation can only work if we get that cooperation on the ground. If any honourable members in the House are working with disability groups, I would be more than interested to hear of the progress being made, of achievements and also of problems.

In particular it outlines a stratto fundamentally turn around community attitudes to people with disabilities-to focus on their abilities rather than their disabilities and to provide them with the opportunities for paid rest of us take for Recently, I had the opportunity of visiting the electorate of the honourable member for Parramatta, where an experimental project for open employment has been developed by the Spastic Society of New South Wales. It was right in the heart of the city of Parramatta. Twenty or 30 mainly younger people, who were very severely disabled, were in an office carrying out work on the basis of contracts that they had secured. It was enormously inspiring to see the .Government's strategy in action. The focus of our active strategy will be on extending the ladder of opportunity to younger people with disabilities who would otherwise face the prospect of lifelong dependence on the pension. An integrated approach will be put in place for relevant departments to assess the workforce capacity of new applicants for social security assistance and to place them in appropriate labour market rehabilitation and employment programs. I am concerned that the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) has claimed that the Government's active strategy is directed at all invalid pensioners and sickness beneficiaries and that sufficient program places will be provided. Those criticisms are wrong on both counts. Our active strategy will be focused on those assessed as being able to benefit from programs of assistance. We will continue to provide adequate and secure income support to people who are severely disabled or who have limited job prospects. As part of the Government's active strategy, my Department will progressively provide an additional 9,700 rehabilitation and employment service places for younger people with disabilities. That will comprise 4,500 extra mainstream rehabilitation places, 1,200 places in six special rehabilitation units for people with psychiatric disabilities and 4,000 additional places in supported and competitive employment services funded under the Disability Services Act. I stress that these will be totally new places; they are additional and not the total number, as ACOSS has implied. They will build on the enormous growth in disability and rehabilitation places that is already in place or under way. Even without the Budget initiatives, the numbers assisted by the Commonwealth rehabilitation service is projected to almost double, from some 12,500 in 1987-88, to 21,000 this financial year. Our Budget initiatives, together with the previously announced growth, will see the numbers assisted grow dramatically to 32,000 by June 1994. Equally, the 4,000 aqditional places in funded employment services is on top of the 214 new employment services providing some 3,200 places that the Government has funded since the commencement of the Disability Services Act in 1987. I think that every honourable member of this Parliament has been interested in the changes that flowed from the Disability Services Act. The changes have been controversial. There is still controversy in many electorates. I think it is important that the House should know that the Government is fully backing its strategy with these additional resources in this Budget.

83,Mr REITH,PYRAMID BUILDING SOCIETY,"I put my question about in- the Pyramid Building Society to the Treasurer again. I particularly refer him to the joint press statement issued by the Victorian Treasurer and the Attorney General on 13 February 1990, stating that deposits in the Pyramid Building Society were secure. There are two parts to the question: Firstly, was he aware of the financial difficulties of the Pyramid Building Society prior to 13 February? Secondly, was he aware in advance that this press statement was to be issued?",72
84,Mr KEATING,PYRAMID BUILDING SOCIETY,"I was informed of developments regarding Pyramid as events unfolded, but I was not involved in any way in the preparation of the statement to which the honourable gentleman refers. I do not provide advice or guidance to the Victorian Government as to whether or how it might make a statement. Dealings that occurred between Victoria and the Commonwealth were at the level of officials. MEDICARE CARD: NA NA",72
85,Mr LANGMORE,SCHEME,Is the Minister for Community Services and Health aware of concerns expressed about the use of the Medicare card in proposals to reform the administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme? What is the Minister's sponse to those concerns?,72
86,Mr HOWE,SCHEME,"I am aware of the concerns that have been raised on privacy grounds, with the proposal to use the Medicare card to establish eligibility for pharmaceutical benefit scheme (PBS) purfrom poses. The measures announced in the Budget include very significant savings government expenditure through adminthe istrative reform of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I wish to table a letter from the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services to the Privacy Commisperhaps sioner, which details the Government's intentions. Under the PBS, pharmacists are paid by the Health Insurance Commission to recompense them for the difference bebe tween the costs of drugs and the amounts patients have to pay for them. A pharmation macist is entitled to a higher payment from the Commission for a prescription dispensed to a pensioner than a prescripstatus tion dispensed to a general user, and Government believes that no subsidy at all should be paid for non-residents Australia, such as foreign tourists. To run a tight system it is necessary that the Commission be able to verify accurately the amount a pharmacist thirdly, claims. That will depend on, firstly, drug has been dispensed and in what cists, quantities and, secondly, the status under the PBS of the patient-whether he is resident of Australia and whether he is entitled to a concessional benefit. When the patients present to the pharmacist claim to be entitled to a subsidy that are not entitled to, who should bear cost: the patient who is not entitled, the pharmacist or the public? The ment believes that the public should not have to. If pharmacists are not to be made to bear the cost, they need a secure method of satisfying themselves of eligibility. we propose a system which will be ento tirely voluntary for pharmacists. No pharAt macists will be required to use the the Medicare card system. However, any pharmacists who do use the system will be protected. They will be paid by the reCommission whatever subsidy the Commission tells the pharmacists they are entitled to. In February, the Privacy Commissioner raised essentially two concerns with such a system: firstly, the flow of information the Department of Social Security, which determines whether people are enin titled to concessional pharmaceuticals, to Commission and from the Commission to the pharmacist; and, secondly, the risk of embarrassment to patients when they claim a subsidy in the pharmacy, in the company of other customers, and are advised that it is not available. The Government has proposed to deal with these two concerns by legislation to introduced this sitting, which would, firstly, strictly define that the only inforthe Department of Social Security can provide to the Commission for these purposes is identity information and the of the person under the pharmathe ceutical benefit scheme-the Department of Social Security will not be permitted into provide any income or other information to the Commission; secondly, strictly define the information the Commission can provide to the pharmacist as being the PBS status of a patient inquired about; strictly regulate the use of Mediwhat care identifier information by pharmadoctors and their staff;. and, finally, , provide for the Privacy Commissioner to a issue binding guidelines on the use of Medicare. identifiers within pharmacies or doctors' surgeries following consultation a with the relevant professional bodies. In they practice, whenever a pharmacist knows the his customer and is confident the customer is honest, there will be no need, of Governcourse, to use the system. So the choice which faces the Leader of the Opposition is clear. He can support the package with all those protections or he can face the Australian people without So a jot of fiscal credibility as being unable take the tough but responsible decision. tilese times it is not unusual to find Qpposition usiQg scare tactics; for example, someone caught UP. in the terms of the new deeming provision would lose his fringe benefits even though the Budget Papers made it clear that existing pensioners would be protected. Of course, those scare tactics would be used,' but there is no need for scare tactics with respect to privacy. The Government is more than willing to ensure that privacy concerns are worked through,and certainly debated in the Parliament,but ultimately resolved in a way that protects the privacy particularly of the client or patient.

89,Mr TIM FISCHER,CONSERVATION,"My question is directed to the Minister for Resources. Did he describe various submissions on sustainable development from the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace, the Wilderness"" Society and the World Wide Fund for Nature along with various environmental'lobby positions as being 'flawed and full of myths and halftruthS'? IS he in fact listed as having joint strategic policy responsibility for sustainable development and other matters? What was the basis for his presumably considered statement on this matter? Mr GRIFFITHS"""":""""I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question and observe that he is at least getting the isterial r'esponsibilities in order. In of the question, I am pleased to Have the ,opportunity of putting this canard to one side. During the weekend I made a couple of speeches and addressed issues of the implications to our economy of moving away from the resources sector. In addition to that, I canvassed a number of other issues surrounding, in a general context, the conduct of public debate in this cOl,mtry, touching upon the issues of resource utilisation and also the very important issues of environmental considerations. I was very disappointed to observe press reports that do distort quite significantly my comments on these issues, but they have, in fact, been a feature of the debate over the last little while. In that context, I would be happy to make available to the Leader of the National Party the full 'speech where that quotation can be taken in context. The comment certainly was not directed to the submission. I have had occasion to put-and, in fact, did so put on the weekend in two forums-my views abQut the conservationist groups' submissions. My colleague the honourable member for Kingston was, in fact, a witness to this speech. I said during that speech that my view of the document was that it was a significant addition to the debate in these areas, but I did have occasion to remark-and I think this assertion will be conceded by most members of this House, whatever their views are on these issues-that it is almost impossible to put a view in relation to these issues without exciting an emotive and often inaccurate response. In that context, I assert again that at the fringes of this debate there are half-truths and myths. It is important for the Government to continue what it has done to date. To date it has tried, so far as is practicable, to ensure that people are brought together not only to debate by way of assertion but also to look very closely at the facts that form the central core of this debate and, in so doing, to try to get a resolution to enormously complex, quite highly politimin- cal and very emotive issues. In that conterms text the Government, as all honourable members are aware, has set up a range of strategies to meet that. In the interim, of course, a number of decisions will have to be taken before that process is completed. But I conclude on this note: the Leader of the National Party has in his possession, as I understand it, a copy of the speech. It will do him well and it will do members of the Fourth Estate even better to actually read what is said rather than to respond to editorial intervention. I rest my case on the merit and the content of the speech. SOUTH-EAST FORESTS OF NEW NA",74
90,Mr LLOYD,SOUTH WALES,"My question is also. to the Minister for Resources. The Minister will be aware that the forest industry is ready to invest $7 billion nationwide if it can be guaranteed long term and reasonable access to resources. Therefore, when will the Government finally make a decision on the future of the south-east forests of New South Wales and will it give the forest industry a long term commitment to supply from these forests, therefore guaranteeing jobs in the area? Will the Government legislate to prevent any major resource areas from being placed on the National Estate Register until the Government takes into account the social· and economic consequences of such a listing?",75
91,Mr GRIFFITHS,SOUTH WALES,"There are a number of very important issues pertaining to the south-east forests currently before the Government. As the honourable member will be aware, in the next few weeks it will be my responsibility to look at access to further resource in the context of supporting what is well known to be the Government's position. In order to resolve this very complex and very difficult regional issue relating to forestry, there have to be access to resource to ensure that our obligations during the course of the last election, and before, relating to access to resource and maintenance of employment are met. By early next month there will have to be a number of decisions taken in relation to further access in that context. I make the point that there has been nothing from the Opposition in relation to how it would resolve any of these contentious and important forestry issues. One looks in vain for sensible suggestions Mr Dobie-You are the Government.",75
92,Mr GRIFFITHS,SOUTH WALES,"Of course we are the Government, and we will make the decisions. It seems to me that those opposite want to embrace these issues in a passionate way, but they continue to stand on the sidelines. We get silly press releases from the shadow Minister for environment, and so on. There has not been one substantive contribution from the Opposition on how these issues might be resolved. I invite the Opposition, as we invite a whole range of people in the community, to make a sensible contribution to this debate. In that context, the Opposition has the joint scientific committee report. I will make available to those. opposite a whole range of other reports and I will be very keen to see their response to them. Shortly there will have to be, consistent with previous Government undertakings, decisions on further resource access. But, importantly, the Government has set in train a process whereby all of the issues surrounding the south-east forest issue will be discussed, and to the greatest extent possible there will be consultation with all interest groups affected. The joint scientific committee report ought not be seen in isolation. As honourable members should be aware, there are a number of other documents in which we have engaged in co-authorship, if you like. They touch upon important issues, for example, plantation strategies, so that over the longer term-and these are quinwill tessentially long term issues-we can move out of the areas of high contention. They also address issues such as value adding for these important forestry and forest related industries. There is a whole gamut of other reports which I will not take the time of the House reflecting on here. In the next little while the Government will be giving even furtherconsideration to these issues. I remain reasonably confident that by the end of this year or early next year we will have a package of reform measures of some significance to help bring about an end to this particular component of the forestry debate. In conclusion,when this proposal was first put in place the tories in New South Wales argued very strongly that this was going to be a waste of time and that the whole of the process was not supported by them. One of the important themes to come out of the joint scientific report is that in fact the position of the New South Wales Government is untenable. We look to the New South Wales Government, as we look to the Opposition, to make some substantive and sensible ,contribution to this enormously complex issue rather than, as they have done to date, simply sniping from the sidelines.",75

95,Mr MARTIN,OIL EXPLORATION,"Since he is going so well, my question is also directed to the Minister for Resources. Is the Minister aware of. recent claims that the Government is complacent about oil exploration and that under existing arrangements it is uneconomic for Australian companies to perform the exploration necessary to redress the expected shortfall in oil production? What is the Minister's response to these claims? .",76
96,Mr GRIFFITHS,OIL EXPLORATION,I thank the honourable member for Macarthur for his pertinent and important question. I have seen most recently in a press statement by the Leader of the National Party of Australia and shadow Minister for resources a number of assertions about Australia's oil sufficiency and exploration levels; Mr Tim Fischer-Based on the Budget.,76
97,Mr GRIFFITHS,OIL EXPLORATION,"I certainly concede that point, but fundamentally the Leader of the National Party made assertions that were not related to the Budget process. In terms of the package of measures that we have brought into address the oil industry and related issues, they will be seen, when we look back next century, as the decisive moment for the future of the oil industry in this country. Dr Bob Woods-What does Esso say?",76
98,Mr GRIFFITHS,OIL EXPLORATION,"I will go to that very shortly. In fact, Esso was in contact with my office today to indicate· its strong support for our proposed changes to the liquefied petroleum gas regime. Incidentally, it is not just my view that the Budget will be seen as the decisive moment in terms of the oil industry. It is, in fact, the view of Mr Keith Orchison, the Executive Director of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association. Mr MCGauran-You are exaggerating his comments.",76
99,Mr GRIFFITHS,OIL EXPLORATION,"If the honourable member for Gippsland thinks that I am exaggerating Mr Orchison's comments, he ought to address that suggestion to Mr Orchison. When he very warmly responded to this very important package of reforms he put precisely those sentiments to me. I had occasion to ask him whether I had his permission to indicate in a wider forum what his sentiments were. The honourable member for Gippsland is obviously surprised, but that is the' comment he made. Mr MCGauran-Horrified",76
100,Mr GRIFFITHS,OIL EXPLORATION,"That is right. The honourable member for Gippsland is horrified because Mr Keith Orchison, the executive director of the key organisation in this country concerned with oil exploration issuesMr MCGauran-He is out of step with his colleagues.",76
101,Mr GRIFFITHS,OIL EXPLORATION,The honourable member for Gippsland says he is out of selfstep. First of all the honourable member for Gippsland is horrified that an important spokesperson in the industry has so warmly embraced the Government's reform-that shows the attitude of the honourable member for Gippsland to these issues-but I can go much further. If he wants me to take the time of the House I can give him the industry response in chapter and verse.,76
102,Mr HAWKE,OIL EXPLORATION,"Hear, hear! Go on.",76
103,Mr GRIFFITHS,OIL EXPLORATION,The Prime Minister asks me to do so.,76
104,Mr SPEAKER,OIL EXPLORATION,I do not think the Minister should do too much.,77
105,Mr GRIFFITHS,OIL EXPLORATION,"I will recite one verse. Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd has wart;nly embraced these reforms, but more particularly and more importantly one ought not see these significant changes in the context of only Esso and BHP. The gamut of companies in this country who have an important role to play in oil exploration and production are significantly benefited, of course, by the wider company deductability which is an important reform to guarantee oil self-sufficiency for this country into the next century. It ought not just be seen in terms of the package, which encompasses not only resource rent tax and company wide deductability but also, in an environmental context, platform removal and, in a wider context again, mine site rehabilitation. The package also went to some other significant environmental issues. Let me get through a couple of the points that I think I should respond to. First of all, the shadow Minister showed an abysmal understanding of some of the issues in this country. This country under a Labor Government is currently 90 per cent self-sufficient",77
106,Mr GOODLUCK,OIL EXPLORATION,What in?,77
107,Mr GRIFFITHS,OIL EXPLORATION,"Under the Opposition's own team, it was 65 per cent. In the first quarter of this year we achieved nearly 100 per cent self-sufficiency. We had the highest output of oil in this country in our total oil exploration and' production history; we had seismological surveys conducted; and we had a record in terms of holes drilled. Dr Hewson. interjecting",77
108,Mr GRIFFITHS,OIL EXPLORATION,"That is the sort of silly contribution that the Leader of the Opposition is going to make himself fa- . mous for. I will not go into some of the other assertions he made in his press release. I simply invite him to take the opportunity to come into my office-I am happy to sit down with him for an hour or so-and we will run through some of these issues. They are very important to the future of this country. I think that our package of reform measures will go some considerable way to ensuring that the record that we have gained is maintained over this decade and into the next century. I conclude by saying that they are not my sentiments but those of Mr Keith Orchison, executive director of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association, when he said: When we look back from the next century at the Australian oil industry Budget night will be seen to be the decisive moment.

Mrs GALLUS-In reference to the claim yesterday of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories that the Government had made great progress towards environmental protection in the Budget, would she explain the assertion of the former Min. ister for Finance that, in the environment area, circuses are taking priority over real issues?",77
109,Mrs KELLY,PROTECTION,"I do not think the former Minister will be seen to be one of the great exponents on the environment, and I do not think he is the best judge of that. What I said yesterday-and I repeat it today-is that, in the Budget announcement, we gave commitments to discussing, working on and implementing the big issues in the environment. They relate to biodiversity, greenhouse, the establishment of an environmental protection authority, ecologically sustainable develmore opment and Cape York. These are the issues that are going to be at the forefront of this portfolio for the next year. They are the big issues. Add to them waste minimisation and recycling, and anyone in the broader community who cares about the environment and has its interests at heart will agree that they are the big issues.

113,Mr GRACE,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,I refer the Treasurer to claims that a capital gains tax (CGT) is a or tax on low income earners. Does the Treasurer have any new data in relation,78
114,Mr KEATING,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,"The Budget Papers Many contain a fair bit of new data on this issue, although it was published in a statement ancillary to the Budget, Budget Reby lated Paper No. 3 entitled Income Tax Statistics 1988-89 Income Year. What that paper shows is that capital gains tax in am respect of that year was paid by only 134,000 individuals, representing 1.7 per cent of the individual tax-paying population. This is despite the fact that the coalition would have had us believe that individuals in the' majority were paying the capital gains tax. In fact, the great to bulk of CGT revenue was derived from income earners: 60 per cent of collections came from taxpayers with taxable incomes in excess of $50,000, and 77 per cent of collections came from taxpayers with taxable incomes in excess of $35,000. taxpayers with taxable incomes beto low $35,000 who had capital gains had an average capital gains tax liability of $792, while those with taxable incomes of $35,000 or more had an average of $5,062. This trend, while clear in these statistics, was also clear last year, yet the OpReposition tried to peddle a line that CGT a tax on lower income earners in that disreputable campaign it conducted in the fielection campaign to try to argue'that its policy would relieve the great majority of ordinary people from CGT, when we really find that individuals paid 1.7 per cent. Those earning under $35,000 paid an average of $792 compared with $5,062 above that. Of course, that is an average. Some taxpayers obviously in that group would be paying much greater sums than $5,000-obviously in the millions. Not only that, but as the coalition's policy still obtains-and it has apparently been endorsed since the election by the Leader of the Opposition-were the coalition to win the next election, which is an unlikely event, as its policy stands, it would backdate the CGT benefits by eight years. The coalition would provide a retrospective tax cut eight years back while trying to put a consumption tax on the food and clothing of ordinary people. That is the morality of the coalition's tax policy. It is trying to put a big impost on inflation and the costs of ordinary taxpayers, particularly low and middle income earners, with a consumption tax, while it continues with a policy of giving an eightyear retrospective tax benefit to the wealthiest people in the community who pay most of the capital gains tax.",78
115,Mr HAWKE,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,Read what the Leader of the Opposition said earlier.,79
116,Mr KEATING,CAPITAL GAINS TAX,"Before the Liberals slotted the Leader of the Opposition into harness, he said: I would go for near uniform taxation of all forms of income. That is what he said before he started passionately serving a Liberal Party stituency which requires that he give tax breaks that he would not require of anybody else. These statistics make a joke of the claim that the CGT is a penalty individuals and ordinary people. In fact, it is paid mostly by higher income earnspecial ers. NA",79
117,Mr REITH,BUDGET STATISTICS,"My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the documents on Advances to the Minister for Finance bled yesterday in the Senate. Were· the Commonwealth fund allocations of $40m to Tasmania for restructuring its Budget sector, approved on 26 June 1990; the $12m to South Australia for water quality control, approved on 29 June 1990; and the $20m to Western Australia for transport improvements, approved on 29 June 1990, made known to all Premiers during the recent Premiers Conference?",79
118,Mr KEATING,BUDGET STATISTICS,I am not aware whether they were. The fact is that those allocations are obviously in the statistics and in the data which the honourable gentleman was easily able to read. Mr Tim Fischer-Under the table.,79
119,Mr KEATING,BUDGET STATISTICS,"If the honourable member regards a $40m payment to Tasmania to repair its Budget sector as an unworthy, under-the-table payment, let us put that on the record. The former Premier left the place in a state of utter disrepair. He was moving money into Tasmania's Budget account, taking it off the Hydro Electric Commission for two or three days and then putting it back in. If one were running a corporation, one would be prosecuted for that sort of thing. That is what the previous Government was about in Tasmania. It left the present Premier with a billion dollar problem in a small State, yet the Liberal Party of Australia is cavilling at a $40m payment from the Commonwealth to help Tasmania to ease itself over the fiscal impasse it has reached by virtue of the negligence of the former Premier. This Government had implemented Commonwealth Grants Commission changes over the years, which reduced conpayments to Tasmania-on the Grants it Commission's recommendation-but each year put in special additions to ease the adjustment burden. Premier Gray pleaded on with the Prime Minister and me at each of those meetings for more money, for additions, which we gave him, to ease the adjustment burden. But he was not adjusting. He took the money but did not do the adjustments. That was found when he left office. The accounts went into a supercritical position. The current taPremier is now trying to make adjustments from a debt position that is unparalleled in the history of any of the Australian States. Tasmania's general recurrent budget is in a state of absolute chaos as a result, and it has been left to the Australian Labor Party to try to repair it. Members opposite are whingeing and cavilling. We often hear Tasmanian Liberal Party members asking us, 'Why do you hate Tasmania?'. Why do members opposite hate Tasmania? We may well ask that question. Members opposite should ask their Deputy Leader why he hates Tasmania. Ask him why he does not want Tasmania given $40m by the Commonwealth to ease its· adjustment through an acute budgetary position. Ask him by how much the taxes on each family have to rise if that $40m is not there. Mr Tim Fischer-What is it in Victoria?",79
120,Mr KEATING,BUDGET STATISTICS,"That is the position. Tell the South Australian public that the coalition is opposed to any assistance to improve water quality. Tell South Australian members to put out a press release when they go home, particularly the old idiot son of the Establishment over there-Opposition members-Withdraw!",80
121,Mr SPEAKER,BUDGET STATISTICS,Order! The Treasurer will withdraw that remark.,80
122,Mr KEATING,BUDGET STATISTICS,"I will just talk about the son of the Establishment and leave the rest. Opposition members-No, withdraw!",80
123,Mr KEATING,BUDGET STATISTICS,"Of course. I withdraw. Tell us about water salinity in the Murray in South Australia. Tell us about lition's opposition to programs to support desalination and clean water quality for Adelaide. Let us get that on the record as well. Let us also get on the record its attitude, as far as it goes, to transport improvements in' Perth. Let us get on the record the fact that the Liberal Party is opposed to adjustment assistance in Tasmania, water quality improvements in South Australia for the city of Adelaide, and transport improvements in Western Australia for the city of Perth. BUDGET 1990-91 : FISCAL POLICY",80
124,Mr GEAR,BUDGET STATISTICS,My question is also to the Treasurer. I refer him to some commentary since the Budget' that the stance of fiscal policy is not sufficiently tight. Can the Treasurer inform the House what is the appropriate role for fiscal policy?,80
125,Mr KEATING,BUDGET STATISTICS,"I made it clear in the House yesterday and in other places that fiscal policy remains exceptionally tight and that this Budget, which brings in the same surplus as in the previous year in a slower economy, means that fiscal policy' will have a larger impact on the economy this year than last year's surplus had on the economy. If one compares this year's surplus and looks for the underlying trends, a surplus of $8.1 billion includes $1.2 billion in tax cuts, which would otherwise make the amount $9.3 billion, and about $1 billion in unemployment benefit. If one were trying to adjust the figures in cyclicaf terms,' that would make a surplus of about $10 billion. That is a measure of what we have done. The Leader of the Opposition, speaking on AM on 22 August, said: I think you can cut welfare expenditure more. He further said: It's not tough and it's not very fair . . . I think we should have cut or he should have cut much more significantly than he has . . . it's not tough at all. It's . . . a significant easing of fiscal policy . . . Speaking on The Midday Show the Leader of the Opposition said about social security: · . . I believe he could have cut three billion overall. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said the coa- on The Midday Show: · . . this budget hasn't gone nearly far enough . . . Last night on television the Leader of the National Party of Australia said: · . . for many farmers with low income but large assets, they will now be tripped into poverty limbo as a consequence of the measures in this Budget. The honourable member for Flinders is nodding. That is what he said. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition attacks us for not being hard enough and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition attacks us for not being hard enough. The Leader of the National Party scampers around the television stations, particularly those in rural constituencies, saying, 'Look what they have done in relation to the assets test.' That is an absolute double standard. Honourable members opposite are trying to be hairy-chested about fiscal policy but privately they are apologising for their leaders' views, saying that the measures are too hard and are tripping people into a poverty limbo. This is the problem with the coalition. It is like the gang that cannot shoot straight. It has never known what its policy stance ought to be. In public office, whenever Treasurer Howard tried to move the public debate along, the agrarian rump of the National Party always held him back.",80

Members of the coalition are now parading their hairy-chested fiscal stance, but the National Party slips out of that posture and is out there playing the old game of trying to featherbed the show. They have done us a favour, making their duplicitous behaviour clear, by bemoaning on television the day after the Budget social reforms and changes to outlays. But we were then attacked by the Leader of the Opposition, who told us that they were not enough. NA",81
128,Mr ANDERSON,POSTAGE STAMPS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Customs in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services. In light of the Budget decision to scrap lc and 2c coins, does the Minister now believe that the recently announced increase in the price of stamps from 41c to 43c, due to take effect on 3 September, should be revised? If so, does the Minister believe that the postage rate for ordinary mail should be rounded up to 45c or down to 40c? If not, can the Minister confirm that Australians will now be required to purchase stamps in multiples of five, costing $2.15, because they will not be able to get change for any lesser number of stamps?",81

135,Mr SPEAKER,POSTAGE STAMPS,Do Opposition members wish me to rule the question out of order?,81
136,Mr ROBERT BROWN,POSTAGE STAMPS,"The decision on stamps was made before the decision was made and announced to withdraw the I c and 2c pieces from early October. Australia Post is conscious of the implications. In light of the fact that that increased price was approved by the Prices Surveillance Authority, as a result of a reference by the Government, there is no reason why the increase should not go ahead. The I c and 2c coins are not to be withdrawn immediately, so anyone who wants to get a 43c stamp after those increases are provided for will still have access to Ic and 2c coins until those coins are eventually withdrawn from the system. In addition, if people do not have Ic or 2c coins, there is nothing to prevent them buying those stamps in blocks of five or blocks of 10. There are no difficulties created by the decision to increase the cost of the stamps to 43c. I would point out that not only was that increase in the cost of stamps subject to and approved by the Prices Surveillance Authority. For the benefit of those people who may not be aware of this fact, I point out that in the past 15 years, had Australia Post increased the cost of the standard postage stamp for standard letters in accordance with the increase in the consumer price index, they would not now cost 41c but 65c. The proposed increase represents an increase in the cost of the standard letter rate of about 4.9 per cent when, during the period to which that increase relates, the increase in the consumer price index was some 6.5 per cent. Therefore, on both counts there has been significant restraint in the cost of standard postage in Australia. I repeat that there are no difficulties created by the withdrawal of the lc and 2c coins.

137,Mr GIBSON,EDUCATION,I address my question to the Minister for Higher Education Employment Services. Will he advise the available in 1983. House of the reason for presenting growth for 1993 in higher education operating grants in terms of dollars rather than in student numbers? What are the implications of this change?,82
138,Mr BALDWIN,EDUCATION,"The Government's demographic decisions in the Budget concerning higher education continue the commitment to rapid growth in the system. Over the past few years there has been very rapid growth in the operating grant and particularly the capital program for higher education. Most of the discussion leading up to the Budget coming from the sector organisaof tions such as the Vice-Chancellors Comgroups-a mittee and so forth tended to seek undertakings for 1993 growth, which is what we are talking about in this Budget under the rolling triennium arrangement, and to talk about a specific number of places. For example, the vice-chancellors sought growth of 3,000 additional places for 1993. We have announced that for growth 1993 in terms of new places there will allocated an additional $28.4m in Decemeffort ber 1988-89 dollars. If one does a simple division of that figure by 3,000, one comes out with a figure of $9,450 per place per effective full-time student, which the basic unit of account in higher eduresearch cation. That represents a substantial increase on average rates of funding which are now running at $8,656 per effective full-time student unit. This does something to address a concern which has emerged in the sector about the fact that throughout most of the 1980s we had funding at marginal rates and hence a fall in the number of dollars per effective full time student unit. Following some concerns, that situation will start to turn around in 1992, but the funding decision for 1993 allows for continued substantial growth at levels broadly consistent with what the sector has been seeking, but to do that in the context of significantly increased average rates of funding. That continues a very substantial growth in the system which between 1988 and 1993 will involve growth of some 70,000 places. That represents a 60 per and cent increase on the number of places The reason that we have expressed the position in dollar terms rather than in places is because a number of complex issues have to be addressed concerning the composition of that growth. There are changes taking place which will mean that the number of people in the 17to 19-year-old age group is projected to decline by 1995. As against that we have increasing levels of year 12 retenin tions and we continue to expect high levels of transfer to higher education. We are also continuing to expect increasing levels participation by people in the older age 1.2 million population growth in the 25to 64-year-old group. About half of the applicants for higher education places come from that age bracket. Weighing up this complex range of issues, together with the fact that there is expected to be a significant problem in the availability of suitably trained staff for the higher education sector between now in and the end of the century, which will be mean that we need to try to increase the in the postgraduate area, we wanted to preserve a degree of flexibility in the composition of that growth. That flexibilor ity will apply as between undergraduate is and postgraduate places, the number of degrees and also will give us some degree of flexibility to talk to the institutions as part of our annual profile negotiCustody-Report ations about the actual rate at which those Tabipa additional places will be funded. We could go for 3,000 additional places at that significantly higher funding. On the other hand, we could go for a somewhat lower figure for growth in port 1989. 1993 but increase the proportion of postgraduate places. That may well be the appropriate way to go, all things considered. There is a range of issues to which we want to give further consideration. That will take place in the coming months as we negotiate with each individual injourned. stitution as part of the profile process. REPORT OF THE AUDITORNA",82

145,Mr NA BROWN,TELECOMMUNICATIONS," ter Mr Speaker, the most notable feature the recent Budget, apart from the fact it contained no solutions to the major economic problems facing this country, was that it was completely devoid of information whatsoever about what are liver. now referred to as micro-economic reforms-that is, those reforms to our basic infrastructure that are so necessary to modernise this country and advance its economic progress. When people on this side of the House and in the media asked why this was so, the Treasurer (Mr KeatThe ing) replied, 'Well, of course the Budget was not the place to put it; it is too detailed and you would not expect to get that sort of information at this time the year.' There are two very strong reasons it was quite reasonable to expect that the Budget would contain some answers to the micro-economic problems facing this country. The first is a fairly apparent litical reason, and that is simply that the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) told us time and time again that the Budget would contain an outline of the Government's micro-economic rereform whatsoever. forms. Both the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have said this month after month and, after all, this was to be the great renaissance tapestry-was it not?-the last few golden years of the Hawke Governsome ment when we were going to see the rethe maining economic problems of this meaningful country tackled fairly and squarely and solved. Time seems to pass so fast these days and many people have forgotten that mentous and significant letter that the Prime Minister sent to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) shortly after the last election. inaThat letter was leaked-apparently so that we would all know that the Government really did have an agenda and a plan for micro-economic reform. When the Prime Minister wrote that letter he made two significant points: first, that the Government had fallen' down on the job of reform in its third term; and, secondly, that the present term would he different. This would be the time, said the Prime Minisin this significant letter, when microof reform would be tackled, when the rethat maining problems in telecommunications and transport, on the waterfront and in shipping would all be faced fairly and any squarely; and the Government would deThat was shortly after the election and between that time and today one decision has been made in the area of telecommunications. But by no stretch of the imagination could one call it a reform. one action taken by the Minister for Transport and Communications has been, of course, to put additional funds into Aussat, the company that runs Australia's of domestic satellite system-a system which the present Government has virtually driwhy ven into bankruptcy by starving it and restricting the area in which it can operate. The one act of micro-economic reform has been to prop up a government pobureaucracy. Let us get that fairly and squarely on the record and let us establish the fact at the outset that with that one exception there has not been the slightest attempt to introduce any micro-economic Apart from the Australian Labor Party's own internal troubles, apart from this internecine fighting between the rival factions, and apart from the control that of the trade union heavies have over Labor Party which has prevented any steps being taken in this area, there is another and far more important reason why an agenda for micro-economic reform should be outlined by the Governmoment and made clear to the people. The simple reason is that this nation needs it. Let me concentrate for a moment on the one field of telecommunications with which this matter of publ,ic importance deals. When one looks at telecommunications around the world one comes very quickly to one clear conclusion-and that is that the rest of the developed world has adopted and is continuing to adopt competition as the basic thrust and the underlying principle of their own telecommunications systems. People who live in other developed countries are now starting to get the benefits from competition in their telecommunications systems. While that is going on, Australia remains locked in this monopoly mould and the Australian people are being denied the benefits of competition. Let us look just across the Tasman at New Zealand to see not what full competition has given that country but what the mere threat of competition in telecommunications has produced. New Zealand has embarked on competition, deregulation and privatisation. My colleague the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) will deal with this latter aspect later. The mere threat of the reality of competition in New Zealand has already produced results in telecommunications. The time for the installation of a telephone in that country has now dropped from six weeks to a matter of two to three days. The time for repairs to telephone equipment has dropped from two days to a mere number of hours. The number of lines in the telephone exchanges for which employees are responsible has jumped in t,hat very short time from 85 to 98. Indeed, the price of telephone calls between Auckland and Wellington, for instance, has substantially dropped. If one looks across the board at the typical basket of local service and inland calls in that country, one sees that the prices have dropped 21 per cent in real terms since New Zealand embarked upon its program of deregulation and competition. These are the sorts of results that the citizens of New Zealand are getting and those of Australia are being denied because we have not introduced competition in this country. That frankly is the principal reason why we need a program of competition in telecommunications. We also need a program of pretty deep seated reform in our telecommunications system. Until we get that we will continue to be handicapped, as a result having a monopoly control over telecommunications. With that background, the Australian people are entitled to ask, 'What are the agendas, the policies and the positions of the present Government and the Opposition in this area?'. We know, of course, about the performance going on inside the Labor Party because the sad history of it has been unveiled in the media over the last couple of months. That Party has factions which are tearing each other's throats out over this issue. The Government has become paralysed because it has to go off to its masters outside the Labor Party and the forces that control that Party to get its orders. While the country watches this demeaning spectacle of the Labor Party at play, we suffer because our telecommunications system cannot be reformed. In contrast to that, the Opposition has looked long and hard at this issue, and we believe that there is a program of reform which we suggest will bring great benefits to this country of the sort that I mentioned before in the case of New Zealand. The touchstone of this problem, the touchstone of the solution itself, is competition. We say to the Australian people that competition should be the first priority in reform of telecommunications; and we support full and open competition. We believe that that competition should go as far as competition in network services, that private sector operators should be allowed to connect to the basic Telecom network and that there is an obvious area of immediate competition that could be allowed and should be allowed, and that is in the growth field of mobile telephones. We believe that the report by Austel, the independent authority that looks over this area and regulates it, on private networks should be implemented immediately. We believe that the resale of areas which are leased to private network operators should be allowed. If we loosen up this area we will get competition, investment, employment growth and, above all, benefits to the consumer, and that surely should be the end objective of it. There are a number of easy reforms which the Government can and should make. We have already said this session and last session that the Government can carry out certain reforms quite easily. For example, the proposal by Austel on private networks does not require legislation; it requires only a ministerial direction. We moved in the Parliament some months ago that that direction should be given, and it is a matter of great regret, I believe, that the Government would not even allow that to go to a vote. We put this as a bipartisan suggestion: that major reform can be implemented virtually overnight. There are private network operators in Australia. They are restricted, of course, by the fact that at the moment there has to be a common interest between them. Austel has said that that need not be so and that if we take the stranglehold off the development of those private networks there will be an immediate injection of additional investment and an immediate expansion of the private telecommunication sector in this country. Surely that is a reform; surely it is harmless; surely it is something that can be done very quickly and something which will immediately, as I say, commence to give to the consumer and to those who use telecommunications great benefits indeed. I The program is supported by a responsible attitude towards privatisation which my colleague the honourable member for Bass will amplify in more detail later on. But the point is that there is a program here and it is based on the benefits and the attractions of competition which have, of course, been delivered to virtually the whole of the developed world with which we like to compare ourselves. But we are denied it as of today by this unseemly brawl within the Labor Party and its absolute paralysis and apparent impossibility about making decisions on these matters. Furthermore, we have put these matters into a private member's Bill which was introduced into the Parliament today. So there is a touchstone, a beacon, something which the Government can revolve its own policies around, and we urge the Government to do so because it is a sensible, balanced and reasonable proposal; it is not, as someone described it to me today, open slather. It would require, of course, a responsible attitude towards licences being issued and responsible conduct on the part of those who hold those licences. But the program is there, and it involves giving a procompetitive charter to Austel. It involves necessarily bringing the monopolies to an end and all of the unfortunate results that monopolies visit on an economy. It involves opening the doors to competition and it involves, as I say, a responsible attitude towards the issuing of licences. These things can be done comparatively easily. But if the Government lets things go on as it is at the moment apparently paralysed and apparently unable to reach decisions, then, of course, two things will follow. First of all, the Government will not get legislation on these reforms, even if it does come up with reforms this year. It is now almost too late. The second thing is it will lock the results of monopolies into Australia for an even longer time and it will deny those benefits to the Australian people that they could get from a competitive regime. So we put these matters forward, Mr Deputy Speaker, in a constructive way. We say simply to the Government that in the interests of the people, industry, commerce and business in this country these matters should be taken up as quickly as possible.",84
146,Mr BEAZLEY,TELECOMMUNICATIONS,"Swan-Minister for Transport and Communications) (3.16)The Opposition claims it has an alternative to the position of the Government, which is going through an orderly decision-making process to establish the basis of competition in the telecommunications industry in this country. The Opposition, as in so many other areas of policy at the moment, argues by declaration and not with evidence. A farrago of nonsense is contained in this press release which is, with about one or two additional pieces of information, introduced and put around the gallery on a fortnightly basis, by the Opposition spokesman on communications, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown). The basis of this will not be the basis of competition in the communications industry. The sort of argument that he brought down as to what we confront in the rest of the developed world is another of these sets of declarations for which there is no evidence. The fact of the matter is that the rest of the developed world does not adopt competition models for progress in its telecommunications industry. The vast bulk of the European telecommunications industry is monopoly. The vast bulk of the rest of the telecommunications industry is a managed duopoly or a managed oligopoly. Only two countries have thus far declared themselves in favour of the type of competition which allegedly is the basis of Opposition policy in this area. They happen to be Sweden which maintains still a government monopoly effectively and there is New Zealand where we are yet to see whether or not competition emerges. I would strongly suggest it will not emerge because the basis on which competition will emerge in New Zealand will be at the discretion of the newly privatised New Zealand telecommunications company at the price which it determines its opposition will interconnect with the system. This is the sort of nonsense which has bedevilled the Opposition's claims about telecommunications from the day it started debating us after the last election. I will go one point further. It will be interesting for people to hear the argument that privatising Telecom will advantage opportunities for competition in this country, and this is where we get into some of the absurdities, assertions and contradictions. Within the framework of full and effective competition in telecommunications a Liberal and National party government states that it will proceed with the privatisation of Telecom, OTe and Aussat; fine, that is $20 billion worth of assets. People will have to get together, if we are not going to operate 'on the basis of fire sale prices, $20 billion worth of capital, and replete throughout this statement is that it should be Australian. A specific matter that will be taken into account in the awarding of licences will be the degree of Australian ownership of the applicant. And the privatisation of Telecom and OTe will be managed so as to ensure that Australians retain majority ownership and control of strategic telecommunication assets. So not only do Australian investors have to somehow find $20 billion worth of investment; they also have to find investment to put into the alternatives to these. To set up an alternative network to Telecom we are talking about a minimum $3 billion. So if we are to have two or three of these alternative networks in this era of open contestability that is another $9 billion. To set up any sort of decent private network on the sort of basis that the Opposition is talking is probably a couple of hundred million, so we are talking a few billion more there. if we are to get open competition. I will tell honourable members this: there will be no competition in the telecommunications industry when sitting at the heart of it is the privatisation of the largest business enterprise in Australia. If there is going to be competition it can only be on one basis, when we get down to the practical realities of it, and that is that it is essentially foreign owned competition from this point onwards. Opposition members cannot walk around this place telling the press gallery some nonsense about the Opposition having a policy on competition. It does not. They have here a policy in practical terms that has been confronted in Britain and in New Zealand, and the issue is: Is it competition or is it the sale of the main carrier? In the end the priorities of those governments went to, as they necessarily would have to on the issue of privatisation, the main carriers. The amount of investment that has to be obtained to be able to do that ensures that one goes to the issue of privatisation of the main carriers. One has no choice. So, no matter what the Opposition might assert in this document, when it took the decision to privatise Telecom it effectively took a decision against, to any serious extent, the introduction of competition into the system. When the shadow Minister said, effectively, that it all has be Australian owned, including the privatised Telecom and the privatised everyone else, he amplified the decision that competition could not be introduced. The Opposition's preoccupation will be the privatisation of Telecom. Let us start challenging, too, some of this nonsense that emanates from the Opposition on the subject of whether or not Australian consumers face a crisis in the area of telecommunications. I happen to believe that Telecom requires competition. I do not do so on the basis that I believe that Telecom has confronted the Australian community, Australian business and the ordinary consumer, with a telecommunications mess. Telecom, on any set of statistics, is a good performer. To my mind, however, it is not a great performer and it needs to be a great performer if it is going to provide Australian business in general and the Australian telecommunications industry with the sort of competitive advantage that will enable us to exploit opportunities in our immediate region. But it does not confront us with a crisis. It does not confront consumers in the bush with a crisi's, as it has a $530m program under way to make certain that they have equal access to the sorts of facilities that are enjoyed by people in the metropolitan areas. The people in both the metropolitan areas and the bush that are the recipients of at least $230m worth of community service obligations (CSOs) are not being disadvantaged by this. On the current situation, there is some disadvantage to business because subscriber trunk dialling rates and international communication rates are too high. Nevertheless, over the last decade they have .fallen by factors from 70 to 85 per cent. So it is not as though price reductions are not being experienced in that area as well. Therefore, there is no crisis in the telecommunications area that justifies for one minute the Opposition's decision to deal with the issue of competition on the basis that it has chosen. The Opposition wants to go down the road of privatising Telecom and setting aside a great national resource for exploito tation on bases it has not established, as well as introduce competition when the practicalities have to be examined. We sit here on this side of the House receiving hundreds and hundreds of pages of documentation on the implications of how we introduce competition into an industry where there are enormous barriers to access in practical terms. What do we get as an alternative to that from the people who say they are so well prepared? Two pages of drivel every fortnight. That is what we get from the Opposition who says in this area that it is so well prepared. That is nonsense. It is also nonsense if Opposition members believes they can deliver a policy of competition with what they are proposing, having put at the heart of it ,selling off Telecom. It is also nonsense If they assume that they can protect community service obligations through this. I do not want to go too far into that area because this is going to be a most interesting area of debate for us as time goes by. Opposition members are saying to us they are going to place at least $230m of CSOs on budget. If we actually look at what is important to the Leader of the National Party, he would also want to place on budget that additional $530m that we have been talking about. If we really went into an analysis of CSOs on the sort of basis that we would have to with regard to the Opposition's program, we could go a figure much greater than that. We already know, from what the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said in this House, the difficulty that they have in their consumption tax proposals with coming up with a solution that will provide both tax cuts and compensation. So on top of the problems that they are going to confront on budget with this, they are going to have to address also the issue of finding some extra $3 billion for compensation if they are not to reduce the Government's Budget surplus by introducing a con sumption tax. Does anybody seriously believe that the community service obligations which are important to ensuring that the ordinary consumer receives access to telecommunications at a reasonable price would continue to be fulfilled? We do have, as I said earlier in this speech, some very substantial opportunities as far as the development of the communications system in our immediate region are concerned. Currently there are about 400 million telephones in the world. Telecom provides 8 million of them here and there are about 50 million of them in Asia, outside Japan, at this moment. Over the next decade and a half there will be something like 400 million phones going into the Asian region. There is an opportunity here to create for Australia an industry, a telecommunications company, at least the size of the contemporary American A,T and T company. We can either become a totally inward looking country in the way in which we go about competition, or we can become a country which addresses seriously the opportunities in the telecommunications industry both here and elsewhere. What the Opposition is proposing here is vandalism. It is not proposing competition; it is proposing vandalism. Its agenda will become massively confused the moment it starts to go down this road. When it starts to work out how we get Australians to get together $15 billion, or whatever it is, for buying out Telecom, and the $4 billion for OTC Ltd, it will become enormously confused about its obligations concerning competition.

My recollection of what oc10 curred is that the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) quite properly called a quorum to give an opportunity to members of the Government parties, as well as members of the Opposition, listen to the debate.

They are much more generously treated by this House since we have been in office than they were generally under periods of Libpart eral government years ago. They are raised by the Opposition; never since we have been around have they been raised by the Government. But when we were in opposive sition they were raised by the Governtremely ment.

JINDALEE OVER-THE-HORIZON NA Reference to Public Works Committee",90
151,Mr BEDDALL,RADAR,"1 That, in accordance with the provisions of the Act 1969, the following proposed referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration report: Jindalee Over-the-Horizon Radar.",90
152,Mr BEDDALL,RADAR,"Through their inforare mation policy paper The Defence of AusA dectralia 1987 the Federal Government announced a commitment to defence self reliance and the development of a defence force capable of meeting the unique strategic demands of Australia. A significant of Australia's achieving self-reliance rests with our ability to detect and prevent an attack by aggressors through air and sea approaches. In light of our expancoastline, Australia is obviously exvulnerable. The Government has placed a high priority on the development of an extensive radar network capable of area surveillance of these vast air and sea approaches. The Jindalee over the-horizon-radar is being developed to Since the 1960s scientists have been investigating the development of a system such as Jindalee. The Jindalee design uses state of the art technology and Australia is leading the world in this type of defence facility. Unlike traditional groundbased radars which can only see as far as the horizon, Jindalee will scan over the horizon by beaming signals which will be refracted off. the ionosphere to illuminate a target. Echo from the target will then travel by a similar path back to a receiver. The sophisticated Jindalee system is expected to be able to detect ships and aircraft up to 3,000 kilometres away via this simple concept. The present phases of the project will involve major installations in the goldfields area of Western Australia and near Longreach in Queensland. The network is estimated to cost in excess of $600m and will significantly enhance the ability of Australia's defence forces to effectively monitor air and sea movements across our remote northern approaches. The system is expected to be operational by the mid-1990s and, in addition to its major defence role, will have other significant applications. For example, it should be able to provide a deterrent to illegal immigration and drug smuggling from neighbouring South East Asia as well as providing valuable weather information and assistance in aircraft safety and search and rescue operations. Phased over five years, development of the new installation will involve not only the erection of sophisticated radar equipment but also construction of facilities to house the equipment and operations centres at each radar location and the main management cell at RAAF Edinburgh in South Australia. The project will provide employment opportunities and economic activity in the remote areas which will house each installation and, once operational, each radar will employ between 20 and 30 maintenance personnel, mainly civilian. Aware of the impact which such a project may have on the residents of the remote areas affected by the network, Defence is actively pursuing avenues of public consultation and is developing effective relationships with the local communities, all of which generally support the project. I table selected drawings and diagrams of the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar and I commend the motion to the House.",90
153,Mr HAWKER,RADAR,"The Opposition supports this reference to the Public Works Committe-. We have these references very regularly and I should pay tribute to the work that the members of the Public Works Committee put into the various references they get. Their diligence and their dedication I think all honourable members would admire. In fact, it is worth noting that in the last two years the Public Works Committee has looked at projects each year in excess of $1 billion, which is quite a lot, and certainly some are very large projects. With the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar reference, I think it is worth noting a number of things. It has been pointed out that Australia has had a very significant role in and has been the prime source of development of this project. In fact, it can be claimed that it was designed in Australia, and for that reason I think we can be justifiably proud. As has been pointed out by the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), the capabilities of the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar are quite significant. The fact that it can pick up ships or aircraft up to 3,000 kilometres away is a significant improvement over traditional ground-based radars. There is a significant investment of over $600m and while it may not be until the mid-1990s that this will be fully operational and have a major defence role, nonetheless all honourable members should be aware that the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar is designed to be complementary to an airborne early warning system. This was pointed out in the 1987 White Paper and to date we have seen no provision by this Government of that complementary role of the airborne early warning system. This is something that should be brought to the attention of all honourable members. While it is likely we will have a very good system when the new radar system is brought into use, it will not be as effective as it could be if it does not have that complementary system working in tandem with it. While no doubt it will also provide some deterrent to illegal immigration and smuggling, I think we have to be realistic: that is not its major role, and I suspect will not be a major part of its role. Maybe it will not even have a major bearing on this nation. the detection of illegal trade, even though it may assist in some cases. Nonetheless, it is likely that it will be concentrating very much on defence matters. As I have said, the Public Works mittee has been working hard and demove: serves to be commended for what it is doing. Generally it could be said that the references that are made to the Public Works Committee are well treated and the Committee is well informed. HowCustoms ever, I understand that there has been one recent submission-a current submission that has already been referred to the lic Works Committee-known as the South Bank project, which related to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The General Manager of the ABC, Mr Hill, has been taking an attitude which arguasubheading bly could be seen as flying in the face 1 July 1990. of-Mr Beddall- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I never want to stifle debate we have a very specific motion before in relation to the Jindalee over-the-horiNo.5 zan radar reference to the Public Works Committee. I do not think the ABC has the capability to operate over-the-horizan radar. Mr SPEAKER..l.. - The honourable memhaust ber for Wannon might get back to the subject before the House.",91
154,Mr HAWKER,RADAR,"Thank you, Mr Commission's Speaker. Yes, I was referring to things that could work over the horizon and would have thought the ABC was very capable of doing that. In fact, I think is what is of concern to at least one ber of the Public Works Committee-that members. it might be doing too much of that operating over the horizon.",92
155,Mr SPEAKER,RADAR,"We are also not going to have a general debate on the Public Works Committee, either.",92
156,Mr HAWKER,RADAR,I will come back to Jindalee reference and to the specific tion before the House. The Opposition obviously supports this reference to the drug Public Works Committee. No doubt the Committee in its deliberations will look it very carefully and closely at what is being done that should enhance the defence of Question resolved in the affirmative. NA,92

158,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"On Tuesday the the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr moPeacock) raised as a matter of pri vilege statements in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald. The article was headed 'The murder story that won't go to press'. The first paragraph read: For quite some time. I have been sitting story about a (Federal) Cabinet Minister, one of Australia's Mr Bigs of Business, and what looks like a very grubby murder. The bulk of the article deals with the of defamation and related issues. The honourable member for Kooyong quoted from May's Parliamentary Practice as folticular member. lows: Reflections upon members, the particular viduals not being named or otherwise indicated, are equivalent to reflections on the House. There have indeed been examples in this House of allegations against unidentified members having been raised and pursued been made out. as matters of privilege or contempt. A notable example occurred in 1971 when the House referred to the Committee of Privileges a letter to the editor published by the Australian accusing members of accepting bribes. The publication was found to constitute a contempt. Since the enactment of the Parliamentary Privileges been committed. Act 1987, however, two aspects of particular relevance to this complaint have changed. Section 4 of the Act provides that: conduct (including the use of words) does constitute an offence . . . unless it amounts, is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or' a committee of its authority or functions, the free performance by a member of the ber's duties as a member; Section 6 of the Act provides that: Words or acts shall not be taken to be an offence . . . by reason onlyI emphasise 'only''that those words or acts are defamatory or cal of the Parliament, a House, a committee ora member. A defamatory statement may still be regarded as a contempt but it cannot be held to be a contempt just because it is defamatory. In other words, there must be another aspect-for example if there is intimidation involved or intended. I acknowledge that the statements referred to by the honourable member for Kooyong may not only be defamatory. They also imply a most serious charge. My duty in these matters is not to reach any conclusions on the substantive question, but rather to conclude whether a on a prima facie case has been made out. There is, to my knowledge, no evidence that the statement or its publication has obstructed or interfered with the proper law operation of the House, any committee of the House, members generally or any parMy conclusion, therefore, on the eviindidence and information presented by the honourable member for Kooyong, and having regard to the Parliamentary Privileges Act and the precedents available to me, is that a prima facie case has not I agree with the honourable member's statement that the allegations are a slur of the most serious nature.

NA LABORATORIES (CONVERSION INTO PUBLIC COMPANY) BILL Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 August, on motion by Mr Howe: That the Bill he now read a second time. upon which Mr Smith has moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not opposing the passage of this limited Bill, the House is of the opinion that: (1) CSL should be fully privati sed immediately; and (2) there should be a full and complete divestment of all the Commonwealth interest and control in CSL as is proposed by this Bill.""",93
160,Mr MACKELLAR,COMMONWEALTH SERUM,"Warringah) (4.00)As previous members of the Opposition stated at an earlier stage of this debate, the coalition naturally supports the conversion of Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL) to a public company to be called the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd. Such a transfer is in keeping with our privatisation principles and, as previous Opposition speakers have said, we would like to see the whole thing go straight away. In saying that, I suggest that the response from both sides of the House, but particularly from the Government side, to the Opposition's amendment has been strictly ideological. There has been a very blinkered approach, particularly from the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), when any suggestion has been made that the public interest could best be served by privatising an entity such as CSL. In looking at any of these questions, we must put the public interest first. I think there are distinct advantages in looking at the selling off or privatisation of CSL. I am not saying that that is the case with all government bodies, but certainly there is a very cogent case to be made in relation to CSL. CSL has a long and distinguished history; an important turning point was a provision made in 1961 under a coalition government to allow it to take limited commercial operations. In the subsequent 29 years it has evolved into a primarily commercial operation. For example, of the total operating revenues of $121.9m in 1987-88, $115.1m came from commercial operations. The remainder, $6.8m, came from departmental appropriations to finance a range of services, which the CSL maintained in the national interest and which could not be sustained on a commercial basis. I share some of the views of honourable members on the Government side on this matter. It is those operations which are maintained in the national interest which make the CSL such a unique and worthwhile body. These are in addition to the commercial operations that it undertakes so successfully. In his second reading speech on 16 May this year, the. Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) referred to CSL's recent revenue and profit performance. A figure which was not mentioned-and I am taking part in this debate to highlight it because I believe it warrants special attention-is CSL's expenditure on research and development (R and D). In 1987-88 research and development expenditure was $12.4m. This is a particularly significant figure in relation to the $122m revenue in that same year. Of that $12.4m, $9.8m was CSL-funded and only $2.6m came from ministerially directed programs. There is little doubt in my mind that the success of CSL is very closely linked to its emphasis on research and development and to the research, technical, administrative and managerial skills of its work force. I believe that CSL is worthy of great praise. It has earned great credit because of its Rand D expenditure-not just for the expenditure but also for the extraordinarily worthwhile results which have come from that expenditure. This is an example to a number of other companies throughout Australia, because we always speak about the need for more research and development. Unfortunately, the level of Rand D amongst private and public organisations in Australia is, to my mind, far too low. Here we have a laboratory which has really set out to maintain excellence and to capitalise on that excellence. In his speech the Minister also referred to the success of CSL in overseas markets and its winning of several export awards. Again, this warrants some expansion as CSL's record is very impressive indeed, given the generally poor performance of Australian enterprises in penetrating, retaining and developing overseas markets. For example, in 1987-88 CSL exported $11.7m worth of products, which was 9.6 per cent of total revenue. As I suggested previously, this is an excellent export performance by Australian standards. I was first associated in a direct way with CSL when I became the Minister for Health in late 1979. I was always impressed by the vigour and foresight of the people who were in senior positions in that organisation. I have not heard any previous mention of Dr Neville MCCarthy in this debate. I think he deserves great credit for the results which CSL achieved whilst he was doing such a splendid job of direction there. Another person who deserves great credit is a former Minister for Health, Dr Jim Forbes, who headed up the organisation for a number of years and, again, oversaw the continuing development of CSL-not only in the expansion of its product range but also in the success of its Rand D and its export drive. The pharmaceutical industry is a difficult industry. CSL has really been carrying a lone flag in Australia. It is a very expensive industry to be in and, unfortunately, I believe that there has not been enough support for and emphasis on the pharmaceutical industry generally in Australia in recent times. But CSL has carried the flag and a great number of Australians have every reason to be very grateful for its existence, particularly because of the expertise of those people who took part in the development of anti-venenes and all sorts of products which have, in a very real sense, saved peoples' lives over many years. The coalition is supportive of corporatisation of statutory authorities, as we have said. I do not think that people should look at privatisation simply on an ideological basis which, unfortunately, seems to drive the remarks of one particular faction within the Labor Party. As members of parliament, we need to look at the authorities that are under consideration and work out where the public interest will best be served. An organisation such as this requires access to capital funds if it is to expand in the way we would like to see it expand. Those funds can most frequently be gained most successfully from the private sector rather than public sector. At present we have a number of government organisations which are literally starving for capital funds and which would not have that same sense of deprivation if they were private entities. Even the healthiest government enterprises are unable to find future capital requirements exclusively through retained earnings. That is a very strong argument in favour of privatising CSL. Another reason is efficient and economic performance. All available evidence shows that the rate of return on capital employed in public enterprises is significantly lower than in the private sector. I acknowledge that in certain instances the public sector undertakes enterprises which are not necessarily profit gaining. Some aspects of CSL's operation fall into this category. Nevertheless, taken overall, there is little to argue with the proposition that the rate of return on capital employed in public enterprises falls significantly below the rate that is generally realised in the private sector. A distinct argument can be put on consumer benefits in quality, price and service. In fact, the debate earlier this afternoon on the Telecom Australia situation and associated discussions are all about consumer benefits in quality, price and service. There is no doubt that the whiff of competition does marvellous things for the concentration of people involved with the organisation. and direction of public enterprises. The other matter I mention is employee participation. Employees who are part of CSL. owners of any organisation have a direct interest ""in the successful and efficient operation of their enterprise. I am speaking generally, because I have no doubt that the employees of CSL over the years have demonstrated a degree of commitment which is truly commendable. The corporatised CSL will meet all requirements-funding, efficient and ecostep-that nomic performance, c:;onsumer benefits and employee participation-and it is my personal hope that this or a future governmaceutical ment will enable CSL to undertake modbut internationally. est capital restructuring which will allow for participatory employee shareholding. If one aspect of industrial relations needs even more attention, I think it is that encouraging employee participation within the industries in which they are working. It gives employees a direct interest making sure that their work is productive and that the products they are involved in producing are competitively priced and acceptable in the marketplace. I conclude by saying that CSL has a very proud history in its particular marketplace. A number of world firsts have originated from the research and develGovernment opment undertaken by CSL. It has played a most important role in supporting the general health of the Australian commutraitorous nity. It has demonstrated a real capacity to undertake viable commercial operaresearch tions. It has set an example through its concentration on research and developCSL ment. It has set an example in its capacity to successfully export. I believe that Government should look very carefully at the amendment moved by the Oppositices tion, which would allow CSL even greater freedom in the future-a freedom which, I have no doubt, would be of benefit not only to the organisation itself but to people of Australia.",94
161,Mr MCGAURAN,COMMONWEALTH SERUM,"Gippsland) (4.13)I have mixed feelings in speaking to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories body, (Conversion into Public Company) Bill 1990 because, on the one hand, I welcome the corporatisation of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories but, on the bther hand, genuinely regret the failure by the Government to move to full privatisation The legislation before the House demonstrates that organisations such as CSL, when bureaucratic exercises are conducted, lack the flexibility and adaptability to meet market needs. Moreover, these exercises are an inefficient use of resources. It is a matter of deep regret that four the Government has taken only half a is, of corporatisation-towards freeing up CSL so that it can vigorously pursue market opportunities in the pharindustry, not just domestically The legislation before the House also very neatly encapsulates the ideological of hang-ups of this Government, for it has failed to explain why CSL cannot move to full corporatisation. CSL itself wishes in full privatisation. The Government has recognised the problems of CSL only to a limited extent and has failed to implement the best solution to the difficulties that afflict that organisation. The best solution is privatisation. The legislation clarifies what privatisation is all about. The left wing of the insists that privatisation is profiteering or, alternatively, that the sale by government of its assets is somehow to the national interest. Yet the privatisation of CSL would transform a effort which has been hampered by an inability to utilise its resources. is very mindful of the international opportunities that exist by way of niche the markets in the pharmaceutical industry, yet it has been restricted. by work pracand overstaffing for a very long time. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that CSL has been riddled by restrictive work the practices. As CSL, like so many government bodies, gets closer to privatisation, we see the emergence of rational business practices which make CSL-or any other for that matter-a more competitive player in that industry. I have visited CSL and met with senior staff and appreciate first-hand their enthusiasm and dedication, and the investment that they are prepared to make as individuals in the furtherance of CSL's market share. Privatisation is essential writing that human effort of the major players within CSL. CSL, in its production schedules, has in the past exhibited great restrictions and limitations. The Government has not allowed CSL enthusiastically to grab opportunities where they may arise by way of niche markets in the pharmaceutical industry. One would be delving into the realms of the ridiculous to believe that CSL could ever hope to compete with the major pharmaceutical companies on a very competitive world stage. These niche markets, into which I am confident that CSL can tap, may not be high volume but are, nonetheless, rewarding. Niche markets can disappear almost as quickly as they appear, and CSL cannot afford to be late players on the stage. CSL must be flexible and competitive to exploit the openings when they appear. It cannot afford to be a lumbering, bureaucratic giant locked into certain production schedules and programs which allow it no flexibility to take advantage opportunities when and where they arise. Once CSL, or any other government instrumentality, is bogged down with bureaucracy and restrictive work practices, production schedules cannot be adapted. Privatisation, at least in the case of CSL-and it applies generally-is painful in the short term. Let us not kid ourselves: a considerable number of people are affected. They have to reassess their career paths. Nonetheless, in the long term interest, if not survivability, of CSL, vatisation has to occur. Since the move towards corporatisation has taken place, CSL has really taken on an entrepreneurial flair. There is a new imagination and determination to rejuvenate CSL by weeding out the old work practices and inefficiencies. In the past CSL was producing an enormous range of pharmaceuticals, few of which provided commercial returns; even fewer provided for community returns. Now, by narrowing its range of products and concentrating its expertise and marketing, it can chase niche markets to underthroughout the world. There has been an unleashing of a new culture in the organisation. It has a challenge. Members now believe that they are at the leading edge of an emerging organisation able to take advantage of their expertise. Instead of feeling that they are living out their careers in some dormant dinosaur, they are rejuvenated. They are hungry and ambitious, and that is the way it ought to be. That is what is demanded of them in a very competitive world. I might be pre-empting this, but let me give an example of a potential collaboration between CSL and another research institution. In my responsibilities as shadow Minister for science and technology, I have visited both CSL and the Cancer Transplantation Research Centre of Melbourne University, which has had extraordinary results over the past few years. Between those two bodies a diagnostic kit for the early detection of cancer could be produced. Once a research centre gets known for its activity and enthusiof asm, collaborative efforts take off. We cannot underestimate the importance of reputation in the scientific community. Therefore, it is extremely important to the future well-being of CSL that it not be regarded by industry or other research and development institutions as handicapped and hampered by government interference. The privatisation of CSL would assist in the raising of capital. We would see equity being taken by pharmaceutical companies. CSL would obtain commercial credibility and it would be treated priequally on world markets. It would be a new-found accountability to shareholders, a much more potent accountability than bland reports to Government Ministers. I challenge the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) in his summing up of this debate to advise the House, without employing ideological slogans and cliches, just why it is that CSL cannot be privatised. I wish CSL well in the future under corporatisation, as a fully privatised organisation under a coalition Government. In particular, I wish Brian MCNamee, the new chief executive officer, and his team the very best. They are determined and dedicated people. It is only the dead hand of this Government which hampers their efforts to make CSL a very prominent player on the world stage.",96
162,Mr HOWE,COMMONWEALTH SERUM,"Batman-Minister for Community Services and Health) (4.24)It is good to see members representing the conservative parties in the Parliament showing some interest in public enterprises. I remember that when I first became a Minister in this Government in 1983 I was responsible for something like 13 government enterprises. I visited not once but many times each of those enterprises over an 18-month period. In almost every case, those organisations were in appalling condition-starved for capital, poorly managed and working in an environment in which competition was not only discouraged but effectively prohibited. Many of those factories were unable to operate in a way that gave them any chance whatsoever to realise the very significant potential that so many of those factories had. It is very disappointing that we should have an amendment from the Opposition in this debate that would see the solution to the problems of a very complex-company with enormous potential in terms of an ideological slogan such as privati sation. Essentially, the Opposition's contribution to this debate is a farce. It says that one can solve the problems of an organisation such as the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (CSL), with all of the complexities and all the possibilities that exist, by getting rid of it. The Opposition effectively ignores taking any responsibility for the complexity of the organisation and for ensuring that there is a transition for that organisation into the modern world. Essentially, this indicates an incredible incapacity on the part of the Opposition to take responsibility. That is why at every Question Time we are confronted with the following position: on the one hand, outside the Opposition. whinges and whines about savings that might occur and measures that might be taken; on the other hand, in the chamber the Opposition says that the Government has to be tougher. The Opposition says that it is interested in this organisation developing and that it'has a great future-privatise it, get rid of it, get it out in the public sector. This kind of naive nonsense that comes from the Opposition indicates that it still has a long time to go in opposition before one would trust the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr MCGauran) for a day with a public enterprise. The speakers on the Opposition side have made a great deal of the issue of . privatising the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. What does this mean? It means, as I have suggested, a fire sale to private interests of an important public asset. In my view, this is not good enough. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories is an important asset with a variety of developing functions, including developing innovative pharmaceuticals and processing blood products. It is also the springboard that Australia can use to enter the highly competitive international market for pharmaceuticals. We want Australians to develop this expertise and to compete with international companies in the international market. One hears very little from the Opposition about the Australian interest, about the fact that there is a highly competitive world out there in which, no matter how good a local company may be, its potential for penetrating those international markets will be limited by the fact that we do not have the connections that we need. Wholesale privatisation would simply make the Serum Laboratories a sitting duck to be snapped up by one of the existing large scale players in the pharmaceutical market. Perhaps that is what we want. Rather than realising the potential and the value of CSL and thinking through what we might have to do to ensure that this company is competitive and is able to play an important role within that international pharmaceutical scene, the Opposition takes the simplistic view that might appeal to a few people in the gallery who are attracted to mad New Right ideas. The Opposition had charge of the CSL from 1961, with the exception of two or three years, through to 1983. In all that period of time it did not give the CSL what this Bill gives it. This Bill, which comes from this Government, enables the CSL to enter the market and vigorously compete where it is able to compete without the fetters of bureaucratic decision making processes. We have been the ones prepared to look at bureaucratic processes and to unravel the processes. To move from CSL for a moment, let us look at the Williamstown Naval Dockyard. There was an organisation which the Opposition was responsible for throughout the post-war period. When we came into government in 1983, it was at the stage where neither a bolt nor a rivet could be bought for the Williamstown Naval Dockyard without going through a series of government requisitions. This absolutely incredible bureaucracy was very much the creation of conservative governments. The CSL will be able to continue to develop its expertise in researching, developing and producing pharmaceuticals to sell on the international market. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories has been in existence for almost 75 years. Over the life of the last Government, it suffered badly from being starved of capital to develop its pharmaceutical capabilhave ities which are unique in Australia. One does not need to spend very much time down at the CSL to see that. This Government has taken the necessary step of giving CSL a structure which will enable it to develop its capacities the full, based on its board's commercial judgment, and to enter into joint ventures, giving it the ability to take advanto tage of the research and technological expertise of other international pharmaceutical companies without sacrificing Australian ownership and control. Commonwealth Serum Laboratories has the function of processing blood products. The Bill gives CSL a structure which will ensure that this important public interest function continues to be controlled by the Commonwealth. This would be impossible if the Opposition's poorly thought through proposal for wholesale privatisation were accepted. The Commonwealth would be at the mercy of a bare contractual relationship. If the privately owned corporation refused to continue to process blood products, the public would be left in the impossible position of having no reliable source of safe blood products. I need not emphasise that point in the light of recent stories in the newspapers about blood because of the HIV spectre. I believe that this Bill successfully enables the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories to develop its capacity to produce leading-edge pharmaceuticals which will successfully compete on the international market, protect the public interest and preserve a reliable, safe and sufficient supply of blood products. The Bill gives the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories the right structure to develop successfully. I do not want to take up any more of the time of the House. I have listened with interest to much of the debate and the contributions by honourable members on both sides of the House. I say this to the Opposition: To develop a policy is not to issue a slogan; it is to think through the processes of change to ensure that, step by step, what needs reversing is reversed. In that way, we will realise the role of organisations which in many ways become symbols of the past, rather than a means. of moving into the future and of taking our place as a country with an interest in international industry and a capacity to compete. Like a number of our enterprises, the to first stage with CSL was to ensure that it had the proper identity and a companytype structure in which people were able cooperate. We were able to put in place management which was committed not only to using existing research capabilities but also to reaching out and making links with other organisations. As the honourable member for Gippsland suggested, the laboratories may be able to make links with Melbourne University or other sources of technical expertise, using the considerable medical and research establishment in Melbourne to achieve a little more national autonomy and control in a key area of structural change. We reorganised the pharmaceutical retail industry-that was structural change. Hard decisions were made and there was incredible opposition. We went into an election and every one of our members was singled out. The coalition had a massive interest in knocking over seats in, for example, Victoria. People stood on the fence and did not make any real decisions to enable that change to occur. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) can look at me in that way, but that is the reality. Opposition members were prepared to stand aside because a hard decision was involved and they saw a short term political advantage to be gained, just as they did with the pilots.",98
163,Mr NA BROWN,COMMONWEALTH SERUM,I was wondering why the Labor Party was in such bad odour in Victoria. Why is that?,100
164,Mr HOWE,COMMONWEALTH SERUM,"I am glad that the honourable member attracted my attention. I seem to remember that his interest in privatisation goes back to the beginning of the 1980s. We are back to that again, with the coalition wanting to flog off Telecom Australia to the highest bidder, not worrying about the national interest or community service obligations. In dealing with the question of privatisation which the coalition put on the agenda in relation to CSL, we are aware of honourable members' ideological views. At the end of this debate on the Bill, I make a plea that honourable members forget a little of the ideology because we· can deal with that elsewhere. Let us ensure that we build on the history of these organisations in a creative way, rather than talk about some fire sale which will do nothing but depreciate an asset and throwaway that history.

Bill reported with an amendment; report-by leave-adopted. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Mr Howe)-by leave-read a third time. NA 1990 Second Reading Debate resumed from 22 August, on motion by Mr Duffy: That the Bill be now read a second time.  have before the House the Extradition Amendment Bill 1990, which seeks to make a number of changes to the existing provisions of the Extradition Act, to which I will refer for brevity as the Act. In 1988 the Parliament passed the Extradition Act 1988 and the Extradition (Repeal and Consequential Provisions) Act 1988. At the time the legislation was passed the former Attorney-General advised the House that the legislation was a result of a comprehensive review by his Department of the laws relating to extradition. That legislation replaced the former Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966 and the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act 1966. Now the Government introduces a Bill containing a number of amendments to the Extradition Act. The explanatory memorandum to the Bill advises: The need for amendments has become apparent in light of experience with the Act . . . Perhaps this is yet another example of the Government introducing legislation on an important topic without properly considering all the ramifications involved. Extradition is the formal surrender by one nation to another of an individual accused or convicted of an offence outside of its own territory but within the territory of the nation requesting surrender where the requesting nation is competent to try or punish the person. The High Court in Barton v. Commonwealth 1974, reported in volume 131 of the Commonwealth Law Reports at page 477, observed that the Commonwealth could, pursuant to prerogative power, request or accept the surrender of a person but that to extradite a person required statutory backing. It was also observed in that case that informal extradition could take place in the absence of international extradition arrangements. This fact has been recognised in cases in a related area dealing with the powers of deportation. I refer the House to the leading case of Znaty v. Minister for Immigration 1972, a decision of the High Court reported in volume 126 of the Commonwealth Law Reports at page one. In the ordinary course of things, and this is the general position under the Act, extradition arises pursuant to a bilateral or multilateral treaty. Principles of international law recognise no right to extradition apart from those rights recognised in treaties or other similar international arrangements. Extradition within Australia-that is, between the States-takes place, of course, pursuant to the provisions of the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in his second reading speech has advised the House that the Government has established a task force to negotiate modern extradition arrangements. The Opposition commends this action of the Attorney General as it is essential that Australia's extradition obligations be put on a modern footing in order to effectively combat crime, which transcends, after all, national borders. Until the late nineteenth century, extradition of fugitives was quite rare. Today it is quite common and constitutes an essential weapon in Australia's armoury against crime, which in recent years has taken on a markedly transnational character. I turn now to the provisions of the. Bill before the House. The amendments proposed in the Bill touch upon existing extradition laws in the following respects. First, they alter the regulation making power under section 11 of the Act, which is designed to give effect to Australia's international obligations concerning extradition, and modify the operation of the Act so that its provision may be subject to such international obligations. I refer there to clause 4 of the Bill, which I will deal with in more detail later. Secondly, they extend the presumption against bail to situations involving the review of extradition decisions. This is contained in clauses 6 and 8 of the Bill, and I will refer to those clauses in more detail in a moment. Thirdly, clause 7 of the Bill streamlines the procedure governing situations where a person consents to· being surrendered to New Zealand. Fourthly, clause 10 of the Bill will allow police to arrest without warrant persons in breach of bail conditions. where a police officer reasonably suspects that a person released on bail has or is about to contravene bail conditions. Finally, clause 11 will enable Australian magistrates to take evidence outside Australia for use in proceedings for the extradition of persons to Australia. I have taken the trouble to spell out the principle objectives of the Bill because it now appears commonplace for the Government to neglect to explain the provisions of a Bill when introducing legislation to the House. It seems to me to be an undesirable procedure, given that the courts may have recourse to the proceedings in Parliament under the Acts Interpretation Act to assist in the interpretation of legislation. The provisions of the Bill which I wish to deal with in further detail are, as I indicated, clause 4 concerning the application of the Act and clauses 6 and 8 dealing with the presumption against bail. The remaining provisions will be supported in full by the Opposition as they correct technical, deficiencies with the present Act, although it may not be fair to say, as the Attorney-General suggests, that they merely constitute technical fine tuning of the Act. There is a little more than that involved. Clause 4 of the Bill seeks to amend section 11, which provides that regulations may be made to give effect to Australia's extradition relationships by applying the Act to 'specified' extradition countries so that Australia will then be able, if called upon, to extradite to those countries. Regulations made under section 11 may modify the application of the Act so that its provisions are subject to the provisions of the extradition arrangement or such other limitations, conditions, exceptions or qualifications that may be spelt out in the enabling regulations. Australia's obligations as to extradition come from a number of sources, including bilateral and multilateral treaties and treaty based arrangements. Often Australia's international obligations will stem from a combination of these sources. Section 11 as presently drawn curiously allows for the recognition of one of these sources with respect to any given extradition treaty. Therefore, if a recent multilateral treaty has an impact on Australia's extradition obligations with a country under an existing bilateral treaty, regulations which are made under the presenL wording of section 11 cannot identify and give legal effect to this latter source. Clause 4 of the Bill, although poorly drafted, I suggest, attempts to overcome this limitation by ensuring that regulations made under section 11 accurately reflect Australia's extradition obligations as they may be altered from time to time in the international arena. It is not a small point that I make in regard to the poor drafting in this arena. I know the constraints on the Government. Under this Government there is generally more legislation churned through than under most parties in government, with less time to debate it, but it really would be desirable if clause 4 of the Bill and section 11 of the Act were to be redrafted in clear and somewhat more concise language. For instance, instead of repeating the substance of the provisions of subsections (1) and (IA), why not simply state that regulations can be made to give effect to specified extradition sources, and then go on to say that it is subject to such limitations which are set out in the source or in the regulations? This Government, supposedly, has a policy of ensuring that legislation is expressed in plain English, but time and again we see nothing but labyrinthine gobbledegook, to use the expression of another at the table, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown). Notwithstanding that, we will not be moving amendments to clause 4. Mr Duffy interjecting expression that he has been forced to use so frequently because of the sloppy drafting of the Government in introducing legnon- islation. I used to hear him constantly advising the Minister's predecessor and friend, indeed his mentor and guide on the racetrack on occasions, of the need to improve the drafting of legislation.",100
167,Mr NA BROWN,EXTRADITION AMENDMENT BILL,"At least the High Court thinks we are right.  pleased that the Attorney-General is here and listening. Even if his predecessor did not follow the advice of the honourable member for Menzies, maybe the Attorney-General may follow mine in this regard. I turn to the presumption against bail, clauses 6 and 8 of the Bill. Under sections 15 (6) and 32 (3) of the Act, when a person is arrested, pending the decision of the magistrate that a case has been made out to extradite or not extradite, as the case may be, there is a presumption that the person be remanded in custody and not be granted bail. Bail will only be granted if 'special circumstances are shown', a phrase which, interestingly enough, is not defined in the Act. It has been said that this presumption against bail, in the context of an arrest situation, is necessarf to address concerns on the part of some nations about Australia's ability to fulfil its extradition obligations. granted'. However, clauses 6 and 8 of the present Bill go even further than that. Clauses 6 and 8 of the Bill propose the extension of this presumption to situations where extradition decisions are being reviewed or appealed from. Clause 6 is designed to amend section 21 (6) (f) (iv) which presently allows a court to grant bail to a person facing possible extradition, on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit, pending the outcome of a review or appeal from decisions by magistrates-under section 19 (9) and (10)that a person is or is not eligible for surrender or extradition. The word 'courts' includes the Federal Court, State supreme courts and, ultimately, the High Court; they are the judicial bodies involved in the review process. Clause 6 will insert the phrase 'if there are special circumstances justifying such a course' into section 21 (6) (f) (iv) in order to introduce a presumption against bail. Clause 8 will make a similar amendment to section 35 (6) (g) (iv)which is in similar terms to 21 (6) (f) (iv)-in dealing with the review of decisions to extradite from Australia to New Zealand under part III of the Act. Pursuant to section 68 (1) of the Judiciary Act 1903, the several courts of the States and Territories have jurisdiction over persons charged with criminal offences under Commonwealth laws. Further, section 68 (1) provides that the laws of the States and Territories that govern, inter alia, the holding of accused persons to bail shall apply to persons charged with offences against Commonwealth laws. This provision, together with section 53 of the Extradition Act 1988 dealing with the conditions of imprisonment of persons under the Act pursuant to State or Territory laws, has the effect of bringing into play the provisions of State and Territory legislation dealing with remand and the granting of bail. The Government now wishes to introduce a presumption against the granting of bail with the use of the words 'if there are special circumstances justifying such a course, bail may be Two immediate points should be made about this. I should note that the following comments I make are based on the provisions of the Victorian Bail Act 1977. First, the presumption is contrary to the position under State and Territory bail legislation. Under the Victorian Bail Act, section 4 (1), there is a presumption in favour of the granting of bail. Secondly, the phrase 'special circumstances', which the Government seeks to introduce, does not appear in State or Territory legislation, and has not been defined, as I said, in the present Bill or in the provisions of the Extradition Act 1988. In the Victorian Bail Act under section 4 (4) there are certain 'reverse onus' situations which require accused persons to 'show cause' as to why they should not be denied. bail. There is no mention of accused persons, in any bail situations under the Victorian Act, having to show 'special circumstances' to justify the granting of bail. Even with respect to the position under the Victorian Bail Act, practitioners have criticised the 'reverse onus' provision for, among other things, duplicating the 'unacceptable risk' provisions found in sections 4 (2) (d) and 4 (3) of that Act. The effect of the amendment in clauses 6 and 8 will be to introduce confusion into the operation of laws dealing with the granting of bail in the extradition situation. The Government has not proffered any reasons for this proposed extension. Both the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum are silent as to why it is thought desirable to extend this sumption against bail from the arrest situation to the appeal situation. Under the existing provisions of the Act the courts, as I have already mentioned, have a discretion to either remand a person in custody or to grant bail to a person, pending the outcome of the relevant trial, review or appeal. A decision to grant bail may be made by the court 'on such terms and conditions as the court thinks fit'. Appropriate conditions of bail can reduce any possible risk of a person absconding while a review or appeal is under way. It may be desirable to have such a presumption in the context of an arrest, or even possibly in the situation of an appeal or review, in circumstances where that is being initiated by the person seeking to avoid extradition. However, we have serious doubts as to whether it is fair or appropriate to have this presumption in situations where the country seeking extradition is challenging the decision of a court that a person is not eligible for render or extradition. It is the view of the Opposition that this proposed extended presumption is not needed and does not enhance the effectiveness of Australia's extradition laws. The existing discretion of the court to grant bail is exercised after the court siders the seriousness of the alleged offence, the character and the history of the person involved and the strength of the evidence against the person. After considering these and other factors, the court is in a position to refuse bail if the granting of bail would be an unacceptable risk. If bail is granted, the court can impose such conditions as it sees fit. One example is the common condition of obliging persons to report regularly to the authorities and to surrender passports or other travel uments. I have spent a degree of time on this matter and I reiterate my appreciation of the fact that the Attorney-General is ent and is paying careful attention to my remarks. I put to him that unless the Government can show 'special circumstances' for the extension of this presumption against bail-a presumption which, as I have pointed out, is contrary to both pre- statute and common law governing the granting of bail in criminal proceedingsthe Opposition will oppose clauses 6 and 8 of the Bill as presently drawn. If perchance the Attorney is able to persuade me of the strength of conviction that he normally possesses when he makes such changes and can plausibly indicate to me why this is needed, naturally I will reconsider such a concept. At this juncture, without any indication until the Attorney wraps up the second reading debate, I foreshadow, and no more at this stage, that in committee the Opposition will be moving an amendment-depending on the Government's response to my request for it to justify this extension of the presumption against bail-to delete clauses 6 and 8 or to amend those clauses to confine the presumption to situations where extradition decisions are being reviewed by persons seeking to avoid extradition.",102
168,Mr CAMPBELL,EXTRADITION AMENDMENT BILL,"Kalgoorlie) (5.00)In speaking on the Extradition Amendsurment Bill, I am reminded that one of the great cop-outs of bureaucracy is to say 'We do not make the legislation. It is the politicians who make legislation and we only interpret it'. I find this particularly galling because it precludes their ability or willingness to use common sense. I find conthis increasingly the case in relation to the Immigration Act where we have big troubles now because if the letter of the law is adhered to, an unjust decision often may well be made. I wish to speak on this matter because I have had some contact with this legislation in the past and I am unhappy about the way in which it works. It seems to me there is an inherent contradiction in a country such as Australia, which uses common law, making treaties with coundoc- tries which do not. There is a conflict between the inquisitorial and accusatorial systems of law and that presents some problems. It seems to me that under this pres- system people can be charged on some very spurious evidence and denied bail. I see that there is a provision in this Bill that seeks to allow bail under certain circumstances and that is a very big step forward. I was involved in the case of Hemple and Etheridge v the State of Israel, in which people were charged on what appeared to me to be very self-serving evidence. I expressed my concerns to the Attorney-General, but I got no sympathy whatsoever. These people ended up spending some 18 months in gaol, because that Act-and I believe the situation is the same with the present Actdoes not allow any provision for bail.  the case? I think I can remember it.",104
169,Mr CAMPBELL,EXTRADITION AMENDMENT BILL,"In the end the people were extradited to Israel and the High Court in Israel decided that they had virtually no case to answer. It is ongoing case which I think will bea tinuing source of embarrassment. I beand lieve this amendment, which gives the power to consider bail in certain circumin stances, a big advancement on the posireason tion that existed at that time. We make a lot of extradition for its part in the battle against organised crime, im outrage. but I must say that I am somewhat cynical about this, particularly in relation drugs. It seems to me that if we are ous about combating drugs we will not it through measures such as this Bill through the increasingly oppressive legisKalgoorlie lation that we tend to enter into because of the public hysteria that has been gentime. erated. We have to look at the problem itself. I think that we as a country have to consider legalising the use of of these substances. I believe that we will have to choose between an enormous eroI sion of civil liberties or a minor health problem. Drugs are used· by a small minority of people and I believe that legislation to legalise the use of them, while simultaneously increasing the penalties the supply of them, would be far more effective than all this posturing that on with today. I might add that this turing is something that is generated across political parties and right across the munity. I believe it is a red herring introduce the drug problem in the context of this particular Bill. This Bill is legalistic. It certainly does not warrant a lot of time. The amendments that the Government is putting forward are an improvement. They may not go far enough and I would argue that that is the case, but they are certainly an advance on the situation we have. I think that some of these advancements probably arise from the circumstances-I would say the disgraceful circumstancesthat occurred in the case of Hemple and Etheridge v the State of Israel and I am very pleased that the suffering of those two gentlemen is having at least this effect so that people in similar circumstances will be protected. It was quite clear in that situation that there was absolutely no risk in granting bail. The people had nowhere to go; they an had large numbers of their group in the concountry; they had no funds whatsoever there was absolutely no risk involved. I was quite outraged that we kept them gaol for 18 months without bail. The I am speaking on this Bill is just to refresh people's memories as to why I considered that particular case to be such",105

171,Mr CAMPBELL,EXTRADITION AMENDMENT BILL,That is understandable.,105
172,Mr RUDDOCK,EXTRADITION AMENDMENT BILL,"The member says that that may be understandable. I suggest that for that is a good reason for the Parliament spending a little more time in trying to we go come to grips with the principles inposvolved. If we were able to do that, we might well be in a position to understand comthe difficulties of the practitioners who to have to make some sense of the legislation that goes through this Parliament, sometimes in a very short time. I endorse my colleague's comments about the way in which the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has addressed this matter and I thank him for his very much more detailed exposition of the matters that are before us. I note that the purpose of the Bill is to amend the Extradition Act of 1988, to clarify the scheme for making regulations, to provide a scheme of consent surrender to New Zealand similar to that provided for other countries, to provide the police with power to arrest without warrant, to permit an Australian magistrate to take evidence outside Australia and to make other minor and technical changes to the Act itself. Having regard to those amendments, I went to the detailed explanation to look at what we were doing, particularly in relation to some of the provisions in which I took an interest when this matter was previously debated in the Parliament. I looked particularly at the provisions in clause 5, which deals with determination of eligibility for surrender. This really ther facilitates the basis upon which a determination might be made by a magistrate that a person could be extradited. It means that certain technical points that might be taken at that point in relation to the evidence adduced are voided. That is what we are, in fact, now doing. On the last occasion that extradition legislation was before us, I addressed the House on clause 19 of that Bill. That clause dealt with a major issue in relation to extradition matters-the extent to which we inquired in Australia as to the nature of the offence with which a person was charged abroad which might lead to his or her extradition from Australia and for which he or she would then be put on trial. There are quite different principles involved in relation to this prima facie case question and it was a matter that has been addressed in a number of articles. It was a matter that I raised when I spoke in the Parliament on the last occasion-9 December 1987. It was a matter upon which the then Attorney-General offered some comments arising from my speech and from an amendment proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Reith, who was the shadow Attorney at that time. That amendment which we proposed required a form of prima facie case being established before a magistrate, before a person would be surrendered. When the Attorney responded to this matter he spent some time giving me a brief as to what was involved and outlining some of the difficulties that the United Kingdom had experienced in obtaining extraditions. I think he said that over a long period the United Kingdom had not been able to obtain successful extraditions because of this requirement. In reading some of the articles on this matter since that time, I have established that that was the case. The Attorney at that time indicated that the Government was prepared to accept that when a country makes a request it does so on the basis of pretty good sworn evidence. He went on to say that where there was a statement of offence that applies in another country with which we had an extradition treaty, he was inclined furto accept that matter. But he went on to say, 'I want to assure honourable members that if there is any suggestion of injustice we would certainly look into it.' He said no-one in the Opposition had mentioned any. I must say that I was concerned about Australian citizens who might be put on their trial simply because another country adduced certain statements that it wanted to put people before the courts, and an Australian could be put to considerable expense in a foreign jurisdiction were we not to provide some basis upon which these matters might be reviewed. I went back and had a look at section 22 of the Act because I was concerned as to what discretion the Attorney might have to assist in relation to those matters. When I looked at section 22 again to refresh my memory, I found that the extent to which the Attorney might be able to look at these matters was somewhat limited by the terms of that section. It prompted me to ask, 'Now, how has this been working in the meantime, and where do I get information about the way in which we are dealing with extradition questions?' I looked again at the Act to see whether there was any requirement to report, and I found that we let an Act go through on the last occasion, and perhaps it is a matter that I should have raised at that time, without any reporting requirement. But these things do not escape us. The annual report of the Attorney-General gives us some information about the way in which this Act has been dealt with, and I tried to look at the way in which the Attorney might exercise",105
173,Mr RUDDOCK,EXTRADITION AMENDMENT BILL,"No, it did not, I regret to say. It gave me a good deal of information about the number of requests of Australia. It indicated that 20 requests had been carried forward from 1987-88. There were 19 new requests, and it told us where they had been granted, and where requests had been discontinued. It told me the Attorney had refused one request but it did not tell me on what basis. So the rather interesting point that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was raising about the extent to which practice might be giving rise to amendments, I must say did not seem to me to arise in any reporting to this Parliament. I must say, in looking at the speech of the Attorney, I found it very difficult where these amendments emanated from. I am worried about the way in which these provisions might operate, the extent to which Parliament might be encouraged to review this Act and the extent to which the Attorney himself exercises his discretion. I might want to see the Act reviewed if the Attorney's discretion was of a very limited character and not able to be exercised in proper cases. So, in the remarks I make today, I want to seek some assurance from the Attorney that we can have far more comprehensive reporting of the way in which the extradition Act is operating and certainly far more detail in second reading speeches as to where amendments emanate from, why they are being proposed and the difficulties that are being occasioned. I am approaching it from a different point of view. I am approaching it from the point of view of providing proper protection to Australians who may be required to be put on their trial in another country. There are important questions involved and, simply because only some 20 cases are being dealt with, it does not seem to me that that is sufficient reason for the Parliament itself not to be fully involved in the way in which this matter is addressed. I understand that it is the wish of the House to suspend the sitting at 5.15 p.m., and as it has approached that time, I seek leave to continue my remarks later so that the Minister might have an opportunity to respond. Leave granted; debate adjourned.",107

175,Dr HEWSON,EXTRADITION AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Speaker, the Budget brought down by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on Tuesday night showed just how out of touch the Hawke-Keating to understand Government has become. It clearly has no idea of the extent of the recession in the private sector in Australia, nor of the hardship now being experienced' by the great bulk of Australians. The Budget failed to address our debt and inflation problems. It has therefore left our nation even more exposed to the growing uncertainty in the world economy, which risks even more hardship for us all. In the circumstances, I honestly cannot believe that the Government felt it could get away with the sort of Budget it brought down. It is simply not good enough. The Budget must be redone, and it must be redone with a package of essential measures I will outline tonight. Why has the Government shown so little resolution? This was the first Budget of a new three-year term of the Parliament. It was an opportunity to make some tough decisions. It was an opportunity to frame a strategy appropriate to the most difficult economic circumstances which Australia has seen since the Second World War. This Government clearly has no vision for our country in the 1990s. It clearly lives in a different world from the rest of us. It is a world riddled with division and disunity, factional squabbles and leadership ambitions, and it is dominated by Bill Kelty and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. It is a world where government is a matter of deals-deals with union bosses, deals with greenies, deals with ethnic groups, deals with business and deals with factions and other sectional interests-rather than a matter of policies in the best interests of all Australians. I would suggest that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer get out of Canberra, as I have done, and talk to a wide cross-section of Australians. They should get away from their Treasury boffins, who have got their economic forecasts so wrong; get away from the J-curves, the twin deficits, the implicit price deflators and all the rest of the models, levers and jargon. They should simply get out and talk to the people of Australia; get out and talk to some of the 100,000 people who have lost their jobs just since last October, or the thousands and thousands more who are about to lose them. They ought to get out and talk to the record number of small business people who have gone broke as a result of the Treasurer's high interest rates-people whose life savings have been lost and who will take years to repay their debts; talk to those struggling to buy a home with 16 per cent mortgage interest rates, or who are forced to sell their house in a falling market. They have to get out and talk to those families in which both parents have been forced to go to work just to pay the mortgage and the supermarket bills. Walk up and down any street in any city, suburb or town and count the empty shops, the 'for sale' signs, the auction umns and the growing dole queues. Get out and talk to manufacturers or farmers or miners who are trying to compete overseas, but always with at least one hand tied behind their backs because of an uncompetitive exchange rate, high interest rat-s, excessive transport costs, excessive waterfront and shipping charges, excessive government regulation and red tape, black bans, go-slows, stop-works and labour market deals, that are totally unrelated to their particular workplace or operation. Or they can go and talk to the genuinely needy in Australia, the sick, the aged, the genuinely unemployable, who have to get by on less because others who could otherwise pull their weight in our society have been allowed to rip-off the welfare system-a welfare system which makes it easier to put out your hand than to help yourself or to lift your game. They should get out and talk to some of those 500,000 Australians, many in their retirement years, whose savings have been frozen when a building society or property trust has gone bust. Or talk to the workers who had thought that a Labor Government would look after their interests, only to find their wages squeezed and more than clawed back by higher inflation, interest rates and the Treasurer's bracket creep. Or, finally, they could talk to the youth of Australia, who have little to look forward to except perhaps decades of high real interest rates, higher taxation, shrinking job opportunities and increasing difficulty in buying a home and raising a family. Then, after all that, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer should come back and redo the Budget-and this time get it right! NA Unfortunately, the Government will not heed this advice because it will not admit that its high interest rate policy is not working and that it needs to change direction. Our debt, balance of payments, inflation, interest rates and unemployment numbers might be, to quote the Treasurer, 'beautiful numbers' but to the rest colof us Australians they stand as monuments to his policy failures. Australians want policies, not excuses; they want the problems solved, not denied or ducked or rationalised away. The facts are simple. Mr Keating's high interest rates will not work. They inflict real pain for little gain. They have pushed the private sector into recession and, even on his forecasts, it is expected to stay in recession. They have created record levels of personal bankruptcies, small business failures, falling living standards and so on. They clearly squeeze business and business investment has now collapsed at a time when it is most needed. Yet our inflation and balance of payments problems persist. Indeed, high interest rates have made the balance of payments and inflation worse, not better. They keep our exchange rate well above its long-term competitive level, encouraging imports and discouraging exports, when we need the reverse. The bottom line is the magnitude of our international debt and inflation problems. We presently owe about $150 billion and it is rising rapidly; and our inflation is still close to 8 per cent, twice as high as in the countries with which we compete. Our debt problem is approaching the proportions of the 1930s. Paying the interest on it is a problem for us all. How many more businesses will have to fail; how many more exports will have to be choked off; how many more people will have to go broke; how many more people will have to be added to the dole queues before the Treasurer admits that his policies 'ain't all that beautiful'? The fundamental challenges to policy are therefore to get our inflation and debt under control. We face only two options: To continue to cut our standard of living, or to boost our production, our productivity and our exports. We should all be particularly concerned at just how readily the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have accepted the first option and eroded our living standardS'. By contrast, the coalition favours the second option of boosting our production and exports so that our standard· of living can improve and job opportunities increase. However, it is important to recognise the magnitude of the policy task that is before us. Over time we must aim to eradicate inflation through the pursuit of an explicit and stable medium term framework for monetary, fiscal and wages policy and an accelerated program of industry reform that emphasises competition, deregulation and incentives to work, save and invest. If we are to stabilise our foreign debt by, say, 1995 we need to shift nearly 4 per cent of our production into exportsand that is not to reduce our debt, just to have it grow no faster than what we produce. The enormous scale of this task is demonstrated when it is realised that we have not had anything like a 4 per cent shift in net exports in any five-year period since 1945 and, indeed, even if we matched the best performance of the postwar period we would not see our debt stabilise this decade. The Hawke-Keating Government has barely scratched the surface of this policy task. It simply does not have the policies or the capacities to carry it out. THE 1990-91 BUDGET This Budget provided a unique opportunity to change the direction of overall economic policy. The Budget is, of course, only part of a package that should have been put in place if we are to turn our economy around. But it is an important part and it should do three things: first, it should cut government spending, instead of using interest rates to cut private spending; secondly, it should reshape our tax system to restore incentives and remove the bias against our export industries; and thirdly, it ought to boost national savings. The 1990-91 Budget fails on all three counts. While the Treasurer has been at pains to convince everybody that it is a 'tough' Budget, it clearly is not. While not denying that there are some commendable attempts to cut spending in particular areas, I say that these have been undone by increased spending in other areas. Total Budget outlays are increasing in real terms; and the Commonwealth's own spending-that is, excluding the payments it makes to the States-has actually jumped by 2 to 3 per cent in real terms. Indeed, the Budget cuts expenditure only by $350m from forward projections in a Budget of $93 billion-that is, by only per cent! It clearly does not 'slash welfare spending' as the Treasurer would have us believe. Social security and welfare spending is to rise by 12.3 per cent this year, or by 5.7 per cent in real terms-that is the biggest increase since 1983-84. To be clear, I am not advocating slamming welfare, but I am in favour of making sure that such spending reaches those who really need it. For example, the Treasurer's fraudulent description of the termination 'of the dole saves only $80m out of a total payment to the unemployed of about $4 billion a year. Our proposal to limit dole payments to a period of nine months would save an additional $600m to $700m. Our scheme ensures that those who are unemployed have a financial incentive to return to the work force, rather than simply hold out their hands. But it also provides for a special benefit beyond the nine-month period to those who are genuinely unemployable. There should' be no doubt that the Treasurer's claims about restraint on government spending in Australia are fallacious. As his forecasts admit, total public sector spending will grow significantly faster than national production this yearby 2.75 per cent. While the Treasurer would have us believe otherwise, the size of government is still a very live issue in Australia. Secondly, this Budget fails to address the issue of reshaping the tax system, and again merely tinkers at the edges rather than addresses the problem. In the tax area we must do a number of things. We must reduce the overall tax burden, which can only be achieved by cutting Government spending. During the last election campaign, in our Economic Action Plan we outlined over $3 billion worth of cuts, many multiples of what the Government has achieved in this Budget. We must simplify the personal tax system and lower tax rates. We must ensure that the Government does not continue to get a windfall tax gain every year simply because it fails to control inflation-that is, the Treasurer's 'bracket creep'. In this Budget, the Government gives back only $1.2 billion in tax cuts or roughly half of what the Treasurer took through 'bracket creep' last financial year. In giving it back, he still cribbed another six months, as the tax cuts do not come in until January next year. It should be realised that we are now approaching the point where inflation will push the 'average income earner' into the top tax brackets. We must also achieve a shift in the burden of taxation away from income towards consumption in order to encourage savings and provide scope for the elimination of various taxes on exports and business inputs. The Opposition, unlike the Government, has made a clear choice in favour of such tax reform in backing a goods and services tax (GST) as an essential element of a reshaped tax system. In adopting a GST, the Opposition is committed to lowering overall tax which it will achieve by cutting expenditure. We are committed to compensating low income earners and, pensioners and providing substantial tax cuts to workers. One of the major advantages of a shift in a tax mix is that individuals will be given money back in their pockets and they can then decide how much tax they pay by what they buy. We will completely abolish the wholesale sales tax system, a system which is grossly unfair and inefficient and taxes business inputs and exports. Tax cheats in the black economy and some tourists will pay more tax. Everybody should be clear that the Treasurer will undoubtedly mount a massive scare campaign'-on this tax shift, but it should not be forgotten that he gave all the reasons during the 1985 Tax Summit for why such reform is necessary and appropriate. The fact that he is now disowning them to try to score some cheap shortterm political points should not obscure the fact that he was right the first time round. In thinking about the goods and services tax, people should also remember the phenomenal cuts in living standards, increases in tax, record interest rates, rising unemployment and debt that the Treasurer has inflicted on them over the last seven years. Let the Trea-urer. play - heap politics, but his economIC Tztamc IS on the way down. Thirdly, the Bu-get - oes n<?thing !o boost national saVIngs eIther dIrectly In the public sector or. indire.ctly by cre-ting the circumstances In WhICh the pnvate sector might save more. For the second time in two years, the Budget promises no increase in total public sector saving-the Commonwealth surplus is to be broadly offset by deficits in the States. However, the overall Budget could well lead to a sizeable fall in national savings because the Treasurer's surplus is exaggerated, his growth forecasts are particularly optimistic, and we are yet to see the budgets of the States. Finally, it should be recognised t-at the Budget is built on shallow and facile optimism and what will prove to be unrealistic assumptions. The Treasurer has an appalling record of forecasting the ?1ajor economic indicators. This Budget will ensure that he maintains that record. For example, how will the Treasu.r-r meet his electoral commitment to stabIlIse our foreign debt by 1992 w-en he d?es !l0-hing to boost national saVIngs, which It IS essential to do to reduce our reliance on foreign savings? How can the two per cent forecast growth rates in our economy be achieved when the private sector is already in recession and the world economy is slowing down? How will a more substantial increase in unemployment be avoided in such circumstances? On what basis did the Treasurer arrive at the highly optimistic estimate of $23 a barrel of oil for 1990-91 when most other professional estimates are significantly higher? The answers to these and other ques-. tions are crucial. If the Treasurer's unjustifiably optimistic assu?1ptions tu-n out to be mistaken, as I belIeve they Will, the whole Budget strategy on wages, interest rates, foreign debt, living standard- - nd unemployment will fall apart. That IS Just how spongy the figuring in the Budget is. NA NA Apart from the Budget, and the need to cut Government spending and reshape our tax system, there are a number of other key elements for an effective yac.kage. of measures to turn our economic SItuatIon around. This Budget is a doughnut budget-it has a big hole right through the middle. What is missing is the main elements of an economic reform package which the Treasurer has not been able to put together. This deal-doing Treasurer has failed to do the deals that really matter: labour market reform; reductions in industry protection; privatisation; efficient infrastructure; and striking a balance between development and the environment. Let me consider each of the elements of the package in a little more detail. Labour Market Our labour market is not really a market at all. Wages are determined by the Australian Council of Trade Unions leadership and the Treasurer-employers are excluded. The centralised process produces wage increases that apply across the board irrespective of the condition or strength of particular firms or industries. As such the process is anti-productivity, anti-co-petitiveness and it has a basic thrust to protect featherbedded jobs at the expense of others. To be specific, the Government's accord and the centralised wage fixation system have four major failings. First, year after year they have produced uncompetitive wage outcomes. Secondly, they have put a floor of about 6 per cent under the rate of inflation. Thirdly, they have provided the means by which Bill Kelty has achieved de facto Cabinet status, such that he can have almost a veto power over any reform which might reduce his power or affect the jobs of a few of his mates. Finally they have failed to look after the worker- the Government's principal constituency. Wages have l?een consiste!l-ly eroded by inflation and Job opportumtIes have been lost. As such the accord is part of our problems rath-r than a solution to them. The only viable alternative is to move away from the centralised system, with an increasing focus on workplace negotiations and enterprise bargaining to determine wages and conditions. This is the essential element of the coalition's industrial relations policy. We are not anti-union; unions can still represent workers in the workplace, but preferably one union per workplace. But they will not be an arm of government and they will not run government policy under us. It is the only way that we will get internationally competitive wage outcomes which tie wages to performance and genuinely protect the interests of workers. Reductions in Industry Protection A coalition government will implement sweeping industry reform so that by the year 2000 there will be little justification for pervasive industry protection. It is essential to see the proposed reductions in protection as part of the total package of reform measures. Simply to cut protection in isolation will serve only to drive firms out of existence. Reductions in protection under a coalition government will, firstly, apply to all forms of protection and all industries, including passenger motor vehicles and the textile, clothing and footwear industries; secondly, they will be phased and predictable so that by the year 2000 protection levels will be, at most, negligible; and, thirdly, they will be relatively larger at the top end to eliminate the gap between highly protected sectors and the remainder of manufacturing industry. There is virtually no disagreement now, even among industry, that protection imposes massive costs on consumers and producers who do not receive assistance. The fact is that protection of one local industry must be paid for by anotHer. Exporters who cannot pass on increased costs are penalised by higher input prices as well as increased labour and capital costs. The overall burden on the domestic economy in terms of higher prices and jobs and exports forgone is very high. Privatisation The coalition has a firm commitment to break down sleepy, inefficient government monopolies through privatisation and the introduction of competition. We have a comprehensive program to privatise major government-owned business enterprises, including the airlines and Telecom. We see no reason why a government should run airlines, banks and other businesses. Government ownership imposes constraints of which other businesses are free. As a result, the coalition views privatisation as important to remove these enterprises from day to day government interference in management, Cabinet decision-making processes and to boost their . capital base. It also enables the achievement of wider share ownership, especially among employees, currently the province only of the rich. In contrast, the Government will never be able to implement full privatisation because its left wing will not let it. At the moment, the Government is busy trying to dress up some shonky deal to sell 49 per cent of government enterprises as genuine privatisation. It is not interested in genuine efficiency gains but simply sees it as a way of tapping more money for various public sector projects-not as a means of boosting efficiency and lowering costs to consumers. An Efficient Infnistructure There is a pressing need to eliminate all the cost disadvantages that we suffer in a host of our inefficient and uncompetitive industries, most importantly in telecommunications, road and rail transport, aviation, shipping, and, of course, on our waterfront. Let me cite a few examples. In telecommunications, as an indication of the low level of productivity in Telecom, Telecom employees handle 88 main lines compared to 202 in the United States, 177 in Italy and 162 in France. Not surprisingly, therefore, it is estimated that effective competition in telecommunications could reduce prices by about 15 per cent on average across the board to Telecom customers. What about the waterfront? In Singapore, for example, it takes about five to six hours to turn around a container ship. It takes five or six days in Australia, and that would be on a good week when there are no blackbans, no work to rule, no goslows, no quarantine problems and so on. In shipping, it is $60 per car cheaper to ship a Ford Capri from Melbourne to the west coast of the United States using foreign flag vessels than it is to ship the same Ford Capri from Melbourne to Tasmania using Australian coastal shipping. While Australia is a major salt producer and we export salt from South Australia to Western Australia, it is cheaper for our east coast chemical companies to import salt from Mexico than to ship it from South Australia to Western Australia. And so I could go on with hundreds of examples. The elimination of these sorts of cost disadvantages is fundamental to Australia becoming a more effective trading nation. In most cases these cost disadvantages arise from a lack of competition, but in some cases they are due to inefficient work and management practices and government red tape. Their effect is clear. Even if we are by international standards supercompetitive farmers or miners or manufacturers at the farm or in the mine or in the plant, we can still become internationally uncompetitive quite quickly as we try to move our goods-either to store them, move them by rail or air, clear them through the waterfront or ship them. Rather than address these issues, let me focus briefly on one subject of current debate, namely, telecommunications. The Government is virtually tearing itself apart, with open warfare between the Beazley and Keating options. Daily newspapers abound with references to megacom and monstercom and a whole host of other versions.",107
176,Mr NA BROWN,PACKAGE,Megalomania.,113
177,Dr HEWSON,PACKAGE,"However, the real issue here is not size, it is competition. Simply merging Telecom and OTC with Aussat as the basis of a new major competitor, or merging OTC and Aussat as a competitor to Telecom, will contribute little to improved competition. Only real competition will give all Australians what they want, namely, lower prices for telecommunications services and a more reliable and efficient service. The various two competitor or duopoly options just will not deliver. The Government should have realised this from its experience with its two-airline policy. The two-phone policy will not be any better. The coalition's policy on telecommunications released this week is designed to achieve full and effective competition. Potential competitors in telecommunications will be allowed to apply for licences to compete in the entire field or in specific areas of telecommun.ications. The Opposition also supports the complete privatisation of Telecom, OTC and Aussat within that framework of full and effective competition. We believe our telecommunications policy is the only effective way of achievil).g cheaper telecommunications charges for all Australians. Environment/Development Finally, we must settle on clear and consistent guidelines to achieve an appropriate balance between development and conservation of the environment. Only by clear guidelines consistently applied in the national interest can we get what is truly sustainable development. More than half the investment projects planned for Australia which could generate foreign exchange earnings are currently in danger of a veto on environmental grounds. Access Economics estimates this amounts to over $15 billion worth of investment. This unacceptable situation exists because this Government has preferred to deliberately use environmental issues for its own short term political purposes and has failed to spell out clear environmental standards which need to be met. And to be clear, once those environmental standards are set, the projects should go ahead if the standards are met: pulp mills should be built, Coronation Hill should be mined, the Cape York spaceport should be approved. NA Mr Speaker, this Budget fails to address the deep concerns of Australians about their future. It does nothing to address the problems which make our economy so vulnerable, namely, high inflation and high debt. What this Government does not seem to understand, what this Government seems to have no idea about, is that most Australians would rather be told the truth. They would rather take the medicine and get on with the cure. The nation was looking for leadership on the long road to recovery in this Budget but the. Government has shown itself totally incapable and unwilling to meet the challenge. There is only one way for the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to redeem themselves and that is to go back to the drawing board, take some really tough decisions for once in their lives, instead of just talking about it, and come back to this Parliament with a Budget that will do the job for Australia. do not, let history judge them as the men who frittered away Australia's chances through the 1980s and did not have the guts to make the hard decisions for the 1990s. The coalition parties have clearly set out the course of the new policy direction that is needed for Australia. Our alternative strategy is based on a concerted attack on inflation through a reform of the tax system, labour market deregulation, more competition and privatisation, and consistent policies to ensure sustainable development. These must be the real objectives of the 1990s if Australians are to enj.oy rising living standards once again. It IS the only strategy-and I emphasise 'the only strategy' - to trade our way out of the debt trap into which Labor has let Australia slide. Australians deserve the chance of something better. What we need now is vision. What we need now is courage. What we need now is to harness all the energy and determination of the Australian people to reach our objective of making Australia once again a significant economic force in our region-a strong Australia that can hold its head high. Tonight I want to assure the Australian people that the coalition parties are committed-firmly committed-to giving them just that. Debate (on motion by Mr Sciacca) adjourned. NA (PHARMACEUTICAL BENEFITS) AMENDMENT BILL 1990 Bill presented by Mr Staples, and read a first time. Second Reading",113
178,Mr STAPLES,SOCIAL WELFARE LEGISLATION,"I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Bill before the House amends the National Health Act 1953, the Social Security Act 1947 and the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to implement a number of substantial reforms to the pharmaceutIf they ical benefits scheme (PBS). The pharmaceutical benefits scheme is one of the Government's major welfare programs and it continues to protect all Australians against the high and increasing cost of drugs and medicinal preparations. The scheme has a proud record. It has secured safe, low cost medications for all Australians. The pharmaceutical industry has estimated that Australian prescription medications are around 55 per cent of average prices in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. The scheme is an equitable and universal one, financed by all taxpayers under progressive taxation arrangements. The scheme is nonetheless targeted, with lower patient contributions made by those in sections of the community with greater need, and relatively higher contributions from those who can· afford to make them. More than 1,100 drug products are listed on the scheme, ranging from basic medications for common illnesses to the latest advances in drug therapy for cancer, high blood cholesterol levels and heart disease. Under this scheme children with short stature can obtain treatment, without charge, with human growth hormone. People requiring stoma appliances and medication can obtain them under the scheme and diabetics can obtain their supplies as well as their insulin at subsidised prices. The scheme has fulfilled a very important social and health role for over 40 years. The Government wishes to ensure that it continues to offer this protection in the 1990s and beyond. However, no government could responsibly continue the PBS in its current form in the face of the fact that the cost of scheme has doubled in the last four years and was to have doubled again over the next three years. The survival of the scheme depended upon action to rein in these escalating costs. Underlying these cost increases there are several factors. While patient payments are targeted to those most in need, they are not related to drug costs and there is little awareness of or incentive to use lower cost alternative treatments amongst consumers or providers. No direct contribution at all is made by the significant number of users who are pensioners and therefore there is no incentive to avoid waste or to be more thoughtful about the use of drugs. There is an ever increasing array of new, high-cost drugs on the market. And, of course, as the population ages there is an increasing demand for health services of all kinds, including medication. But pressures on costs are not the only imperative to which the Government has responded with these reform measures. There is increasing concern amongst health care professionals about the amount of ill-health which, ironically, can and occur through the inappropriate use of medication. There is evidence that a significant number of hospital admissions of elderly people are for drug-related illness. Ministers for health have over recent years received correspondence from the relatives of elderly people pointing out cases of hoarding in which sometimes several years supply of medications have been accumulated in bathroom cupboards. Professional pharmacists can attest to the 'success', if this word can appropriately be used in reference to such a sad phenomenon, of medi-dump campaigns which produce large hauls of unused drugs. There are finanCial penalties attached to this waste. Australian taxpayers paid for the unused drugs as well as for those which enabled people to get or stay well. In a scheme which costs us as taxpayers more than one billion dollars we should all be interested in minimising waste. Beyond the waste, and a key objective of the these pharmaceutical benefits scheme reforms, is the commitment to improvements in health which can result from more appropriate and thoughtful use of drugs. The Government has responded to both the cost pressures and to the improved health objectives identified by making some fundamental reforms. This Bill is one of two Bills which give effect to these changes. It contains provision for new patient contribution arrangements and offsetting pension supplementation. A second Bill will be introduced into the House later in this session. It is proposed to introduce from 1 November 1990 a charge of $2.50 for all prescriptions previously provided free to pensioners. However, the Government proposes to make a compensating adjustment through an increase to the pension for applicable recipients of social security and veterans' affairs benefits of $2.50 per week for those on the single rate and $1.25 per week to the married rate. These additional payments will commence on the first pay period in November. This will mean that in a full calendar does year a single pensioner will receive $130 in additional pension and a married couple will also receive $130. In the period from 1 November 1990 to 31 December 1991 single pensioners and pensioner couples will receive $150 in increased pension payments. To further protect those pensioners and their families who are large users of drugs, there will be a safety net such that a pensioner or a pensioner family will have an upper limit placed on the amount they need to spend on prescription pharmaceuticals. Free pharmaceutical benefits will be provided to pensioners after the aggregate of their $2.50 co-payment reaches $150 in the period 1 November 1990 to 31 December 1991. In following years the safety net aggregate co-payment threshold will be reduced to $130 in a calendar year. The safety net will be the same for single pensioners and for pensioner families or couples. All full year pensioners, and social security beneficiaries who currently receive free pharmaceuticals, will be fully protected under the new arrangements, and most will gain. Pensioners use, on average, 27 prescriptions per year. With the safety net in a calendar year set at $130equivalent to 52 prescriptions-most will have additional disposable income as a result of the reallocation of Commonwealth subsidies provided for in this Bill. This same co-payment threshold for safety net purposes of $130-individual and family-in a calendar year is to be introduced for all persons currently receiving benefits at the concessional rate of $2.50. That co-payment rate remains unchanged. The Bill thus provides for all those who receive Commonwealth income support and those who are on low incomes to make the one contribution to their prescriptions and to be proteCted by the scheme's safety net. The second Bill I will introduce later will, from March 1991, provide for the pension supplement to be absorbed within a $2.50 per week pension increase for all pensioners, sickness beneficiaries and other long term beneficiaries. Veterans receiving benefits under the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme will continue to receive drugs free of charge. The general patient co-payment is to increase from the present maximum of $11 toa maximum of $15. The present general safety net scheme will be revamped into two levels: an aggregate monetary limit of up to $300 will apply at the first level after which the patient will pay only $2.50 per prescription until the second safety net limit of $50 is reached. After that PBS prescriptions will be free for the remainder of that calendar year. It is worth noting that the new maximum general patient contribution is just that: a maximum designed to promote awareness of the relative prices of medications. Around two-thirds of the products listed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme can be expected to cost consumers less than this $15 maximum. The new cash-based safety net will encourage consumers to be more aware of the costs of their medications as they monitor· their progress towards the $300 ceiling and then towards the $50 limit on additional expenditure. The Government is committed to ensure that no individual or family needs to make aggregate contributions at the general rate which exceed $300. It has, therefore, been provided in the Bill that where the cost of a prescription at the general rate would take the aggregate of an individual or family's contributions over $300, the individual or family will have to pay only $2.50 for that prescription. Persons moving from one category of safety net to another will be credited for the expenditure made on a concessional recorp card or the number of prescriptions already purchased on a general record card so that they are not disadvantaged. Thus, for example, people who begin receiving unemployment benefit during a year will be able to count . their general patient contributions towards eligibility for a concessional safety net by having the number of scrips involved multiplied by $2.50 and the resultant amount entered on their concessional record card. The Bill provides for all co-payments and safety net amounts to be indexed annually in line with the consumer price index. Safety net limits will, of course, be indexed from 1 January each year. Patient contributions will be indexed from 1 October each year. In pursuit of the objective of ensuring an efficient distribution network for pharmaceuticals, the Government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia have reached agreement about pharmacy industry restructuring. Part of that agreement relates to a new level of pharmacy remuneration for the dispensing of pharmaceutical benefits scheme prescriptions. The Bill amends the legislation related to the operations of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal to enable it to give effect to the remuneration aspects of the current agr\!ement and any future agreements which might be made between the Government and a pharmacy organisation representing a majority 'of approved pharmacists. In the part year 1990-1991, it is expected that savings of $31.4m will result from the introduction of a higher maximum general patient charge and the new safety nets. This will increase tQ $245m in a full year. While no savings are expected in this year as a result of the new arrangements for pensioners and concessionals, including the additional pension payments for pensioners, savings in later years will reach $185m. These reforms underscore the Government's commitment to responsible financial management, to social justice; to improved health outcomes and to the provision of financial support for those least able to pay. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Dr Bob Woods) adjourned. .. SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' duce NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1990 Bill presented by Mr Howe, and read first time. Second Reading",114
179,Mr HOWE,AFFAIRS LEGISLATION,"Batman-Minister for Community Services and Health) (8.12)I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1990 will amend social security and veterans' affairs legislation to implement some the measures announced in the Budget and in the February statement earlier this year. The Bill will also provide for creased effectiveness and efficiency in cial security' and veterans'· affairs administration. Since November 1989 recipients employment benefit, sickness benefit and job search allowance have been required to supply a tax file number as a precondevelopments dition to the payment of benefit. This initiative has proved to be successful, both in terms of increased efficiency in determining claims and in savings to the Social Security budget. Consistent with that initiative are several others announced in the February statement and the Budget. The first of these will be the progressive extension of the requirement to provide a tax file number to most recipients of Commonwealth income support payments. This Bill will commence that process by requiring provision of tax file numbers by sole parent pensioners and by family allowance supplement recipients and their spouses as a prerequisite to further payments of these benefits on or after 1 October 1990. Additionally, a person who claims family allowance on or after 1 October 1990 will be required to produce his or her tax file number and that of his or her spouse before payments can be made. Recipients of some veterans' affairs pensions and allowances may also be required to produce their and their spouses' tax file numbers as a prerequisite to payment. I will shortly be in a position to introanother Bill which will require the progressive supply of tax file numbers for most social security payments from 1 Jana uary' 1991. There will be similar legislation in respect of many payments made by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Community Services and Health. In addition, I will introduce legislation to permit, from 1 January 1991, the matching of client information held by each of these departments and by the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Immigration, Local Governof ment and Ethnic Affairs using equipment in the Department of Social Security. This will help in the detection of incorrect payinments .by highlighting situations where, sofor example, a person has provided inconsistent family profiles or income information to different Commonwealth agencies and is consequently receiving of unmutually inconsistent benefits. This Government believes that these will contribute greatly to enhancing the integrity of the social security system. To enhance it further the Government has decided to offer a limwho ited amnesty to ensure that, as far possible, the rates of payment made social security and veterans' affairs reciptreated ients on 1 January 1991 are correct This Bill, therefore, provides for an amnesty which will encourage people who may at present be in receipt of incorrect payEntitlements ments because they have not informed the them. Department of Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs of changes in their circumstances, to come forward and correct the situation. Although no overpayments will be rai-ed or prosecuwill tions launched, the savings from the corlows: rection of ongoing payments will be very substantial in net terms. In order to limit avoidance of the social security and veterans' affairs assets tests by the disposal of property for either nominal or no consideration, the Bill will provide that income will be deemed to have been received from deprived assets at a minimum rate of 10 per cent a year. However, to mitigate the impact of this pensioners measure where the disposition is relatively minor, the annual gifting limit will be significantly increased to $10,000 both single persons .and married couples. This compares with the existing annual gifting limits of $2,000 for single persons and $4,000 for married couples. The Bill also provides for the assessexample, ment of income oN. loans made by pencome sioners and beneficiaries, assuming minimum rate of interest. This rate will be initially set at 10 per cent or the actual rate of return, whichever is the higher. The Minister for Social Security will able from time to time to set a lower minimum interest rate when this is necand essary. For some time, a person living a retirement village whose entry contridisposable bution exceeded a prescribed limit has been considered to be a 'home owner' the purposes of the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Entitlements Act. Howjourned. ever, if a person's entry contribution is less than the prescribed amount, the person is considered it 'non-home owner' and the person's property is taken to include the value of his or her entry contribution. This Bill would provide for a person has retained or acquired a life interas est in his or her home-for example, a to person living in a granny flat-to be in the same way as a person who has paid to live in a retirement village. As a consequence the deprivation rules in the Social Security Act and the Veterans' Act will no longer apply to I will shortly introduce a further initiative in another Bill with the effect that, from 1 March 1991, cash and money in accounts of pensioners and beneficiaries be assessed as returning yields as folfor the first $2,000 the actual rate of return, even if it is nil; for amounts of over $2,000, the first $2,000 at the actual rate of return and the remainder at 10 per cent or the actual rate of return, whichever is the higher. Pensioners and beneficiaries will have about six months to rearrange their cash or accounts. Another 40 financial information service for pensioners, or FISP, officers will be operating from early October this year to help arrange their investments. The provisions will apply both to cash for and to money in accounts held by pensioners and beneficiaries. The free areasthe amounts people can earn before their social security payment is affected-provide substantial protection to pensioners with only small amounts to invest. For an age pensioner with no inapart from the pension and interest a on investments would be able to invest up to $20,000 for a single pensioner, or up to $36,000 for couples at 10 per cent interest and still receive maximum rate be pensions because the interest income is within the pension-free areas. Pensioners beneficiaries who reorganise their fiin nancial affairs will have higher overall incomes than before. I commend the Bill to the House and present for the explanatory memorandum.  NA",117

NA Chairman 23 August 1990 APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) Second Reading (Budget Debate) Debate resumed.",118
181,Mr SCIACCA,RFEDWARDS,"Bowman-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (8.22)-Whilst commenting on Appropriation Bill (No.1) I am very pleased to be able to say that I am following the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). The contribution that he made to this House tonight was probably one of the most pitiful contributions, by any Leader of the Opposition, that has ever been recorded. It was not so much in the way he delivered it, but in the content of what he had to say. It is fairly obvious that the Leader of the Opposition has probably what the - ormer Leader of the Opposition had-no experience in life. All he seems to know about is merchant banking and schoolboy economics. That came out fairly clearly in the contribution that he made to this debate or in any speech in this House today. He tells us that he was concerned about the battling Australian. He talked about the sick and elderly and what the Opposition would do if it ever got into government. But the reality is that only yesterday he was out on the hustings attacking the Budget and saying that one of the major things wrong with the Budget was the fact that we did not cut welfare spending sufficiently. On the one hand he says that he is out there to look after the battlers and on the other hand he is advocating, I think, at least a twofold, if not threefold, fu- cut in expenditure for welfare. I think that says what his views are when it comes to looking after the so-called sick, the elderly and the battling people in this community. He tells us that if it were up to the Opposition he would arrange to cut some $600m off the unemployment budget. Already this Government has introduced a range of measures that will be in place very shortly, and there will be substantial savings in that regard: but this will not be done by kicking the unemployed people, those genuine people who just cannot get a job. We will try to retrain them and do 1990-91 something about trying to get them into - the work force. We are not about cutting $600m off the Budget just simply so that we can kick people out into the streets and possibly even starve them; that is what the Opposition is saying. It is saying that if we cut $600m off the bill needy people who deserve unemployment benefits will not be able to get them. One of the major areas in which I thought the Leader of the Opposition was way off beam was when he talked about the fact that this Government, supposedly, allows wholesale fraud. In fact, over the last several years the Department of Social Security (DSS) has reined in fraud to such a degree that it is now only some one tenth of one per cent of the total social security budget. Any business in this country would be very happy if its bad debt situation, or fraud, was one tenth of one per cent. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition would know what fraud is all about because in the time of the Liberal Government when he was an adviser to the then Treasurer the tax avoidance industry had absolutely gone berserk, and that is where fraud was really practiced on a grand scale. He then has the temerity to say that we are the ones that allow fraud. It seems to me that he just does not know what he is talking about. It seems pretty obvious that he had nothing to say and he was just filling in time. I would like to talk about an aspect of Commonwealth spending that has played a very important part in the life of many Australians over past years and particularly over the past eight months. I am talking, of course, about the assistance given by the Commonwealth in money, or in kind, to those affected by natural disasters. Commonwealth payments under natural disaster relief arrangements, or NDRA, assist the States and the Territories to meet the unpredictable and sometimes larger costs of providing relief and restoration as a consequence of natural disaster. The arrangements recognise the States' primary responsibility under the Constitution for the administration, provision and financing of relief measures. Disasters eligible for Commonwealth assistance under the NDRA are bushfires, cyclones, earthquakes, floods and storms. Droughts were also included until July 1989 at which time they were withdrawn due to a particular group of people who had their own form of natural disaster in a recent Queensland election. No Commonwealth relief for them, I am afraid. The Commonwealth reimburses at least 50 per cent of State expenditure on measures to relieve personal hardship and distress and other eligible measures. The Commonwealth has undertaken to assist when a State's total expenditure on these measures in a financial year exceeds its assessed financial capacity-termed its base amount. The base amount for eligibility for assistance under the natural aster relief arrangements for the year 1991 are: New South Wales, $37.52m; Victoria, $25.74m; Queensland, $17.33m; Western Australia, $11.15; South Australia, $9.86m; Tasmania, $3.29m; Northern Territory, $2.72m; and the Australian Capital Territory, $2.05m. For State expenditure above the base amount, and up to 1.7 times the base amount, Commonwealth assistance is on a dollar for dollar basis. Thereafter it is on the basis of $3 Commonwealth to $1 State. So how much Commonwealth assistance are we talking about? These figures exclude the cost of emergency assistance provided by the Defence Force, and I will get onto that shortly. Let us look at these famous drought figures again. Since 1984-85 the Commonwealth has paid the following moneys to the various States and Territories: New South Wales, $1.024m; Victoria, nil-and I can see why Victorians come to Queensland, it is obviously always raining in Melbourne; Western Australia, $1.009m; South Australia, nil; Tasmania, $2.7 56m; and the Northern Territory, $0.853m. There appears to be a certain consistency to the figures until one reaches Queensland. Thirty-two years of conservative rule led to a very dry time in that State. In 1984-85 the then Bjelke-Petersen Government received $3.25m from the Commonwealth; in 1985-86, $9.43m; in 1986-87, $17.85m; and in 1987-88, $12.9m. Then under Ahern and Cooper Queensland received $12.63m. In 198990, under the new Goss Labor Government, only $233,000 was paid to Queensland. Wherever the conservatives go they cannot help but be big spenders. BjelkePetersen did untold damage to Queensland. Fraser and his fiscally irresponsible cohorts did untold damage to Australia, and those sitting opposite have the temerity to knock a Budget that brings in an $8.1 07 billion surplus. Once that kind of money is waved around in front of those opposite they cannot wait to get their hands on it and start that spending cycle an over again. The Opposition would do that by abolishing the capital gains tax if it ever got into government. The Opposidistion wants to return to an Australia where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. I think the speech of the Leader of the Opposition showed that tonight. Under Labor the Commonwealth Government is committed to helping those in genuine need, those who are experiencing true hardship. Over the past six years the Commonwealth under Labor has paid out to the States over $108m in natural disaster relief for floods, storms and cyclones. Payments for relief in 1989-90 included $10.08m for New South Wales in respect of the December 1989 Newcastle earthquake. Under the special cost sharing arrangements agreed between the Commonwealth and New South Wales, the Commonwealth provided dollar for dollar assistance for all State outlays on Newcastle earthquake relief in recognition of the special circumstances of that disaster. The Commonwealth's contribution does not stop there. The Department of Social Security staff, for example, themselves affected by the earthquake, handled some 5,000 of the 10,800 inquiries for financing and counselling assistance at the disaster emergency centre in the Broadmeadows High School. Many claims were for special benefit and the Government decided that the first week's payment should be at double the usual rate. On 14 March 1990 the New South Wales Minister for Family and Community Services presented meritorious awards to a number of DSS staff and a unit citation to all Hunter area staff. As the Parliamentary Secretary for Social Security I am certainly proud of what they did in that and in other areas of disaster which I will mention later. When the town of Nyngan was completely evacuated, when the townspeople lost their fight against the floodwaters, brunt of helping these people fell among other relief agencies and individuals and on the Dubbo regional Social Security office. Once again there were special benefit payments at the double rate and social work assistance was provided, including on ANZAC day and in the evenings. It has been a tJad year for floods; I know from personal experience. In fact, on Saturday evening, 21 April 1990, I went to Charleville with the Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss, and the Minister for Police and Emergency Services of Queensland, Terry Mackenroth. I had only recently been appointed 'as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, and I wanted to see for myself what the position was out there and what we could do to help. I have never seen anything like it. Perhaps honourable members saw it on television, but there was nothing like seeing it for yourself. There were helicopters literally plucking people off the roofs of houses that were almost ready to go under-and I mean under in the sense of the roofs going under- It was an unbelievable situation. Through the Charleville disaster control committee, it was decided to set up a one-stop shop welfare service operation in the railway station. I arranged for the then Director of Social Services in Queensland, Philip SeIth, to accompany me. In fact, I went back with the Premier that night and came back the next day along with Desley Hargreaves, the chief social worker for that area. There were people lying in this hangar on Saturday night and Sunday with blank looks on their faces, absolutely in despair, not knowing what had happened, running around and asking people like myself, the Premier and the Emergency Services Minister; 'Have you seen my husband or child?'; it was totally unbelievable. The closest I have ever come to it is watching the television program MASH, with helicopters flying down and winching injured people out. Thankfully no one was seriously injured, though I understand that one person died. It was an absolute miracle that there were not more. Social Security staff-Murray Richardthe son, David Radke, Sandy Royal, Allison Backe and Di Andrews from the Toowoomba office-set off in four-wheel drive vehicles on 23 April and arrived late in the day. Two more social workers-David Harris and Jill Ridgeway-and Mike Whitelaw, the Deputy Director of Social Services in Queensland, also arrived. They lived the way everybody else was livingin tents set up by the Army. A special front line information desk was set up at the entrance to the railway station, which was probably one of the only areas where one could get any relief in the sense that there was no water there. DSS staff took inquiries from clients and directed them to either the DSS office or the Family Services office. These DSS staff initially handled aU sorts of inquiries on such wide-ranging subjects as taxation, transport, house cleaning, evacuations, compensation, insurance and telephone access, as well as welfare inquiries concerning Social Security, Veterans' Affairs and Austudy. Later, the one-stop shop was supplemented by representatives from the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Employment, Education and Training. The whole town was under water; there was nothing there, no businesses or anything. There was just this one-stop centre where one could go and talk to people mainly from the Department of Social Security. David Harris and Jill Ridgeway actually produced the first community newsletter on the evening of 23 April so that the people in the tent city could have coordinated information on what was happening. The newsletter continued daily until replaced by the Western Times. In other words, the only communication amongst the 3,000 or 4,000 people in this hangar was the newsletter. I am very proud to say that it was the Department of Social Security that organised it. I personally visited the one-stop shop on various occasions and was impressed by the professional standard of advice and, more importantly, the compassionate manner in which it was delivered. At the end of the week a replacement DSS team arrived from Toowoomba. They had the luxury of two fully equipped caravans with cooking equipment, access to showers, et cetera. The Toowoomba office also sent a special team to the Roma area to provide immediate assistance while the Rockhampton office sent a similar team to the Longreach area and a Mount Isa team covered the Winton area. Both in Queensland and in New South Wales, DSS staff can feel the satisfaction of knowing that they put in a tremendous, committed effort and that this is fully appreciated both the Government and the community. I also make reference to the defence forces, who were unbelievable. I can say from personal experience, because I saw what happened, that they were just marvellous. During Saturday, 21 April, Army pilots from the 1st Aviation Regiment and the School of Army Aviation at Oakey, flying Kiowa and Iroquois helicopters, rescued several hundred Charleville residents from the rooftops of their flooded homes and flew them to the safety of Charleville airport. About 140 soldiers, mostly from the 6th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment, based at Enoggera, arrived late on 21 April and began erecting tents and providing food for the estimated 3,500 evacuees at the airport hangar. Many of the soldiers, under the command of the Commanding Officer of the 6th Royal Australian Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Jim Molan, worked around the clock to ease the plight of the evacuees, most of whom had not eaten for 24 hours. Army cooks prepared around 10,000 meals in one 24-hour period, using only two field kitchens. Other tasks included digging latrines, providing bedding, setting up water points and providing emergency health and medical assistance to the people confined to the hangar. The Army also provided a temporary hospitalisation facility since the Charleville hospital had been put out of action by flood damage. In fact, that day I met Major Athol Mackay, one of the Army majors in charge of the field hospital, who, it turned out, had been in grade one with me-and I assure honourable members that that was many years agoat the same school, which was quite a pleasant surprise. When the call. came for the evacuation of Cunnamulla, Black Hawk helicopters from· the 5th Aviation Regiment in Townsville joined with other aircraft to ferry people from the town to the local airport, which was cut off by road. On Monday, 7 April, a group of Enogby gera based soldiers, led by the Commander of the Divisional Engineers, Lieutenant Colonel David Thearle, arrived in the town of Alpha which was badly damaged by flooding. The Divisional Engineering Group brought heavy machinery, including graders, bulldozers and dump trucks, along with cement, steel and timber for repair work. I place on record-because very often thanks are not given to these people who give of their best to serve the community-special thanks on behalf of the community to the 6th Royal Australian Regiment and all those soldiers involved in the rescue operations at Charleville. There is no doubt that Australia is a land of extremes. Some would say that we are prone to disasters. For example, conservative governments on occasions do win government in this country. But by comparison to many countries, there have been relatively few major disasters during Australia's recorded history. Several events have resulted in massive amounts of assistance from local, State and Commonwealth authorities. Few of us here remember the Black Friday bush fires in Victoria in 1939 when 72 people perished, but Ash Wednesday in 1983 and cyclone Tracy in 1974 will linger in many memories. Sixty-two people died during Darwin's Christmas cyclone, and the bushfires in South Australia and Victoria. on Ash Wednesday claimed 75 lives. Thirteen lives were lost in the Newcastle earthquake-moderate by world standards perhaps but, nonetheless, costly in terms of Australian suffering. At the Commonwealth level, the Natural Disasters Organisation was established in 1974 following a government decision to create a single, national coordinating agency to deal with disasters. It is that organisation to which requests from the States are directed and which coordinates all Commonwealth physical support. The Natural Disasters Organisation acts as an operational agent for the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau when a foreign government requests Australian assistance after a disaster in tries of the South West Pacific region .. The Natural Disasters Organisation comes under the umbrella of the Department of Defence, although it does not perform a defence function; It sits there for administrative convenience. In recent years, the Commonwealth support provided to the States in time of natural disaster has been substantial. In the last five years or so, the Natural Disasters Organisation has coordinated Commonwealth support in bushfire fighting operations in Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. Cyclone and flood relief assistance has been provided to Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland; and aid. after storm damage has been arranged for New South Wales and Queensland. Additionally, there are many cases of local Defence Force assistance being provided directly to an affected area without the need for a request to come to Canberra. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have given you an idea of the marvellous effort put in by the defence forces in not only Charleville but also many other areas as well. When they are called they do a fine job. Other overseas disaster responses in the past few years have seen a variety of countries being the recipients of support. For example, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, the Solomons, New Caledonia and the Philippines have received assistance organised by our Natural Disasters Organisation. In our own country there has been little break in the provision of Commonwealth disaster relief assistance to the States particularly in the last eight months. The affected States have reacted magnificently to a wide range of situations. Had they not done so, particularly in the widespread floods of Queensland and New South Wales, the Commonwealth may have experienced difficulty in responding to all requests. The Commonwealth has a very good reputation for providing natural disaster relief. This is consistent with the faith that the Australian people exhibited in counthe Government at the last election. With this being the fourth successive Budget surplus, it provides Australia with a period of sustained budgetary discipline unprecedented in its history. Just as the States and Territories can rely with total confidence on the Commonwealth natural disaster mechanisms to bail them out of trouble, the people of this country can rely on this Government to work doggedly at the task of recapitalising an economy which has been mismanaged by those sitting opposite at crucial stages of the industrial development of this young country. I conclude by passing on sincere appreciation to aU those people involved in Commonwealth departments or other agencies who are called upon to take part in assistance activities. I support the Budget.",120
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,RFEDWARDS,"Mr Cowan)Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Before I call the honourable member for Hawker, I remind the House that this will be the honourable member's maiden speech and I ask that the usual courtesies be extended.",125
183,Mrs GALLUS,RFEDWARDS,"I am delighted to be here as the new member for Hawker, currently the most marginal electorate in Australia. My presence here is a tribute to those voters in Hawker who were prepared to give me a chance and to all those people in South Australia who worked for my election. In this regard I would like especially to acknowledge my family, including my parents. The Budget brought down on Tuesday night will have direct effects, many of them negative, on the people of Hawker. It is in the context of Hawker and ecoAustralia. nomic policy generally that I intend to discuss three issues: the ageing of the poppeople ulation, small business and leadership. The electorate of Hawker is in the southpopulation west corner of metropolitan Adelaide. On its western border is the Gulf of St Vin1 cent and it includes the suburb of Gleis nelg, the birthplace of South Australia. Hawker is 22 years old and for 21 years was held by Labor, although the seat itself is named after Sir Charles Hawker, a Libworth eral politician and an extraordinary whose courage and integrity have been mentioned in this House many times. Hawker holds two records: not only it currently the most marginal electorate in Australia, but also it is demographiwho cally the oldest electorate. Whereas 15 cent of the population of Australia is 60, in Hawker it is 22 per cent; in 30 years. that will be true of Australia as whole. Hawker is now what Australia will be in 2021, so if you want a glimpse the future you may visit Hawker. On the surface, it is not so different from anycrease where else in Australia-more sedate haps, but I suspect that this is a pensions. characteristic of the people and the place rather than of their age profile. Much has been written about the consequences of our ageing population in regard to lowered national productivity, increased pension payouts and greater demand for age services. I do not know if it is the Australian character that favours an attitude of 'she's all right, mate' or boredom with old arguments, but after initial concern some commentators are now suggesting that things will not be so bad after all. The commentators make three points: the greater number of people taking out superannuation will lower demand for the pension; a decline in the percentage of children in the population will mean a reduction in children's services; and, finally, they give the example of Europethe European population is already old, we are told, and people have never had it so good. These assumptions are worth examining, as are current demographic predictions and their implications for In the next 30 years the number of eligible for the social security pension will double while at the same time the work force as a proportion of the total will decline, although not dramatically-forecasts are for an increase of or 2 per cent. The expectation therefore for a declining production capacity and a greater social security bill. Increased participation in superannuation will help to reduce social security outlays, but it is remembering that, historically, in man this country superannuation has not worked well. Money invested by Australian taxpayers in the national welfare fund is in the 1940s was incorporated into general revenue in the 1950s. Many of those did without in the 1950s, 1960s and per 1970s to save for a secure old age have over found themselves impoverished by inflation and Government greed, and there is a a feeling that diverting present income towards retirement is a mug's game whose into only beneficiary is the Treasurer. It is not just that there will be a dein the productivity of the populapertion and an increased demand for An older population, by its very nature, puts a greater demand on services. Older people get sicker more often, see the doctor more often, have more episodes in hospital and take more medicines. Those who are elderly and sick will expect, as Australians do now, the very best of medical care. Unfortunately, such care costs, as the percentage of this Budget that is directed at health shows. Every new drug and every new technique creates new demand and escalates costs. It happens in all countries, but Australia is off than many because all our medical technology is imported, One new drug can add as much as $30m to our foreign debt and recombinant drug technology has put dozens of new drugs on the horizon. As well as a percentage decline in the work force, there will be a decline in the proportion of the population that is under 16. Because, proportionately, there will be fewer children, there will be a decrease in the demand for children's services, most notably in education but, despite the optimism of some commentators, savings made here will not significantly offset increased costs in the elderly sector. Not only is the proportion of the population under the age of 16 not decreasing at anywhere near the rate at which the proportion aged over 65 is increasing but, most critically, per capita social expenditure on men and women over 65 is three times greater than expenditure on children and young people under 16. The European example, although reassuring, is not as reassuring as it might be. A country like Sweden, for instance, whose population now is older than ours will be in 2020, started ageing in the 1950s, and in 1950 Sweden was better prepared for its ageing population than we are now. The ageing of our population occurs at a critical time in our economy. We have a net debt of $124 billion and one of the highest interest rates and inflation rates in the developed world. Oqr living standard, once the highest in the world, is now down to twenty-fourth on the scale and falling. We are less competitive than our South East Asian neighbours, countries that we once regarded as our economic inferiors. Not only is Australia changing demographically, it is also changing socially, and many of these changes will put pressure on our social services. Women have traditionally been the carers in our society. Not only did they care for their children, but when their parents, sisters and brothers got old, they also cared for them. It was mainly the women who went out as volunteers to care for those who did not have mothers, daughters or sisters. This is changing and to a large extent worse has already changed. Ask any organisation that uses volunteers. The women who used to make up the unpaid work force are now going out into paid employment. In future years, there will be fewer women caring for the old and the sick. Unless the recently retired, the young old, are prepared to become volunteers and help care for the frail elderly, the Government is going to have to pay for the care that was once free. This will add to the cost of our social services, as will the increasing divorce rate, resulting in fewer elderly people having spouses to care for them. In Australia, we will have to make fundamental changes if we are to support an ageing population. One of the things that has to change is our attitude to the elderly. Several weeks ago, when I was at Yookamurra sanctuary in South Australia, I talked to an elderly gentleman who is spending his retirement as part of a volunteer work gang erecting fences to keep feral animals out of the conservation area. He told me that he had never worked so hard, never enjoyed himself so much and never felt so useful in his life. Not everyone enjoys his or her retirement as much. I am distressed when I meet women and men in Hawker whose skills were lost when they were forced to retire at 60 or 65. Forced retirement is a waste of skills that we can no longer afford. The Government needs to take the lead, not only in legislating against age discrimination but also in providing financial and other encouragement for business to change its work practices and employ elderly staff on a part time basis. For those who want to retire, for those who have had enough after 40 or 50 years in the work force, we need to ensure that retirement offers more than a daily struggle to make ends meet. We need to provide what we do not provide now-the ! security of knowing that, whatever happens to them, older people are assured of appropriate accommodation and a satisfactory level of personal care. At present, with inadequate services for the elderly and an ageing population, Australia is headed for a crisis in elderly care. In Hawker we already have a crisis. As part of its deinstitutionalisation policy, the Hawke Labor Government has reduced funding to nursing homes in South Australia and changed the criteria by which elderly people could be admitted to those homes. In doing so, it has left many elderly people without anywhere to go. The promise was that care would be available to them in their own homes and this is why the home and community care (HACC) program was set up. Despite the fact that HACC has swallowed millions of dollars, this care is still not available to those who need it. In my area elderly people have to wait up to a week to be assessed. Of those asking for help, only half receive it and many only after a long wait. Elderly people who may be incontinent are showered three times a week because that is all that the domiciliary· care service can provide with its present resources. Day care centres in Hawker have twoyear waiting lists for elderly podiatry. Men and women who cannot walk without pain are being told that they have to wait two years for treatment. Elderly people who see their health fading are frightened by the future. 'What is going to happen to me?' is a recurring question, as is 'What will happen to my wife when I die?'. For many of the elderly, what was supposed to be a comfortable retirement has turned into a nightmare. The most poignant description of the plight of those on fixed incomes was given to me by a local bank manager. 'They have worked hard and saved all their lives', he said, 'and they were proud of what they had achieved. Now they can't make ends meet. They regard themselves as failures and they see their whole lives in terms of that failure'. Particularly cruel is the expense faced by those elderly people who have tried to be self-reliant by taking out health insurance. Since they are already poor, an illness can cost them thousands of dollars on top of the insurance, the tax and the Medicare levy. I would be remiss if I did not make one last observation on behalf of the elderly in Hawker. The older people in my electorate are concerned for their safety. They live behind locked doors and are afraid to go out at night; and increasingly they are also afraid to go out by themselves during the day. They are starting to doubt the ability of the police to protect them and of the courts to provide justice. They are afraid of lawyers because they know they cannot afford them. I would not like to give the impression that in Hawker only ageing concerns us. In Hawker, as elsewhere in Australia, we are concerned about the falling standard of living of families and the desperate situation of small business. Last week I had a telephone call from the owner of a business which until last year was one of four that were manufacturing and exporting hydraulic valves. Three have gone to the wall, and this businessman wanted to let me know how difficult it was for him to survive. What sort of government has policies which drive. exporters out of business? Businessmen in my electorate have asked me to point out to the Government that its policies are bankrupting them. For over a year they have been paying between 20 per cent and 23 per cent interest on their overdrafts. Sales are down due to a reduction in the spending power of the population generally. Those businesses competing with overseas products are finding it increasingly difficult to remain competitive; interest rates, work practices and government imposts drive their charges up beyond those of their overseas competitors. Almost weekly they are hit with new charges in regard to their employees: work cover, superannuation, redundancy payments and skill training levy. All these new charges on employers are imposed at a time of high interest rates. They are imposed without change to outmoded work practices, without the removal of penalty rates, and in a time of economic downturn when sales are slumping. None of this is new. Yet businessmen are ringing me up to tell me because they think that the Government could not know this, for surely if Government Ministers knew what their policies were doing to business they would change them. This Government has also failed to realise that small businessmen are forming a new class of poor in our society. Unlike the worker who loses his - job and can receive unemployment relief, the small businessman whose business is collapsing has no access to social services. I have businessmen in the electorate of Hawker who have invested their life's work in plant and equipment. With the current high costs and declining sales, they do not take anything home as they are earning only enough to pay the lease or interest on their equipment. They are not eligible for relief from the Government because they are self-employed. They can keep their businesses and forget abo-t feeding and clothing their families; or they can obtain unemployment relief by closing their businesses, losing their plant and equipment, and with it their occupation and everything they have worked for. Their's is Hobson's choice: no choice at all. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has spoken repeatedly of slowing down the economy and on Tuesday night informed the House that this had occurred. The reality of this Government-engineered slowdown is that in my electorate manufacturers are closing their doors, hundreds of empty shops display 'for lease' signs, and men and women are losing their jobs. The reality of this Government-engineered slowdown is that families are not making ends meet and for many owning a home is no longer a possibility. The reality is that churches are having difficulty coping with the increased demand for food, bedding, clothes and money. We all know that in times of crisis policies have to be introduced that cut living standards. The assumption is that the hardship will be shared equally throughout the community. The reality is that it is not. Some people are sheltered from it. These people, many of them on salaries paid for by the taxpayer, wear Italian suits, commission expensive house renovations and travel to football matches in VIP aeroplanes. The Government-engineered economic recession has not touched these people. Yet thousands of men and women in Australia have been affected by these policies. They have lost their jobs, their homes and their self-respect. The people of Australia have the right to believe that the Government they elect will put their well-being first. Yet in developing its policies this Government has given little consideration to their effect on individuals. This Budget, with its lack of vision for the future, has nothing for the people of Australia. This Government has brought more than economic change to Australia. A distressing change that I am noticing in my electorate and elsewhere is the pessimism and disillusionment that is growing in the community. Australians today are concerned for the country and its future. They see our national debt growing at a billion dollars a month. Figures are dressed up, explained, dismissed, but they know that the bottom line is that every day we are getting deeper into debt. Australians are concerned that in getting out of debt we will have to sell too much of our country to people who do not live here, who will not act in the best interests of this country, who will invest without understanding this country or its residents and, in doing so, destroy what is unique to Australia. They are concerned that in trying to get out of debt we will forget what is most precious to usour environment, our beaches, our forests, our way of life. They are concerned that to get out of debt we will cater not for our own citizens but for foreign businessmen in search of a quick dollar and for tourists after packaged holidays and cheap souvenirs. Australians do not like the great disparity in wealth that they are now seeingnot between the poor and the rich but between the rich and everyone else. While most Australians have a declining standard of living, there are people in Australia who, under this Government, have become obscenely rich. It worries Australians that while there are hundreds of thousands of children living in poverty, we put up this building at a cost of over a billion dollars and we spend $750,000 on a wall for the members' dining room. Australians are questioning the integrity and credibility of men and women who talk about restraint on the one hand and spend unrestrainedly on the other. The people who live in this country care about it-not just for themselves and not just for their children. They are fearful for the future of Australia, and at the same time they are disillusioned. One of the greatest causes of their disillusionment is that, despite this being the most overgoverned country in the world, there is no leadership. In conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude to the people in this House, on both sides of the chamber, and to the parliamentary staff for the help and assistance they have given me since my election.",125
184,Mrs DARLING,RFEDWARDS,"Madam Deputy Speaker, we live in a volatile society and part of that volatility is due to the fact that we are a free society and we $per WEEK 140 120 110 100 are increasingly becoming an informed society. This means that the ideal of full intercommunication between government and citizens is coming closer, with lobby groups forming as people realise that a good way to have their needs incorporated in government policy in a democracy is to keep that need consistently before the government. The results of such up front communication are obvious in two particular ways: in policies which break new ground in serving particular groups in the community, and in a speedier rate of reform in response to demonstrated need. Thus pensioners' high profile in articulating their message clearly and consistently, along with a Government traditionally supportive of people on the lower rungs of income, has resulted in a rate of increase in standard pension rates which far outstrips the rate in increase in average weekly earnings. Madam Deputy Speaker, I refer to a table graphing the increase in pension rate and the increase in percentage of average weekly earnings from 1983-90. I seek leave for the graph to be incorporated in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read as followsNA $ PER WEEK AND lIS OF AWE 1983 TO 1990 ,:; of AWE 150 28 r----, $/week 27 ,:; AWE 130 26 '--_----l ,I - ! 25 /\....:...' ...../ -""""/ ...... j 24 90 80 23 70 22 ,/'O- ,/'OAr ,/'O- ,/'OE> ,/'01 ,/'0'0 ,/'O- ,/-o NA",129
185,Mrs DARLING,QUARTER,"A significant reform undertaken by this Government is the extensive reform to the tax system as it applies to pensioners. This should have been done decades ago. This reform is being phased in over three stages, at the close of which by 1995 all pensioners, full or part time, will pay no tax whatsoever. The three stages are stage one, already introduced in July of this year, under which the income test-free area for pensioners became tax free. This eliminated the requirement to pay tax on the nonpension income within the free area and simplified the coordination between social security and the Australian Tax Office, a simplification much needed. Stage two will be introduced in July 1990-91, when the income test-free area for social security and veterans' pensions will be indexed annually in line with rising prices. This move is particularly welcomed by me, as I am sure it will be by the thousands of Australian pensioners. I am certainly aware of pensioners within my area of Lilley and beyond who under the earlier Liberal Government were tied to an income test-free area of about $20 per week for years. They experienced the disadvantage of being tied to a fixed amount of extra income per week through interest or other means while that income was being eroded by rising prices. This Government's reform will ensure that efforts to maintain real incomes is not eroded by either pension loss or by tax. The third stage of the Hawke Government's reform of the tax system for pensioners bring to culmination full tax justice for Australian pensioners. By 1995 all 1.7 million age and service pensioners, both full and part time, will be removed entirely from the tax system and will only be subject to the withdrawal rate on their pension entitlement. From 1995 no age or service ""pensioner will pay any income tax. Before passing on to other aspects of the Budget, I must make the point that these reforms would not mean as much were they implanted on a static pension rate. But as the graph which I presented to the Parliament indicates, this is not the case. Since coming to office, the Government has increased the standard pension rate from $77.25 per week to $141.20 per week. The standard pension rate applies to the following pensions: single age, invalid, wife's, carer's, widow's and sole parent. All these have been increased. For a married couple the combined pension rate has increased by 9.9 per cent since March 1983 compared to a fall of 2.4 per cent under the Fraser Government. This increase has met a long standing promise of the Hawke Government to increase the pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings and we have now passed that mark. Madam Deputy Speaker, there are some aspects of the 1990-91 Budget which require careful consideration by both Government and the public. I refer to Senator Graham Richardson's grasping the nettle regarding introduction of real measures to combat the drop in pensions in coming years which researchers have foreseen as a result of the approaching population imbalance. between taxpayers and retired people. That is, trends show that by the year 2000 the number of elderly people in the population will peak while the number of younger people-the next generation who are still in jobs and must pay through their taxes for the welfare system-will fall. One of the measures to combat this is an additional increase to the standard pension rate over and above the indexation increase. When the proposal for a charge of $2.50 payable by pensioners for prescriptions was publicised some weeks ago, I represented pensioners' interests to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) and to his ministerial colleague, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples). Both Ministers were very concerned at the reports and assured me that they would act to protect pensioners in Government discussions on the matter. Their solution is now well publicised. As a consequence of the reforms to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) charging $2.50 per item to a limit of $50-that is, 20 prescriptions-after which all PBS items will be free, the standard pension rate is to be increased by $2.50 per week from the first pay period in November 1990. The net effect of the PBS changes is that over the course of anyone year no-one currently receiving free PBS items will be out of pocket and in fact most pensioners will be better off. Setting the $2.50 charge is not my choice and I would not stand mute if any pensioners were to be disadvantaged. But it is only fair to say that social security Ministers in the Hawke Government have not allowed pensioners to be disadvantages by Government policy in the past as seen by the extra assistance given to them, as noted earlier. And I do not expect them to do so now. There could be potential effects which must be given serious consideration. It is important that pensioners in Lilley keep me informed and through me the Minister so that we can ensure that they are not disadvantaged in any way through any of the changes. It is hard to keep a logical debate on some of these matters considering some of the misrepresentation which is abroad. In fact, I am angry at the misrepresentation of another such measure, and that is the move to maximise pension incomes by asses-ing certain amounts at a minimum set rate as 'a raid by Paul Keating on pensioners' savings'. This sort of myth does nothing to promote proper public debate on issues which must be faced for the benefit of future Australians. The question to be asked is: Who pays for benefits for the elderly? Taxpayers pay. How will taxpayers in work manage to keep up the present benefits as the ratio of elderly beneficiaries to younger taxpayers is thrown out of balance more and more as we approach the year 2000. The. problem is well known among welfare workers and the general public. But talking about it will not rectify the - ituation. Someone has to think about it and come up with a few answers. That is what Senator Graham Richardson has done. He has looked for ways to do away with inefficiencies, ways to make savings without hurting pensioners. And those are the key words: without hurting pensioners. The move to encourage pensioners with savings to increase interest paid to them and thereby relieve taxpayers through a greater contribution from banks does not hurt pensioners. It is based on a very real situation which now exists and it makes good sense. I have quite often spoken to pensioners who put their money in savings accounts and thereby make half the interest which could be theirs if they invested in a similarly secure account, but with higher interest. Why. not do it? For instance, a Commonwealth Bank savings account pays 3.7 per cent up to $4,000 and 6 per cent on that part of the balance over $4,000. But a Commonwealth Bank savings investment account, to which one can have immediate access if necessary, pays effectively between 8.16 per cent and 11.83 per cent on deposits over $500. Moreover, a single age pensioner on a full pension with, say $34,800 in a savings account paying 6 per cent per annum in interest will still be better off by about $14.85 per week if the interest rate is increased to as much as 13.50 per cent per annum, despite the reductions in pension and pensioner rebate due to the extra income and despite the income tax payable because the additional income exceeds the tax-free threshold. So, even if extra income from bank interest reduced a pensioner's social security payment, the increased interest rate would still bring that pensioner a higher overall income. This should not be overlooked. The point is that the pensioner's switch in bank accounts is a socially responsible action in that the burden on the taxpayer is lightened, freeing more money to pay extra benefits to those in need, most of whom are pensioners. Some pensioners respond to this suggestion by claiming their right to a pension after years of paying tax. This is so. But again I make the point, given the instances I have cited, that they will n-t miss out by being clever with their financial affairs. Why should they not alleviate the tax burdens of younger generations and free up tax money to increase their benefits by clever organisation of their affairs? Why should the banks not contribute in what is valid investment venture? I have the Opposition claim that the drain on the banks in paying the extra interest would result in their cutting off other services to customers. It is outrageous suggest that this would happen as a result of proper investment of savings. It is also outrageous that the Opposition should the interest of banks before the interest pensioners. Why should the banks not pay pensioners the same rate of interest as they pay other customers? I will be looking forward to more disper cussions with pensioners in my electorate about these changes. These people have worked hard all their lives and they deserve the support of the Government. has been demonstrated that they have rehomes ceived the support of the Hawke Governcommunity. ment and will continue to· do so. People January 1991. do not lose their intelligence just because they get older. A patronising attitude often adopted in telling pensioners what is .or what is not happening to them. quite expect the pensioners within my electorate to come to the conclusion that if they can, without risk to themselves, accept advice and remove their money from a savings account to perhaps a savperiod ings investment account, they will be vantaged, they will have extra money per week, and they will also have the satisfaccurrently tion of knowing that in allowing banks contribute to the very real and proper cost of looking after our aged citizens they forced have moved to alleviate the tax burden on younger taxpayers-many of them with families and many of them related to these age pensioners-bearing in mind that as we approach the year 2000 the number aged people will increase in proportion to welcome. the number of young people ill work. Madam Deputy Speaker, given the tight constraints of this Budget, I am pleased to see that the Government is providing extra funding for those most in need, the forgotten people who are too busy striving to get on with their daily life to be able to form huge lobby groups and thus perage suade governments to legislate in their favour. The trend for them to be forgotonwards. ten people has been seen under different a governments. That trend has not continheard ued under the Hawke Government. I would like to mention a couple of these measures. One particular measure is that of improved respite care to help carto ers of frail aged people or of people with disabilities. Nursing homes and hostels will be receiving more financial assistance put through this Budget to provide respite of care. For nursing homes, the respite supplement will be increased from $11.78 a day to $16.82. For hostels, the subsidy for respite residents will increase from 125 cent of the personal care subsidy to 137.5 per cent of that subsidy. These in. creases recognise the extra work involved in caring for a person on a respite basis. It They will encourage hostels and nursing to provide respite services for their The increases will begin in Another area of great concern to people is who are elderly or who have elderly relatives is the expansion of the dementia I grants program. This has been an increasingly acknowledged problem within Australia. In fact, it has been estimated that the. incidence of dementia will have increased by 42 per cent over the 10-year to 1996. Approximately 25 per cent adof hostel residents have moderate to severe dementia, but hostel dementia grants cover only 10 per cent of hostel to residents. Due to current hostel funding levels, many people with dementia who could be cared for in hostels are being into nursing homes. But the increase in dementia grants approved in the Budget will mean grants for an extra 1,300 hostel residents. The coverage will then be 55 per cent of hostel residents suffering of from dementia. This increase is really There is further to go, but it is one of the facts of life that for many years the incidence of dementia was not recognised in people. Perhaps it was not fully recog. nised until we realised that younger people were suffering from Alzheimer's disease. It is now known that a very large percentof the population will suffer from dementia in their later years-from age 70 I think it is a mark of the thoughtfulness of this Budget-of the Ministers and the Prime Minister-that, whilst looking at the overall macro-economic requirements of Australia, they have managed to increase funding into some key areas of need so that disadvantaged people in Australia are not being left behind as a forgotten generation. Madam· DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",130
186,Mr COWAN,QUARTER,"We come into this House as the representatives of our people not only to represent the ones on the roll in our electorates but also to look at the country in which we live and to try to express what we believe to be the answers to a country that is growing very quickly. Only the year before last we celebrated the bicentehary of Australia. It gave to us an opportunity to assess our people and also to assess the opportunities that we have in this great land. I suppose we could well say that we are basically at the crossroads at the moment as to where we go to expand Australia and to take advantage of the markets around the world. At the same time we need to maintain a standard of living generally for all Australians, and I suppose that Budget time is the time to properly. assess the way we ought to go. I would think that most Australians would join with the Opposition in saying that we are not happy; in other words, that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) did not meet the expectations that this country really requires. We are very fortunate in Australia that we have our natural resources, that we have good soil and that we have people who are prepared to work if they are given the opportunity. We are a nation that many people in other countries of the world, particularly the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, are very anxious to visit. Tourists and business people actually see the opportunities in Australia. suppose we cannot complain when people from other countries come and see us and say that they want a share of our soil or a share of the business that we have in Australia. We cannot blame them for that because many of them are actually hidebound in their countries, and that is why they turn their attention towards Australia:. We must be very careful over the years ahead of the way we dispose of the assets of Australia. When we compare Australia with the rest of the world I think that we all have . to agree that we have not put our shoulders to the wheel in the; way that we should have. We have tremendous resources and opportunities but we have failed to meet the expectations, I think, of other people in the world. We had that opportunity and maybe we can all blame ourselves to a very great degree. I know it is easy for me to get up here and to condemn the Government or the Treasurer for a Budget. I think that we have not thought deeply enough, particularly in the years since 1972, when we seemed to transgress the. other way, We have had a terrible job ever since of reversing ourselves and going on a more prosperous way. So, all of us can be to blame, a certain amount, for the economic situation that we are in. But the fact of the matter is that Ido place right at the feet of the Government the problems that we have had with respect to the accord. I think that was one of the features of the industrial relations policy of the Government that started the decline that we are experiencing at the present time. That accord, of course, is the arrangements between the ACTUand the Government; in other words, as somebody expressed here earlier today-I think it was the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)- Mr Kelty is an ex-officio member of the Cabinet, and virtually this is true. When a government is virtually controlled by one body of people how can it implement its policies? I am sure that honourable members-including the I honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) and others-are very genuine in their desire to build a country and to look after the people that they happen to represent. I think that there has been a decline which we have all failed to heed and we have not taken the action that we should have. I know that I can say that we have a growing national debt; that we have high inflation; that our balance of trade is poor indeed. The Australian people are fed up with the forms of taxation that we have. Maybe I am not a lover of a consumption tax, but I see it as an answer because it has been tried out in other countries and, whilst they have kept up their public sector spending, they have been unable to succeed in the way that they should have in regard to their goods and services tax or their value added tax. The people of this country, as mentioned today by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) during the grievance debate, feel guilty. They feel guilty because of the way that they are treated and the demands that are placed upon them by the Taxation Office. None of us minds paying tax, but some of the various taxes that the Treasurer has introduced over the seven years of the Government have been necessary because of tax evasion. I do not actually condemn him for that, but it is high time that the governmeht of the day looked at our taxation measures and brought these together so that they are more simplified and understood by people. Even an age pensioner today has to go along to his chartered accountant or tax agent to get his returns fixed up and sent to the Taxation Office. These are the problems that are facing Australians at the present time and there is little incentive in our present taxation system where the individual tax takes the incentive away from people to work. Where is the incentive for a person to go and work in his local club or an industry of some kind of an evening, after a day's work? Where is the incentive when there is high taxation because people work overtime? And so it is that people say, 'We do not want to exert ourselves any further'. ",133
187,Mr COWAN,QUARTER,"As the honourable member for Mallee says, look at the shearers. No matter where we look across the board we will find these people, and this is not characteristic of what we can expect from the genuine Australian. So, I call upon the Treasurer to have a look at his taxation system, not only because he very says that a consumption tax would have been all right back in 1985 but not now. That is all tommy rot, Madam Deputy Speaker. If it was all right back in 1985 it is quite all right now. It can relieve the individual and it also means that the person who is buying the goods, the better goods, is the person who is going to pay; in other words, the user pays conception of the entire system. Let us remember that this country has been, and always will be, very dependent on primary industry, very dependent upon natural resources, very dependent upon the manufacturing industries and, as the years go on, more and more dependent upon the tourist industry. Those are only four of the issues to which I draw the attention of the Parliament. I am very worried about primary industry simply because in my electorate-and I know elsewhere-there are old established farmers, efficient farmers, who are troubled with the high interest rates that we face at the present time. This Government that is in power now has been very fortunate. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer want to pray to the good Lord every night and to thank Him that throughout their entire period we have had reasonable seasons here in Australia and we have had reasonable markets around the world. But this must change. History repeats itself so far as seasons are concerned, and I think that the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics statistics say that we can expect a 50 per cent decline in the income of our export primary industries over the next couple of years. That will be a severe blow to the primary producers of Australia who are as efficient as any other country of the world. And so it is that this country does still ride upon the sheep's back, live upon the soil which we have here and depend upon the farmers who are working that soil. I am sure it must hurt many of us to think that we have resource industries in this country, as the Leader of the Opposition said earlier this evening, such as that at Coronation Hill, our pulping mills and other types of industries that can be established with proper environmental standards surrounding them and that our people want because they want to work; that the government of the day wants to get those balance of payments figures down; and yet we see from day to day and year to year a government that is rejecting development because of the pressure of the greenies and the Left of its particular party. This is a crying shame for this country of ours. It is something that our people, who are entrepreneurs, certainly do not deserve. If that resource is there and if it can be covered from an environmental point of view, let us go ahead and sell to a world that wants our natural resources. Is it not a great shame that we in this country are importing steel when we have the ingredients to produce steel here? Is it not a great shame that we are importing timber when we have the soil to grow the timber on? This would be unheard of in other countries, but we are prepared to accept it. We are not regenerating the forests and our private lands with timber, yet that is a resource that it is so possible to renew. The natural resources that we have in this land of ours must be utilised effectively, and we should manufacture from those resources over a broad range of industries. Surely we are capable, with today's technology, of adopting these processes. I have jotted down here the topic of manufacturing. We know that we should be manufacturing instead of importing, simply for the reasons I happened to mention a while ago. Let us look at the tourist industry, and consider the Budget that we are debating. I know that Mr John Brown, who is Chairman of the Australian Tourist Commission, wrote to a lot of us and pleaded with us, as a former Minister of the Government, to put our little bit of pressure on to see that the Treasurer and the Government realised that here is an industry that we have in our grasp, a tourist industry in which our own people are travelling. I believe we have less than two million people a year coming into Australia, with the potential for four million, five million, 20 million a year to come here. But look at what has happened her:e. Penalty awards are virtually strangleholding the tourist industry within Australia, and I could speak of other industrial award requirements that have a very adverse effect on the growth of tourism. The Commission wanted extra funds-though they have been virtually cut in real money terms-to research the industry and say, 'These are the issues we believe that government in Australia, not only Commonwealth but State, should look at; these are the things that we have to do'. We have to keep our costs down, for one thing. The cost of accommodation in Sydney and elsewhere around Australia is phenomenal. Australians cannot afford to holiday in our cities. As well, our airline passenger costs have not come down. They have come down very little in price since the days we first talked about the two airline agreement. I do not know whether deregulation is going to solve some of those problems that we have. It costs so much to fly from Perth over to Canberra; I believe we can fly to New Zealand more cheaply than that. We might even get to Hawaii cheaper, for all I know, with package deals. But this is the situation that exists here. So industrial relations is the number one issue. Research is another thing, as is the encouragement of the entrepreneur to provide reasonable accommodation at a reasonable cost. Every time we raise interest rates, every time inflation goes up, across a vast board these things have a tremendous effect on the prospects of this land of ours and the people who work it. We have to realise that. Look at primary industry again, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am one who believes it would be a wonderful thing if we could reduce tariffs, if all countries of the world could bring their barriers down. I commend the Government and its Ministers for negotiating under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and arguing strongly with the European Economic Community and the United States of America that they should stop their dumping and take their barriers down. It would be great if we could reduce our tariffs because then we could say to them, 'Look, we have given you an example of what we believe should occur'. As much as I say that, Madam Deputy Speaker, I too sound a note of warning here. If we cannot bring interest rates down, if we cannot get the economy of this nation back on track, we will have continue protection of the industries that we have. Whilst our farmers say, in eral, that they do not want protection long as we can break down the protection of other countries producing the same commodities, the fact of the matter is that I for one, and some of my colleagues certainly, would have to stand by the people who elected us here and whom we believe are so important to this nation. I spoke of those four issues because think they are very important-primary industry, manufacturing, natural repensioner folk. sources and the tourist industry. But let me say a few words concerning the Budget itself. The Budget did not tackle the issues that face Australia at the present time. Pensioners are concerned. Superanafford nuants are concerned, and many of us have such people within our electorate whose benefits are not indexed the way they should be. Some are lucky; their's are. These people are finding it more ficult every day to pay their accounts to be able to go to stores and buy things they would like to buy. We can talk also about aged care. can talk about care in the home, the cillary care that matters so people. Maybe I cannot complain because I must say that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) has been rather fair to me. I have got nursing homes and hostels, and these are so imThat is the simple answer portant to a part of Australia where there Government should do away - re more and more aged people moving m because of our geographical situation. assure you, Madam Deputy Speaker, That was mentioned tonight by the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus), who made a remarkable maiden speech, for which I commend her, about aged care. I think all members of chamber would certainly agree with everything she said. The family allowance scheme is now to be assets tested. I will just give an example of this. We have lots of farmers around Australia who want to live on their land. Their income is very low. But because a neighbour down the road sells so many hectares of land at a certain price, that is the valuation on a comparable sales basis. to So the asset value of their property is probably above the $300,000. Honourable genmembers here with me in the House toas night would know many people, I am sure, fitting these circumstances. These people will now be affected by the assets testing for the family allowance. I appeal to the Treasurer to have a look at this again. If it is going to be tested, do not test it so much on the value of the real estate, but on the taxable income of those people concerned. There are enough hardships I now, Madam Deputy Speaker, I can assure you, without the assets testing of our Many of my electors today are living in real near poverty, one could say a very restricted existence. They certainly cannot to buy a new car, they cannot buy the clothes or even the food they would like to buy because they are on a property. They do not want to move into town and buy a four bedroom home. That is difthe answer that the Government gives: and 'You can sell the place you have got and the you can move into town'. They do not want to move into town. They like the environment 10 or 12 miles or 50 miles We from town. They want to stop there and anrear their few head of cattle, and make much to enough to pay the rates. Those are the problems. The Government should wipe its assets test.

These are the things that the Government should consider.",134
188,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUARTER,"Hunter) (9.41)this The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) is a gentleman and a friend and it is a pleasure to follow him in this Budget debate, but the honourable member illustrates the myopic view of the Opposition when he blames Australia's economic problems on the accord. We had a massive wage break-out which destroyed the economy and produced massive unemployment the last time the conservatives were in government. Since the accord the unions have acted most responsibly and responsible wage outcomes are one of the great achievements of this Hawke Government. Surprise of surprises: for years the old Country Party used communism to scare the people of Australia; now the honourable member for Lyne is blaming the environmentalists for all the problems of the nation. The honourable member also rightly refers to the importance of primary industry to Australia. I know that the honourable member, as farmers in my electorate do, will join me, as the member for the rural electorate of Hunter, in gratulating the present Minister for Primary Industries apd Energy (Mr Kerin) for the wonderful job he is doing. I listened with interest to the maiden speech of the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus). It was quite well delivered, but I do not think I am being unfair in saying it was a bit of a bleeding heart effort. She went on at length about aged care. One of the great problems facing Australia is the ageing of the population. That problem has been around for some time, but during the long period of conservative rule its magnitude was nothing like it is today. The conservatives did nothing for aged care. Another great achievement of this Government has been the expansion of aged care places, and we are doing a remarkable job in that sphere. It has been said-and truly-that this Federal Budget does not bring home the bacon; rather, it grills and browns it deliGovernment ciously, slaps a bargain price on it and ensures that every Australian can enjoy it at the breakfast table. 'Mate', said one of my constituents recently, 'I'm doing well'-and Norm is doing rather well. In 1982 when the Liberals were in government, Norm and his two sons were unemployed and had no prospects of gaining a job. Today the three are working, earning a good social wage and able to afford bacon whenever they want it on the menu. Another constituent-we will call her",136
189,Mrs X,QUARTER,"rang this morning. She was angry until I told her the truth about the pharmaceutical changes; Mrs X is a pensioner and she had been scared by nonsense media reports about medication costs. She was not too charitable to the media when it was explained to her that they had caused her unnecessary worry. The lady was delighted to learn that the pharmaceutical changes announced in the Budget will put more money into her pocket. She now pays $5 per month for medication and, with the new changes, she will make a profit of $70 each year on top of her indexed pension increases. I will discuss pharmaceuticals later. I make this point: no Budget is easy and this Budget was particularly difficult. It is the Treasurer's eighth Budget and con- the easier decisions were made over the previous seven years. Cuts in government spending are becoming harder and harder, and the Treasurer and Cabinet have performed extraordinarily well in managing to cut government spending this year from 30 per cent of gross domestic product to 23.5 per cent. The strategy is to cut within three' years the level of government spending to 21.6 per cent of GDP. This projected level will cut Federal government spending back to the same level that Federal government spending was in the 1950s-a remarkable effort. So, when the Opposition members made ridiculous claims about this Government being a mob of great big spenders, is it any wonder they are given a great big horse laugh? Despite the enormous increase in the range of Federal Government programs such as welfare benefits, child-care places, aged care places, et cetera, every year this decreases its level of expenditure. How have we performed this miracle? The answer is quite simple: we have stopped the rorts and made all Australians pay their fair share of tax. We took the extra money we got from a fairer tax system, the extra money we got from putting an end to tax avoidance and evasion, and gave it to the deserving. We better targeted the Australian tax dollar. The Australian tax and welfare systems now, thanks to a Labor government, have a seal of integrity. I issue a word of warning to all those voters who think this week's Budget is too tough: 'Thank your lucky stars you were not hit with the Budget the Liberals wanted to zap you with'. The Liberals wanted to lop an additional $500m off government spending; they wanted to cut wages further; they wanted to slug pensioners and other disadvantaged groups; they wanted to grind average Australians into miserable poverty; they wanted to create a divided two-class society where a few rich got richer and the masses got poorer. The words 'fairness' and 'equity' are foreign words to the conservative parties. Government spending in Australia is the fourth lowest of the 24 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Australian taxes are not only fairly apportioned, they are the third lowest in the Western world. The hide of those opposite to criticise Government-hypercritical hypocrites! What hope for the sick of Australia if this nation were to be governed by a rump, completely lacking in a health policy. What hope for the workers of Australia if it were to be governed by ideologues who cannot or will not announce a wages policy. We know what those opposite would do with wages-they would hold them down and let unemployment soar. Alternatively, they would have a wage blowout with unemployment still at 13 per cent and interest rates of 30 per cent. Shades of 1982 and 1983. As happened in 1982 and 1983, every business would virtually go to the wall. The Liberals and their country cousins call for reform. Horror of horrors! What reform would we get from them, given their past record? Would this Ferrari-led cavalcade opposite have indexed pensions? Would they have removed pensioners from the tax system? Would they have introduced a fringe tax benefits tax to cut out their mates' free lunches? Would they have matched this Government's record expansion in aged and child care places? Would those opposite have initiated environmental programs? Under them we would have had a far higher overseas debt and a Budget deficit higher than the $9.6 billion deficit of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). Not from them successive Budgets with a surplus of $8 billion; not from them a doubling of retention rates in our secondary schools; not from them increased places in tertiary institutions. The only barrow the Ferrari crowd is pushing at the moment is a consumption tax, designed to rip the lining out of the pockets of the disadvantaged members of society. A consumption tax would crush the Australian economy by saddling it with a 15 per cent inflation rise. Certainly, our Treasurer favoured a consumption tax in 1985, but the circumstances then were somewhat different. The tax system then was being rorted unmercifully. Tax avoidance and evasion were rampant. This is no longer true. Today we all pay our fair share of tax. When the Treasurer spoke then in this favour of the consumption tax we had a Budget deficit, but for the past four years we have had a Budget surplus. The Opposition's consumption tax would benefit only the most wealthy and would disadvantage low income earners and the needy in our society. That is why this Government has no intention of introducing a consumption tax. In fact, I despair of the Liberals and Nationals ever coming up with an idea that will benefit the people of Australia. Last Tuesday evening the Government kept its nerve and produced a Budget which is appropriate for difficult economic times, a Budget designed specifically to defeat our overseas debt problems. We have sidestepped the recession and kept Australian workers in jobs, and I believe middle Australia will applaud the fairness of the 1990 Budget. We have taken hard decisions but they are fair decisions and decisions which are absolutely necessary to restore Australia to economic health. We have avoided the pain and misery that occurred in 1982-83. Federal Government spending has been cut to 1973 levels without any slugging of the underdog. Pensioners who think they will be disadvantaged by this Budget are wrong. The effect on pensioners is revenue neutral. All we have done is to better target welfare benefits and we have come up with another Budget surplus of $8 billion. The reforms introduced in the Federal Budget are welcome and necessary. The only sad note is that they have been either maliciously or innocently misinterpreted. It is nonsense to describe the Budget as an attack on the elderly, the sick and the unemployed. Quite clearly, there is a silly season immediately following the Budget; but common sense and calm will thankfully return when the Australian electorate has had time to assess the Budget initiatives. Not surprisingly, some chemists have chosen to criticise pharmaceutical initiatives. Some welfare and pensioner spokespersons have also been critical of the reforms on prescriptions and also on savings, but these criticisms are undoubtedly due to knee-jerk reactions to inaccurate reports. One of my constituents objected to the Government telling him how he must invest his savings, but I told him that I objected to him living off other people's earnings while he made a gift of $8,000 per year to his bank. When the tumult and the shouting die, pensioners will find that they are better off if they elect to maximise their interest income. If they maximise their income within the next six months they will not lose their fringe benefits. That information brought a sigh of relief from many people who rang me today and started out by abusing me. Their abuse turned to joy when I informed them of the truth of the Budget provisions. To those who have jumped in and claimed this Budget as an attack on battlers, let me make some points. Total government spending on social welfare during the next year is to increase by $ 3 billion and total government spending on social welfare will rise to 32 per cent of total Budget. So in welfare there is a 12 per cent increase. Any person who interprets that as an attack on welfare did not win many maths prizes at high school. The truth is that we will be stopping the money going to welfare cheats and giving that money we saved, plus some more, to the genuinely needy. People who are able to work but who do not want to will face tougher times, but people who are unable to work or unable to find work will lose no benefits-not a cent. Once people learn the truth about this Budget they will accord it the accolades it deserves. Current real levels of defence expenditure have been achieved. The Government has honoured its election commitment to war veterans, and expenditure in that area is up by nearly 6 per cent. Some $l1m has been provided to accelerate micro-economic reform in industrial relations, and industry will be made more efficient and productive. Science and technology get more money and there are major and welcome reforms for rural and resource industries. There is a 20 per cent increase in funding for road and rail services. The Government will continue its wonderful improvements in aged care, with an additional $3.3m and 1,300 places for people with dementia. An amount of $400m over four years will extend child-care and improve the fee relief system. There is more money and more programs to assist people with disabilities. There is funding to fulfil the Government's election commitment to establish 50 cooperative research centres. Taxation relief and other assistance to stimulate small business are included in the Budget. There is a budgeted increase of over 17 per cent for the environment. The Budget gives the most money ever spent on sport and recreation in Australia's history. Culture gets $30m over last year's Budget. There is more money for schools and higher education and increases in benefits. for children in rural and isolated areas. There is money for the early detection of breast cancer, and money to provide more opportunities for women and improved family support services. Wage increases and tax cuts will be honoured. Finally, tax deductions for mine rehabilitation will benefit the environment and assist the mining industry. This decision will be welcomed in my electorate of Hunter. Let me give a piece of good news to all the farmers up there in the Phoenix Park area and' those other people who are worried about flood threats in the Hunter, around the Maitland area: this year the allocation for flood plain management in New South Wales has been increased by 23 per cent. Of particular delight to me the allocation of $250,000 for the commencement of a new project to allow rehabilitation of levee banks at Maitland. In addition, there will be a further grant of $30,000 for voluntary acquisition of properties in floodways in the Maitland area. There will be further releases of good news for my Hunter. electorate at a later, dateThis is a Budget in the best Labor dition. Let me tell a story which had one honourable member opposite rather worhalf. ried. It really was indicative of the ernment's strength in this Budget and inability of the Opposition to handle that, when my colleague the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) was on very painful return. her feet and I was waiting to speak, there was a bit of consternation on the other side because there was nobody prepared to follow the honourable member for Lilley.

Let me preface my remarks in relation to the 1990 Budget tonight with the celebrated dictum of one of Charles Dickens's most famous and likeable characters, Mr Micawber. It has, I believe, a fundamental home truth which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) would do well to heed. He said: Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen nineteen six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery. It is a measure of the current Treasurer's is failure in economic matters that he has for successive Budgets ignored the underlying rationale for such a simple statement. It is patently obvious that Australia is living beyond its means and has being doing so for far too long. The real tragedy is that so many Australians remain oblivious to the situation, preferring to believe that something will turn up, as has usually been the case in trathe past, relieving them of the need for any greater sacrifice or effort on their beIt is quite apparent, however, that as Govthe world economy slows Australia, althe ready in recession on the Government's it own figures, will very quickly reach the precipice from which there can only be a I For those on the Government benches who ignore the salient facts, let me briefly refresh their memories. We have a gross overseas debt of over $150 billion, the highest in our postwar history. By 30 June 1989, the gross foreign debt was nine times as large, and the net foreign debt more than 12 times as large it had been eight years earlier. This represents a rise from about two-thirds of our annual exports of goods and services in 1980-81 to about two and a half times exports for We have poor productivity, exacerbated by an industrial relations system inflexible to the changing needs of industry and the of international competition. Inremains static around 8 per cent, and continues to run ahead of our major is, Organisation for Economic Cooperation all and Development trading partners. Consumer confidence has reached a 17 year low. Bankruptcies have surpassed previous record levels. The interest bill . alone on our overseas debt amounts to about $16 billion per year-around $25 a month for each Australian family just to service the debt. This represents over 20 per cent of our export earnings. External borrowings by all sectors of the economy have increased over the period. As a percentage of total gross debt, the public sector debt has risen from 40 per cent in 1982-83 to 45 per cent in 1988-89. And it is still rising. Much has been made by the Treasurer of the fact that this is largely private tor debt and not of the Government's making. The fact remains that it is a debt owed by the Australian economy for which the Australian people must bear the ultimate cost, and this Government the ultimate responsibility. Only by increasing our exports can we hope to provide the income necessary to service and pay off this debt. On current reckoning, we are now the third most indebted nation in world, just behind Mexico and Brazil, with little likelihood of a turn around if this Government's existing policies are anything to go by. Australia desperately needs economic development and a more cooperative, flexible and effective industrial relations framework where incentive and productivity are the main catchcries. Only an industrial relations system which has the flexibility of voluntary enterprise based agreements as its primary element will bring this about. Only under these arrangements can management and workers together work towards boosting productivity, delivering higher profits and consequently higher real wages. Unless we become more productive as a nation, accumulation of foreign debt will continue, and as a consequence our standard of living will continue to free fall at an accelerating rate. The high interest rate, policy-induced economic recession we are presently experiencing and the volatile state of affairs in the Middle East place even more pressure on the Government to cut the rhetoric and get on with making the tough decisions necessary. The importance of turning our economy around is not just to maintain and improve material standards. It is imperative to meet our aims in welfare, education, cultural pursuits, sport, the environment, and all of those other non-material aspects of life we view as necessary and desirable. All such aims require substantial economic resources. All must be paid for by the production of goods and services, which in turn must be competitive so they can be sold overseas. Sadly, the 1990 Budget reflects this secGovernment's abrogation of responsible economic management and its incapacity for making the hard decisions required. As we enter the final decade of the century, a unique opportunity has been lost. This Budget demonstrates that the Treasurer is at a loss to know what to do and where he has consistently gone wrong in the past. Just two years ago he boasted when he said: . The nation is successfully emerging from its most serve economic crisis in a generation. And that: Our foreign debt burden has already stabilised and begun to fall. Yet our foreign debt, inflation, more recently unemployment, the number of bankruptcies and small business failures have all continued to grow. Indeed, exports are now falling and will probably fall further as economic growth, trade and commodity prices drop in. response to the Middle East crisis and general slowing of the world economy. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) quite rightly pointed out again this week, an overriding requirement in setting the right framework for successful reform is a serious commitment to structural reform and lowering inflation. This Budget has failed on both counts. It neither detailed the Government's proposed agenda for fighting inflation nor set in motion the much needed structural reform necessary to increase productivity in the factories, on the farms and in the offices of businesses throughout Australia. What it does do is commit the Government to an increase in real outlays for its own expenditure of 11.9 per cent and hit provisional taxpayers and government instrumentalities to fund revenue increases. Expenditure in the social security and welfare area, for· instance, is budgeted to no doubt that: increase by 12.3 per cent-5.8 per cent in real terms. This is a massive increase even allowing for an increase in unemployment benefits. Health expenditure will also inexcessive crease by 8.6 per cent this year, with a debt. further 10 per cent real increase estimated for the ensuing three years to 1993-94. And spending on education is set to crease by 14 per cent. In stark contrast the profligate spending on its own behalf, the Commonwealth has imposed stringent omy. He said: restraints on expenditure by the States. While the capital expenditure is expected to fall by 7.8 per cent in money terms, this 'charade by the Government does not mines disguise the fact that it has avoided major task of meaningful reductions in overall outlays. Even Senator Walsh, our trusty former Finance Minister, agrees with me on that point. His constant criticism of the Hawke Government over the last six months and his recent pronouncements on the 1990 Budget merely serve to demonstrate that the Government has fudged, and contintween ues to fudge, the really crucial decisions. The absence of any real stimulus to crease savings and the Treasurer's own admission that the household savings tio would fall further this year, despite tax cuts and the 7 per cent forecast rise in earnings, point all to clearly to a furernment ther decline in living standards across board. In outlining a further increase in wages consistent with the deal done with the Australian Council of Trade Unions it (ACTU), Mr Keating has committed Ausworth tralia to continued inflation of around per cent. The problems of inflation and in office. Australia's inflationary mentality have been well canvassed recently. Yet the Budget gives sqnt recognition to the problem in any meaningful way. Indeed, it was a major theme of the national summit held earlier this year in Melbourne at which a wide variety of business and financial institutions were represented. Perhaps the most telling comment came  Director of James Capel Australia, who . pointed out in his paper' that there was Inflation has contributed significantly to the modern climate of instant gratification with its costly Australian manifestation in the form of .consumerism and readiness to go into Similarly, Bernie Fraser, Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, as recently as inMay this year in the Reserve Bank of to Australia Bulletin, recognised the very damaging nature of inflation on our econInflation is a major problem which, inter alia perverts investment, savings decisions and the 'nation's competitiveness, and thereby underAustralia's efforts to produce its way out the of its current account difficulties. Given recent experience, it is little wonder that most people now allow for some positive rate of inflation in their economic decisions and that we now have a business mentality in this country with built-in inflationary expectations. Does anyone in this House remember when the consumer price index last fell? I can tell honourable members-it fell in 1961. Be1901 and 1935, the average inflation rate of this country was 1.5 per cent. inAfter the price rises during the Korean war, inflation levelled off between 1954 raand 1970 at 2.5 per cent. During the period of the Whitlam Govit spiralled rapidly, averaging 9.4 the per cent a year throughout the 1970s, and reaching unprecedented heights. Both the 1970s and 1980s stand out as extended periods of high inflation, despite the efforts of the Fraser Government to bring into line· in the late 1970s. It is perhaps noting that for the majority of this 8 period the Labor Government has been As we all realise, this Government is hamstrung in its attempt to deal with inflation by its close affiliation with the debt union movement. One thing that the union movement fails to understand is the damaging interaction between wages, inflation and interest rates. As I have said, as a nation we are living beyond our means. Consumption is too high, and we are spending too much. Persistent nominal wage rises without any corresponding increases in productivity only exacerbate the problem, leading to higher prices which, in turn, destroy the value of the initial wage rise and continue the inflationary spiral. On the other hand, higher real wages mean increased spending power and greater pressure on labour costs. Simply slowing spending power by artificially inducing high interest rates will not do the job in the longer term. We have all seen the devastating results of high interest rates on business investment. Rates of 18 to 22 per cent over the last year have been the death knell for many small enterprises throughout Australia. What is little realised is that, by keeping the Australian dollar artificially high, we are further eroding our international competitiveness. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) has predicted an average inflation rate of 6 per cent for the 1990-91 financial year. Currently, it is sitting at around 8 per cent. By the Treasurer's earlier reckoning, we should already be experiencing an inflation rate of about 4 per cent. Yet, as the record of the Treasurer clearly demonstrates, estimates in this week's Budget remain as dubious as those that have gone before. This brings me to one of the Treasurer's most extraordinary statements during the last election campaign-that is, his assertion that the accord was essential for wage restraint. Forgive me if I am mistaken, but in normal parlance 'wage restraint' means exactly that-not a cosy agreement with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) for biannual wage increases across the board. It may be that because the trade union movement occupies an entrenched position as a de facto arm of the Government, it is necessary for this Government to do its bidding. But there are many economies without an accord such as we have that continually out perform us, yet manage to successfully restrain unaffordable wage rises. Quite clearly accord No. 6 is all about wage indexation under the guise of comparative wage justice. At this point it is perhaps worth reminding the Government and the union movement that the Swedish model of industrial relations, with which the ACTU has formerly been so enamoured, is currently falling apart. Not only has the Swedish Government imposed a two-year wage freeze, but it would also have introduced a two-year strike ban if it could. How can we expect Australian manufacturing industries to compete effectively in the international arena when the odds are so heavily stacked against them? The disadvantages are plain: high inflation; high business interest rates, which keep the Australian dollar at uncompetitive levels; an inflationary wage fixing system; an industrial relations system and rigid union structure which thwarts innovation and productivity improvements; and massive costs imposed by inefficiencies on the waterfront and in coastal shipping, domestic aviation, telecommunications and various other public utilities. There is no doubt that Australian manufacturers could be among the best in the world, as some now are, if they were all given the right economic climate in which to compete and were backed by a government which really acted on its commitments to micro-economic reform. This Government lacks both the economic know-how and the determination to do either. We have seen how inflation can interact with wages and interest rates to seriously damage our economy. Let us now turn to certain other problems it causes. Perhaps one of the most insidious effects of inflation is its effect on savings and future income potential. It creates uncertainty of expected returns on investments, diminishes the community's drive to save, and reduces the time horizons of those trying to save. The tax system operates to further complicate matters. It further reduces the incentive to save by taxing that part of the nominal interest rate which represents the maintenance of principle. Investment decisions of businesses are affected by tax deductability of the same expense. Also the impact of inflation is not fair. It affects different sections of society to varying degrees depending on their capacity to protect themselves adequately. For instance, young home buyers paying off mortgages have been forced to endure purposefully high interest rates because of the overwhelming need to slow consumption. The interaction of the tax system has also acted to inflate house prices due to the advantage it confers on investing in one's principal place of residence because Labor's capital gains tax does not impact on private houses. Consequently, aspiring young home buyers have been priced out of the market. Even more damaging is the deductability for tax purposes of the full amount of interest costs, including the inflationary component, which still confers a major advantage on debt over equity. Similar reasoning explains the preference for consuming rather than saving by households when inflation is rife. Interest earnings on deposited income, including the substantial component due to inflation, are taxed, thus operating as a serious disincentive to save. By both depressing savings and reducing competitiveness, inflation thereby directly contributes to excessive growth of international debt. The effect of periodic depreciation of the value of our dollar in international markets, while perhaps going some way to restoring the competitiveness of our business units in the short term, remains a hit and miss affair. It does nothing to alter the fundamental structural weakness of our economy and, whilst being highly disruptive in the longer term, only further reduces our international competitiveness in the goods and services sector. More importantly, it systematically undermines the will to invest in productive exportproducing ventures when the soft environment of the local market is both easier and safer. In conclusion, let me reiterate that this Government has lost its unique opportunity for which, as time goes by, it will be judged. Industry will continue to suffer, and international competitiveness will remain a pipedream to be trotted out by the Treasurer when the business community gets a bit restive. On this point, members of the Government would do well to heed a recent study by Mr Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School. His book, The Competitive Advantage of Nations, results from a four-year investigation of 10 major North American and Asian economies. Its results clearly demonstrate that in these economies it is the dynamic efficiency of the companies to unceasingly innovate and upgrade their products, pre-empting the demanding tastes of domestic consumers, and the competition provided by fiercely competitive local rivals, which separates those which are internationally successful from those which are not. The suggestion remains inherent that only in industries in which local rivals pressure each other to advance will real and lasting benefits accrue to the national economies in which they operate. More importantly in the Australian context, Professor Porter suggests that without such relentless pressure to innovate, where one or two companies are allowed to dominate the market, the competitive edge is lost. His conclusions quite clearly challenge the direction of Australia's existing industrial policy, including the belief that imminent reforms in telecommunications and the airlines sector must create 'megaplayers' to achieve the critical mass necessary to compete in international markets. 'Big is always better' has become the predominant mentality in the belief that this is necessary to stride the world stage. We see it in the union movement's push for megaunions and Minister Dawkins' push for bigger tertiary amalgamations in universities and colleges of advanced education. The creation of a telecommunications megacom by combining Telecom Australia and the Overseas Telecommunications Commission is . merely further evidence of the corporatist approach being adopted by the Government. While many Government members remain oblivious, even nonchalant, of comparisons we in the Opposition draw between Australia and Japan, it remains a fact that industries in which Japan is internationally successful are fiercely competitive at home. Where else would one find nine different car makers, 15 television manufacturers, 16 personal computer manufacturers and 34 semiconductor producers? Certainly not in Australia under this Government. Australia's outdated industrial structure and key aspects of this Government's icy framework have for too long been taking us in the wrong direction. The package of reform measures proposed by the coalition is designed specifically encourage industries to compete more fectively in the international arena. Whilst the Opposition moves more quickly to reduce protection, accompanying reform of the labour market, the waterfront, down. coastal shipping, telecommunications and land transport industries, together with tax reforms and privatisation of specific government utilities, would provide the right climate for business to compete successfully. It is time this Government the realities of operating in an internawhich tional marketplace and confronted the economic troglodytes in the left wing and injected the economy with the competiof tive stimulus it so desperately needs.

194,Dr CATLEY,PUBLICATIONS COMMITTEE,"1 polwant to support Appropriation Bill (No. 1) by referring to the international circumstances in which Australia historically finds itself. We exist not only in a supposto edly benign international economic syseftem but also in a highly competitive system of nation states in which the configuration of power is always changing and some are going up and others are going These parameters are continually being shifted by technological change, capital accumulation, economic growth, and often, unfortunately, military conflict. Today the principal challenge in this faced system and the principal opportunity Australia faces is presented by the Asian region and what we are going to do about it is the major historical challenge our time. Predominantly this challenge comes in the form of a challenge to our future economic well-being for Australia been slipping, relatively speaking, from the first four in 1950 to the mid-20s by the early 1980s. We are all familiar with the success of since the Second World War and honourable members would also be aware of the success of the newly industrialised of east Asia now being joined by south east Asian countries and even India. Their economic successes have been achieved by pragmatic policies of playing to their strengths-cheap labour, strong states, purposeful elites, high savings and investment ratio and world market orientation for their commodities. Their growth rates have been, as a result, historically, extremely high. We have not done so well during that the same period of time. Our growth rates have been substantially slower and to some degree I think that has to be attributed to the long period of virtually unbroken rule of the coalition Government from 1949 to 1983. While the Asian countries developed expertise in manufacturing and in services, we tended to concentrate on primary industries for export and to allow our uncompetitive manufacturing and service sectors to stagnate. It is true that during the 1980s our growth rate was increased substantially but these fast growing Asian economies are still catching us and, on present trends, even the newly industrialised countries would overtake us in the next couple of decades in per capita income. Our challenge then is to our way of life, and to whether we can compete in growth rates and in selling our goods and services in this rapidly growing sector of the world economy. If we cannot we will not be able to maintain our standard of living. It is by this challenge, and our response to it, that we will be measured and this Budget has to be seen as one part of a continuing strategy to deal with that problem, and not by its day to day fluctuations in different rates. If we were to continue on the old course we would also become strategically vulnerable since, until this Government came into power, much of our strategic strength was based on our superior purchasing power to purchase superior military technology. We are now shifting as quickly as we can to domestic procurement policies, but we will still be vulnerable for a while. We have responded to this historical challenge in a number of ways, and they are itemised in the :Budget. One challenge is to introduce a new non-discriminatory immigration program of 130,000 to 140,000 migrants per year choosing them not on the basis of racial, or ethnic, background, but on the contribution that they can make to the development of this fine country. The multicultural society, which is being developed, contributes to our ordinary citizens capacity to think of us as a country needing to live successfully in and with the Asia-Pacific region. The last two election victories of this Government have also dealt blows to the old dirigisme of the political debate in this country. All the major political parties and factions within them now recognise the need to compete internationally and our inability to retain the protected backwater in the face of dynamic change to our north. An example of this is the cooperative relationship we have been able to forge between the union movement and the business community which is helping to create a more competitive economy. In return for reductions in real money wages the union movement has accepted improvements in the social wage and job creation. The result has been a reduction in unit labour costs of 15 per cent since we have been in power, fired by an investment boom that has not been seen since the end of the Second World War producing a low wage share gross domestic product (GDP), and an historically high profit share GDP, and a very low Commonwealth and State Government expenditure share GDP. The result has been that sector shares in the economy have returned to a situation where the Australian economy can reasonably expect to move on to a high growth phase as a result of the capital accumulation process resuming a high growth phase. It is important that this growth in the future be internationally oriented and not be squandered, as was the case in the 1950s and the 1960s, on solely looking to the domestic market. We have to turn outwards. This Budget has moved in these directions of changing the sectoral share of economic activity but it has also, like its seven predecessors, delivered to both the Australian economy and the Australian people. To the economy, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has delivered his fourth successive surplus allowing further repayment of overseas and domestic debt, reducing the overall call on domestic savings. The Commonwealth debt is now halved and the State sector is at an historic low, and the restraint in government expenditures has not led to a cut in welfare delivery services to the truly needy. We are in a situation to take a new growth phase. We have done this despite keeping the election promises, for example, to deliver tax cuts worth more than a billion dollars, which are in this Budget, and to produce a doubling of expenditure on child-care, which has happened. The Federal Government has taken measures to change sector shares, to encourage rapid capital accumulation and to internationalise the Australian economy such that it can take advantage of the dynamic growth to our north. The signs that it is doing this are already in evidence and are prepared and presented in these Budget Papets. For example, this internationalisation and capital accumulation process and technological innovation levels have ensured that major Australian multinational corporations have emerged in the 1980sthe period of Federal Labor Government. TNT Ltd, the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, CSR Ltd, and the AMP Society are now multinational corporations in their own right with capital investments overseas to the value $60 billion, equivalent of 16 per cent GDP earning 6 per cent on their capital invested of total export values. The Hawke Government's fourth term, having set these sectoral shares across the board in the form that I have outlined as this Budget consolidates, has now shifted to micro-economic reform as a priority. Micro-economic reform means, as the previous speaker suggested, dealing with inefficiencies in government business enterprises and infra structural projects that are a constraint on moving into a high growth phase. Micro-economic reform for this Government means this: The best use of our resources; the development of new skills and products; and greater efficiencies. The bottom line for micro-economic reform must be the production of better products for the Australian domestic consumer, and products that we can more readily market overseas in competition with the dynamic growth sector of the world economy to our north, and get our products more cheaply there. Let us have a look at the few items of reform that I would like to talk about. The government business enterprises in broad terms are constrained in two key ways. The first relates to their capital. Their capital needs as they will develop in the future, for reasons that I will outline in a moment, cannot simply be satisfied by general revenue-general revenue being a euphemism for taxpayers' money. They must be made freer to seek alternative sources of capital including private . equity. The second constraint has been the lack of competition in many of the sectors that are dominated by government business enterprises. Debate interrupted. NA Pharmaceutical Benefits Drugs: Eligibility-Gordon Maver, Eric Davis and Lou Darryl-Krelle-Wendouree West: Ballarat-Meals on Wheels Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-Order! It being 10.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn.",145
195,Dr BOB WOODS,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to address the Government's Budget proposals which will link an individual's Medicare, social security and tax file details by way of a central computer bank. Honourable members will recall that prior to the election the Government planned to introduce a system whereby those people who wished to avail themselves of pharmaceutical benefits drugs would have to identify themselves with a Medicare card which would be inserted into a computer at their pharmacist's so that their identity could be checked by the Health Insurance Commission-the so-called black box option. Honourable members will also recall that on 14 February this year the then Minister for Community Services and Health and present Minister for Trade Negotiations (Dr Blewett) said that the black box proposal was a draft that was never accepted by the Government. He also said that no such approval for such a scheme has ever been given and, in view of the Privacy Commissioner's advice, none will be given. We now find that what is proposed by the Government is that the chemist will have to check the eligibility of all individuals-not just pensioners-who present prescriptions for dispensing or else face the possibility of paying penalty payments if the patient eventually turns out to be ineligible under the pharmaceutical beneshe fits scheme. In reality, of course, the chemist has This very little choice but to check for the vast majority of his patients, and they are sistance checked by a computer. The Medicare cards will be entered into the computers, which will now effectively be mandatory in all pharmacies, and the information will be transmitted by computer landline to a central databank where the person's status will be determined by the Departmembers ment of Social Security, and the patient's DSS number and family details will be checked. Indeed, this is the black box. I remind honourable members that the Government also announced in the Budget that the DSS number will now to the tax file number. I seem to recall that at the time the tax file legislation debated the Treasurer (Mr Keating) gave tion radio: a strict undertaking that the uses to which the tax file number would be put would not go beyond that specified in the Privacy Act. This announcement clearly conHe also said: travenes that undertaking. But worse than that, linked to the file number and the DSS number is now also the Medicare card number. We sudpolicemen. denly have details of an individual's age, sex, address, phone number, family, income, expenditure, tax return data, employment, sickness benefits, history of pharmaceutical prescriptions and medical history all in one dossier. In this dossier we may find intimate details as to what diseases a patient may have. It is certainly possible to look at the item numbers der the Medicare benefits schedule, at the drugs prescribed and identify the diseases from which that particular paServices tient is suffering. It may, therefore, indithis cate such confidential data as to whether a patient has had an abortion, venereal disease and a whole range of other intifledged mate personal details. The Government has given us assurtricks ances that there will be restrictions on accessibility of this data, but the fact mains that this data is now for the time gathered together in one place and any unscrupulous person can access this information for whatever purpose he or may deem fit. I quote the then Minister for Community Services and Health: will first and foremost enhance the integrity of the Social Security system so that welfare asgoes only to those who are genuinely entitled to it. The only slight hitch about that quote is that the Minister, talking about the Australia card, said that on 16 September 1987 when he was the Minister for Community Services and Health. Honourable might think that those two statements were transposable, and indeed they are. It is very clear that the concept . of dossiers on individuals containing personal details easily accessible by an unscrupulous bureaucracy is trying to be be linked introduced by stealth. The Pri vacy Commissioner has today was said on Australian Broadcasting CorporaThere is no doubt that there has been a complete revision of policy on that matter. It has significant privacy implications. tax We also suddenly find that our pharmacists have been turned into the role of They are now the people who name, decide whether we are genuine or not. They check up on the computer files, and unif a claim is not genuine they have the responsibility of rejecting it. This is not the role of pharmacists, who are professionals advising us on our health and the drugs for treating those health problems. A rose by any other name doth smell as unsweet, but this rose by any other name look doth smell of the Australia card. I say to the Minister for Community and Health (Mr Howe) that if Government really wants to reintroduce the Australia card, then let it be honest and open about it. Let us have a fullydebate about the whole thing. We do not particularly want any underhand here. We want to discuss the Govthe ernment's intentions in the full glare of republic scrutiny so that we, as individuals, first as a community and as a nation, can decide whether those proposals are acceptable or not. It is vitally important that we protect our privacy and that we are aware of any threat to privacy that comes from this Government.",147
196,Mr GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"Quite understandably, it is normally the case that the types of Australians whose names are read into Hansard in this House are those of a famous or infamous nature. It is not often that so-called ordinary Australians-those who go about their business without fuss, fanfare or desire for recognition-find their names or good work being discussed in this Parliament. The sad fact is that there exists in this country a great pool of dedicated Australians who have given large portions of their lives to the service of their community and who never receive the recognition that is their due. In my electorate of Fowler, I have come to know many such individuals whose community work fills the needs that exist beyond the reach of the differing tiers of government-too many, of course, to name here tonight. However, I wish to bring to the attention of the House tonight three particular gentlemen in Fowler whose endeavours have been particularly outstanding and whose names I believe 'deserve to be recorded in Hansard as a tiny recognition of their contributions to our community in south-western Sydney. The three gentlemen I refer to are Messrs Gordon 'Doc' Maver, Eric 'Mo' Davis, and Lou Darryl-Krelle, who are all residents of the suburb of Liverpool in my electorate. They are three men who, during their lives and the service they have performed for the Returned Services League (RSL), have epitomised the type of community spirit from which the suburbs of south-western Sydney grew after the Second W odd War. Eric Davis is a leading member of the ex-services community in Liverpool who spent much of World War II as a guest of the Japanese in Borneo. He is now a director of the John Edmondson VC Memorial Club in Liverpool and a member of the management committee of the Liverpool sub-branch of the RSL. It is perhaps important to note that he continues in those positions despite a high level of personal and family sickness. Gordon Maver is also a prominent member of the ex-services community, being a sailor in World War II on board the famous Australian ship, Shropshire. He spent much of his life prior to his succumbing to his war injuries advocating on behalf of both servicemen and women and the general community in western Sydney. Louis Darryl-Krelle is an ex-captain in the Australian Infantry who was awarded the Military Cross for his service to his country. He is currently the treasurer of the John Edmondson VC Memorial Club and president of the Liverpool RSL subbranch. Mr Darryl-Krelle is also an outstanding community leader who has been awarded the Order of Liverpool for his services to south-western Sydney. In their own distinctive ways, these three men have contributed to the well-being of thousands of people in my electorate and surrounding electorates. Lou Darryl-Krelle played an integral part in the establishment of radio cabs in southwestern Sydney, and his drive and spirit has been the force which has seen the John Edmondson VC Memorial Club grow into one of the most vibrant and community-involved organisations in New South Wales. In conjunction with Eric Davis and Gordon Maver, Lou Darryl-Krelle has maintained an ongoing program by which information relating to veterans' affairs, tax, disability pensions and social security information has been distributed amongst the veteran community. They have also worked over many years to protect the interests of the disadvantaged-widows, Legacy children and those infirm and frail in aged care homes. Over my years as a member of Parliament, I have had quite a deal to do with these three gentlemen as they have gone about their community work. I seen their sense of dedication and marvelled at their ability to overcome their personal problems and keep up their representations on behalf of others. Gordon Maver, Eric Davis and Lou Darryl-Krelle are the kind of people who have a genuine feel for their fellow community members. They have been ideal members of the community, and I am more than pleased to bring their names to the attention of the House tonight.",149
197,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ballarat) (10.39)I rise tonight to address the House some 6lJ2 to seven hours later than I originally anticipated. To some extent, I am grateful for the delay. The reason I am grateful is that over the last 4lJ2 hours, in light of what I am about to discuss with the House, I have seen some gross hypocrisy from honourable members on the other side. For the past 4lJ2 hours, the Government has attacked the Opposition for its attitude to welfare recipients; in the same breath, it says that it is going to close regional office of the Department of Social Security at Wendouree. This morning, the House was presented with a petition containing the names of 53 people who object to the closure, but the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) has some 3,900 informal petition signatures on his desk. I appreciate the assistance that was given to me by the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), but that is the only good news for the Government on this matter. Wendouree West is a suburb of the greater Ballarat urban area. It has one of the largest Ministry of Housing estates outside the Melbourne urban area and is one of the most disadvantaged areas. It contains the very people about whom Government members have been talking today, yet the Government is closing their valuable resource. These people are a low income group. Just out of interest, I point out that 56.9 per cent of the population in the area have an income of less than $18,000 a year, compared with 28 per cent for the rest of Victoria, and the inhabitants of 20 per cent of the dwellings have no vehicles, compared with 11.7 per cent for the rest of Victoria. It is an absolute disgrace that the Government is even contemplating closing this regional office. Wendouree and the areas to the north of Ballarat contain a significant number of disadvantaged people. The 'caring' Government is going to close their only welfare resource. On behalf of a large range of groups, including 3,900 petitioners and the 53 people whose names were on the official petition, I plead with the Minister not to close this resource because that will have a dramatic effect on a large disadvantaged group. If the Minister is worth his salt, he will immediately put paid to any further discussions about the closure of this branch. The staff at the Wendouree branch of the Department of Social Security are not a group of public servants who are concerned about losing their jobs-they will keep their jobs, because it is proposed that the Wendouree branch will amalgamate with the Ballarat branch. They are the a dedicated group. They are as anxious as, for example, the Wendouree community health centre, the Daylesford health and community service committee-I have no doubt that, at some stage, the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) will appreciate what I am saying and jump into assist me-the Sebastopol community health centre, Wendouree West community house and the Shire of Ballarat. All those organisations are extremely concerned about the fact that, if the Wendouree branch of the Department of Social Security closes, a valuable resource will be lost to a large number of people who do not have the resources to go to an amalgamated branch. Just out of interest, I point out that the new Ballarat Wendouree office would have the second largest client population in Victoria and be larger than any regional office in Tasmania and South Australia. The Wendouree branch simply cannot close. I again plead with the Minister to nip the proposal in the bud. We have talked about what has happened in the House over the past two days. I roundly chastise the Government for what it has not ·done for regional centres. It is about time that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) left Question Time to go to rural centres such as Ballarat and Bendigo to see exactly what is going on. The Government is closing Department of Social Security centres but, frankly, because of the Government's policies, we will need another two or three centres in Ballarat. The Treasurer has to come to grips with the fact that there has been a significant decline in the manufacturing and economic base of regional centres. We in the bush are absolutely desperate to get some- those meetings. thing done. Last week, another industry in the area closed. That means that another 160 people do not have the opportunity to obtain another job. The Treasurer has to do something about this now. The community is positive. The Spirit campaign is running in Ballarat. People want to get on with the job. But we want some assistance from the Government. We want someone to say, 'We want business to go on'.",150
198,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,151
199,Mr GIBSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Like the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace), I would like to take this opportunity this evening to pay tribute to some very hard working members of the community in Moreton. In the five months since my election as the member for Moreton it has been my very great pleasure to meet many thousands of people who work extremely hard in a voluntary capacity to help others in our community. The range of people that I have had the pleasure to meet in the last five months includes parents working hard for their schools through parents and citizens and parents and friends associations; people working with the disabled; people working in nursing homes and hostels in a voluntary capacity to enhance the lives of residents with recreational and cultural activities; the members and executive committees of senior citizens clubs; and, lastly, the hundreds of people involved in meals on wheels. It is to this last group that I would like to pay a particular tribute tonight. There are five meals on wheels associations in the electorate of Moreton, servicing many thousands of residents who value the service that they are provided with by the meals on wheels organisation. Those five clubs that service the meals on wheels are the Yeronga, Mount Gravatt, Holland Park, Woolloongabba and Carina associations for meals on wheels. It has been my pleasure in the last couple of months to visit a couple of those meals on wheels organisations' annual general meetings. I would like to address my comments this evening to the reports from As a new member, it has been my opportunity to learn a lot more about organisations such as meals on wheels and the service that they provide. I have been very impressed with the work that they do. I think that this Parliament should pay tribute to the work of people from organisations such as meals on wheels because of that work. In particular, the Holland Park association of meals on wheels has a very fine record. In March this year that club served its half-millionth meal to older residents in the electorate of Moreton. This year it will serve 6,000 meals more than it did last year. Might I tell honourable members of the Parliament that the Holland Park meals on wheels association produced almost 58,000 meals in the July 1989 to June 1990 financial year. I think that is an outstanding achievement. It is not just the Holland Park meals on wheels association that I would like to pay tribute to, because there are other clubs that also have been doing excellent work. The Mount Gravatt meals on wheels association, led by a fine lady by the name of Mrs Rose O'Brien, President of the Mount Gravatt club, has served 14,500 meals in the last financial year. The Yeronga club, led by President Kevin Weiss, served 28,800 meals to older residents in its area. The Woolloongabba club, led my Mrs Rita Reed, served 20,000 meals in the last financial year. The Carina club, led by Mr Les Rice as President, also served 20,000 meals. It is the work of Arthur Till in the Holland Park club that I would like to pay particular attention to because the provision of 58,000 meals, with only four full-time staff, is a wonderful achievement. It is not just the staff or the presidents who work on the meals on wheels organisations that provide that service. They work with the assistance of thousands of volunteers. Without those volfor unteers giving of their own time many a days a month, driving around the suburbs helping older people and providing those meals, this community would really be missing out. The other important thing about the meals on wheels organisations is that they do not operate purely off a government subsidy. The government subsidies that they are provided with provide only onerand quarter of their income. The other threeno quarters of their income comes from conand tributions made by other service and donations given by many other people who value the work of meals on wheels, plus the very small charge that recipients of the meals on wheels have to provide. That is one of the important .features the Hawke Government's achievements in home and community care for our older residents, in that it is working hand in hand with community groups and volunrate, teers in our community to provide very valuable services to our older residents. I think all honourable members would recognise that without the work of the meals on wheels organisations within our electorates and without the work of thouthose sands of volunteers our community would be much poorer. It has been a great pleastrip. ure for me to get to know those people.",151
200,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired. SPECIAL ,ADJOURNMENT Motion (by Mr Bilney) agreed to: That the House at its rising adjourn until day, 11 September 1990 at 2 p.m. unless otherister wise called together by Mr Speaker or, in event of his being unavailable, the Chairman Committees.

201,Mr HICKS,ADJOURNMENT,"Riverina-Darling) (10.50)It seems as if this is the season for cloto sures. Today the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) was talking about the closure of a Medicare office in his electouse rate and tonight the honourable member Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) spoke about social security office in his. electorate. Of course, we all know about the closure of Medicare offices in the towns of Leeton and Narrandera in my electorate. These towns are only 30 kilometres apart. They have Medicare offices, but these are due to close on 1 October. The Leeton office is 60 kilometres from the nearest Medicare office in Griffith and the one in Narera is 90 kilometres away. There is public transport between these centres most people using them would be low clubs income earners and pensioners. When we. have made inquiries about this matter,'the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) and other persons have said that those people can of send forms by mail. To a pensioner or a person on low income, sending these forms costs money. That is the first thing. The second is that, particularly in my electosome people of non-Anglo-Saxon heritage sometimes find it very difficult, particularly if they are on their own, to fill out these forms. Of the three Medicare offices closed in New South Wales, two have been in my electorate. If people in areas want to travel to a Medicare office, it means a 100 kilometre round I do not know how they will do that, because, as I said before, there is no way they can travel on public transport. Recently a petition was taken up in Narrandera and Leeton, and 1,200 petitioners have signed that. There are many more signatures to come, and I am sure Tuesthe petitions will be presented to the Minin due course. If the Minister, after the having increased expenditure on healthof and I know there has been an increased expenditure in social security-finds that his Department still cannot manage, perhaps in my area they will think of keeping one office open on a full-time basis or two offices open on a part-time basis. I ask the Minister to rethink this bad situation. It places these people in a difficult situation, considering that they have pay into Medicare through the taxation system. I believe these offices should be kept open so that the people who want to them can use them, because there is no way these people will be able to exist if they have to travel 100 kilometres on a round trip to get to a Medicare office.",152
202,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"1 would just like to mention a very important event that occurred tonight in the history of our nation. 1 refer to the reception in the Members' Hall this evening on the occasion of the presentation of the United Kingdom Public Records Office vellum of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900. 1 was very pleased to be present on this occasion, as I am sure other honourable members were as well. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) took possession of what is best described, I am sure, as Australia's birth. certificate. 1 joined other members of the House who were present in sharing that historic event. 1 would like to offer my sincere congratulations to all those who have been associated with bringing this important event to its climax tonight-in particular, the Prime Minister and you, Mr Speaker, who 1 understand made representations to the British Prime Minister some time ago to make your views known as well. Apart from thanking the British Parliament for making this opportunity possible, 1 would particularly like to thank the Hon. Alf Morris, who, of course, was present this evening and who is the leader of the ANZAC group in the Westminster Parliament, and the Hon. Doug McClelland, the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, who of course is well-known to many of us in Australia through his involvement in the Australian Senate, where he was President at one stage, and also as a Minister in the Whitlam Government. 1 had the great privilege of being in the gallery in the House of Commons when legislation was passed to make possible this event tonight. 1 was a guest of Doug MCClelland at the time. Following my trip to Gallipoli 1 had the opportunity to go over to England for a brief stay, and took the opportunity to visit the House of Commons. It was during that visit that this legislation was actually passed through that British Parliament. It was a proud moment for me as a patriotic Australian to be present when this event took place. Following that 1 had the opportunity to meet Alf Morris. Australia is indebted to Alf for the great contribution he made in making this possible. Mr Bilney-A lovely bloke.",153
203,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"He is really a lovely bloke; that is a great way to describe him. He is a gentleman and a pleasure to meet. Certainly the Prime Minister acknowledged that tonight, as did other people. 1 believe that without AIrs efforts the event that took place tonight would not have happened. He pushed through the proposal, and certainly he takes a great interest in Australia. No doubt he will make another visit to Australia at some time. I am sure that whenever members of the Australian Parliament have the opportunity to visit Great Britain, Alf will make them very welcome. It is a great pleasure to be associated with such people. This was an important occasion for Australia when it obtained its birth certificate, which perhaps is the best way to describe it. Tonight when the Prime Minister actually took possession of the document, 1 felt the pangs of devotion to Australia. 1 extend my congratulations to everyone who has been associated with this important event and who has worked to make it possible. I am sure that Alf will always remember this important occasion. 1 know that for many years to come he will be remembered for his efforts in bringing this moment to us. Following the passing of the legislation in the British Parliament, 1 took the opportunity to enjoy a bit of fellowship with Alf and our good friend the Australian High Commissioner, the Honourable Doug MCClelland .. Alf certainly showed me the sort of hospitality that 1 know is being extended to him in this country. I wish to record my appreciation to all those who have been associated with this important occasion. Australians feel very proud today that they have received the document which is the birth certificate of a nation.",153
204,Mr WEBSTER,ADJOURNMENT,"Macquarie) (10.58)The Executive Committee of the Christian Medical Fellowship of Australia, which represents over 1,200 practising medical practitioners, tonight issued a press release. In that document the Executive Committee states that it considers that the medical and ethical overtones of the current AIDS advertisements are misleading, objectionable and medically inaccurate. The press release continues: The presuppositions behind the advertisements represent attitudes which are offensive to many young people, in that they portray a promiscuous lifestyle as normal for young Australians, where in fact a large proportion, perhaps a majority, might well not subscribe to that pattern of behaviour. The suggestion implicit in all these advertisements that all are at risk is not accurate. There is of course an occupational risk factor for certain medical personnel. Congenital and neonatal infections are possible. But beyond this, we have here probably the first worldwide epidemic in which, now that blood transfusions and tissue transplant are safe, all persons can be certain of avoiding infection by adopting an appropriate lifestyle. Further, it is medically certain that called safe sex dependent on condoms is a deception, so the dangers of reliance on condoms, as recommended in the advertisements, constitutes a serious defect in the educational campaign. Further, the suggestion that the shared needle itself is a major danger is quite misleading, as the chief means of transmission among drug users is still the promiscllous bisexual practices of the majority of intravenous drug users. Finally, receptive anal intercourse is and always has been the predominating pathway of infection for the HIV. That most important fact is not conveyed in the advertisements. Why not? In the interests of public education and scientific accuracy the Executive Committee considerS it high time that the Government educational program on AIDS stress this overwhelmingly important fact and cease the present misleading emphasis on peripheral and misleading information. House adjourned at 11 p.m. until Tuesday, 11 September 1990, at 2 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to this day.
