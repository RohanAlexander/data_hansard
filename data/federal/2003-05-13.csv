2,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"I inform the House of the death on Tuesday, 22 April 2003 of Mr Leonard Stanley Reid DFC, a member of this House for the division of Holt from 1969 to 1972. As a mark of respect to the memory of Mr Reid, I invite honourable members to rise in their places. Honourable members having stood in their places",17
3,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I thank the House. NA,17
4,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I inform the House that the Treasurer will be absent from question time today due to budget commitments. I will be happy to answer questions on the Treasurer's behalf. NA Governor General,17
5,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and it refers to a of the board of inquiry into past handling of complaints of sexual abuse in the Anglican Church diocese of Brisbane. Is it not the case that the Aspinall report finds that Dr Hollingworth's handling of the complaint in respect of a paedophile priest was ‘not fair, reasonable and appropriate'? Dr Southcott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under standing order 153, questions which are critical of the character or conduct of the Governor General cannot be asked.",17
6,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am listening closely to the question being asked by the Leader of the Opposition. He knows the standing orders provide certain restraints. Speaker Snedden has made a comment on this very issue in House of Representatives Practice, which I referred to in preparation for question time. Nothing which is critical of the motives of the Queen or her representative would be contemplated. I am listening closely to the Leader of the Opposition and invite him to continue.",17
7,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am just referring to the findings of a report which is very important in this nation's dealing with child sexual abuse. I think all members of the House ought to take appropriate note of it.",17
8,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will come to his question.,17
9,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It found in relation to Dr Hollingworth's handling of the complaint in respect of a paedophile priest that his action was ‘not fair, reasonable and appropriate' and, further: ... no Bishop acting reasonably could have continued a known paedophile as parish priest. Prime Minister, do you believe a person who allowed a known paedophile to continue as a priest is an appropriate person to have been report appointed Australia's Governor General? Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, further to the original point of order: questions are allowed to be asked and argument raised in relation to such a matter but only on a substantive motion with notice, which is not present in this case.",17
10,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am more concerned about the way in which the question seeks an opinion from the Prime Minister than I am about the substance of the question. I invite the Prime Minister to respond to the question, having expressed my concern about the degree to which it seeks an opinion.",17
11,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question plainly about the Governor General. This matter has been very much in the public domain and will continue to be so. My position in relation to the Governor General has been stated, and I have nothing to add to what I have previously said.",18
12,Mr TOLLNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is also addressed to the Prime Minister. Would the Prime Minister outline plans for the return to Australia of Defence Force elements from Iraq now that major combat operations have concluded and indicate the scope of Australia's ongoing military presence in Iraq?,18
13,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for his question. Can I say, on behalf of all Australians, how incredibly proud we are of the performance of our defence forces in Iraq. The decision of the government to commit our forces to Iraq was just, it was legal, it was right and it led to the liberamember tion of the people of Iraq. I will have the opportunity tomorrow to expand, at somewhat greater length, on the operation in Iraq, the circumstances that led up to it and the contribution so magnificently made by the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. I am sure that all Australians derive the greatest sense of relief and satisfaction, above all other considerations, from the fact that our forces thankfully to date have not sustained any casualties. I might add in relation to that that on many occasions, and not least during my recent visit to Doha, I have been told by senior members of the military that one of the major reasons why we did not sustain any casualties was that we predeployed our forces. I said at the time we predeployed our forces that they were being predeployed in order to acclimatise themselves and to be ready in the event of a commitment-to be more prepared and more acclimatised.",18
14,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,18
15,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I shall ignore the gibbering interjections of those opposite, whose dire predictions of a humanitarian disaster in Iraq have been proved wrong-whose dire predictions on just about every count have Iraq been proved wrong in relation to this. The role that Australia has played has brought great credit to, and an enhanced reputation for, this nation around the world. The member for Solomon asked me a question about the force elements. I thought those opposite might be interested to know when our forces are coming home. I know they did not want them to go but I thought they might be interested to know when they are coming home. Apparently they are not. But I know the member for Solomon is interested, I know the member for Lindsay is interested, I know my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is interested, I know the for Riverina is interested and I know members representing electorates in Western Australia are interested. Indeed, all Australians are interested. They are not only interested; they are going to join, and they are going to have the opportunity of joining, in welcoming our forces home. To start with, let me inform the House that the following elements of our coalition contribution will be returning before the end of May: the Special Forces Task Group, including SAS personnel; the Navy clearance diving team; the FA18 crews and support personnel; HMAS ANZAC; and HMAS Darwin. These forces will be followed by HMAS Kanimbla, which should arrive back in Australia in July. I will have the pleasure, with other colleagues, of welcoming some of the troops home in the next week, commencing with the RAAF personnel at Tindal on Thursday as well as troops aboard the HMAS Darwin and the HMAS ANZAC and the SAS personnel in Western Australia. I will ensure that the member for Brand is also invited to the welcome home in Western Australia. I say that because the member for Brand has a long standing interest in these matters. I acknowledge that, and I am very happy to ensure that he is included because he has an interest in the matter. Mr Crean-And no-one else does?",18
16,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I am not suggesting that nobody else does. I think a lot of people in this parliament have an interest in defence matters but I know that the member for Brand has a greater interest in, and knowledge of, those matters than some other people on the other side who I can think of. I will have the pleasure of welcoming the defence personnel home, and I repeat that all of those deployed to the Middle East deserve our praise and thanks for their professionalism, their superb representation of Australia and its values, and a job extremely well done. We have no plans to provide a substantial peacekeeping force in Iraq. That was made clear by me to President Bush and to the Prime Minister of Great Britain at the very beginning and it was reiterated during my discussions with the United States President and members of his administration recently in the United States. Our position was well understood. From the very beginning, if we were going to make a contribution it was going to be at the sharp end of the conflictwhich we did. We did that to very great effect and to the great regard and admiration of people around the world. Admiral Kelly of the United States Navy said to President Bush that our troops are the best in the world, and I respectfully concur with American Admiral Kelly. I can say to the House that there will be great opportunities for Australians to welcome them home. I could report to the House also that some ADF elements, including HMAS Sydney, two C130 Hercules transport aircraft and some headquarters and support personnel, are already contributing to important transitional and humanitarian operations. Two P3C Orion aircraft are also engaged in maritime patrols in support of ongoing coalition operations, as well as remaining engaged in the war against terrorism. ADF and other defence personnel already contributing to Iraq's rehabilitation include liaison officers in the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, a small group of specialists-about 16-contributing to the hunt for weapons of mass destruction, a military air traffic control group of about 60 personnel helping to run Baghdad International Airport, and a liaison officer and security detachment of around 75 personnel supporting the re-establishment of our diplomatic mission in Iraq. It is not possible at this time to say how long these defence elements, which comprise about 1,200 personnel, will remain in Iraq, as this will largely be determined by the situation on the ground. Let me conclude the answer by saying again that the government's decision to commit our forces to Iraq to be part of the coalition was the right decision. It was a decision in the long-term national interests of Australia, it was properly based in international law and it led to the liberation of an oppressed people. It has made, in my view, a very significant contribution to the long-term stability of the Middle East. It has in part, I believe, brought about a renewed effort by the United States administration to achieve a lasting peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. I say to those who sit opposite and remain critical of the decision the government took: just as many of you disbelieved the determination of the United States President to lead a coalition against Saddam Hussein and were proved wrong, you will be proved wrong if you disbelieve the determination of the world community, led by the United States, to try and achieve a lasting settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. It is something to which this government is strongly committed, it is something to which I referred in the address I made in this House on 4 February regarding Iraq and it is something that I know, on the basis of the discussions I have had with him, that the United States President is determined to bend all of his energies over the years ahead to achieving. I think one of the reasons why that has arisen is the successful commitment of the coalition in Iraq-a commitment of which this government is proud and a commitment of which this entire nation should also be proud. NA",19
17,The SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association study tour. All members of this tour are parliamentarians from near Pacific neighbours of ours. On behalf of all members of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our guests. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Governor General",20
18,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Isn't it the case that the Aspinall report found that at the time Dr Hollingworth made his decision to continue the known paedophile priest in the ministry he was aware that this person had repeatedly abused one boy as well as his brother? Prime Minister, didn't Dr Hollingworth swear a statutory declaration in April this year, whilst he was Governor General, claiming that he believed the priest's abuse was an isolated occurrence? Prime Minister, doesn't the report itself say in relation to that claim that there is no evidence that anyone told him that-the parents and Bishop Noble did not, nor did the priest? Further in the report it states: ‘There was not the slightest basis for him to have that belief.' Mrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 74, page 12 of the House of Representatives Practice, and standing order 153, which makes it quite clear that this matter may only be dealt with on a substantive motion where it can be debated properly. Page 12 reads: The practice of the House is that, unless the discussion is based on a substantive motion which admits of a distinct vote of the House, reflections ... must not be cast in debate concerning the conduct of the Sovereign or the Governor General ... I ask you to rule it out of order and indeed to require that any such questions are done by way of substantive motion. Mr Swan-Further to the point of order, Mr Speaker: I would like to quote briefly from the ruling of Speaker Snedden in relation to standing order 153, because I think we had a very selective view of it by the previous speaker. It says: ... there can be discussion about such an office holder provided that the discussion relates to a statement as to whether the actions were right or wrong, is conducted in a reasonable fashion ... That question was entirely within the framework outlined by Speaker Snedden. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-On that point of order, Mr Speaker: that statement of Speaker Snedden in no way contradicts House of Representatives Practice, which makes it quite clear, beyond any doubt, that if these matters are to be raised they must be done by substantive motion. Mr Ross Cameron-On the point of order, Mr Speaker: I can see that the Prime Minister is happy to take the question. I ply concur with the remarks of my colleague. There are two purposes of the standing order. The first is to ensure that the legislative branch of government does not undermine the prerogatives of the executive branch. The second is a very practical purpose: that the person who is the subject of this allegation cannot be here to defend his reputation. That is a denial of natural justice and that is why there is meant to be notice to allow the compiling of a proper, duly considered, wellinformed, evidentiary-based response to such an accusation. Mr Albanese interjecting",20
19,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the member for Grayndler is well aware, it has been my practice to uphold standing order 74 and I intend to continue to do so. But I alert the House to the comments of a predecessor of mine, Speaker Snedden, as referred to in House of Representatives Practice. On 13 February 1976, on page 131 of the Hansard, he made a comment that I will not read in detail but in which he suggested that the forms of the House will be maintained if the chair permits words of praise or criticism provided such remarks are free of words which reflect personally on His Excellency or which impute improper motives to him. I am particularly conscious of the latter part of that comment and I am listening to the Leader of the Opposition's question.",21
20,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a very important question, Mr Speaker, because it relates to a statutory declaration signed by the Governor General whilst he was in office.",21
21,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have allowed the question. The Leader of the Opposition will come to his question.,21
22,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The content of that statutory declaration is specifically referred the context of the Aspinall report. I go quotes again as to what the report said, besim- cause I want to know what the Prime Minister's comments are in relation to those findings in the report. I think that is a legitimate question for this parliament to have asked.",21
23,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition has not risen on a point of order; he has been called to ask his question.,21
24,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Prime Minister: is he aware that the Aspinall report says in relation to that statutory declaration of the Governor General that there is no evidence that anyone told him thatMrs Bronwyn Bishop- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I invoke standing order 74 and standing order 153. The subject of the question is a report which has nothing to do with this House. It is a report that was conducted by the church for its purposes, and I invoke again standing order 74 and standing order 153. Those remarks of Speaker Snedden can in no way refer to a report which is outside the purview of this parliament.",21
25,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have already ruled on the point of order.,21
26,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Again, I know the sensitivity on that side of the House but this is relevant to the House",21
27,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opposition will come to his question.,21
28,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,because child sex abuse is relevant to all Australians.,21
29,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If the Leader of the Opposition does not come to his question, I will oblige him to resume his seat.",21
30,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to the statutory declaration the report says that there is no evidence that anyone told him that: the parents and Bishop Noble did not, nor did the priest. Further in the report it stated: ‘There to in was not the slightest basis for him'-the to the Governor General-‘to have that belief.' Prime Minister, is a person who got it so wrong in a statutory declaration signed whilst he was Governor General a person appropriate to hold that office?",21
31,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The only thing that I would add in answer to the Leader of the Opposition to what I have said earlier is that, if he is going to quote from the board of inquiry-which he has done-he should also quote the paragraphs of the finding. Let me say that this is a private inquiry. It is up to Dr Hollingworth to deal in his own defence with the way in which he was treated by the inquiry but there are different views on this matter. I have been provided with a legal opinion-it was not one I sought but one that has been provided to the Governor General-which expresses the view in a fairly cogent manner that he was denied natural justice by the inquiry. We have to keep a sense of perspective about this. We are dealing with people's reputations, and the person whose reputation is being dealt with today is not here. He is not in a position to defend himself. It is all very well for the letter of the law in relation to the standing orders to be observed but when you have people interjecting remarks which impute behaviour and relate it to child sex abuse it would be easy to come to an unfair conclusion if you were a passive listener to the debate. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that in relation to the statutory declaration, this is what the report said: Dr Hollingworth has made a statutory declaration that he believed at the relevant time the abuse an isolated occurrence, and whilst the Board does not doubt he genuinely believes this to be so ... It would have been a good idea for you to read that out too. Mr Crean-I did.",22
32,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I do not think you did read that out. Mr Speaker, I do not think the Leader of the Opposition did read that out. Mr Crean interjecting",22
33,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He now agrees that he did not read that out. You are talking about others selectively quoting things. If you are going to the veracity of the statutory declaration, this is a relevant paragraph. It goes on to say: Dr Hollingworth's decision, whilst made in good faith, and in consultation, and without demur of the bishops whom he consulted, and in the belief that precautionary conditions imposed minimised the risk of recurrence, was untenable. Thus the Board finds that this complaint was not handled fairly, reasonably and appropriately. I have read out the whole paragraph and not just part of it. I simply make the point that, as to the substance of these matters, I am not in a position to make a judgment without having had the benefit of interviewing all the people concerned and I am not going to set myself up as an independent arbiter. I just make the point that a suggestion that in some way the board found that he had falsely declared is not justified by the board's findings. It is, therefore, untrue and should not be the subject of the Leader of the Opposition's questions. Foreign Affairs: Middle East",22
34,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of the likely broader geopolitical implications of the action in Iraq and in particular was the prospect for a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",22
35,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First, I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question and recognise the very great interest he shows in these issues. I recognise his support and indeed the support that all members on this side of the House gave to the coalition of the willing in its endeavour to disarm the Iraqi regime and to liberate the people of Iraq. It is early days but I think it is possible to draw some conclusions about the likely impact of the extraordinarily successful campaign in Iraq. The military campaign, first and foremost, has removed a deadly threat, a key supporter of terrorism and a proliferator of weapons of mass destruction. The conflict underlined how seriously the United States and its allies treat the twin threats to international security posed by the spread of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. This is a fundamentally important question. Countries pursuing weapons of mass destruction or lending support to terrorists now have a much clearer illustration of the United States and its allies' determination to act and the possible consequences of dangerous pursuits. The United States has rightly shown a determination to press for outcomes which will, in the end, preserve our common peace and security. That is not to say that the United States will deal with the different manifestations of these threats in the same manner as it has dealt with them in the case of Iraq-and it is important to understand that and not to draw false conclusions-but the United States is determined to use its weight to achieve a positive outcome in difficult circumstances. As the Prime Minister mentioned earlier, and as the member for Flinders also suggested in his question, the United States is now putting a great deal of emphasis and weight into endeavouring to resolve the long standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is doing this through a sustained diplomatic effort. The United States does that with the full support, I know, of so many people around the world, including in this country, and with the support of our government. The United States is capitalising on the new realities created by the successful military campaign in Iraq to address threats to security. For example-and these are very important points-in the aftermath of the campaign in Iraq, Syria has shown a new responsiveness to the concerns of countries like ours, the United States, of course, and others regarding terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. It is interesting that Syria also, after a certain degree of hesitation, has decided not to give sanctuary to Iraqi regime figures trying to flee from the coalition in Iraq. Iran has also assured us of its determination to play a constructive role in postconflict Iraq, and there are indications of renewed discussions within Iran of finding common ground with the United States. With the removal of the threat of Saddam Hussein, the United States has also been able dramatically to wind back its military presence in Saudi Arabia. I think the tragic bombings that took place this morningpossibly carried out by al-Qaeda or a related organisation-illustrate the importance of the United States and Saudi Arabia working together to defeat terrorism, because in that area there is still a good deal of work to be done. I note with great interest the recent comments of the foreign minister of Qatar, indicating that his country is considering a peace treaty with Israel. So the campaign in Iraq has begun a process of dramatic change in the Middle East. Recent actions by regional states and key powers have demonstrated a renewed willingness to work towards positive outcomes in the region. I will be visiting Iraq and a number of other countries in the region between 21 and 26 May, and it will be an opportunity for us to very directly have an input into what we think are desirable outcomes in the Middle East. But I do not think you can dismiss lightly the very substantial argument that what has happened in Iraq has sent a resounding message, not just through the Middle East but around the world, and has generated a much more positive atmosphere in the Middle East, which I think can help lead to the resolution of that terrible and long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Governor General",22
36,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Prime Minister. Isn't it the case that the Aspinall report finds that Dr Hollingworth's response to a complaint of serial child sex abuse was untenable? Doesn't the report also find that the complaint was not handled fairly, reasonably and appropriately? Prime Minister, is a person who has acted unfairly, unreasonably and inappropriately on complaints of serial child sex abuse an appropriate person to be Australia's Governor General?",24
37,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is true that the board of inquiry contained those findings. It is also true that that finding did not have the status of a judicial finding. It is also true that other lawyers have a view that the process that led up to the finding denied the Governor General natural justice. That is a statement of fact. I cannot disagree with the Leader of the Opposition that the board had that finding. But, in the absence of it being a tribunal of law, which it is not, it does not automatically follow that that finding is good for all purposes. It is the view of the people who constituted that board. The question of whether other views will be adduced in relation to that matter is something for Dr Hollingworth and not for me. So I cannot and will not dispute what is in the document. That is their finding. It is not a conclusion that is accepted by Dr Hollingworth. Legal advice he has obtained throws doubt over the procedural aspects of the inquiry and suggests he was denied natural justice. I am not saying that is true either. I am in no position to do so. I am not setting myself up as a court. I am simply pointing out that a private inquiry, having reached that conclusion, does not have the same force as some kind of process that would have a different and more definitive authority. Iraq",24
38,Ms JULIE BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of the coalition's progress to date in finding evidence of Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction?,24
39,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I appreciate the genuine interest, including the intellectual interest, that she shows in this particular issue.",24
40,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,24
41,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Australia, as the interjectors know only too well, joined the coalition to rid Iraq once and for all of its weapons of mass destruction capabilities, which the last 12 years unfortunately have demonstrated could not be achieved through diplomacy alone. We regret that but, on the other hand, the alternative of doing nothing was a worse alternative. The government and its agencies remain as confident as we have ever been that evidence will be found of Saddam's programs. Of course it will take time, but good leads are coming forth. I thought the HouseMrs Irwin interjecting Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting",24
42,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Fowler! The member for Wills for the third time!,24
43,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There are some very interesting interjections from the opposition. I only wish that people, particularly when they watch question time on television, could always hear the interjections because they are very revealing. Already we have seen evidence of what appear to be mobile biological laboratories, at two sites in Iraq, capable of producing biological materials for use in weapons of mass destruction. I know that it is disappointing to the opposition to hear this, but I am afraid this is true. In one technical experts from the United States and the United Kingdom have concluded that the unit does not appear to perform any function beyond what a defector said it was for, which was the production of biological agents. In this respect, this mobile equipment seems to bear out earlier claims by defectorsmentioned, by the way, by Secretary of State Colin Powell in his presentation to the Security Council on 5 February. Honourable members may recall that occasion. The coalition has in place a major search and investigation effort to which Australia is contributing 17 specialists. The Pentagon is currently restructuring its arrangements for weapons of mass destruction searches. There has been a suggestion, I think, in a media report that for some reason the Americans are withdrawing altogether from the search. That is of course not true; the Americans are, on the contrary, putting a very major effort into investigating the evidence. They will continue the examination of over 1,000 sites, including some 600 that relate to weapons which were identified prior to the conflict; another 400 sites have been identified as a result of tips and other leads; and less than 150 sites so far have been inspected. Just that information gives the House a sense of the dimensions of the task. A very significant component of all of this is the interviews that are taking place, and will in future take place, with scientists and others who have been involved in weapons of mass destruction programs. There is also extensive examination of documents and checking of computers for information relating to these programs, and this sort of detail is fundamentally important. There is no doubt that, in particular, the capacity to interview key scientists-such as Dr Taha, who was nicknamed Dr Germ, and Dr Ammash, who was known as Mrs Anthraxcase, recently detained by the coalition will be potentially very important. Let me also say, in answer to the honourable member's question, that we know only too well that Saddam Hussein's regime endeavoured to obfuscate and to hide from the United Nations weapons inspectors; and they worked very hard at hiding these materials from the United Nations weapons inspectors. Therefore, in order to continue the process of unravelling Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, obviously it will take a good deal of time. It will require continued and extensive interviews with scientists and other officials who will be able to provide more information in relation to those materials that have been hidden. Let us make no mistake about this. The revelation already of the mobile biological laboratories is an enormously important development. I do not think, if I recall the debates on this issue some weeks ago, there are many people on the other side of the House who have ever doubted Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction. As time goes on, that possession of weapons of mass destruction becomes increasingly apparent. Governor General",24
44,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that the Aspinall inquiry has found that the man you appointed as Governor General failed to report and act in relation to child sexual abuse by a known paedophile within his church and given that you have failed to seek his resignation as a consequence of those findings because apparently, you allege, procedural irregularity with the inquiry has occurred, will you, given the serious nature of the findings in the Aspinall report, agree to establish a judicial inquiry into this matter and into issue of child sexual abuse in this country?",25
45,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before I recognise the Prime Minister, I would remind the Leader of the Opposition of the use of the word ‘you'.",26
46,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition and I would refer him to the very detailed statement. I made on Sunday. I met the Governor General in Sydney on Sunday. I made a very detailed statement and perhaps I should remind the Leader of the Opposition of three things that came out of it. Firstly, I said that the Governor General would stand aside pending resolution of certain proceedings of which he is aware. Secondly and importantly, I said that, until that matter had been resolved, the Governor General could not properly direct himself to the question of his longer-term tenure of the office. I also said that, in considering his longer-term position, he had indicated to me that the protection and the dignity of the office would be his prime consideration. Against that background I do not intend to add anything, except to pick up the point that has been made about child sex abuse, which is something that ought to be of concern to all of us, and take the opportunity-I hope it is not out of order, Mr SPEAKER - to comment upon calls that have been made in relation to having inquiries into child sex abuse throughout the Australian community. Of all the things I have read about this in recent days, none has caught my eye more than some comments from Liz Mullinar, who is the founder of the group Advocates for Survivors of Child Abuse. This is what she had to say: We are not calling for a royal commission because a royal commission is just more money spent. We know the problem. We want more money spent now on solutions, we want more money spent on healing the victims of abuse, we the want more money spent on setting up services and we want more money spent so that any child or adult who reveals their abuse in the future gets appropriate counselling. The most successful Labor leader in Australia. I think successful Labor leaders should from time to time be taken notice of-is the New South Wales Premier. The New South Wales Premier has expressed his very strong opposition to the holding of a royal commission. Some people suggest it is because he might be embarrassed at its findings in relation to his department.",26
47,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,26
48,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Apparently it is all right for the Labor Party to traduce other people's reputations but, as soon as you say anything critical about the child protection practices of state governments, you are apparently playing dirty pool. That is apparently the double standard of the Labor Party on this issue.",26
49,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind the Prime Minister: some latitude has been given in the response to the question; that is entirely appropriate,26
50,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I think there has been a bit of latitude given to everybody,26
51,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Prime Minister, some latitude has been given in the response to the question. I thought that was entirely appropriate and it has not been a point of order. I am happy for the Prime Minister to continue, but I would invite him to bring his remarks back to the point of the question.",26
52,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In our view, calls for a royal commission on child abuse are more about political posturing than about efforts to increase our understanding of the problem and deal with it effectively. There have been a number of inquiries and reports in recent years on this issue, and they have developed a widespread understanding in the community of the causes of this problem and the challenges it poses for governments. For example, there was the recent Gordon inquiry in Western Australia, which looked at allegations of endemic abuse of Aboriginal children in Perth; the Fitzgerald report on communities in Cape York; the Wood royal commission in New South Wales; and also the Forde inquiry in Queensland. The unpalatable truth is that the majority of perpetrators of child abuse are people who are found within the domestic or family environmentbe they family members, friends or neighbours. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, natural parents are, sadly, the main perpetrators of child abuse in 56 per cent of cases in New South Wales, 84 per cent of cases in Queensland, 69 per cent in Western Australia, 81 per cent in South Australia, 49 per cent in Tasmania and 80 per cent in the ACT. Unfortunately, some commentators choose to use proposals for further child abuse inquiries as a vehicle for making some kind of political point against an individual or an institution. The challenge for governments is to identify children at risk of abuse in their families or communities and to deal with this risk through policies of early intervention and prevention in the early childhood years. Mr Latham-What about Hollingworth? Ms Gillard interjecting",26
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Could I say to those in the opposition who interject on this point that the advantages of early intervention policies, particularly but not only in relation to child abuse, have been identified by this government. Some three years ago we announced the Stronger Families and Communities policy, which is in the process now of providing resources which are in part directed towards curing that problem. Could I say to those, including the Premier of Queensland, who are calling for a royal commission: I would rather spend the $60 million to $100 million that would be involved in a royal commission on further early intervention policies than on lining the pockets of the lawyers who would be called before the inquiry. We have already made a major investment in early intervention and prevention through the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy that I announced just over three years ago. Under this strategy, funds have already been provided to help many community groups right around Australia in their important work to build better family relationships, to develop better parenting skills and to prevent domestic violence. I conclude my answer by quoting from the maiden speech of the member for Sydney, who I understand has some professional experience in this field. This is what she had to say: We need to ensure that every Australian child is safe in his or her home. We need to teach protective behaviours to children as part of a whole program of self-esteem and confidence building that makes children aware that behaviour that makes them feel uncomfortable need not be tolerated. We need to strengthen families before abuse starts. I think that is quite an eloquent plea for more effective early intervention policies, and I think there is a responsibility on the part of all governments. I make the point that the principal government institutions that have the care of children as their charge are state institutions. I do not say that to in any way exculpate the Commonwealth government from responsibility; but, in the end, it is state welfare organisations-state family and welfare departments-that have the responsibility. Whilst I understand fully the interest and the desire of the opposition to pursue certain aspects of this matter, in the end, if governments-be they Commonwealth or statehave additional resources to put in the direction of matters relating to child abuse, I think it is a far better disposition of that money to accept that we know a lot of the problem already; it is a question of devising better solutions, it is a question of providing resources to implement those solutions rather than spending a whole lot of extra money-I say with no disrespect to my former profession-lining the pockets of lawyers at an expensive royal commission that would essentially go over ground that has already been heavily ploughed.",27

55,Mr KING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney-General inform the House of developments in investigations into the Bali bombings, which occurred so tragically in October last year? What has the Australian government done to assist those investigations and bring the terrorists to justice?",28
56,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. I am pleased to inform the House that the Australian Federal Police are continuing their strong and successful cooperative relationship with the Indonesian National Police in investigating the Bali bombings. Indeed, the commitment of both countries to tracking down and prosecuting those responsible for the devastating bomb attacks in Bali last October has already delivered significant and tangible results. There are currently 29 people in cusmation tody in Indonesia awaiting prosecution relating to the Bali bombings. Four other people are also in custody, with inquiries being undertaken to determine their involvement. The first trial, that of Amrozi, commenced on Monday this week. The trial has been adjourned to next Monday, 19 May, to allow the defence further time to consider the brief of evidence. The Bali trials will be heard in two venues-the Wanita Nari Graha building in Denpasar and the Denpasar District Court. The Nari Graha building will be used as the venue for the principal suspects' trials, those of Amrozi, Ali Imron, Muklas and Samudra. The trials for the remaining suspects will be held at the Denpasar District Court. Continuin- ing the close cooperation between Indonesian and Australian authorities, which has been the hallmark of these investigations, the AFP has a team supporting the Indonesian prosecution and providing assistance as required. The team has, to date, collected 49 witness and victim impact statements in Australia, along with 32 forensic statements and reports for use in support of the prosecution. It is not yet known whether there will be a requirement for any of these witnesses to attend and give evidence in the trials in Indonesia. In support of the process, the AFP has also established a dedicated family liaison team with offices throughout Australia. These officers have the responsibility for the important task of liaising with the families of Bali victims and ensuring they are provided with accurate and timely information regarding the investigation and possible prosecution. Members of the AFP team will be in Bali during the trial periods and will provide briefings and assistance to Australian family members in relation to the trial proceedings. The AFP will also provide up-to-date inforabout the Bali trials on their web site at www.afp.gov.au. For those families that do not have Internet access, other arrangements have been made to ensure that they are regularly updated. In addition, the government has provided financial assistance for close family members of the Bali victims and for those seriously injured in the bombings who wish to attend part of the trials. Centrelink family liaison officers have contacted families and the seriously injured in relation to the offer. Interested families can also contact the Centrelink Bali Disaster Hotline on 136 125 for more information. Investigations by the Indonesian National Police are continuing with a view to apprehending other suspects regarding the bombings. One vital outcome of the investigations to date has been a substantial knowledge gained by our law enforcement and intelligence authorities about the activities of Jemaah Islamiah and the extent of terrorist activities throughout the region. As part of the overall investigation into the Bali bombings, the AFP is working closely with Indonesian authorities to trace the flow of funds used to finance the attacks. This important aspect of the investigation is ongoing. There are currently about 36 AFP personnel deployed in Indonesia for Operation Alliance-the Bali bombing assistance operation. This includes members of the AFP and five members of the Australian Protective Service. Approximately 12 AFP officers are dedicated to Operation Alliance in Australia. This reflects the ongoing commitment of Australian authorities to tracking down and bringing to justice those responsible for the Bali bombings and to supporting the Australian families of the victims through what continues to be a difficult and painful process. More officers are allocated to investigations on a needs basis. As at 30 April, Operation Alliance had resulted in the expenditure of $12 million, with more than 170,000 hours being attributed to Operation Alliance throughout the AFP. Australian authorities will continue to play a strong role in the investigation of the Bali bombings. The ongoing vigour of this investigation sends a strong message to terrorists and those considering terrorist acts around the world that we will not stand for such cowardly attacks on Australians or Australian interests. Governor General",28
57,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, are you aware of the Australians Against Child Abuse research report of April 2003? It states: Unlike many other social problems, the torment and harm caused to tens of thousands of Australian children each year occur behind closed doors, away from the public gaze ... Child abuse as a social problem must become far more visible. Prime Minister, given that you have challenged the legitimacy of the Aspinall report-which has just been tabled-because it did not have the status of a judicial inquiry, aren't Australians entitled to feel concerned that the allegations against Dr Hollingworth have been covered up without such a judicial inquiry or an appropriately framed royal commission?",29
58,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I have not seen the particular report that you refer to, but I have no reason to disbelieve the conclusion that you quote. I accept that what you said was there and I accept that that conclusion is correct. Did you say ‘legitimacy' of the report? Mr MCClelland-Yes.",29
59,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will understand the need to address his remarks through the chair and not use the term ‘you'.,29
60,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sorry. Through you, Mr Speaker, I inquire of the member for Barton: did he use the word ‘legitimacy'?",29
61,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Barton is indicating he did.,29
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not challenging its legitimacy. I am not challenging the bona fides of the people who wrote the report. I am just pointing out what its status is. I am also pointing out that there is another view the way in which the inquiry was conducted, which puts it in a different light than it has been put in by the Leader of the Opposition. That is what I am saying. Mr Crean interjecting",29
63,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of Opposition interjects ‘How do I resolve?' I have already answered a question in relation to the position of the Governor General, and I have got nothing to add to it. Health: Therapeutic Goods",30
64,Mr CADMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Ageing representing the Minister for Health and Ageing. In the light of the recent mass recall of ucts manufactured by Pan Pharmaceuticals, would the minister explain to the House how the Australian government is helping to ensure that medicines and medical devices in the marketplace are safe and of high quality? Would the minister also outline to the House the Australian government's proposals to strengthen the regulatory regime monitoring the manufacture of medicines and medical devices?",30
65,Mr ANDREWS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question and his ongoing and continuing interest in the health and welfare of all Australians. The reasons behind the Pan Pharmaceuticals recall of more than 1,500 products-mostly complementary medicines-and the licence suspension of that company have been well canvassed in the media. The recall has highlighted the importance of preventing or deterring deliberate or reckless breaches of standards and conditions applicable to the manufacture of medicines in order to protect the health and safety of the Australian public. In this context, the Therapeutic Goods Administration is to be commended for finding these serious deficiencies in the manufacturing process as well as a culture of concealof ment in that particular company. Its vigilance and competence are a vital part of ensuring that Australians can have confidence now and into the future in the medicines that they take and that the pharmaceutical industry can continue to make world-class products for Australian consumers and for export. The government, nonetheless, has announced a series of measures to further strengthen the sector's future. First, as was announced by my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, the member for Adelaide, yesterday, an expert committee will be set up by the Commonwealth government to examine the role of complementary medicines in the prodhealth care system. This expert committee will focus on issues around the supply of safe, high-quality complementary medicines, quality use of and timely access to these medicines and the maintenance of a responsible and viable complementary medicines industry. The expert committee will be chaired by Dr Michael Bollen, a member of the National Health and Medical Research Council, who has been involved with the Australian Pharmaceutical Advisory Council and consumer medicines information. Further announcements on the committee and its terms of reference will be made later this week, and it is expected that it will report back to the government by mid-August. Second, the government has foreshadowed proposed amendments to the therapeutic goods legislation to tighten the existing requirements placed on manufacturers and sponsors of therapeutic goods. The foreshadowed amendments include: firstly, increasing the maximum penalties for a range of existing offences under the Therapeutic Goods Act; secondly, creating new offences for the falsification of any document that has been created, retained or issued; thirdly, inserting a fit and proper person test into the licence conformity assessment certificate; and, fourthly, providing better identification of therapeutic goods in the event of a recall. The establishment of this committee and the legislative changes that I have made mention of will go a long way towards giving the community and all health care practitioners further confidence that the government is taking the necessary steps to examine the role of complementary medicines in the health care system while encouraging the continuation of Australia's reputation as a supplier of high-quality and safe medicines. Child Abuse",30
66,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister and it follows his answer to earlier questions today. Prime Minister, given the view stated today that you believe that the issue of child abuse requires more support and resources, why, when you were elected in 1996, did you scrap the National Child Abuse Prevention Strategy that had been carefully developed in wide consultation with the community? Prime Minister, why are you still not prepared to consider such a national strategy and resource it appropriately?",31
67,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not have the precise details of the program to which you refer in my mind, and I am not going to comment on the precise circumstances of that until I check exactly what the circumstances were, but I would make the very obvious point that a program that carries a particular name is not the one and only way of tackling a problem. Ms Roxon interjecting",31
68,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Gellibrand has asked her question!,31
69,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have just outlined to the member for Gellibrand and her colleagues that, three years ago, we announced or a program of several hundred million dollars designed specifically to build stronger families and communities and, in the past few weeks, I have written to the Minister for Family and Community Services requesting that there be an even greater focus on strategies of early childhood intervention. Ms Roxon interjecting",31
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Gellibrand!,31
71,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Even if what the member for Gellibrand says is literally correct, it does not prove anything other than that a particular program was not thought to be appropriate. The important thing is that we have introduced programs which are designed to address this issue. The other important thing-and the point has to be made again and again-is that institutions and organisations dealing with the problem of child abuse are, principally, to be found at a state level. Ms Roxon interjecting",31
72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Gellibrand-for the third time!,31
73,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The states want a place in the sun. State governments appropriate to themselves the right to give the Commonwealth government advice on all sorts of things, so I am going to occasionally give them some advice on their own core responsibilities, and one of their core responsibilities is child welfare. There is no federal department of child welfare; there are state departments of child welfare. Somebody is a ward of the state, not a ward of the Commonwealth-that is where the principal responsibility lies. The administration of government schools is a state responsibility and the curriculum control and overall surveillance of all schools is a state responsibility. I am simply making the point that this desire on the part of states to federalise every problem but to appropriate to themselves the right to give advice on any issue they choosethat those days, as far as this government are concerned, are well and truly over. We expect states, particularly as they are going to be given more and more money under the GST-and the extent of how the states benefit from the GST will be apparent on any examination of federal-state relationshipsto meet their responsibilities. I repeat what I said earlier: if people are really interested the issue of child sex abuse as distinct from trying to score a few points in relation to an extraordinarily difficult and traumatic issue, then I think they should focus on greater early childhood intervention in relation to families at risk. That is where you are going to find a solution to the problem. Immigration: People-smuggling",31
74,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on the practical steps Australia is taking to combat people-smuggling and trafficking in our region?,32
75,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question and the interest he shows in this issue. We make no apology for the tough approach we have taken to stop criminals smuggling and trafficking innocent-sometimes less than but typically innocent-people and targeting Australia. Globally, this is a $15 billion a year criminal activity and it undermines the integrity of the international refugee system. It is an issue that absolutely must be addressed. As the House will know, our comprehensive approach to this problem has been working very successfully, with no unauthorised arrivals landing on the Australian mainland since August 2001. A critical element of our strategy is to strengthen regional cooperation against people-smuggling and to do that by improving the technical capacity of source, transit and destination countries to deal with these problems. With my Indonesian counterpart, Hassan Wirajuda, I co-hosted the second regional ministerial conference on people-smuggling in Bali early last week. It was attended by 28 ministers from 32 regional countries, including of course our own distinguished ministers, the Minister for Immigration and Multiin cultural and Indigenous Affairs and also the Minister for Justice and Customs. These ministers have proved extraordinarily effective in their participation at these meetings, as of course has the overall strategy proved effective. Mr Kelvin Thomson interjecting",32
76,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Wills is warned!,32
77,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If we had taken the advice of the opposition, obviously the strategy would not have worked. It was also noteworthy that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers, was at the meeting, as were representatives from the International Organisation of Migration, a number of observer countries and other international organisations. This meeting was not only extraordinarily successful in terms of meeting its objectives-ensuring much better cooperation on law enforcement, information exchange and so the list goes on-and building on the first Bali conference but also a very important illustration of the strength of the bilateral cooperation between Australia and Indonesia. I think this is a significant issue. In Australia, people should reflect on it a little bit. Commentators, in particular, should reflect on it a little more than they do. I noted, for example, the spokesman for the Indonesian foreign ministry being reported in the Financial Review last week, making it very clear that Indonesia is satisfied and impressed with the level of cooperation between our two countries and the work we are doing together. This is one of those issues. Ms Gillard interjecting",32
78,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable member interjects, ‘Have the Indonesians made people-smuggling an offence?' The Indonesian government, true to its word, has drafted the legislation and is discussing the legislation with its parliament. I do not think it would be wise for people on the other side to go to the Indonesians and, in a patronising and high handed way, tell them when they should pass legislation through their parliament. After all, you are not even capable of running your own affairs on the other side of the House, let alone telling the Indonesians how to run theirs.",33

Aren't these, Prime Minister, the programs that you said it would be better to expand rather than spending money on a judicial inquiry?

98,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,"Members will be aware of the death on 31 March 2003 of Doug Mitchell, who will be fondly remembered by members as a long serving and highly valued staff member of the Department of the House of Representatives. Given Doug's long service to the House, his unassuming manner and his willingness to assist all members, I know that the House would want me to put on record our recognition of his service and our sorrow at his death. Doug joined the staff of the House in 1980. In 1981 he was transferred as the Speaker's attendant. He remained in this position until the end of 1985, serving speakers Snedden, Jenkins and Childs. From 1990 until his death, Doug was responsible for furniture management arrangements, and his duties in this field brought him into close contact with most members. He established a legendary reputation for getting things done and doing them well. He was very much part of the glue that holds the House of Representatives department together. Doug was an exceptional sportsman and was active in various sports teams. He captained the department's cricket team until 2002, when he thought that it was time to pass the mantle on. He continued to play and took great delight in the team's victories, particularly over the Senate, as happened again earlier this year with Doug playing his usual strong role. Doug was a highly respected and much admired member of the staff of the House of Representatives.

118,Ms BURKE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER," Mr Speaker, given the changed traffic circumstances around the building because of increased security measures, what assistance and advice have been given to the Comcar drivers in respect of taking alternative routes and, more importantly, how they are now going to access the underground toilets?

147,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Gellibrand proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to adequately protect Australian children from abuse, in particular child sexual abuse. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",41
148,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Gellibrand) (3.46 p.m.)We could not have had a more telling question time to lead into this debate today when the Prime Minister answered a number of questions in respect not just of the matter regarding the Governor General, Dr Hollingworth, but of his views about child sexual abuse. He made some statements about the importance of investing in children. In dismissing calls that are being made by the community for a royal commission, a judicial inquiry or some sort of broader discussion on the issue of child sexual abuse, the Prime Minister said that he actually believed a better response was to spend the money by investing in programs that could assist children and their families in dealing with these sorts of issues. In fact, the member for Lilley was asking a question on this very point when he was thrown out of the House. It seems to us on this side of the House that that tends to happen as soon as issues are raised on which the Prime Minister has actually not kept up with his rhetoric or his stated view that we should invest in these programs. We point out to the Prime Minister, as the member for Lilley was trying to, that the Stronger Families and Communities program has had money taken out of it in the last year. I think members on this side of the House, and I suspect even members on the other side of the House, are aware that most of the money in the Stronger Families and Communities program is actually used for pilot programs. Many of them are incredibly worthy pilot programs; in fact, many of us have advocated the continuance of these programs. The government has more pilots in the Department of Family and Community Services than it has in the Air Force, but it does not run any recurrent programs. As soon as they are shown to be good the expenditure is cut, and there is no ongoing strategy to deal with issues of family and domestic violence, parenting support and early intervention. These are the sorts of things the Prime Minister is prepared to talk about but never delivers on. If people cast their minds back to when this government was last re-elected, there was an interesting article in the Sunday Telegraph which had the Prime Minister, breathtakingly, stating that child welfare reform was to be one of the hallmarks of the coalition's third term in office. But since this government has been elected we have seen absolutely nothing to show that child welfare is of interest to it. In fact, we have had the Prime Minister standing up in this House saying something I am sure people will remember. In answering questions about the importance of preventing and dealing with this terrible issue of child abuse, the Prime Minister said: I want to make it very clear that, if there is an inadequacy of money for child abuse policy in this country, that is 100 per cent the responsibility and the failure of successive state governments ... He has been rushing with indecent haste to blame everybody else for problems in this area. He refuses to accept that this is a national disgrace and that it is an issue of national concern for us that there are large numbers of children who are being abused in our community. He is not comfortable with even saying that child sexual abuse is wrong and should never be condoned, and it should not be condoned by our silence. That is what we are starting to see happening in this House. We should use this current opportunity, and I know the minister opposite, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, will use it. The circumstances that have brought child abuse to the public's attention may not be circumstances that people feel comfortable with, but we should make sure that, this issue having been raised and having been on the front pages of the papers for the last several weeks and previously a year ago, we do something that will really make a difference for children in the future. This government cannot be proud of its record. It does matter that when it was elected it cut the National Child Abuse Prevention Strategy in 1996. It was a national strategy that had been agreed between the states, the community groups and the Commonwealth, and the national government was going to take leadership on this issue. The Prime Minister can say, ‘I'm not really aware of that program.' He is not aware of it because he does not believe that he has any role to play. As the leader of this country he truly does not understand why he has a role to play in this area of trying to prevent child abuse. To be quite honest, that is very sad for this country. We need to take this issue seriously and do something about it. Another question the Prime Minister did not have the opportunity to respond to because he shortened question time today is that, if he is actually so committed to putting money into preventive programs, why has he slashed money from the Stronger Families and Communities program? Members on this side of the House will be very interested to know that he has also underspent the small amount of money allocated for child abuse prevention. Last year the government underspent an eighth of the money; this very small program was not even all spent. Half a million dollars was not spent on the government's single small child abuse prevention program. And since being elected the Prime Minister and his government have not conducted or funded a single national campaign against domestic or family violence or against sexual assault in this country. It makes it very difficult for us to believe what the Prime Minister is saying: that he is concerned about these issues. It is a very serious pattern, because the other thing that has happened is that the government has decided since 1996 that it does not want to collect statistics on things that might be uncomfortable for it. So it has ensured that the Office of the Status of Women does not collect any national statistics on violence against women, despite previous governments having done so. We know that this is a difficult area. We know that the answers are not easy. We think that the problem is a complex one but at every turn it seems to us that the Prime Minister is not prepared to tackle this issue head on. He does not want a royal commission; he does not want a judicial inquiry; he does not accept the findings of the Aspinall report. He thinks that money should be spent on programs instead, but then he cuts funding from those programs. Well, we are not going to let the Prime Minister get away with that. The minister and other speakers on the other side might stand up and say, ‘We've got lots of nice programs running,' but I defy them to find an ongoing national strategic commitment to the prevention of child abuse in this country. That is what we need. It does not have to be in the form that we asked for. We have put forward lots of options that we think could move this debate forward. We cannot be in the position of having over 30,000 victims of child abuse in this country each year. No-one in this House wants to see that.",41
149,Mr ANTHONY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It is the states.,43
150,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister opposite says, ‘It is the states.' What are they doing? Let us deal with this issue because no doubt the minister will stand up and repeat what the Prime Minister has said. They will try to wash their hands of it by saying that it is 100 per cent the responsibility of the states. You do not even know what the difference is here. The states have a responsibility once child abuse has occurred. Do you know what, Minister? We think it would be better if we prevented it from occurring and we believe that the national government has a role to play in the prevention.",43
151,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Government members interjecting,43
152,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We will get to that. We do not believe that having a national agenda for children-and we have supported that; we have welcomed your doing it-is an alternative to putting money and resources into prevention programs. We do not believe that you can consult for however long you intend to-and we will happily encourage people to participate in those consultations-and in the meantime abrogate your responsibility in playing a role in the prevention of child abuse in this country. We expect you to be able to do two things at once. That might be too much, but we expect that you might be able to do that.",43
153,Unknown,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Opposition members interjecting,43
154,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There are members on this side of the House who are not being nearly as generous as I am to the minister. We do not stand up in this House and say that the states have no responsibilities, but it is an absolute disgrace-and something that no leader of this country could be proud of that a leader of this country is not prepared to tackle a major social problem. We know that the Prime Minister has been prepared to do it in other areas. He has been prepared to say that the federal government should take a leadership role in the gun buy-back scheme. He has been prepared to say that he should lead the national drug strategy. He has done it in mental health and plenty of other areas. There is no impediment other than the Prime Minister's lack of will in playing a role in trying to prevent child abuse in this country. We have put forward a proposal and we will be tabling a bill in this House in the coming weeks to establish a national commissioner for children and young people. We think this is one way of valuing and respecting children and promoting their interests, rights and well-being, and a way for us to move forward. It is not, as is often suggested by the government, about rehashing the past-although that is very important for many victims and their parents-but something for us to look forward to. In the proposal for a national commissioner for children and young people we have called for the establishment of a national code to protect children. We have called for a working with children check and the government has absolutely refused even to talk to us about it. In fact, when it has previously been discussed in this House the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, who is sitting opposite me at the table, gave his reason for thinking a working with children check would not be adopted. He said: Yes, in theory, it does have some meritso it was good that he understood that it did have some meritbut, interestingly, a lot of those organisations I speak to that particularly deal with youth and young people are extremely reluctant to go down that path. That is the path of instituting a national working with children check. The minister goes on: Why is that? It is because they are desperate to get more volunteers to help. Unfortunately that might be true but surely we have to put the safety of children first. The priority is that parents want to know whether their children are safe when they are left in the care of others. And ultimately the organisations that deal with children want to know that their volunteers do not have some history of offences against children. In fact the Anglican Church, which has been so much in the papers recently, has certainly been taught some lessons about this issue and is calling for a national working with children check. Minister, we ask you and your government to reconsider. Here is an opportunity to work with us and with the states to establish a national system which could help protect people from further abuse. Why do you want to run away from something that could really make a difference to children in these circumstances? Mr Anthony interjecting",43
155,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The minister also interjects that a large amount of abuse occurs in the parental home. Indeed it does, and there are many steps that can be taken to help support parents and families so that this never happens. In fact, I think that these are some of the strongest arguments for the Commonwealth playing a significant role in the prevention of child abuse. Although people argue about the range of issues that can cause child abuse or the reasons for child abuseand agree that they are complex and numerthat ous-it has been agreed that there are many structural issues like poverty, unemployment, poor educational opportunities and family stress that all have an impact on the likelihood or incidence of child abuse. All these issues are Commonwealth issues. It is even thought by many commentators and welfare groups in this area that child abuse may be increasing because of the extra pressures on families, the increased drug and alcohol addiction rates and the failure to address intergenerational cycles of abuse and neglect. You would think that, if the Commonwealth understood this, they would not have argued against us establishing an inquiry into poverty for Australian families. They might have had the sense to see that sometimes there is a link between poverty and family breakdown and abuse. But they are not even prepared to put any money into these programs. They do not even want an inquiry to find whether there is something that they should do. At every turn the government's hypocrisy is shown up. We cannot afford to do this any longer. We cannot afford to brush it aside, keep it behind closed doors or say it is somebody else's issue. We need to be prepared to take a leadership role here. It might be awkward for the government. It might be awkward for the state governments. We need to take some action so this terrible issue is dealt with. The community thinks that leaders in this country are covering up what has happened in the past. Whether they think it is church leaders, politicians or other powerful people, we must make sure that we are never part of that conspiracy. We on this side of the House and, I am sure, the people on the other side of the House do not want to cover up this issue. But you have to start showing that, as the government, you are prepared to tackle some of these issues. We put the challenge out to you today in this debate. If you are not going to continue to fail our children, you need to do more than take a few small steps towards some long-term planning. You need to introduce a national strategy to prevent child abuse. You need to get serious about working with children checks. You need to get serious about properly funding parenting programs and early intervention programs-and not as pilots but as ongoing programs. The Prime Minister said, ‘We don't need an inquiry, because we know what some of the issues are.' Start putting the money into them. We can do that. We do not have to wait for another five years of consultation to do that. Minister, you know full well that discussing the early childhood agenda is not enough and is not an alternative to us actually dealing with some serious prevention programs. So we want to know what you will do. After the Prime Minister's answer today, we will be looking in the budget to see whether he is putting money back into those domestic violence programs that he is underspending on and whether he is going to put a national prevention strategy back in place. We will be looking to see if your cherished childhood agenda is getting some money in these areas too, Minister, and we will support you if it does. But we need more action. (Time expired)",44
156,Mr ANTHONY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I would like to recant some of the arguments that the shadow minister, the member for Gellibrand, put forward. But, before I do that, I will say that all of us this House, no matter what our political persuasion, are absolutely appalled by the increasing level of child abuse in this country and, in particular, by the issue of child sex abuse. No-one of any right mind can give any type of sympathy to those individuals who abuse children or who follow a path of paedophilia. If there is anything good to come out of the situation of the last couple of weeks, which was put in train many years ago, it is that this issue of child abuse is now on the national radar screen, because it is not just an issue that is in the jurisdiction of governments-although, if the opposition shadow spokesperson was going to be really fair dinkum, perhaps the MPI would have read: the failure of the state and territory governments to adequately protect Australian children from abuse, in particular child sex abuse. I will address that in a minute. If anything good has come out of this, it is a recognition by state governments, communities and, most importantly, individuals and families within the community that, if we are to make a lasting and substantial impact on reducing child abuse, whether the abuse is neglect, emotional, physical or sexual, each and every one of us has a role to play to ensure that children are protected in the communities that we live in. When it comes to the substantive issue of child protection, the Commonwealth government is extremely concerned. That is why I invited the shadow spokesperson to join with the government-which is most unusual and unorthodox-in developing a national childhood agenda, because that is all about focusing on early intervention and prevention to ensure that children do not get into vulnerable situations and, more importantly, to educate their parents so they have a better outcome when it comes to their health, wealth and well-being-particularly on the in issue of abuse. I have included the member for Gellibrand in our discussions. I have kept her in the loop in every way possible so as to have as bipartisan an approach as possible. I think she modified some of her comments, but it should be emphasised that the government is embarking on a huge program here. We have had particular consultations with the Australian of the Year, Professor Fiona Stanley. She said to me, just as she said to the member for Gellibrand, ‘Whatever you do, Minister, don't make it a national roll-out program. That is not going to work because it could actually have the opposite effect and compound the problems if it is not tested and if it is not right.' But I will return to that. Under our Constitution, the issue of child protection rests with the state governments. Do not be fooled about where anyone else in this House says it should be. I suspect that a bit of cost shifting is going on here, apportioning responsibilities that should be carried out by state and territory governments to the Commonwealth. The states and territories are responsible not only for the notification but for the following through and the protection of children. The facts are that the record in this nation has been appalling over the last couple of years. Here is an opportunity. If the member for Gellibrand seriously wants to advance the cause here, she will help me by ringing her colleagues-and I will later supply the ministers' names and telephone numbers-and getting them to start doing the job that they are obliged to with child protection as a state responsibility. Let us look at the number of notifications. It has risen by 30,000 over the past two years. Let us put the record straight and not try to slip and slide here about where the key responsibilities are, and then I will talk about what the Commonwealth is doing. The principal responsibility is with the states, and it just so happens that every state and territory government at the moment is wearing an ALP badge. We have had a notifications increase of 30,000 in the last two years, rising from 107,000 to 137,000. In all jurisdictions, except for South Australia and the ACT, we have seen substantial increases. The number of substantiations has also increased from 24,732 a couple of years ago to over 30,000 now, and the biggest numbers are in New South Wales and Queensland. In all jurisdictions, perhaps except for Tasmania, the number of notifications involving Indigenous children is rising dramatically. If we are to be fair dinkum about this and if we are not to play politics with this issue, the interest in which has been generated by the controversy over the Governor General or, more importantly, by this report that has come out, then we should look at what role the states are playing. Quite frankly, the member for Gellibrand has taken the gloves off. I included her in the early childhood consultations to develop a major plan for this country about how we can do it right. A lot of that involves prevention and early intervention from even before the child is born, helping the parents to get a better outcome to reduce the potential for that cycle of abuse that happens later on. The greatest hypocrisy has been demonstrated by the words that have come from some of the state premiers, in particular the Premier of Queensland. That government has failed consistently. Let us look at the figures. The number of child protection notifications in Queensland rose by over 8,000 in the past two years, rising from 19,000 to 27,000 in the last financial year. The number of substantiations in Queensland is up by 3,000, from just under 7,000 to over 10,000. I note the audacity of the Premier and I notice the federal opposition hedging their bets on the merits of perhaps holding a royal commission. There is a substantial difference of opinion when you talk to some of our other national leaders at a state level. I highlight the hypocrisy that is almost emerging nowit is quite real within Queensland-when I quote from what David Flint has so eloquently written in Online Opinion which was highlighted on Crikey recently. He states: The most reprehensible are those guilty of the worse cases of double standards in recent times. Bill D'Arcy, a former Queensland MP, was found guilty of 18 charges of abuse. The Queensland government has consistently denied liability. This was not 10 years ago; the decisions were handed down this year. He continues: Moreover, legislation has not been introduced to sequester D'Arcy's generous superannuation for the benefit of his victims. Apparently, legal vice is that without this they cannot be touched. Here is a situation where we had questioning by the member for Lilley-he has now been thrown out of the House-about the lack of action perhaps being taken by the federal government over a particular issue. But we are not dealing here with a current member of a parliament. As unfortunate as this case is-and I do not mean to underestimate its importance-we had the situation where, when this person was running the ALP in Queensland, we heard nothing from Peter Beattie on the issue of child abuse. Did we hear anything from Mr Beattie when that issue concerned a man who was at the time the Treasurer of the Queensland government? The silence was condemning. Let us look at the statistics in New South Wales. There were 30,000 notifications a couple of years ago. That figure today is 55,000 notifications. I acknowledge that it is very difficult for those state agencies, but that is a substantial increase. The number of substantiations has also increased dramatically. We have a situation in New South Wales where we have had 55,000 notifications and only 8,600 have actually been substantiations. What has happened to the other 40,000? Even the Age newspaper-perhaps the member for Gellibrand can have some impact on her state colleagues-reports that in the Family Court a judge today, or it might have been yesterday, attacked the Bracks government for doing little to repair an ailing child protection system. John Foggerty, who retired from the court in 1998, said: I am more pessimistic than ever about child protection. It has been assigned to mediocrity and it will stay that way until we get another picture of a Daniel Valerio with those black eyes. This pattern is emerging. We have had many commissions of inquiry by state governments. In New South Wales, the Wood royal commission was set up with all the right inad- tent and $90 million was spent on it. We have had the Gordon inquiry in Western Australia, which recently brought down its findings on a terrible situation that happened with Indigenous children. We had the Ford inquiry in Queensland which was followed by the Fitzgerald inquiry. The federal opposition are trying to muddy the waters by saying that perhaps the government should have a royal commission. However, they are not quite convinced of it because they know that, if there were a royal commission, it would put the spotlight firmly back on the failure of the state authorities. Ultimately, at the end of the day, would an inquiry actually advance the cause for future generations of children who might be vulnerable to being abused? I dispute the inferences and allegations which were made by the shadow spokesperson that the Prime Minister is not concerned about this particular issue. He was probably the first ever Prime Minister to put this issue on the COAG agenda, which he did not so long ago. He did so knowing full well not only that it is a state responsibility but also that as a nation we all have to deal with this issue. Liz Mullinar is the founder of the group Advocates for Survivors of Child Abuse, and she is a well-known advocate. She is reluctant about calling for a royal commission, because a royal commission is just more money spent. She states: We know the problem. We want money spent now on solutions, we want money spent on healing the victims of abuse, we want money spent on setting up services and we want money spent so that any child or adult who reveals their abuse in the future gets appropriate counselling. I notice that Bob Carr is very much opposed to a royal commission. Maybe that is because he knows the spotlight might focus back on child protection issues within New South Wales and that the money is better spent on early intervention and prevention. I have included the shadow spokesperson in two open consultations that I had-one in the ACT and one in Victoria recently-and she knows that we are now going through a process of pilot programs. It is important to have pilot programs now. We do not want to have a major program which is not effective, considering the states are the ones that are implementing most of these programs anyway, and we want to ensure that we get such a program right. There are calls for a national commissioner for children. I have to say that one wonders what powers a national commissioner will have. The government believes that it is probably going to create, as well meaning as it may be, another layer of bureaucracy. As has been mentioned by the opposition spokesperson as well as by the Leader of the Opposition, they are looking for it to become like a statutory authority. It will have no responsibility or accountability to the parliament but will have a very direct and limited responsibility. Even when the Leader of the Opposition was trying to explain it on John Laws, he was all over the place. Some states have adopted commissioners for children, and that is good, but again the responsibility comes down to that level of government. We talk about trying to get some uniformity. Only about five months ago I got the state ministers together to try to get some uniformity in the area of foster care. It was like trying to travel to the moon to get them to acknowledge that we should try to get some uniformity just in actual reporting. It cannot be done because even in Western Australia they do not have mandatory reporting. The systems are so different. If we are to make true advances for children who are abused, a substantial amount of that responsibility under our Constitution rests with the states. I do not think anyone should try to apportion blame to the Commonwealth when the principal carriage and responsibility rests with the states and territories. I will not go to some of the comments that the Leader of the Opposition made, but I do not think that the opposition have thought through the full consequences. Likewise, I encourage the opposition, if they have got good contacts among their state colleagues, to pursue some of these matters there as they should, rather than directing a lot of the responsibilities to the Commonwealth, which has no jurisdiction. The issue of a working with children check has been raised by the member for Gellibrand and by the Labor Party over the last 12 months. In Queensland and New South Wales they have specific legislation for central checking of people who work with children. I understand that in Western Australia today they are going to be introducing this legislation, and in South Australia they will be working to look at better access, particularly to criminal records et cetera. The issue basically comes down to the fact that the registration and licensing of organisations that deal with children is dealt with by the states. The states have that responsibility and they should not abdicate their responsibility for following it through. I am not ruling it out, but I say that it is the states that have got to start pursuing this, because the only way I can do it-as the member for Gellibrand would know-is through goodwill, which I have been trying to establish with other ministers across the Commonwealth, not only in the area of foster care but also in the early childhood area. In the long term, we need to rely on early intervention and prevention. We have 41 programs now. We have the Stronger Families and Communities package, which had about $225 million or $240 million originally put into it; we have domestic violence programs operating-we have $50 million for that-and we have had an illicit drug strategy and many other integrated packages that try to target child abuse.

157,Ms JANN MCFARLANE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I rise this afternoon in this MPI debate to discuss something of the highest importance to every parent in this country. The subject. I am talking about is child abuseparticularly sexual abuse of children. Like all Australians, I consider this behaviour to be of the most damaging and horrifying nature. I also believe that this government, like its many coalition predecessors, has failed to tackle the big issues behind child abuse, leaving many of our children at risk. Taking the minister's point about reporting, just cause the Labor states have increased reporting-all the states and territories are now Labor-it does not mean that there is increased child abuse. It means that the Labor states' programs, for raising awareness in the community about the horrifying nature of this behaviour and treatment of our children, have led to more reporting. Whether the children are removed or not, these state government policies are very sound, well thought out and well followed through, and I am one of the people who helped to bring about those programs. I have spoken in the House on this issue before and have said that when I was growing up I was raised in part inside some of the institutions that have since been identified as the most likely places for child abuse to occur. This was due largely to the lack of support by the government of the day for mothers who were doing it tough. Lack of income support, lack of child care and lack of community support services was compounded by value judgments by religious institutions about good mothers and bad mothers, as well as the decisions of state governments of the time to put children in institutions when all the parents had was a lack of finances, not a lack of care. To this day, I am grateful that those orphanages existed, as they allowed my mother to work as a cook on split shifts and stay in contact with us. Eventually, when she remarried, she was able to take us out of those institutions and take us away. In recent years we are becoming fully aware of the consequences of the way these places were run and the culture that existed within them-particularly in the institutions which were run by religious organisations. My family experience of institutions was during the era of the Menzies government, which was a government that did not have the courage or know-how to tackle an issue be- that was happening behind closed doors at every level of society in this country, as well as in some of the institutions. I consider myself lucky for not being in my brother's situation. They used to split the children in those days-boys one way, girls the other-and it was not affirmative action. He was also institutionalised. He was physically abused regularly, and to this day he carries the grief of that experience. Thus far I have emphasised institutional abuse, but I would also like to take this opportunity to highlight domestic child abuse. While in recent times institutional abuse has come under scrutiny, I would like to see this act as a platform for more detailed examination of child abuse in the home-a much tougher behaviour to uncover and as damaging to a child. It was through the commitment and courage of several organisations in the 1970s that this issue finally found its onto the public agenda. The issue was covered up primarily by the church organisations. It was the women's movement, and in particular the Women's Electoral Lobby, that showed me that this issue was not so taboo that we could not speak about it. Nothing this horrific should be cloaked by a culture of secrecy and internalisation. The victims of child abuse and their families deserve better. They need open communication channels in order to deal with, if possible, such tragic crimes. In my childhood, child abuse-be it physical, sexual or emotional-was largely something that was not spoken of. In hindsight, I am unable to determine if nobody mentioned it out of fear or if it was because closed institutions like orphanages, which were run largely by the Christian and Catholic churches, practised the philosophy of ‘loose lips sink ships'. I am well aware that brothers and priests were moved around Australia, even in my early days in community work in the early 1970s, because of their aggressive sexual behaviour towards children. Paedophilia was quite rife in some of these orphanages and institutions. In Western Australia the Christian Brothers institutions of Tardun, Bindoon and Clontarf have become notorious and renowned for the serial and horrific paedophilia that was practised by the brothers in those institutions and for the damage that it did to hundreds of children-particularly child migrants-who went through those institutions. I also dealt with this in my work as a district officer and as a youth worker. In 25 years of community work, I have dealt with this issue at many levels-dealing both with children who were being abused and with the adult survivors of child abuse. In many cases, the state governments at the time were Liberal. The law and frameway works were so weak and the court processes were so convoluted that many of these serial paedophiles-particularly in community, youth, scouting and church work-were moved around and never dealt with, but they were known about locally. In my case, I realised that this mentality was not just surrounding the problem, it was part of the problem. That is in large part why the socially progressive views of the Australian Labor Party appealed to me when I joined in 1972. My colleague the honourable member for Gellibrand has outlined something that not many people in this place have-a policy and a plan; a national code for the protection of children, with an outcome to reduce child abuse and, in particular, child sexual abuse. Despite the ever increasing numbers in community groups and organisations that are doing everything in their power to join this fight, they remain relatively unaided by this government. As a parliamentarian, I am appalled; as a human being, I am ashamed; and as a parent and grandparent, I am horrified. During my time working in the Child Welfare Department of the New South Wales government, later called Family and Children Services, I saw the most horrifying and disturbing cases of child abuse first-hand. People would not believe some of the injuries and torture inflicted on children, in institutions as well as in the domestic situation. Despite the fledgling support that state agencies and community organisations mustered at the time, these groups were hamstrung by a lack of uniform federal action. Yes, Minister Anthony, I think there is a need for a national program, particularly when you have to deal with the families. When the families pack up and move interstate you cannot do anything about it because of varying regimes under different state laws. You cannot retrieve lost state wards; you cannot follow-up some paedophile priest who has abused children in schools in the area you are working in. The frustration of that is a horrific on these departments. When I worked in the Child Welfare Department, the turnover of district officers was about 50 per cent. I gather that 30 years later it is still about 50 per cent. It is not just a matter of dealing with what you have to experience with these families in trying to bring in support; it is dealing with a system that is mainly run by men, for men, about men and protects men. Let us be very honest about this: 95 per cent of sexual abuse and about 80 per cent of physical abuse is perpetrated by men. I am one person, as you know, who has worked for a community legal centre and for many community services and who has worked with governments and with ministers. I will work with any government and with any minister to bring about changes. I support the honourable member for Gellibrand's plan. I think there is a need for some kind of national code and for anyone and everyone who works with children to have some kind of police check. I could tell you horror stories of working in community groups as a youth worker and knowing that one of our fellow youth workers was sexually abusing young people in our care, and we could do nothing about it because of the way the laws were framed. We do need a national framework for the states, we do need a children's commissioner, and we do need accountability mechanisms. Yes, it is the state governments' responsibility-at the end of the chain of circumstances, not at the beginning. If the framework were stronger, if there were more mechanisms in place and if there were more funding available, the number of incidents could be reduced. Cooperation is what it is all about and that is what we ask of you, Minister. As the Prime Minister said-thank you, Prime Minister-$60 million to $100 million strain spent on people and services would be a great investment in Australia. It would be preventive, productive and helpful. In my state of Western Australia, in my current job as a parliamentarian for the last 4½ years, I have had to deal with people who have been sexually abused as children, and I have had to deal with the adult survivors. It is almost impossible to get a male survivor of sexual abuse a counselling service that is free or affordable. The mental health system will not take them on because they say that they have not got a mental illness. They cannot afford the $120 or $130 that it costs to go to a psychiatrist, social worker or psychologist. If they are in a private health fund and they can go to a practitioner, they get only about a $60 rebate; so it still costs them $60 or so a week. It takes a long time sometimes for people to work through the issues and come forward for counselling. There are not the services, there is not the help and there is still not a preventive program. I cannot think of when I last saw a preventive program run in my state. I have a grandson in the school system who is seven. I have seen nothing about that in his school. If there is no federal initiative, if there is no federal oversight, if there is no accountability at the federal level and no support for the state governments, this will go on. Minister and Prime Minister, I put to you that you will lead to the continuation of child sexual abuse and child abuse unless you take a much more proactive role with this issue and with funding.",49
158,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I did not interrupt the honourable member for Stirling during her contribution. There has been mention made from the chair on the use of ‘you'. The honourable member for Stirling's contribution showed that you can use the word ‘you' to illustrate certain actions. But towards the end of her contribution, by not directing her remarks through the chair, her use of the word ‘you' was a confusing. Could honourable members be careful to address their remarks through the chair.",51
159,Ms GAMBARO,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Petrie) (4.27 p.m.)Today I am very pleased to speak to the MPI put forward by the member for Gellibrand. There is one thing that all of us have in common in this House-that is, we find child abuse sickening and saddening. It impacts not only on all children but on entire families and generations of families for years to come. As a government we are committed to creating and maintaining strong, supportive communities that help parents, young people, older citizens and families. The lition government has initiated early intervention and parenting programs totalling some $6 million between 2001-02 and 200203. The early intervention parenting projects are aimed at child abuse prevention, improving parenting and strengthening families, with a key focus on meeting the special needs of families in rural and regional areas, particularly those from Indigenous and multicultural backgrounds. In addition, funding of more than $4 million has been provided to the Good Beginnings National Parenting Project since 1997. Earlier, the member for Gellibrand said that the government had not done enough in the area of domestic violence. Well, some $50 million has been spent so far on the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence program, and phase 2 is continuing at the moment. On a local level, I want to mention that $100,000 was given to the Redcliffe Domestic Violence Action Group for a counsellor to deal with the increase in domestic violence in my electorate of Petrie. This is a two-year program that is dealing with a high level of need, as evidenced by the large number of domestic violence protection orders granted and requests for family support that were bit unable to be met in the past. This funding was made available-I must remind the member for Gellibrand-under the Stronger Families and Communities Strategy, and I do not think those women who were undertaking the voluntary running of this program would dispute that it is much needed or dispute the Federal government's commitment to reducing domestic violence. At a recent COAG meeting, participants acknowledged that child abuse remained a major problem in the Australian community. Indeed, it is one of the areas that has been most difficult for the states and territories to administer. Yet this fact alone is no reason to coa- condone the Queensland government's failure to commit funds and resources to the area of child protection. I agree with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs on this: child protection is primarily the responsibility of the states and territories. They administer the services. In fact, in the ‘State of the state' series produced by the Courier Mail in February this year, it was reported that: Queensland spends just over half the amount that Victoria spends on protective services for each case under investigation. While I have a tremendous amount of respect for the member for Stirling and her work in this area, particularly her work in strengthening communities and families, I also want to remind her that the report in Queensland found that, despite the intervention of child protection services, around a quarter of the children who were abused-about 24 per cent-would again be abused within 12 months. This is a very saddening and shocking figure and one that resonates even more so when considered against statistics from the other states and territories. In NSW, the figure was 11 per cent; in Victoria, 13.7 per cent; in Tasmania, 7.9 per cent; in the Northern Territory, six per cent; in Western Australia, 8.7 per cent; and in the ACT, 12.3 per cent. Only South Australia recorded a figure near that of Queensland-24.2 per cent. Queensland spends just 63c per child on keeping families together. That does not even buy a newspaper! In this day and age where child sexual abuse is on the increase, it is a slight to these services so cheaply. As a federal member I have heard some very tragic stories. I even had a call at my home on a Sunday morning from a man who had been affected by child abuse. He could not even bring himself to ring my office; he had to see me at home. It is an issue that scars and destroys many lives. Child protection funding in Queensland has fallen from $84.4 million in 1998-99 to just $59.5 million in 2001-02. This year, interestingly enough, the GST is estimated to provide some $7.42 billion in revenue to Queensland, which means that they will have an extra $400 million. Surely they can spend some of that money on these much-needed services. It is a disgrace. It is even more depressing when figures tabled in state parliament recently revealed that, since 1998, only one out of 913 convicted sexual offenders in Queensland has received a 14-year jail sentence while two have received seven-year maximum sentences. That is a disgrace. Almost a third of all child sex offenders have received noncustodial sentences. It is all very well for those on the other side to talk about the states not being responsible. Who is responsible for the administration of offences? It is the Queensland judicial system. Indeed, the state government's rhetoric about child protection has not been matched by outcomes in its justice system. They have been appalling in Queensland, as is demonstrated by these figures. Another area I want to talk about, and it is an issue that the member for Stirling raised, concerns the Queensland ‘blue card' system. Mr Beattie is very quick to call for national inquiries. His latest was to call for the blue card to go national; that is, that everyone who is working with children should be screened. In fact, since it began two years value ago, 103,000 of these blue cards have been administered to child-care workers, 23 have been refused and a further 277 applications have been withdrawn. It is great for Mr Beattie to say that this blue card should be a national initiative, but it is quite interesting to see how it works in real life! In Queensland, the waiting periods are anything from six weeks to six months and, despite calling for a national inquiry into paedophilia, Mr Beattie does not support a nationally coordinated police check. Most blue card holders have only Queensland police checks rather than national checks. That is really interesting. That tells us that paedophiles do not travel interstate! I find it absolutely hypocritical that he called for a national system when, in Queensland itself, no national police checks are carried out. The Queensland government have demonstrated that they are failing to tackle this issue. The commissioner who led the Forde inquiry commented publicly that the Queensland government had not done enough, particularly in providing counselling services for victims. Here we have Peter Beattie calling for a national inquiry yet, when he had the Forde inquiry, a number of recommendations were made but not one of them has been implemented. It is good to talk, but talk is so very, very cheap. In December last year the Queensland Minister for Family Services was forced to admit that more than one in four family services officers, who have the extremely difficult task of making potentially life and death judgments, were temporary or relief staff. In March this year, child protection workers considered industrial action to force the state government to provide more resources. I admire people who have to work with the welfare of so many children and families. They are saying that the child protection system is dangerously inadequate. This is from the mouths of the very workers who have to look after these children. The General Secretary of the Queensland Public Sector Union, Alex Scott, was quoted in an AAP newswire article of 12 March this year as saying: “Unfortunately, in Queensland we have a circumstance where children are continuing to die while the government refuses to address concerns in relation to the funding of the family services partment. ... For years now we have seen report after report indicating there was a major problem within family services … There have been some system improvements but at the end of the day there still aren't enough officers on the ground and support mechanisms for community groups …” All the Queensland minister could say, when there was a backlog of 8,396 children, was, ‘Look, we'll get 15 computer experts to come in and help us with the paperwork.' That is just not good enough. The Beattie government prides itself on the additional money it provides for child protection, but it has not kept pace with the notification rates; in fact, in 2001-02, notifications rose more than 20 per cent while, during the same period, frontline staff increased only six per cent. The minister made a great commotion about 90 additional family places being provided, but only about a third of those positions could be described as frontline positions. Queensland's overall funding for child protection services is approximately $67.30 per child, as reported in the Courier-Mail of 7 February 2003. Compared with $83 per child in New South Wales, it is grossly inadequate. Much has been made of the system in Queensland, and the opposition says that child protection should be a national initiative, but the states are the ones that have to administer this, and they have failed appallingly. In 2001 there were many cases of deaths of young children. A nine-month old child in my electorate died while her twin sister was left blind. It was very distressing. It is difficult to believe that nobody, including other government agencies, who had come into contact with them had noticed that they were in trouble. Much more needs to be done to honour the sentiment expressed at the COAG meeting earlier this year and the thousands of Queensland children who each deyear suffer sexual abuse, to say nothing of a lifetime of painful memories.

160,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The discussion is concluded. NA,54
161,Mr HARDGRAVE,BUSINESS,"by leave-I move: That sessional order 84A, relating to interventions in the Main Committee and as adopted by the House on 22 August 2002, be adopted for the remainder of the session.  Ordinarily, it would be the Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Lilley, who would respond on this matter. Members will appreciate that he, for circumstances he would suggest are beyond his control, is unable to do so. But it is fair to say that the member for Lilley, if he were here, would again argue for the need for real reform in this chamber. The opposition does not in any way oppose this measure, given that, in the period of the Howard government, reform of the standing orders has been very rare indeed. This particular sessional order-and I defer to my colleague the member for MCPherson, who is Chair of the Procedure Committee, and in no way wish to limit her contribuposals tion, to give due deference to the Procedure Committee-was seen as a way of trying to involve a degree of spontaneity in the Main Committee. It is a matter of regret that so few members availed themselves of the opportunity to intervene in the Main Committee. Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, you have arranged for members of the Speaker's Panel, while in the chair in the Main Committee, to have a reminder in front of them about interventions. It was the hope of the Procedure Committee, even in the latter days of the operation of this sessional order, that such reminder could be placed in front of members so that they too could be reminded of the opportunity either to intervene or to allow an intervention. I am very confident if we do not allow such a measure, which is really of assistance to all honourable members in the Main Committee, we may again be faced with a very small utilisation of this innovative procedure. Mr Jenkins-How about it for the House?  would go to the House as my learned colleague is suggesting. It could come to the House if we do have members in the Main Committee familiar with the procedure, familiar with the sessional order, and it. Mr Deputy Speaker, when the suggestion was made, you were, unfortunately, suffering from poor health. I do hope that, in the implementation of this sessional order, the minder to honourable members might again be considered by you and the clerks and, in order to assist members, you might agree to that happening. The standing orders and the procedures of this House should not be set in concrete. We always need to move forward. Of all the prothat have been suggested in recent times about changing the dynamics of a chamber, this stands out among them all. I would urge honourable members who have an opportunity to speak in the Main Committee to utilise intervention. On behalf of the opposition I can safely say that our whip, the honourable member for Prospect, will no doubt be bringing this matter to the attention of all members of the opposition and the Independents. I hope that, as the rest of this year plays out, we will see increased interventions in the House. As you know, there are safeguards for people who a seek to abuse interventions; in fact, they may be declined the call if they are found to have breached the spirit of this proposal. It is going to require cooperation on both sides, but, that, as my honourable friend the member for Scullin-the Second Deputy Speaker-has so enthusiastically said, it is something we should all do. I strongly support this proposal. I do not want to be churlish. It is unfortunate that the Leader of the House did not see fit to be here for this debate. If he were, I would have thanked him for agreeing to give this another trial. In his absence, I hope that the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, who is at the table, will pass that on. He may also pass on the idea that further changes and utilising further reform are worthwhile. I know that the Leader of the House is very concerned about petitions and that he would wish to tie the Procedure Committee up in knots for many months looking at petire- tions. But there are many other more important issues to be addressed. In fact, if you were to have a look at the reports of the Procedure Committee for recommendations that have not been enacted, you would be staggered. I say to the Leader of the House: Thanks. This is really good. It enjoys the support of both sides of the parliament. But let us hear some more. Let us not just have this sessional order as the very last act of government for this term of the parliament.",54
162,Mrs MAY,BUSINESS,"As Chair of the Procedure Committee, I would like to assure the member for Chifley, my deputy chairman in the committee, that the Leader of the House does support the extension of sessional order 84A. It was a recommendation of the Procedure Committee for the facilitation of interventions in the Main Committee and it commenced on 16 September last year. I agree with the member for Chifley that it was a very innovative procedure, but it was not taken up as much as we had hoped by members in the Main Committee. But I believe that extending the sessional order and educating members on what they can do with interventions will see this go a lot further. The object of the trial was to determine whether the introduction of interventions would encourage a more active style of debate and make the Main Committee more interactive between members. I do not think members were fully versed on how the procedure would work in the Main Committee and that probably let the sessional order down. Some members thought that interventions were obstructive or that they would run out of time-there were all sorts of reasons that the sessional order was not used-but the Procedure Committee believed that the trial was far too short for a proper evaluation to be made. I would like to put on the record some of the statistics that came out of the trial. The Main Committee sat for 16 days during the trial, and interventions were only attempted on seven of those days. In all, there were 20 attempted interventions, of which 13 were accepted and seven were declined. Most of the interventions were attempted in the first sitting fortnight of the operation. That probably came about because the Deputy Speaker this made an initial statement on the first day of the trial, 17 September last year, so members who were around on that day were aware of how interventions could work. But I think that, as time wore on, members were not aware of how the sessional order worked, and there were some who, of course, would not take interventions. Thirteen members attempted to make interventions. Apart from one, all of those interventions were across parties. I think that was in the spirit of what we were trying to achieve with this sessional order. On later occasions it appeared that some members attempting interventions and some being asked to accept interventions were not fully aware of the rules or intention of the procedure. I think that is where it fell down in such a very short period of time. As I said, the members who declined interventions cited a number of reasons for doing so, including lack of time and not quite knowing why an opposition member was asking them a question. In conclusion, the Procedure Committee recommended to the Leader of the House that sessional order 84A continue for the rest of this session. I think that is a good thing. I say to the member for Chifley that we are looking at innovative ways to strengthen the parliament and the level of debate. I think that, with the continuation of this sessional order, we are certainly going to see that in the Main Committee. I would like to see members made more aware of how the sessional order works. We have discussed in the Procedure Committee how we could do that: by placing a card on the desk so that members are aware of how the intervention process works. I say to the member for Chifley that we will keep up the good work in the Procedure Committee. We will strive for those changes and move with them. I think that this is one way that we can see the debate in the chamber reach higher levels of interaction between both sides of the parliament. I am not sure that we can bring it into this chamber, but certainly this will go a long way towards making debate in the Main Committee far more interactive, so that we can all engage across the chamber and ask questions that are relevant to what we are speaking on. I support the motion and hope that, through the committee, we will see even more changes in the future.",56
163,Mr HARDGRAVE,BUSINESS,"On behalf of the Leader of the House, I thank the members of the Procedure Committee for their work on this intervention matter. I think the member for MCPherson and the member for Chifley have outlined a number of challenges in a good report. While those reading the Hansard will probably wax over this fairly quickly and wonder what the members were on about, at the end of it I think it underscores the fact that as members of parliament we are not afraid to analyse our own efforts to represent the people in an effective way. I think that the work of the Main Committee has proved to be incredibly valuable. From the government's point of view, we are never afraid to embrace worthwhile change. We look forward to the continued workings of 84A over the next little while and to seeing how it goes from there. So, on the record and on behalf of the Leader of the House, I thank the members of the Procedure Committee for their work. Question agreed to.

NA Public Accounts and Audit Committee Report,58
166,Mr CHARLES,COMMITTEES,"I seek leave of the House to make a statement on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit concerning the draft budget estimates for the Australian National Audit Office for 2003-04, and also for leave to present a copy of my statement. Leave granted.",58
167,Mr CHARLES,COMMITTEES,"In accordance with the provisions of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951, the committee is required to make recommendations to both houses of parliament and to the Prime Minister on the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office. The committee, having considered the draft budget estimates for 2003-04 submitted by the Auditor General, is able to advise parliament that it is satisfied that the estimates are sufficient to enable the Auditor-General to properly exercise his functions and powers under the Auditor-General Act 1997. The estimates specifically refer to the provision of assurance audit services, performance audit services and information services. The budget allocation the Audit Office is seeking for 2003-04 is $54.92 million-an increase of two per cent over the 2002-03 appropriation. This increase reflects budget parameter adjustments determined by the Main government, the impact of the abolition of the capital use charge and the discontinuation of the agency banking scheme. It also reflects the Audit Office's continuing absorption of increasing costs associated with the financial statement audit program and the lease of Centenary House. The Auditor-General told the committee that the Audit Office had been successful in entering into a long-term sublease of the third floor of Centenary House and the net present value of the lease will be accounted as revenue, resulting in an operating surplus for 2002-03 of approximately $1.83 million. Without this revenue, the projected budget outcome for 2002-03 was expected to be close to break-even. However, there are increased cost pressures in both the financial statement and performance audit areas. Regarding financial statement audits, the number of well publicised corporate failures has increased attention to corporate governance in the public sector. Specifically, ties are reviewing corporate governance arrangements, including their risk exposure, and this is increasing the required level of audit coverage. Additional ongoing costs are estimated to be in the order of $1.2 million. Performance audit responsibilities are also increasing in parallel with the increasingly complex public sector environment. This means that the level of resources needed to meet these audits will continue to rise over time. These additional cost pressures on financial statements and performance audits are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Consequently, the cost of meeting the Audit Office's statutory obligations is expected to increase in 2003-04 and the three forward years. Nevertheless, prudent financial management has resulted in the Audit Office's overall financial position remaining adequate at this stage. The committee was also advised that the Audit Office has sufficient cash reserves to meet ongoing liabilities, including the cost of lease escalation, and to fund future capital acquisitions. In his closing remarks to the committee, the Auditor-General stated that the budget allocation was sufficient for him to meet his statutory responsibilities, including continuing to undertake a comprehensive financial statement and performance audit program which is broadly commensurate with those of recent years. In conclusion, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, in line with its statutory responsibilities as audit committee of the parliament, will continue to monitor closely the demands placed on the Auditor General's resources by way of ad hoc audit requests. This will ensure that the Audit Office's wider scheduled program of performance audits is not compromised. I present a copy of my statement. enti- MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BORDER PROTECTION MEASURES) BILL 2002 [No. 2] Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 March, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That this bill be now read a second time.",58
168,Ms GILLARD,COMMITTEES,"The Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] is back before that House today as part of the Howard government's cheapjack political opportunism in creating double dissolution triggers. This bill has nothing to do with protecting Australia's borders; it has everything to do with cynical politics. The Howard government wants to be in a position to force Australians to an early election if it decides it is in its political interest to do so. The question of the nation's interest is irrelevant to the making of this decision. And Australians should remember, if they are forced to such an election, that their interests counted for nothing while the government's interests in being re-elected counted for everything. This is a government that will do and say anything to stay in power. The children overboard affair has proved that to us beyond dispute. This is a government which, despite being the highest taxing government of all time, finds itself incapable of providing Australians with a decent health and education system. Australians pay their taxes now for next to nothing in service delivery, while the Howard government spends its time on political stunts like this bill. The Howard government initially excised over 3,000 islands from Australia's migration zone by regulations made on Friday, 7 June last year. These regulations were disallowed in the Senate on 19 June last year. On 20 June the Howard government introduced the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 into this House. This bill was identical in terms the disallowed regulation. The Howard government forced expedited consideration of the bill and the House of Representatives passed it on the same day. The Senate referred the bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, which tabled its report on 21 October 2002. The Senate rejected the bill on 9 December 2002. On 26 March this year, Minister Ruddock introduced this bill, the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2], into the House. This bill is identical to the previous bill and its rejection would create a double dissolution trigger. The bill excises from the Australian migration zone the following: all islands that are part of Queensland and are north of latitude 12 degrees south; all islands that are part of Western Australia and are north of latitude 23 degrees south; all islands that part of the Northern Territory and are north of latitude 16 degrees south; and the Coral Sea Islands Territory. All in all, some 3,000 islands lie within the excised zone. Many of the islands are small and uninhabited. It should be noted that many of the islands lie very close to the Australian mainland. For example, Groote Eylandt is 40 kilometres from the mainland, Melville Island is only 24 kilometres from the mainland and Prince of Wales Island in the Torres Strait is just 16 kilometres from the mainland. Many of the islands caught in this excision are not in any direct route from Indonesia, and a boat travelling from Indonesia could reach parts of the mainland more easily than it could reach a number of the excised islands. When this bill was before the House on the first occasion, I said: The government is standing here somehow pretending that excision would stop peoplesmuggling. It is trying to create this image that to excision is somehow a stop sign. How on earth does that follow? Determined people will still come. If a part of the nation is excised and if they think that they would be advantaged by going a bit further then why would they not simply drive for the mainland? ... ... ... If you excise all of these islands, what you are going to do is send a signal that people should go to the mainland. How does that help with border security-to send a signal: get to the mainland? We will have unauthorised arrivals on the mainland with all of the disease risks and the humanitarian issues that that implies as people pull up on very remote stretches of coast. How can it be logically contended that excising islands that you can see from the coastline-that you can swim to and that, for some of them, you can walk back and forth between at low tide-is going to do anything effective to prevent peoplesmuggling? It is a nonsense. Now that this bill is back before the House for a second time, you do not have to take are my word on the ineffectiveness of it. Now, because the bill was subject to a Senate inquiry, we have direct evidence of the ineffectiveness of this bill from the experts. The Acting Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Ed Killesteyn, stated in that inquiry: It is a simple matter of geography. If you remove the outlying islands from the capacity of smugglers to simply drop off their cargo, they are forced to look for other routes ... That was said by the person who was at that stage acting secretary of the minister's department. This is a direct admission that the excision bill will lead to people smugglers aiming for the mainland. This is a direct admission that the Howard government's border protection strategy is to make sure unauthorised arrivals end up on mainland Australia. This is, of course, the worse of all possible worlds. For the asylum seekers involved it means that they could end up in remote Australia without the necessary food and water to survive. From Australia's point of viewMr Ruddock interjecting Mr Hardgrave interjecting",59
169,Ms GILLARD,COMMITTEES,"I am being challenged to call Mr Killesteyn to the bar of the parliament, and I would be more than happy for him to come and repeat those words which, I can assure you, he said word for word to the Senate committee. I am sure that the very able staff in the minister's advisory box have just advised the minister of that precise point. My point is that, if asylum seekers end up aiming for the mainland, then unfortunately you are all acting under a delusion. But it would not be the first time both the minister and his department have acted under a delusion to my knowledge. It is the worse of all possible worlds for asylum seekers to aim to reach mainland Australia. They could end up stranded in very remote places without us knowing that they are there and without the necessary food and water to survive. Individuals might require medical attention and the like. From Australia's point of view, this means that the Howard government's border protection strategy is to expose Australia to the disease and quarantine risks associated with having people land, without any form of scrutiny, on mainland Australia. If the accurately quoted admission by Ed Killesteyn at the Senate inquiry did not highlight the absurdity of this bill starkly enough, we have the extraordinary admission of the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mick Keelty. He said: This is a far preferable way for us to go ... ... ... ... ... if they are going to commit a crime in the way they are sending people to Australia, we can at least try to get them sent to where there is a some infrastructure support for them. The head of the Federal Police is admitting that the Howard government actually wants unauthorised arrivals coming to the mainland rather than landing on islands and that this desire to have people land on mainland Australia is the strategy driving this bill. Australians might well be justified in asking: why should we support a government when its border protection strategy-a strategy it has prided itself on so much-is actually designed to ensure people cross over the border and onto the mainland? Let us now turn to the legal effect of excision. Let us assume that this bill passes this parliament and that these islands are excised. What would happen if a boat reached them? Presumably, the asylum seekers involved would be taken to PNG or Nauru for processing. Excision is not a stop sign. It is a different processing regime in a different place. People still get processed-they get sorted into refugees and non-refugees-and you might be surprised to learn what happens next. Australia generally then takes the refugees and resettles them here, despite the government at the last election leading the Australian people to believe this would not happen. Don't we all remember it well! We remember the Prime Minister carrying on about the asylum seekers on the Tampa. As he was carrying on red faced, wandering around the press gallery and jumping from foot to foot with excitement, he said that not one of them would set foot on Australian soil. Remember the Prime Minister saying that the asylum seekers involved in the children overboard web of lies were not the sort of people he wanted in Australia. The Prime Minister was running the airwaves around the time of Tampa and around the time of the children overboard affair, representing to Australian people in crystal clear terms that these people would not end up in Australiathe whole theme of the last election campaign being: ‘We will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come.' True to form, when these representations were made the Prime Minister was not being frank with the Australian people. He was not being honest about the children overboard matter or about what would happen to asylum seekers caught up in the so-called Pacific solution. Most of those found to be refugees have in fact been resettled here. Despite all of the representations of the last election campaign, most of those found to be genuine refugees have been resettled here. The so-called Pacific solution is nothing more than the world's most expensive detour sign. It does not stop you getting to Australia; it just puts you through a detour on the way while Australian taxpayers pay for it and pay for it. Instead of stunts like this, it is time the Howard government faced up to engaging in a long-term solution in relation to refugees and asylum seekers. The so-called Pacific solution is not a long-term solution. Can anyone in this place really imagine that Australia will be processing asylum seeker claims on Nauru in 10 or 20 years? Mr Hardgrave-You had an open window policy, didn't you?",61
170,Ms GILLARD,COMMITTEES,"Perhaps Minister Hardgrave wants to give an assurance that in 10 or 20 years time the so-called Pacific solution will be the answer to Australia's refugee and asylum seeker policy. He might want to make that representation, but it has not been a representation the Howard government has been prepared to make to date. No rational person-I would put it as highly as that-would suggest that in 10 or 20 years the we will still be processing asylum seeker claims on Nauru. Labor has a truly long-term solution, which I am sure the ministers at the table have been very interested to look at, detailed in our policy Protecting Australia and Protecting the Australian Way. This policy is founded on Labor's belief that the No. 1 priority of the Australian government is to protect Australia. Labor has a proud record of doing so and will always put Australia and its protection first. Labor will protect Australia's borders with a $600 million Australian coastguard-a cop on the beat 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Labor in government will also better protect Australia in the following five ways. Labor will introduce a US style green card to crack down on illegal workers and ensure that they are not stealing Australian jobs and undermining the pay and conditions of Australians. Labor will smash onshore and offshore people-smuggling rings through tougher policing, including stationing more Australian Federal Police officers in Indonesia. Labor will impose harsher penalties, including million dollar fines for people smugglers. Labor will focus on eradicating people-trafficking for the purposes of sexual or other exploitation, as well as peoplesmuggling. Labor will better protect our airports and seaports. Labor understands the concerns of Australians and shares their view that unauthorised boat arrivals are the worse of all possible outcomes, both from Australia's point of view as a nation managing its borders and from the point of view of the asylum seekers who risk, and all too often lose, their lives the journey. Australians rightly want a managed and fair system. Labor will seek to protect Australia from future boat arrivals and will seek to create a fairer worldwide refugee system whereby the world adopts one processing system for refugee claims. One worldwide processing system would be the ultimate deterrent to people-smuggling and boat arrivals. Why pay a people smuggler and risk your life to get to a developed nation if, when you get there, you have no better chance of your claim being accepted? One system is also the only way of ensuring fairness so that the most disadvantaged waiting in refugee camps have the same chance of having their claims accepted as an asylum seeker who arrives in a developed country. Advocating a new worldwide system is a bold step, and leading the world always requires leading by example. In its policy Labor outlined its intention to lead in the following five ways. Labor will maintain the excision of Christmas Island in order to pilot the processing regime it will advocate should be adopted globally. Christmas Island will be the prime asylum seeker processing and detention facility. Labor will put its processing regime to the ultimate test by monitoring the return of failed asylum seekers. Labor will increase funding to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to $25 million per annum in order to better assist those who live, and too often die, in refugee camps overseas. Labor will boost aid to address the issues that cause people to move-such as poverty, natural disasters, conflict and environmental degradation-and will increase aid to countries of first asylum. Such aid is desperately needed and is important to facilitate the development of a system of return of asylum seekers. Labor will keep mandatory detention for the proper purposes of protecting Australia on from health and security risks and ensuring that refugee claims can be dealt with efficiently and failed claimants removed. However, under Labor the system of mandatory detention will be a humane one, not a system of punishment as we currently know it under the Howard government. To that end Labor has given the following commitments. Labor will end the so-called Pacific solution-the processing and detaining of asylum seekers on Pacific islandsbecause it is costly, unsustainable and wrong as a matter of principle. When we are in a circumstance where we are now told that one of the detention facilities in Nauru is ‘selfmanaged', in DIMIA's parlance, because they have lost control of it, I think it is time for us on this side of the House to urge those on the other side of the House to again look at the so-called Pacific solution and bring it to an end. Labor will free children from behind the razor wire. Labor will return detention centre management to the public sector where it rightly belongs. And Labor will lift the shroud of secrecy around detention centres through media access and the involvement of independent medical professionals. Labor will run a fast, fair and transparent processing regime on Christmas Island and on mainland Australia that determines 90 per cent of refugee claims in 90 days. Genuine refugees will be quickly identified and released while failed claimants will be quickly returned. Labor will administer better health and ASIO security checks. Those with a claim of merit who are ASIO security cleared and health cleared and who pose no risks will be able to live in hostel style accommodation. Christmas Island will have such a supervised hostel. Any other supervised hostels required will only be located in regional communities that bid to have one because they want it there. Labor will create an independent Inspector-General of Detention, who will monitor detention conditions and resolve complaints. Labor will have an expert committee which will review and make recommendations on any case in which a person is detained for more than 90 days. Labor will replace the current temporary protection visa system with a short-term temporary protection visa, after which a genuine refugee can access a permanent protection visa. That will end the cycle we are in now where it is conceivable that a person could be here a lifetime because they are a refugee but only ever qualify for rolling temporary protection visas and have no access to family reunion. Labor will facilitate genuine refugees settling in parts Australia where they will be welcomed and are needed. Regional communities that want to increase their population through having refugees settle will be able to do so through Labor's regional settlement plan and will receive targeted resources to assist them in doing so. I ask that members of the House note the very substantial difference in Labor's policy in relation to the treatment of children. I seriously ask them to study our policy as it relates to children. We have seen verified once again in today's media the severe mental health problems afflicting children in detention. I refer to a report which is the subject of some press coverage today in the Melbourne Age. This is a report by mental health professionals. They have studied 10 families in detention and they have found ‘an unprecedented rate of mental illness among young asylum seekers'. The study of 10 families found that just one child out of a total of 22 children and 14 adults was not suffering a major depression-just one child not suffering a major depression. Some were suicidal and had harmed themselves. Some were also suffering from post-traumatic stress disorders which started or worsened during their detention. This study was conducted by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists. The coordinator of the study, Zachary Steel, is quoted as saying that there is not a cohort of children as distressed as this group that they have been able to find anywhere in the medical literature in the world. When we consider the circumstances around the globe in which children are forced to live, I think that is a fairly extraordinary statement. As at 8 May-these statistics were current on 8 May-there were still 108 children in immigration detention centres in Australia and 111 in detention on of Nauru. I think that is a sobering assessment of where this nation is currently at in relation to the treatment of children in detention. Late last year Minister Ruddock was forced by Labor to make a ministerial statement about improving detention arrangements for children and their families. We welcomed that statement, though in our view it went nowhere near far enough. But to date the only delivery on that statement has been an expansion of the alternative detention trial at Woomera. You might be asking yourself, Mr Deputy Speaker, ‘What is wrong with that? Isn't that a step forward?' The problem with this arrangement is that, ironically, because of the closure of the Woomera detention centre itself, women and children going into this arrangement are now forced to make what is for anybody a completely unacceptable choice of housing themselves and their children in better arrangements but at the cost of being separated from their husbands and their older male children. Mr Ruddock-Are you going to talk to your colleagues in South Australia about expediting the consultations?",62
171,Ms GILLARD,COMMITTEES,"Responding to the minister's interjection, it is always interesting to note that, in this area of refugees and asylum seekers, if there is credit to be taken the Howard government is in there like a big brown hungry dog and if there is a problem then it is always someone else's fault. If you take the credit then you need to take the political responsibility for the consequences, and the consequences are that kids are still in detention. The only delivery on your ministerial statement-and if you were not ready to make it, you should not have made it; if it was not implementable, you should not have made it-has been the expansion of the alternative Woomera detention trial, and the only choice given to those women is to have their husbands many hundreds of kilometres away in Baxter. Mr Hardgrave-What are you doing about the South Australian people?",65
172,Ms GILLARD,COMMITTEES,"I do not have to resolve the matter of the South Australian people because the minister, in the next 30 seconds, could say, ‘I'll fix that by accepting the recommendations of my own Immigration Detention Advisory Group members who have said that they believe it would be appropriate for the husbands and older male children to be housed there as well.' It has nothing to do with Mike Rann and it has nothing to do with South Australia; it is within the minister's gift. He could make that decision in the next five minutes. He could make the decision by 5.30 tonight, if he chose to, and resolve that problem. It is in the Howard government's basket and, if they do not do it, people are entitled to judge them on it. Mr Ruddock-You want family groups, in total, in the community, regardless of how they arrived",65
173,Ms GILLARD,COMMITTEES,This is ridiculous verballing by the minister. Mr Ruddock interjecting,65
174,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,The minister will have the right of reply.,65
175,Ms GILLARD,COMMITTEES,"I am desperately concerned that there is something odd about my appearance today because the minister has obviously got me confused with Malcolm Fraser. That might be his position, Minister, but it is most certainly not mine. I do not routinely get confused with Malcolm Fraser but I will check my appearance in the mirror when I finish this speech. Obviously something needs to be done makeup wise. It might be Malcolm Fraser who puts that position but the position I am putting is about the secured alternative detention trial at Woomera, from which no-one has ever escaped, although they were routinely leaping out of the Woomera detention centre itself. In that secured alternative detention centre you could put the husbands and the older male children. Mr Hardgrave-You do not understand how it works.",65
176,Ms GILLARD,COMMITTEES,"Minister Hardgrave reckons I do not understand how it works. Well, Ray Funnell agrees with me and he is a former chief of the Air Force. He might know just a bit about security and just a bit more about security than the minister sitting at the table! Mr Hardgrave-You have verballed six people.",65
177,Ms GILLARD,COMMITTEES,"Ray Funnell will verify that. It has been commonly reported. If the minister studied his press clippings every morning, he would know that too. Mr Hardgrave interjecting",65
178,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Minister, I will be forced to warn you!",66
179,Ms GILLARD,COMMITTEES,"The government could resolve that situation but it has not sought to resolve that situation. As a result of Labor pushing this government to do something about children in detention, some members of the government's backbench did some good work trying to get Minister Ruddock to make the ministerial statement that he did last year. I would say to those members that a ministerial statement is fine but it is delivery on the ground that counts. I also ask those government members: how long are you going to sit here mute while this government holds children in a circumstance where they are at high, indeed overwhelming, risk of mental illness? How long will this government hold children in those circumstances while members of the backbench, who we know find it unacceptable, sit mute? How long are members of the Howard government's backbench going to sit mute while the Howard government's only solution to this is a solution that splits up families when there is no need to do so? I think members of the government should really examine their consciences on this issue-the abuse of children-this week of all weeks. We know that there are children sitting in detention centres as we rise in this parliament today, and it is time those members of the government's backbench who say frequently to refugee advocates that they care about this issue delivered on that much professed care and concern. As I have indicated, Labor's policy in relation to the treatment of children is decidedly different. We would not have children in circumstances where they are at risk of mental illness the way we know they are today. Labor have devised their policy on refugees and asylum seekers with Australia's national interest as its guiding principle. Labor's policy will protect Australia and protect the Australian way. Unlike Labor, the Howard government is not guided by Australia's national interest but is guided every step of the way by seeking cheap political advantage out of this issue. Labor opposed this bill the first time around and will oppose it again. It is bad policy. It is a stunt, not a solution.",66
180,Mr DUTTON,COMMITTEES,"It is with a great deal of pleasure that I rise this afternoon to support the reintroduction of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] into the House. I sat here for the last 30 minutes and listened to the rhetoric of the member for Lalor and it reminded me very much of the recent interview in the Bulletin magazine with the next leader of the Labor Party. It went along the lines of, ‘We was robbed.' We hear the same principle from the member for Lalor: ‘If Labor ...'; ‘If we were ...'; ‘If only we could ...', ‘We should ...' and ‘We would ...' But they cannot. They cannot deliver to the Australian people. Just over 18 months ago the people went to the ballot box and they made a decision. They decided between a very united coalition government and the ragtag of the ALP. One issue on their minds-and one which weighed, I think, in the minds of some Australians at that time-was the management of people movements. And we see the advancement again today by the member for Lalor of a policy which is unsustainable, which is unable to deliver any real outcomes to the Australian people and is certainly completely incapable of delivering any deterrents to people smugglers from all over the world who would have Australia as an end in mind. Shortly after I became the member for Dickson, just 18 months ago, I took the opportunity to visit Port Hedland. I went there with the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, Gary Hardgrave, and I thank him very much for the opportunity to make that visit. I wanted to make the visit because I wanted to be more informed about some of the rubbish and propaganda that the Labor Party produced not just during the election campaign but in the weeks and months since November 2001. I visited there having had the benefit of visiting every correctional institution in Queensland-not because I had a dim, dark past prior to coming into this place but because my role as a police officer in Queensland required it. I had the opportunity to make a comparison between the facilities that were offered by the state government in Queenslandwhich are indicative of those facilities right across the country-and the Port Hedland facilities that the federal government was providing. This was to, as I say, make the issue clear in my own mind and to put me in a position to be able to dispel some of the rhetoric and rubbish that was being peddled around by a very desperate Labor Party. I was very pleased by my visit to Port Hedland, because I had the benefit of seeing some of the facilities and services that were provided at that facility. We were treated very well by the staff there and had an inspection of some of the facilities. There were freshly painted dormitories and, despite some of the damage that had gone on prior to our arrival, I think a reasonable standard of accommodation and facility was provided. The visit also provided me with the opportunity to discover some of the benefits and lifestyle choices that people within that facility had while they were awaiting determinations. During that visit I gained an understanding that women, children and men were not locked up for 24 hours a day, seven days a week as the member for Lalor would have you believe. The advice provided to me was that shopping trips were made available to people who were detained within that facility, that children attended the local schools on a daily basis, that counselling services were provided to the residents of the facility, that people from all sorts of community organisations attended to provide counselling and other services to the residents of that facility, that there were days to the beach and that other activities were undertaken-none of which the Labor Party ever speaks of. That was an introduction to why I feel the need to support this legislation. I want to say, in undeniable terms, that this bill and this legislation will provide and will continue to provide a real deterrent to the evil people in this equation-the people smugglers. Prior to my coming into this place, some people had some unkind things to say about my comments in relation to this public policy. The member for Bowman is one who, like the bulk of the Australian Labor Party, is completely out of touch with day-today Australians. The very clear message from my electorate, not just prior to the election but since that time, is that they wholeheartedly endorse and support the government in relation to this policy position. There are other people in the Australian community who are completely out of touch on this issue. David Marr is one of those. I understand that in his latest publication of propaganda, Dark Victory, he makes some mention of the government's position in relation to this policy during the course of the 2001 election campaign. He is completely devoid of any real understanding Thefacts of the in relation member to this for Lalor, matter. during her speech prior to mine, spoke about the desire for the Labor Party to send a message and to make a position which was about providing some basis for an international scheme. One of the things that we do not hear from the Australian Labor Party is any quoting of the Labor Party in the United Kingdom. In the recent debate on the very difficult but right decision that the government took in relation to Iraq, we were criticised by the Labor Party. They said that the troops should not have been predeployed and that the troops should not have engaged in the Iraqi action at all. With the benefit of hindsight, we understand that the liberation that was provided to the people of Iraq was of great benefit, not just to those people but to the whole Middle East region. The Labor Party at that stage and during that debate refused to acknowledge the position of the United Kingdom Labor Party-a position that supported this government's stance. Indeed, they are refusing to acknowledge the stance of the Labor Party in United Kingdom in relation to this very policy. The policy of the Labor Party in the United Kingdom needs to be noted, because it is not mentioned by the Australian Labor Party. It is mentioned because they know that it concurs with our own policy in many areas. The Australian Labor Party policy in relation to people-smuggling, of opening the borders up and inviting people smugglers to move people into Australia and forever more flood the borders, is an unrealistic and ridiculously naive policy. The United Kingdom Labour Party understand that. Why can't the Australian Labor Party get the message? What part of it don't you get? We looked at the policy prior to the movements by this government and looked at the numbers that were flowing into Australia. When this government took a tough stance in relation to protecting our borders and strengthening not just Australian society but our way of life, the numbers dried up. The Labor Party at the time tried to say that the resulting lowering and, indeed, the drying up now of the number of arrivals was due to all sorts of weather conditions, the presence of the monsoon season and other ridiculous arguments that they pushed forwardall of which have been proven to be completely incorrect. I almost feel embarrassed for the member for Lalor, that she has to stand up and represent the extreme view of the Left of the Labor Party. We know about other members in society with left views who speak against the government stance because they are in the same boat-they do not have a proper grasp of what this argument is about. What we need from the Labor Party is a recognition that the government's policy in this area has worked and has worked well, and that it will continue to work because this afternoon we are in the process of reintroducing this bill which will allow for the further excising of remote islands and will send a great message to people smugglers-the worse type of people, who trade in human misery-saying not just that they should not bother trying to make it not to the mainland but that they should not try to make it part of the way in their rickety boats. The member for Lalor would have you believe that this policy sends them a message of, ‘Make a mad dash for the mainland.' This policy says the complete opposite-and it has said the complete opposite for a number of months. That is why we have seen the resulting drop in the number of peoplesmuggling movements that we have. The message that it sends those people smugglers is, ‘Don't bother trying at all. Don't bother trying to get halfway and running your unseaworthy boats onto an island because we will welcome you with open arms.' It says to those people smugglers, ‘Don't bother trying, and don't start the evil process of trading in human misery.' My view of the issue of border protection is that the Howard government has got the policy right. We continue to strengthen the policy, we continue to send the message to people smugglers right across the world that Australia is no longer the soft target it was under Labor. If the people of Australia are interested in continuing a policy which really does strengthen Australia's borders and provide strength to the Australian way of life, they need to continue to support the coalition government. I commend the bill to the House.",66
181,Ms LIVERMORE,COMMITTEES,"The re-introduction of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2] in the House today just goes to show that this government will do anything to avoid talking about the issues of real concern to ordinary Australian families, like those people who live in my electorate who are so concerned about things like how they will afford to go to the doctor tomorrow and how they will make sure their kids get quality education. As I say, this is all about the government avoiding the issues of real concern to Australian families. The government will do anything, pull any stunt, to try and make sure that attention stays away from those issues. This bill is being introduced in the House today to try and revive the government's long-running attempts to divert attention away from those important domestic issues and keep this agenda of fear and insecurity going in the community. That is not to say that the issues of border protection and national security are not important; in fact, they are vitally importantand that is a point that has been made time and time again in these debates by people on this side of the House. We keep trying to send the message to the government that, yes, border protection and national security are vitally important to our nation; they are too important to play games with and to become the subject of political stunts, such as with this bill. The Labor Party is still opposed to this bill. Nothing has changed since we voted against it in the House and the Senate last year. We saw through it as a cheap political stunt then, and we make the same call now. I am opposed to the bill because effectively it is a farce. It is illogical. The evidence shows that it will not work; it will not achieve what the government claims it will achieve. In fact, it will have the opposite effect. I am also opposed to this bill because it is one more part of this government's disgraceful and grubby strategy to continually demonise asylum seekers and whip up fear and insecurity within our community. This government continues to threaten our cherished reputation for tolerance and a fair go. What does this bill aim to do? Technically it seeks to excise over 3,000 islands from Australia's migration zone. The Migration Act 1958 was originally amended in 2001 to excise Christmas Island, Ashmore Reef and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands from Australian territory for the purpose of visa applications. Those islands were declared, under the amendment, to be ‘excised offshore places'. The effect of that amendment was to prevent a noncitizen arriving at any of those places without a visa from making a valid visa application. For example, if you landed on Ashmore Reef, you could not make an application for a visa. The people landing on these places became part of the Pacific solution; they got shipped off to Nauru or Manus Island to have their refugee status assessed. Having excised those areas in 2001, the government then sought by regulation to extend the excision zone to include vast areas of the Australian territory. That regulation was quite properly disallowed by the Senate, and this bill is the latest attempt by the government to revive the whole asylum seeker and border security agenda that they manufactured and then exploited so shamelessly at the 2001 election. If this bill came into effect, it would for the excision from the Australian migration zone of vast parts of Australia's territory. Specifically, it would include all islands that are part of Queensland and are north of latitude 12 degrees south, all islands that are part of Western Australia and are north of latitude 23 degrees south, all islands that are part of the Northern Territory and are north of latitude 16 degrees south and the Coral Sea Islands Territory. If you look at the map of this area, you can see how ridiculous the government's proposal is. For a start, it represents a massive area of over 3,000 islands. What message does this bill send to the people, the Australian citizens, living on those islands? It says, ‘You are expendable; you are secondclass citizens in terms of this nation's sovereignty.' It means that, as a nation, we are prepared to retreat from our borders and create one level of sovereignty for the mainland and another level for Australians living on the islands. The reaction of residents of those islands was made very clear when the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee took evidence on those islands. One of the community members said: When you came out that time, we did not know what was going on. In the back of our minds we were thinking: why are we getting kicked out from the rest of Australia? After rolled for federal Commonwealth elections. The government has been treating these people in a very offhand manner and it did not consult them properly before this proposal was put forward. Why wouldn't they feel insulted by the way they have been treated and by the proposal put forward in this bill? The map also shows just how close some of those islands to be excised are to the mainland. For example, Melville Island is only 24 kilometres from the mainland, and Prince of Wales Island in the Torres Strait is allow even closer. I can remember spending some time up on the tip of Cape York a few years ago in the community of Bamaga. There it was quite common on the weekend for people to come over from PNG or the Torres Strait Islands in their tinnies to play football or visit family and friends. The suggestion that excising these islands is going to make any difference to people's attempts to enter Australian territory is really ludicrous. The map highlights just how ridiculous the government's proposal is and it exposes this bill for the political stunt it is. When any bill comes into this House, the question is: why are we doing this? There has got to be a good reason for the government to put forward these proposals and for us to spend time in the parliament debating them. The question is whether the government have made out their case for this bill. Since introducing the bill in the middle of last year, the government have been desperately trying to establish some kind of rationale for the excision of these islands. They want everyone to believe that there is some higher principle or purpose to what we all know is a bald-faced stunt. It is an attempt to whip up fear and insecurity in the community-in the best tradition of the Tampa, the shameful waste of taxpayers' money that is the Pacific solution, and the children overall, we are enboard disgrace. From what I can see, the government are out on their own in claiming that this bill is necessary or that it will achieve any of its purported aims. According to the explanatory memorandum, this bill is all about preventing asylum seekers from reaching Australia and applying for refugee status. The memorandum says: The bill was originally introduced in response to indications that people smugglers were changing the focus of their operations to target islands closer r to the Australian mainland. This potential still exists. The Government believes that the measures contained in this Bill to combat these threats and extend the bar on visa applications by persons who arrive without lawful authority at these offshore islands is still necessary. As debate on this bill has proceeded over the last year and investigations in the Senate have gone on, we see that this rationale put forward by the government is completely threadbare. The government would have us believe that excising these islands will cause people smugglers to simply shut down their illegal trade. Of course we know, and logic dictates, that the opposite will be the case. If the people smugglers and the desperate, unfortunate people who fall into their hands know that you cannot make a claim for refugee status from Melville Island or Prince of Wales Island, where do you think they will head? Where are the boats going to end up? Of course they are going to end up on the Australian mainland. This bill will not achieve its stated aims of preventing people smugglers from attempting to bring people to Australia, as asserted by the government in the second reading speech in the Senate. It was claimed that the bill will significantly reduce incentives for people to make hazardous journeys to Australian territories. The government's claims and, indeed, the overall effectiveness and efficacy of this bill, were investigated last year when the bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report. The first of the terms of reference for that inquiry was to look at the implications of excision for border security. Evidence was given to the committee by agencies involved in surveillance and interception of people smugglers, such as the Australian Federal Police and the immigration department. The testimony of these agencies laid bare the government's claim that this bill would provide a disincentive for people smugglers to approach Australia with their cargo of people fleeing persecution and seeking refuge in our country. In fact, the evidence suggests just the opposite. The first person I will quote is the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Mick Keelty. In his evidence, he shared the assessment that the bill could lead to people smugglers coming direct to the mainland. The committee asked him for his view about boats possibly coming to the mainland under this regime. He said: That would be what we anticipate for those vessels intending to arrive in Australia: rather than leave the passengers to the unknown fate of arriving on a remote island or reef, they would be forced to come to the mainland. This was backed up by a representative of the immigration department, who went into great detail about what would happen with boats travelling through the Torres Strait. The representative described a situation where the passengers would panic, there would be pressure put on the people smugglers in control of those vessels, ‘passengers would have had enough: they would be fed up, seasick, and they would just want to go to the nearest land. The Torres Strait is also a very difficult area to navigate. The likelihood of a boat getting through the Torres Strait, without hitting land somewhere along the way or the passengers panicking or being ill and the boat needing to turn into Australia, is very low'. Finally, there was a great summing up of what everyone in Australia reading this bill would be able to see. If you look at this bill, you see how ridiculous it is. There was a great quote from Mr Alan Keeling. He said: My concern is that if you come this far from overseas, you would be a damned fool to stop here when, if you go two kilometres, you will be where you do not have the problem. If you land on Australia, it will be open slather. So why would anybody want to stop here? He is talking about the Goulburn Islands. He continues: I just think it is overkill when the whole of the border of Australia is open slather but a few scattered islands have to have a separate law. Hear, hear! The committee concluded, after hearing evidence from these agencies and people involved at the coalface of protecting our borders, that there was little evidence to support assertions that the excision of islands close to the mainland is likely to deter asylum seekers. In fact, some evidence was received that the likely effect of the bill would be to drive asylum seekers closer to the mainland, either with the intent of landing or incidentally. Nothing that the minister or anyone in this debate has had to say in the six or eight months since that inquiry was conducted has made any difference to the reality that excising these islands and drawing Australia's borders closer to the mainland would have any effect on deterring people smugglers. In fact, the evidence and common sense tell us that, of course, if people have made that dangerous journey to within 20 kilometres of the Australian mainland, they are just going to keep going; and they are going to put pressure on the people in control of those boats to do that. In effect, the committee report tells us what common sense and logic tell us anyway. If people fleeing horror and destruction that we cannot even imagine have made it through a terrifying and life-threatening journey to an Australian island, why would they not just keep going to the Australian mainland? It is a complete farce and a charade on the Australian people for the government to run around pretending that this bill is about border protection and national security. The fact that Labor reject this bill and the ill-considered proposal it sets out does not mean that we do not take border protection seriously. Of course we want to see peoplelittle smuggling stopped. The member for Lalor put in an enormous amount of work last year in presenting the Labor Party's very comprehensive policy to stop people-smuggling at its source, to increase the penalties in legislation, to work within our region to stop people-smuggling from happening across the South-East Asian region, to make sure that the problems at source countries are dealt with, and to make sure that the assessment process through the UNHCR is done in an efficient, fair and timely way so that peoplesmuggling is nipped in the bud. We want to see people-smuggling stopped because it is an affront to anyone who cares about their fellow human beings, what they have been through and what they continue to go through in trying to reach Australian borders to make their applications for refugee status. We also want to see people-smuggling stopped because of the threats that it poses to Australia's quarantine situation and our national security. We oppose this bill not because we do not care about border protection but because we need to keep sending the government the message that border protection and national security are too important to be the subject of these ongoing political stunts. We want to see some real solutions to people-smuggling in our region, which is why Labor has put forward a proposal for an Australian coastguard to protect our borders properly. This proposal is a genuine response to the threats to our borders and to our national security posed by people smugglers, gun runners, drug smugglers and illegal fishermen. The Labor policy is backed up with funding of $600 million. That will pay for that cop on the beat-24 hours a day, seven days a week-which is so desperately needed. We keep on coming back to the figure of Australia's 37,000 kilometre coastline. It is crazy and hard to believe that we, as the biggest island in the world, do not have a proper coastguard facility to do that policing role and protect our borders. Our policy proposal recognises that the current system of border protection is ineffective and inefficient. It involves a maze of different organisations with competing roles and responsibilities. The coastguard has four main pillars and principles. The first one is better capabilitymaking sure that we have the vessels to carry out the policing and border protection role. It also involves specialist personnel with the training and qualifications required to do this job. It is a job that the Navy is not supposed to be doing. I am not casting any doubt on the ability of our naval personnel-they are fine men and women-but they are there to defend Australia, which is a specialist job and one that they have trained long and hard for. The role of plying back and forth across the northern approaches to Australia is not what those people have trained for years and years to do. The other part of our policy is to introduce a volunteer effort and get those recreational fishermen, those boaties and the existing voluntary Coastwatch and coastguard organisations in under a coordinated umbrella to provide surveillance and intelligence and to be part of that cop on the beat-that 24-houra-day, seven-day-a-week operation-that will be essential to the protection and surveillance of our borders. It also means making the best use of national intelligence by filling in the gaps in our intelligence capacity. The centrepiece of Labor's coastguard will be three purpose-built vessels with the capacity to operate across Australia's northern region. Currently the Navy is being required to conduct this task with ships that are not designed, and were never designed, to carry out the type of border policing and interception role that this government have asked them to fulfil. Navy patrol boats do not have the range to protect the Indian Ocean territories, including Christmas Island, and the frigates that the government have assigned to this task are costing the defence forces $1 million per day. Labor have identified that we need to fix this gap in our border protection capacity with the purpose-built vessels, for which we have put aside funding. The volunteer aspect of our coastguard policy is worth expanding on; it is an important part of the overall package. We have got thousands and thousands of people out there on a daily basis fishing, boating and enjoying the waters. We could use those people very effectively, just as we use Neighbourhood Watch in our communities, to keep an eye on what is going on out there. We have currently got the Coastwatch system in place, but it is a very ad hoc operation at the moment. There is no reason why we cannot provide the proper support, equipment, resources and funding to draw that volunteer effort into our broader Coastwatch operations. I have spent some time working on this policy with colleagues Christian Zahra and Bernie Ripoll. We have spent a lot of time talking to the volunteer coastguard units around the coastline, and they are very eager to be involved in this way. This is a way of showing our support for what they do, for the volunteer hours that they put in protecting recreational boaters and fishermen. This is a way of saying, ‘You are doing a great job. We want you to be part of this very important national task of keeping an eye on what is happening out there in our waters.' The government talks about border security and drawing lines across our northern border with the excision of these islands. The reason that we are talking about so vast, and you are not going to do it with a few patrol boats. You are not going to intercept vessels and keep an eye on that vast area without engaging the rest of the community. We have had a great response from the volunteer organisations to be involved, and we want to give them the equipment, training and support to carry out that role and be part of the coastguard effort. The government continues running these stunts up the flagpole. We have got a serious proposal to improve the security of Australia's northern region and to ensure that there is a coastguard on the beat 24 hours a day. We continue to support our national security and border protection by opposing these bills. They do nothing to help. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Hockey) adjourned.",69
182,Unknown,COMMITTEES,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 2003First Reading Message from the Governor General transmitting particulars of proposed expenditure and recommending appropriation announced. Bill presented by Mr Costello, and read a first time. Second Reading",74
183,Mr COSTELLO,COMMITTEES,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. When I brought down last year's Budget we announced a major upgrade of Australia's defence and security. We decided to make that investment because our security situation had changed, the threat of terror had become more direct, and it is that it is closer to home. We did not know how close to home the threat would come. The tragic events in Bali on 12 October last year saw 88 innocent Australians die at the hands of criminal terrorists. We cannot take our security for granted. Tonight I will announce further measures to upgrade Australia's security and border protection. At the time of last year's Budget. I reported to the House on the deployment and funding of Australian forces engaged in the War on Terror. At that time our Defence Force personnel were engaged in Afghanistan. Since then, the brave men and women of the Australian Defence Forces have again served in theatres of war, this time in Iraq and the Persian Gulf. This Budget provides funding to cover that commitment. And to7.30 p.m. night I will announce further measures to upgrade our defence capacity. 2004 This year we were tested by terror and war overseas. And this year we were tested at home with the most extensive drought recorded in Australian history and bushfires which savaged life and property. This year we were tested again as the international economy turned down, making it harder for our economy. We have been knocked around by some of these events. We have been tested. But we are resilient. And Australia's economy is resilient. The international body, the OECD, says Australia is “… notably resilient to shocks, both internal and external.” We have put in some hard work to get to this point. And that has given us a lot of insulation against these kinds of shocks. We will need it again for the shocks that will come in the future. I do not pretend that things will be easy in the next year. But I do believe that Australia will weather the shocks much better than comparable countries. We want to keep our Budget in surplus. Tonight I announce the sixth surplus of this Government. In 2003-04 the Commonwealth Budget will be in surplus-a surplus of $2.2 billion. We want to invest in priority areas, in defence, in security, in education and health. And consistent with those objectives we want to keep our taxes as low as possible. That is why tonight I am announcing an income tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. NA Mr Speaker, on 1 July 2000 the Government introduced the largest income tax cut Australia has ever had. From 1 July this year, three years later, income tax will be cut again. This will be done in two ways. For low income earners, the low income tax offset will be increased. For other taxpayers, income tax thresholds will be lifted. The upper income limit for the 17 per cent rate will be raised from $20,000 to $21,600, the upper income limit of the 30 per cent rate will be raised from $50,000 to $52,000, and the upper income limit of the 42 per cent rate will be raised from $60,000 to $62,500. The low income tax offset will rise from $150 to $235. The tax offset currently phases out at four cents in the dollar for every dollar over $20,700. This limit will be lifted and aligned with the other changes so that withdrawal will occur with each dollar earned over $21,600. This means that taxpayers earning between $20,000 and $27,475 will get the benefit of both increased thresholds and the increased tax offset. Some will get tax cuts up to $329 per annum or a tax saving of 10 per cent on their current tax bill. A taxpayer on $45,000 will receive a tax cut of $208, a taxpayer on $55,000 will receive a tax cut of $448 and a taxpayer on $65,000 will receive a tax cut of $573. The measures I am announcing tonight cut income tax for 9 million Australians. The tax cut will amount to $2.4 billion in 2003-04 and $10.7 billion across the forward estimates. NA Mr Speaker, the security of our people and our nation is the Government's first priority. Today we are faced with the dangers of rising international terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The Government is committed to confronting these threats to our security and defending our values and our way of life. During the last few months Australia deployed more than 2,000 personnel to the international coalition to disarm Iraq. The deployment included a Special Forces Task Group, many of whom operated behind enemy lines, a squadron of F/A-18 Hornet Fighter jets, three Royal Australian Navy Frigates and transport and surveillance aircraft including Hercules and P-3C Orions. Our young Australians served with great distinction. They made a very significant contribution to the downfall of Saddam Hussein's regime and to the liberation of the Iraqi people. They have accomplished their mission. We salute their service. The cost of this deployment and some contributions to rehabilitation activities such as the deployment of personnel to the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, is budgeted to amount to $645 million. The Government has also committed a further $100 million for urgent humanitarian relief and reconstruction for the Iraqi people. This spending is over and above normal defence expenditure. It is in addition to the Defence White Paper which provides the biggest upgrade of our defence capabilities in 25 years, increasing spending by $27 billion over a decade. And Australia continues its defence commitment to East Timor with a battalion of three rifle companies and around 1,000 personnel all up costing around $500 million this year. In total, tonight I am announcing new defence spending of $2.1 billion over five years. Total defence spending will rise to $15 billion in 2003-04. In this Budget, additional funding of $157 million will establish a Special Operations Command. This will deliver an additional 334 combat and support personnel to Australia's existing special forces, including an additional commando company and a maritime terrorist capability in the 4th Royal Ausprotect tralian Regiment. The Government will also provide an additional $1.1 billion to augment logistics and support funding for a range of platforms and equipment, including the F/A-18 fighter aircraft; Hercules transport aircraft; Collins class submarines; and a range of transport vehicles. This funding is vital if the Australian Defence Force is to remain well equipped to cope with heightened levels of operation and respond to unforeseen events both at home and abroad. It is, however, the quality of the people that has been the core strength of Australia's military forces. This has been clearly demonstrated in East Timor, Afghanistan and, most recently, in Iraq. Army and Air Force are presently experiencing better recruitment and retention rates with separations at ten year lows. To capitalise on this favourable recruiting environment, the Government will increase funding by $103 million over three years to enable the ADF to exceed the personnel targets envisaged by the White Paper for this period. ENHANCING AUSTRALIAN SECURITY After the terrorist attacks on 11 September, the Government strengthened Australia's domestic security arrangements at a cost of $1.3 billion over five years. These included measures to put Protective Services Officers on selected flights, doubling AFP strike team capability, a Regiment to respond to chemical and biological incidents and a second Tactical Assault Group. After the Bali atrocity, the Government commissioned a further review of security arrangements and, as a result, announced further measures at a cost of around $100 million. Let there be no doubt about our resolve to Australians against terrorist threats. This Budget commits, in addition to those amounts, another $411 million over five years to continue the upgrade of our domestic security arrangements. Critical security infrastructure at our shipping ports, airports, as well as our nuclear research and military facilities will be upgraded. The new international code of practice for maritime security will be introduced. More funding will be provided to increase the use of container X-ray facilities at Australian ports. The Government will enhance our border processing systems to identify and track persons of concern. Intelligence that is timely and accurate is critical if we wish to prevent terrorist incidents. Our intelligence agencies must play an increased role in identifying and responding to possible risks to Australia and our interests. This is why the Government is providing an additional $152 million to enhance Australia's intelligence capacity. Part of this funding will go to agencies such as the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation and the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to enhance their counter-terrorism bilities. The Office of National Assessments will receive more funding to work on terrorism through dedicated liaison capacity with counterpart agencies in Washington and London. And, as a lasting legacy to those who lost their lives in the terrorist attack of October 2002, the Government is allocating $10.5 million to fund a new intensive care centre for the Sanglah Hospital in Denpasar, also to construct a community eye treatment centre in Bali, and to fund an ongoing medical and health scholarship programme. These initiatives are a practical living memorial to the victims of the tragedy. NA Mr Speaker, tonight the Government is announcing far-reaching reforms to Australia's higher education system. These reforms will free up universities, and allow them to build on their strengths. Universities will gain access to increased Commonwealth support and have more flexibility in setting course fees. In total, the Government will commit an additional $1.5 billion over the next four years to higher education. By 2009-10, with the reforms fully in place, there will be an extra $870 million per year spent by the Commonwealth on higher education. This represents a real increase of 17 per cent ten years. Universities wishing to increase their research capacity will have greater scope to do so. Universities wishing to build teaching excellence will have greater scope to do so. The Government will invest more money over the next four years on extra Commonwealth grants for universities. This will include a 7½ per cent increase in base funding by 2007. The package will also provide new funding towards the costs of education in capa- regional campuses. Our universities must provide the quality courses that our students want and our nation needs. And to ensure that students and the community get the best value from this investment, the Government will be seeking significant improvements in governance and workplace relations within the higher education sector. From 2005, universities will have flexibility in setting fees for Commonwealth supported places. They can cut them. Except for teaching and nursing, they can increase them to a maximum of 30 per cent above HECS. It is up to the institution whether it wants to attract students, and up to the student as to whether the course offers value. Universities will be able to specialise in their areas of strength. The Government is also reforming the system of student loans so that all students will be able to study without the need to pay any up-front fees. A new comprehensive Higher Education Loans Programme called HELP will assist students from January 2005. For students in Commonwealth supported places, HECS will continue as part of the new HELP system. A new FEE-HELP programme will be introduced for students who pay full fees. A new OS(Overseas)-HELP over programme will assist those students who need financial assistance to study overseas. The Government expects these loan arrangements to generate an additional $800 million for students to invest in their higher education. At present students are required to make HECS repayments when their income reaches $24,365 a year. From 2005 this threshold will be lifted to $30,000. To enhance access and participation nancially disadvantaged students in higher education, the Government will establish three new scholarship programmes costing $162 million over four years. There is a clear imperative to address the shortage of teachers and nurses in our schools and hospitals. The Budget will set aside an additional $161 million over the next four years for teaching and nursing and other priority places. This includes at least 574 extra places in nursing by 2007. Australia has a quality education and training system. Over 200,000 international students recognise this by choosing to study here each year. They generate over $5 billion in export earnings each year. The Government will build on our achievements in this area by providing an extra $113 million over four years for quality assurance and the motion of Australian education and training in overseas markets. This will largely be financed by extra charges for overseas students. It will develop a stronger educational system in Australia. PROVIDING ACCESSIBLE AND AFNA Mr Speaker, this Government is committed to ensuring Australia has a first rate health system. In 1995-96, Commonwealth spending on health amounted to around $18½ billion. In 2003-04, we expect to spend over $31 billion on health. Since coming to office, this Government has increased health spending by around 65 per cent. The Government has invested in strengthening public hospitals, enhancing Medicare, and providing financial assistance to Australians who take out health insurance. Improvements to Medicare recently announced by the Prime Minister allocate new spending to make Medicare services more by fi- affordable and accessible. The reforms will provide more doctors where they are needed most, with an additional 150 GP trainee places each year targeted to rural and outer-metropolitan places. 234 new medical school places each year will be bonded so that when their training has been completed, these doctors will start practising in areas of shortage. The Government's spending on public hospitals will increase to record levels under the recently announced Australian Health Care Agreements. These provide more than $10 billion of additional funding for public hospitals over the current agreement-a growth of 29½ per cent over five years, or 17 per cent in real terms. States and Territories that at least match the rate of growth in the Commonwealth contribution and deliver on pro- reporting commitments will receive the Commonwealth's maximum contribution. This Budget is setting aside $253 million for a Pathways Home Initiative to help people discharged from hospital, particularly the elderly, to be able to make a smooth and easy transition back home. The $42 billion in public hospital funding is on top of the contribution the Commonwealth is making to take pressure off the public hospital system by increasing the coverage of private health insurance. Private health insurance covered 30 per cent of Australians in January 1999 and jumped to 44 per cent of Australians in December 2002 as a result of the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and other Government initiatives. More than 8.7 million Australians now have private health insurance. Illegal drug use is an enormous burden on our society in terms of waste and cost to man life. We will continue to fight this menace. Since 1997, the Government has committed extensive resources to its strategy of Tough on Drugs. The challenges remain immense but there has been recent evidence of some success. Enhancement to our law enforcement capability has been important to detecting the smuggling of illicit drugs into Australia. They have resulted in several significant zures, like the recent interception of the North Korean vessel the Pong Su, and its deadly cargo of heroin destined for Australian streets. Tonight I announce measures that strengthen our ability to disrupt supplies of illicit drugs and prevent the production of illicit drugs on our shores. Additional ing will be provided to identify and ill-gotten gains of those who have benefited from supplying drugs to our community. The new and continuing measures announced in this Budget will allocate $316 million over the next four years for the Tough on Drugs Strategy. On 8 April 2003 the Government gazetted Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) as a quarantinable disease. Border protection measures against SARS are an essential first line of defence, and will be maintained for long as they are necessary. The Commonwealth is funding health personnel to detect possible cases of SARS at international airports. NA NA Mr Speaker, this Government understands that people with disabilities and their carers face special challenges in getting employment and participating fully in the life of the community. In this Budget, the Government will inhu- crease funding by $135 million over four years to community organisations providing disability employment services. Grants will be larger according to the level of disability of the person they support in the workplace. It is expected this will help an extra 6,000 people have the opportunity of a job and the self respect that comes with it. The Government will also spend $25 million over three years to help organisations seiproviding employment for people with disabilities. This funding will improve the viability of these organisations and support the payment of better wages to their employees. Parents of children with ongoing high support needs will also benefit from additional funds to fund more carers. Around 1,250 extra families will be helped under the fund- measure I am announcing tonight. seize the REBUILDING AFTER DROUGHT AND NA Mr Speaker, the past year has seen many communities ravaged by the devastating effects of drought and fire. People have lost their lives, their homes, their livelihood. An institution of great importance to our heritage and scientific learning was lost in the ACT. The Government expects to provide a total around $740 million this year and the next as two years in assisting farmers, small businesses and regional communities through the most extensive drought ever recorded. This funding will provide direct income support, personal counselling, tax relief and interest rate relief for those in need. This year the Commonwealth spent over $8 million helping the States and Territories with aircraft to battle terrible bushfires and will provide continuing support for aerial firefighting in the next fire season. The Government is working with the States and Territories to establish a national approach to natural disaster mitigation including bushfires and floods. Conditional on States and Territories matching funding and the implementation of more effective land use and building controls, the Commonwealth will provide $68 million over five years for this purpose. The Commonwealth will also assist the rebuilding of the Mount Stromlo Observatory. AUSTRALIA'S HERITAGE Mr Speaker, the stories of our past, our people, their struggles, and the places, and anniversaries that make us Australians need to be preserved. It is important that these achievements are treasured and shared with future generations. So tonight the Government is announcing the establishment of a National Heritage List which will identify Australia's places of national significance and preserve them so that future Australians will know of them, their history, and what they mean to us. Some of these places will be outside Australia like ANZAC Cove at Gallipoli, a place that helped to define our nationhood, our values, and holds a special place in the hearts of all tralians. Through partnerships between government, industry and the community these places will be kept as part of the Australian story forever. The programme will cost $52 million. NA Mr Speaker, the Government is encouraging Australian industry to be internationally competitive, laying the foundation for more jobs and higher living standards. A new $20 million in funding is allocated to support the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's (CSIRO) Flagship Programme, a partnership of leading Australian scientists, research institutions and commercial companies undertaking research to advance new industries and jobs, healthier and more productive lives and better use of environmental resources. The Government is finalising the White Paper on our innovative land transport package, AusLink. AusLink will improve planning for the Land Transport network, result in more private investment and better transport links. Funding has been provided in this budget to progress the development of that programme. REFORM OF INTERNATIONAL TAXNA Mr Speaker, to maintain Australia's status as an attractive place for business and investment, the tax system needs continually to adapt to the international business environment. Tonight I announce the outcome of the Government's review of Australia's international tax arrangements. The Government will implement a balanced package of reforms to help Australian companies compete better overseas and encourage foreign companies to establish regional headquarters in Australia. We want Austhese companies to provide better job opportunities for Australians. The Government will simplify the application of the controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules. It will also modernise Australia's tax treaty network, and reduce taxes on certain forms of business income earned by Australian companies overseas. NA Mr Speaker, despite a weak global economy, despite heightened international tensions and the most extensive drought ever recorded, Australia has proved very resilient over the past year. Growth was solid, investment surged and over 230,000 new jobs were created. Looking forward, there is a larger than usual element of risk surrounding the nearterm outlook. While our fundamentals are sound, the international outlook is difficult. There are looming problems in the major economies, heightened international tensions, including the Korean Peninsula, and the risk of the further spread of SARS. Nonetheless, there remain good reasons to be positive about Australia. Productivity growth will continue and prospects for business investment look strong. Economic growth is forecast to be 3¼ per cent in 2003-04, and inflation is expected to ease to 2¼ per cent through the year, within the Government's medium-term inflation target band. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at around 6 per cent. Moderate wage pressures and the tax cuts announced tonight should assist further jobs growth in the future. NA Since coming to office, this Government has implemented economic policies providing for strong and sustainable growth. By June this year we will have reduced Labor's net debt by around $63 billion. Interest rates are at around their lowest levels in 30 years. Unemployment is around its lowest rate in 10 years. More than 1 million jobs have been created since March 1996. Our continued resilience and prosperity rely on our ability to plan today to confront the challenges of tomorrow. We need to continue to work on important reforms to ensure our future prosperity. The tax reductions announced tonight will assist families working hard on their own budgets. The reforms I have announced tonight in education, in health, in energy and tax will make Australia stronger in the years ahead. This Budget is a further step on the journey to secure Australia's future. I commend this Budget to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. BUDGET PAPERS 2003-04",74
