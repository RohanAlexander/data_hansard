2,Mr ANDREWS,BUSINESS,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (9.01 am)-I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Perth's private Members' business notice relating to the disallowance of Workplace Relations Regulations 2006, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No. 52 and made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005, being called on immediately. Question agreed to. NA NA Disallowance Motion",19
3,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,REGULATIONS,"I move: That the Workplace Relations Regulations 2006, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2006 No 52. and made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005, be disallowed. I have moved that these regulations be disallowed because the source of authority for these regulations is the font of public policy evil. That is the government's extreme, unfair industrial relations changes reflected by the Work Choices legislation, which this parliament adopted against our opposition at the end of 2005. As we have made consistently clear, on coming to office Labor will tear up that legislation and we will also tear up the regulations made under that legislation. This is not the first occasion that I have sought to have the House consider these regulations. On 29 March I moved that standing orders be suspended so that the House could consider these matters. I moved that the matter be debated forthwith so that the House could: (a) respond to the widespread community concern about the government's industrial relations changes by debating and voting to disallow regulations to the legislation; (b) record the House's contempt for the Government's extreme changes, particularly the removal of unfair dismissal rights which sees Australian employees at risk of being sacked, sacked unfairly for no reason or any reason; (c) record the House's contempt for the Government's attack on the wages, conditions and entitlements of Australian employees without benefit to Australia's economic future; and (d) show by tearing up the regulations the House's intention to tear up the Government's unfair, un-Australian legislation. All of those sentiments remain true today. Even before we go to some of the content of the regulations, which I will do in due course, the essential element of these regulations is that they have as the source of their authority the government's extreme and unfair legislation. This House should tear up that legislation and, as a consequence, tear up these regulations. There is an important starting point in this debate. The government now says that these changes are so essential to our way of life, so essential to our economy and so essential to our workplace arrangements. There is only one problem: we heard nothing about these measures at all in the run-up to the last election. I have a very distinct recollection of the last election being fought on the economy; we heard nothing about these measures. On the contrary, at the launch of the Liberal Party's industrial relations policy in Brisbane, the Prime Minister was asked whether he was proposing to pursue what he described as a single national system. He said no. He was also asked whether he was proposing to pursue a reduction in allowable matters and he said no. So not only was there no mention of these measures but the Prime Minister on two issues affirmed the contrary. We heard nothing about these measures in the run-up to the last election, but we will hear plenty about them in the run-up to the next. Why should this House tear up this legislation and these regulations? There are three essential points in my view. Firstly, these regulations and this legislation are a massive attack on the living standards of Australians. Secondly, they are a massive attack on our way of life and on characteristics, values virtues that we as a nation have built up 100 years. Thirdly, they are a massive attack on the capacity of the trade union movement to take part in the modern social and economic affairs of Australian society. Let me deal with each of these in turn. Why are these regulations and this legislation a massive attack on living standards? They are a massive attack on living standards in two areas-firstly, in attacking the minimum wage and, secondly, in attacking entitlements and conditions. We know that, if over its 10 years in office the government's submissions to the Industrial Relations Commission had been agreed to, the minimum wage would currently be $50 a week or $2,600 a year worse off. That is the sum total of the government's submissions to the Industrial Relations Commission. We also know, for example, that if the submissions from ACCI ‘the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry' had been agreed to by the Industrial Relations Commission the minimum wage would currently be $95 a week or $4,940 a year worse off. That reflects the government's objective. The government's objective in the changes it has made to the minimum wage is to reduce the minimum wage in real terms. That is what it wants to do-reduce the minimum wage in real terms. It wants to shift part of the economy from the wages section of the economy to the profit section of the economy, to shift part of a total factor income section of the economy from wages to profits. The government wants to attack the living standards of Australian workers and working families, firstly, through an attack upon the minimum wage and, secondly, through an attack upon conditions and entitlements, by doing precisely what the Prime Minister said he would not do-that is, by reducing the number of allowable matters and removing the no disadvantage test, by reducing condiand tions and entitlements to the government's over so-called five minimum standards and by leaving swinging and to be torn away without any compensation things like overtime, penalty rates and leave loadings. These are things that many Australians depend upon to make ends meet and to pay their mortgages. So far as the minimum wage is concerned, it is not just me or Labor that is asserting that objective. The President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, Justice Giudice, has said the government's legislation leaves open the prospect of a fall in the minimum wage in real terms. The chairman of the ‘low pay commission', Professor Harper, has reflected that attitude as well. I was interested to hear the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who is at the table, complaining the other day about the fact that some of the state commissions are now hearing minimum wage cases at the state level. He asserted that what the New South Wales commission is doing is somehow not fair-as if the government were somehow worried about fairness when it comes to the minimum wage. What do we know about the changes the government has made to the legislative requirements that are now on the low pay commission? The government has removed the requirement in the old act that the minimum wage be fair and that it have reference to prevailing economic standards and inflation. No longer does the minimum wage have to be fair and no longer are we to be concerned about whether the value of the minimum wage is reduced in real terms. That is the primary attack on ing standards. But the attack is also met with an attack on job security by the government's removal of unfair dismissal rights and pushing people onto individual contracts, AWAs, without any of the underpinnings of the previously existing no disadvantage test and allowable matters. What do we know about the government's changes to unfair dismissal? We know the government proposes that, if you are employed by a company with 100 or fewer employees, you have no unfair dismissal rights at all. You can be sacked for any reason or no reason. You can be sacked unfairly for no reason or any reason and not have a remedy. We also know-because we have seen it come into effect with the Cowra abattoir-the so-called operational reasons: if you are a company with more than 100 employees, you can determine for operational reasons that a person has to go, and that person loses his or her unfair dismissal rights. So the unfair dismissal rights of nearly four million Australian employees go out the window. For the remaining Australian employees it depends upon an interpretation of the very widely drafted ‘operational requirements' provisions. That is the attack upon wages, conditions and living standards. What about the attack on our way of life? We have always prided ourselves on being a society which is interested in safety nets, which is interested in minimum standards and which is interested in making sure that, whilst people have opportunity, there is a certain basement or floor beneath which people will not be allowed to fall. We have reflected that in the history of our industrial relations and workplace legislation by having sensible minimum standards, sensible safety nets and the operation of a strong and independent umpire. What do we see the government doing across the board with these measures? Gutting the effectiveness of the liv- independent umpire-the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The government could not get its view up before the commission on the minimum wage. So not being able to get through the front door what it could not persuade the commission of, it now goes through the back door. It trumps up the low pay commission to do that job, depriving the independent umpire of its wagesetting-and, effectively, its disputesettling-powers and arrangements. Secondly, by reducing the minimum standards, taking away the no disadvantage test and taking away the allowable matters, the government is removing from protection the things that people have come to rely uponpenalty rates, overtime, leave loading and the like. There is only one consequence when you take away the umpire, remove minimum standards and take away the safety net: Australia will end up with the equivalent of America's ‘working poor'. People will not be able to make ends meet with the wages they get through employment. They will be dependent, as many American employees are, on what they find in the tipping bowl at the end of each day. The great social and economic danger is that we will end up with an American-style working poor and our way of life will change. We will change from a society that is interested in community standards, safety nets and making sure people do not fall through the cracks into a dog-eat-dog society. The third area where you find the basis of the public policy evil of these measures is the attack upon the trade union movement. There is a fundamental difference between Labor's attitude to the trade union movement and the attitude of the government. The government's starting point, the government's political and philosophical policy position, is that there is no role for the trade union movement in the social and economic affairs of modern Australian society. That is not our view; we reject that view. I need only give two examples. I recall the Sunday morning in October last year on which the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Prime Minister called together all the business organisations and industry representatives for a briefing on what might be contained in the government's Work Choices legislation. There was not one person in that room who had lifted a finger to help the asbestosis and mesothelioma victims of James Hardie. When the asbestosis and mesothelioma victims of James Hardie needed some assistance, who came to their assistance? The organised trade union movement, through the ACTU and its constituent unions. The second example, Beaconsfield, is a shining example of how trade union activity can assure a sensible approach to occupational health and safety. Despite these two examples, the government takes the view that there is no role for the union movement to play in the social and economic affairs of Australian society. We reject that. The regulations in particular have a range of measures which seek to exclude what to date has been known as common and respected union activity. When you move to the regulations, there are a couple of points that are worthy of making. Firstly is the erence in the regulations to the so-called prohibited content. Prohibited content is where it is not open to an individual or a ion to suggest in either an individual agreement or a collective agreement that certain matters can be subject to that agreement. One matter is unfair dismissal. If an employer and an employee decide that an employee ought to have some appropriate unfair dismissal rights, the government rules that out-that is prohibited content. In accordance with the legislation, if you seek to include in an agreement prohibited content, an individual can be up for a fine of $6,600 and a union can be up for a fine of $33,000. So even if an individual employer and an individual employee determine that it is appropriate for an employee to have unfair dismissal rights, that is prohibited content so far as an agreement is concerned. We on this side always thought that the government's attitude was that people should be free to make choices, that people should be able to agree about whatever they want to agree about; but, under this legislation and these regulations, people can only agree to what the minister regards as being politically or philosophically correct. The second area of interest in the prohibited content is the prohibition of any agreement referring to trade union training. This has been the subject of conversation with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who is seated at the table, during question time this week and in earlier weeks. There is one issue that the minister refuses to seize in any way whatsoever and that he walks a million miles away from: he refuses to acknowledge that prohibited content in his regulation includes the granting of leave for trade union training, including occupational health and safety training. That is the issue the minister walks a million miles away from. When you actually look at the regularef- tions, what do you find? You find this extraordinary effort by the government, by the Prime Minister and the minister to ensure un- that nothing can be contained in an agreement unless they think it is politically or philosophically kosher, and that is best reflected by the unfair dismissal arrangements and the training issue that I have referred to being made prohibited content. The other point that needs to be made about the regulations and the legislation is extraordinary complexity, evident in the volumes of legislation I have here. I have only bothered to bring down with me the act as amended and the regulations. I have not even bothered to bring down the volumes of explanatory memoranda for the legislation or the supplementary explanatory material for the regulations. Is this a single, simple system? It is massive complexity. And how much time did the government give its so called friends in business, particularly small business, and industry to try and come to grips with this? The government proclaimed the legislation effective for 27 March. The regulations were published on the website in the dark of night on the weekend of 18 and 19 March. That was a week. Thanks very much! So we have here miles and miles of complex legislation-a jurisdictional and regulatory dog's breakfast. It is not just me who is saying that. We remember the No. 3 man in the government-the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin-going off to his soul mates at the HR Nicholls Society, the society that the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister drew up the documentation for and was one of the founding members of. When Senator Minchin turned up to the HR Nicholls Society, he said two things: ‘We apologise for not going as far as we would want to, but we do have to take note of community concerns. But rest assured, be reliably assured, that when we win the next election we will have a third wave.' The government, not having gone to the last election telling the Australian community that it had this in mind-on the contrary, saying precisely the opposite-now has the secret plan that, should it get elected at the next election, we will have the third wave and truly satisfy the government's friends at the HR Nicholls Society. I was interested to hear a representative of its the HR Nicholls Society make a point on the issue of complexity and regulatory burden. Far from taking the view that the government's legislation and regulations were somehow an attempt at deregulation, he said that it was massive regulation and described it as a ‘Soviet style command control state'. He did so not just because of the reason that I have outlined but also because of the extraordinary reporting provisions and requirements that the minister has inserted into the legislation and regulations concerning the Office of the Employment Advocate and the Industrial Relations Commission. So what do we have in this legislation and regulation? And why should the House disallow these regulations and set the scene for the tearing up of this legislation? It should do so because there is a massive attack on the living standards of Australian working families, a massive attack on the living standards of Australian employees, a massive attack on the characteristics and values and virtues that Australians have held dear for over 100 years and a massive attack on the legitimate activities of the trade union movement to play a role in the modern social and economic affairs of Australian society. It is not as if it were even done competently. It is a jurisdictional and regulatory dog's breakfast. It is massively complex and places onerous burden on business, particularly small business. We have seen since the legislation came into effect on 27 March any number of examples of how these measures are working to massively disadvantage Australian families. If it is not unfair dismissals, it is shoving people onto AWAs of inferior standards. And for what-to achieve any so-called economic effect? One interesting point about the budget was that the Prime Minister, at the time the legislation went through the House, made the assertion that the mere adoption of these proposals would see employment growth in our economy. What do we find in the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister's budget papers? We find in the out years an indication that employment growth will fall. So there is no economic benefit. It is a massive attack on living standards, it is a massive attack the Australian way of life and it is a massive attack on the trade union movement. As a consequence, this House should disallow these regulations and, in due course, under a Labor government, rip up this legislation.",19
4,The SPEAKER,REGULATIONS,Is the motioned seconded?,24
5,Mr BEAZLEY,REGULATIONS,I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,24
6,Mr ANDREWS,REGULATIONS,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (9.22 am)-If anybody listening to the debate this morning on the motion to disallow the Workplace Relations Regulations had been out of Australia or somewhere isolated in the world for the last 10 years they would have thought that they had come back in 1996 because the rhetoric being used today once again by the Labor Party was exactly the rhetoric that we heard 10 years ago when the workplace relations legislation was introduced and passed by this parliament. I remind the House that the member for Perth, who moved this motion, and his seconder, the Leader of the Opposition, used precisely the same rhetoric in 1996 and 1997 about the Workplace Relations Act. They told us that the sky was going to fall in 1996 and 1997. They told us then that the living standards of Australians would be driven down as a consequence of the changes made to workplace relations in Australia. They told us that all sorts of adverse impacts would result for the men and women, the families and children of Australia as a conseover quence of these changes. In the last 10 years, partly because of those economic reforms and partly because of the good management of this government over that decade, we have seen just the contrary occur. We have seen the creation of almost two million jobs for Australians over on the past decade. We have seen wages increase in this country by something like 16 per cent in real terms over the last 10 years. I contrast that with what happened to wages for 13 years under the previous Labor government in Australia when real wages increased by about 1.2 per cent. Indeed, part of that time during the 1980s, real wages in Australia went backwards as a result of the accord between the ACTU and the then Labor government. Whatever piece of economic data one likes to take-or, collectively, the economic data that is published-it corresponds to the anecdotal evidence and the experiences of ordinary Australians and that is that the last decade has seen rising prosperity for the men and women of this country. Part of the reason for that is the preparedness of this government to undertake economic reform so that we can build for the future rather than, as we hear once again this morning from the member for Perth, simply looking at the past. In a sense, this debate is a proxy for the differences between the government and the Labor Party. It is a proxy in the sense that the government is prepared to engage in continuous reform in this country so that prosperity can continue in the future, versus an in opposition whose rhetoric is about ripping up and rolling back and taking us backward. Ripping up these laws is ripping up, including the Work Choices laws, the workplace relations laws of 1996. What the opposition would like to do is undo the change that has been brought about in this country the last decade or so and take us back to the 1980s and beyond. But the reality isand I believe the people of Australia know this-that the preparedness of a government to undertake continuing reform has been one of the hallmarks of ensuring that this country continues to prosper. The rhetoric, of course, has not really changed from the opposition. The phrase today is ‘rip up'. It reminds me of that other phrase which was used a few years ago by the Leader of the Opposition-‘roll back'. It is a similar sort of thing-‘We're going to roll it all back, we're going to rip it up, going to look backwards to the past,' rather than looking to the future and how we can ensure that the prosperity of this country continues. The member for Perth commented about living standards. What has happened to living standards in Australia over the last 10 years? Those living standards have substantially increased for Australians. I do not think anybody in this country denies the increased living standards that ordinary Australians have experienced over the last 10 years, yet we still have this head-in-the-sand attitude from the opposition towards moving to the future. The member for Perth talked about the way of life and the capacity of the trade union movement as something which may be closer to the objectives of the Labor Party with regard to its opposition to this legislation. He talked about the minimum wage. He said that there is some unfairness about having an Australian Fair Pay Commission set the minimum wage-not only the minimum wage, I should point out, but all the classification wages in Australia in the future-as somehow suggesting that trying to give people the opportunity of a job and also maintaining a safety net is not about fairness for ordinary Australians. Whilst a national unemployment rate of five per cent is a far cry from the double digit figures that we saw under the Labor Party when, I remind the House, the Leader of the Opposition was the minister responsible for employment in this country, the reality is that there are still some hundreds of thousands of Australians without a job. Policies that give more of our fellow men and women in Australia the opportunity to have a job are surely policies based on fairness in this sense. We have also heard about the unfair dismissal laws but nothing about the rorting and we're the abuse of those laws in the past. What about the situation where an employee is caught red-handed thieving from their employer and an industrial tribunal orders reinstatement or compensation? What about the situation of an employee engaged in gross sexual harassment of another employee in the workplace, where an industrial tribunal orders reinstatement? What about the range of other abuses of the unfair dismissal laws, but we hear not a word from the opposition about those? The reality is, as I have gone around Australia over the last few weeks since the introduction of the Work Choices legislation, that small and medium sized business operators have told me how they have employed another worker or two because they no longer fear what would happen with the unfair dismissal laws. In every state of Australia. I have had small and medium sized business operators come to me and volunteer information that they have employed somebody else because of the removal of the fear about what would happen under an unfair dismissal regime. But, obviously, we hear nothing about that from the opposition. The member for Perth was getting to the core of his real objection to the Work Choices legislation when he said that it was an attack on the trade union movement in Australia. After all, it is the trade union movement in Australia that not only funds but controls the Australian Labor Party. What is it? Since 1996 $50 million has been donated by unions in Australia to the Australian Labor Party. Look at the backgrounds of the members who sit opposite, and overwhelmingly they are from the union movement. Overwhelmingly they represent that single occupation in life in Australia-that is, officials of trade unions. But the reality is that trade unions continue to operate under this legislation. The right of entry of trade union officials is prosingle tected under this legislation. The right of trade unions to represent workers is protected under this legislation. The reality is that collective agreements, since 27 March when Work Choices came into operation, have continued to be negotiated by trade unions in Australia and are being lodged and renewed under this system. In addition to that, trade union officials can act as bargainago, ing agents where people are seeking to enter into an individual contract. Again, the role the trade unions is protected in this legislation. The right to take protected industrial action, which can be motivated by a union, is not only protected under legislation but has actually been used by trade unions under this legislation. This overblown rhetoric that somehow Work Choices is destroying the role of trade unions in Australia and the place that they have had in this country for a century is simply nonsense. It does not stack up when you look at the facts. This is the problem with argument the opposition continues to mount against this legislation. The problem essentially is that it does not stack up when the facts are taken into account. If you just want overblown rhetoric about ripping up legislation and ripping up regulations, that is fine. But, in the end, rhetoric is not going to do anything for the advancement of the economy in this country. The member for Perth talked about its complexity. As my friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, who is at the table, pointed out, the complexity we have in Australia is a situation where there are something like 4,000 separate awards operating. Somebody calculated that there is an industrial award for every 27 employees in this country. That is the complexity which has built up over time in this country. We are saying that we should have one national system of industrial relations. We cannot achieve that overnight because of constraints in the Constitution. But what we have been able to do, by using the corporations power in the Constitution, is effectively bring 80 to 85 per cent of employees in this country into a single industrial relations system. If the other states beyond Victoria, which handed over its powers some years were to follow the course of Victoria then we would finally achieve one national of system of industrial relations in this country. The Labor Party is defending an industrial relations system that was established in the early part of the last century-when Australia operated as separate colonial economies largely removed from one another-an industrial relations system established over a century ago to address the industrial problems of the 1890s in Australia. That is the attitude of the Labor Party: there is a sentimental attachment to the conditions and the economy of this country at the time of Fedthe eration rather than a preparedness to look forward to the way in which we grow our economy into the future. As I said before, this debate is a proxy for the different attitudes of the parties in Australia as to our economic performance. Do we want to grow this economy into the future by continuing to take significant economic reforms that will best place us to grow into the future or do we simply say we are going to rip things up, roll them back and take Australia back to the 1970s and the 1980s? That is essentially what this debate is about, when we go beyond the subject matter we are looking at today-namely, the industrial relations regulations. That is the argument being advanced by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Perth in the comments they have made today, will make today and no doubt will make into the future. The criticisms basically go to the fear of the union bosses that their privileged sun will be removed. They are concerned with that rather than with what is good for Australian families and Australian workers. We have seen a major economic increase. Our current prosperity is even the subject of comment in overseas newspapers. In recent weeks an English newspaper reported that Australia is: ... rolling into its 16th year of uninterrupted growth ... and that it manages to combine: ... the vigour of American capitalism with the humanity of European welfare, yet suffering drawbacks of neither. And it manages this while keeping a consistent budget surplus. That is what this is about. It is about how we continue to grow Australia into the future at a time when we face significant challenges. One challenge is the demographic change this country is moving through-that is, the ageing of the population and the fact that, as a consequence of that, a massive reduction in the growth of the workforce in this country is starting to occur. The Productivity Commission said in a report a year or so ago that we have to ensure we grow our productivity and increase the number of people participating in the workforce in Australia if we want to sustain the economic growth that we have enjoyed in this country in the past. That is the reality behind this. We know, for example, that greater flexibility in the workplace correlates with higher productivity. Those industries, those businesses and those sectors of the economy that have embraced the flexibility of the workplace relations legislation tend to have the highest productivity of businesses in Australia. Consequently, they pay the best wages and provide the best conditions to the employees. Conversely, those locked into the rigidities of the old award system tend to have little or no productivity and there is a corresponding outcome for the place in the workers in that area. This essentially is about whether we go forward or backwards. This government is committed to going forward, to making careful, significant reforms such as these so that the conditions that Australian workers have today are more likely to continue into the future and the prosperity that this country is enjoying today is more likely to continue into the future. The alternative is the backward-looking rhetoric that we have heard from the member for Perth and no doubt are about to hear from the Leader of the Opposithe tion. The motion should be defeated.",24
7,Mr BEAZLEY,REGULATIONS,"We have just heard 15 minutes of pure humbug about the propositions that we are deliberating on in this place, the regulations that are associated with the Workplace Relations Act. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations talks a lot about going forwards or going backwards. These regulations and the act on which they are based, via a Soviet process of bureaucratisation in terms of centralising power in the hands of the minister, take us back to a 19th century master-servant relationship. We have here a curious mix in these regulations of Soviet-style, line-by-line regulation of the relationships between employers and their employees, with an ultimate, Soviet works minister, power of intervention on the part of the minister to strike out anything that he finds offensive in any agreement, collective or individual, reached anywhere in this country, basically to enforce the precept which underpins this legislation-that we need to get back to the 19th century masterservant relationship. It is true that, until very recently, in community we enjoyed a substantial increase in productivity in our workplaces. That productivity has gone off the boil in the last two years. But that surge in productivity coincided with the implementation of the changes to the industrial relations legislation made by the Labor Party in 1994. The enormous expansion that you have seen in the ability of workers, through enterprise agreements, to earn substantial payments above the awards that once existed and to introduce flexibility into the practices under those awards were entirely a product of the negotiated arrangements between the then government, business and the union movement on what we ought to do to improve the productivity in our workplaces by enhancing the capacity of our industrial relations systems to reflect the needs of every workplace. The product of that has been substantial improvement in the living standards of many Australians and, until recently, substantial improvement in productivity. The minister talked about the remarks made by Mr Smith and me on a number of occasions on the legislation that has been brought down. He identified those remarks with remarks that we made at the time the government had its first go, the first wave of their changes to industrial relations legislation in this country. I remind the minister there were 230 successful amendments to that legislation. The legislation, when it passed through the parliament, bore no resemblance to the act put into this place by the minister at the time, which was appropriately characterised, by me and others, as attacking the basic living standards, conditions and rights of the ordinary Australian. So there is no point in his defending himself on this occasion by reference to our words then. The government of the day was not permitted to do what it wanted to do-to recreate 19th century conditions in the Australian this workforce. At the time, the act that it was attempting to put in place bore absolutely no resemblance to one aspect of what the government is intending to do here: to assign to the minister of the day such exceptional interventionist powers in every agreement, collectively or individually arrived at by workers and their employers. That was his particular innovation. He took the unfair aspects of the original, unamended, legislation of the first wave, and added to it a level of Soviet bureaucratisation which surprised and took aback those on this side of the House, who had never anticipated that we would have to debate Soviet-style legislation in this country. The simple point is that ordinary hard working Australians expect to be rewarded when they work hard. They expect to be able to negotiate hours that sustain decent family life-that they can advance their families, advance their interests and participate as constructive members of the community. They expect to have job security. They expect to know that they can go to their workplace and that, if their employer or supervisor suggests something to them that is untoward, they can express an objection to that without fear of being sacked. They expect to be able to go into their workplace and not be harassed by their employer or supervisor, that improperly or in any other way, and they expect that, if they are so harassed, they can raise a complaint and not find that it becomes a pretext, or that some other pretext is used, to sack them. They expect to emerge from the workplace rewarded for effort, with security for their families, and secure in their dignity in this most important aspect of their lives. The two most important aspects of anyone's life are their family life and their workplace life. That is where they spend most of their lives; that is where they their energy and creativity. And they do not expect, in either place, to live with intimidafamily tion, indignity and deprivation. That is what ordinary Australians, middle Australians, expect, and that is what this government intends, in its regulatory arrangements here, to deny. The member for Perth made a whole lot of relevant points about the extraordinary complexity of this legislation. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs shouted across the table to me, ‘But what about the 4,000 awards?' I replied, ‘So you actually are going to knock off every award in this country?' He very quickly came back and said, ‘No, no; it would be merely the simplification of those awards.' So what we are going to have is this legislation, plus 4,000 awards that we are going to fight over. That, apparently, is view of what a simplified system would be. What we actually have here, as was pointed out by Mr Smith, is a massive bureaucratisation of the workplace process. As with the so-called reform of the tax act through the GST, we now have an act instead of regulations that we can take around this country, and, as we denounce them before we rip them up, we can use them as a soapbox from which we can speak. Even the shortest members of the opposition will be capable of being seen when they stand upon these regulations and this act in order to nounce them. I want to go into what has been the practical effect of the new arrangements so far. The intention here is absolutely clear. The intention of this government is to make it easy to rip away penalty rates, which are the principal mechanism by which employees in this country are rewarded for their decision to work overtime, on difficult shifts or in holidays. The intention is to use these regulaput all tions to rip away all those payments. Everybody who knows anything about life in this country, particularly in areas where people are heavily mortgaged, knows that the way in which ordinary Australian families organise their financial affairs to withstand the consequences of high mortgage payments is for one or both spouses to work a great deal of time at penalty rates. That is simply the case for most Australian families, at least for a substantial period of their lives. You could not cut to the heart of family life and family stability more quickly and more atrociously than to produce a set of regulations that produced the conditions these ones do. Let us not kid ourselves here. The new arrangements have had an immediate impact. This act is impacting on ordinary working life in this country much faster than I anticitheir pated it would. When we were debating the original legislation in this chamber, I used the analogy of an infestation of termites. From what we have seen so far, I have to say that they are a very hungry bunch of termites indeed. They are chomping away very solidly. We have the example of 100 victims of Work Choices-garbage collectors employed by local councils on the New South Wales Central Coast. They stand to lose up to $340 a week after their jobs were put out to tender in a form that meant that if they took those de- jobs back they would effectively lose their penalty rates. We saw another impact in the negotiations currently occurring with childcare workers in New South Wales. They have been offered contracts that slash between $138 and $313 from their wages and reduce or remove sick pay entitlements, rest breaks, annual leave loadings and overtime payments. In a school in recent times we saw another way in which the regulations permit these matters to be dealt with in a negotiation. The employees in all positions at that schoolthe teachers and all the other workers at the school-had it pointed out to them that their jobs are now up for grabs. They can reapply for those jobs, but they will have to reapply on the basis of a very substantial reduction their earning capacities and other rights. There is the situation of the Cowra abattoir workers-sacked one day and offered their jobs back the next, all with slashed pay packets and reduced conditions. The minister panicked when he saw what the employers had done at Cowra and ensured that there was intervention. He proudly boasted of that. But what was the one question he could not answer at the press conference he conducted subsequently, when the journalists were wise enough to say, ‘Okay, the employers have backed off for the moment, but was what they did legal? Was what they did legal under the laws that you have put in place?' The minister could not answer that question-not because he did not know the answer to it but because he knew that the answer would embarrass him grossly. He knew that he would have to say: ‘Well, what they did was not opportune, but it was legal. They embarrassed us by acting too fast, not by acting illegally.' We have had that case. We have had another case in Ballarat where 39 local workers were sacked while their company continued to rely on employing Chinese workers. We are seeing more and more examples of this around the country now. People are brought into this country on temporary working visas. These are not long-term skilled migrants who are part of the process of building this nation, enhancing our long-term wealth and improving the character of our community by bringing into it new and interesting ideas and cultures. They are not that section of skilled workers. These are people brought into this country explicitly and specifically to undermine the working conditions of Australians. When an employer decides-on the basis of what they are permitted to do under these massively complex regulations-to mount an attack on the living standards of modestly well-paid Australian workers, there is somebody else in there to do the work. They have to be put out on the grass by the employer while they go through the process of negotiating their conditions down. On other occasions in this place we have had occasion to mention practices such as bringing in foreign youngsters to replace our young Australians as apprentices-all of these things to do with the provision of temporary work visas. Every aspect of these regulations and all aspects of that act-we are simply going to rip them up. They are malevolent and evil in their intent, absolutely unnecessary in the workforce that we have and un-Australian. These have not been Australian practices at any time since the 19th century. There is no saving any aspect of them. We will put a fair system in place in this country, a system with the flexibilities that will ensure that people are able to bargain in good faith and produce the decent sorts of outcomes that we have been capable of producing in this country and that we continue to be capable of producing in this country.

8,Mr BARRESI,REGULATIONS,"One reason we are here this morning debating this disallowance motion is that the Leader of the Opposition's leadership is under pressure. He has Combet and Shorten looking over his shoulder. Another reason we are debating this motion today is that the member for Perth is under pressure. The member for Perth has every member of the backbench and the union movement looking at him and saying, ‘You're not muscling up.' Combet told the ALP, ‘Muscle up, get your act together or we'll review our support.' And what support is that? It is $50 million worth of support. Make no mistake: the ALP is under pressure. The Leader of the Opposition is under pressure and the member for Perth is under pressure. They have the hide to come into this chamber and say that our Work Choices legislation is extreme legislation. I will tell you what is extreme: the language that is creeping into the member for Brand's speeches these days. That is what is extreme. It is interesting that an article in today's tralian talks about the growing tendency for members of the ALP to use xenophobic type language. It is not about skilled migration from other countries; it is: ‘Let's talk about India, let's talk about Chinese migrants and divert people's attention.' That is extreme.",30
9,Unknown,REGULATIONS,Opposition members interjecting,31
10,Mr BARRESI,REGULATIONS,"The fact that members on the other side are interjecting in such a loud way when I at least had the courtesy to listen to themMrs Irwin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is quite obvious that the member opposite is not interested in the workers of Australia. He is not talking to",31
11,The SPEAKER,REGULATIONS,"The member for Fowler will come straight to her point of order. Mrs Irwin-The point of order is on relevance, Mr Speaker.",31
12,The SPEAKER,REGULATIONS,The member for Fowler will resume her seat. I will rule on the point of order. The member for Deakin has only just begun his speech and he is in order. I call the honourable member for Deakin.,31
13,Mr BARRESI,REGULATIONS,"In fact, skilled migration was not introduced by me into the debate on this motion; it was introduced by the member for Brand. Extreme language was not introduced by me; it was introduced by those on the other side. The motive behind this disallowance motion is very much what I am talking about. The motivation is that they need to muscle up. This motion represents nothing more than a final attempt to delay the implementation of the Work Choices act. It is simply a lastditch effort by the opposition when they know that the Work Choices legislation is being embraced by the Australian community. The ALP's last-ditch effort is just a Aussham. The member for Perth is under pressure. He claims that this legislation is an attack on unions, that we on this side believe that unions will have no role as a result of this legislation. It is an exaggerated position and one which would be great for the union movement to hear. It is wrong. The unions' role, as evidenced at Beaconsfield-and I take my hat off to the AWU-will continue to exist and is very appropriate. There is nothing in this Work Choices legislation that will prevent that role from taking place. In fact, I would say to the union movement that they will have greater opportunities to show their relevance in the industrial relations setting because of this legislation. Mr Adams-What about penalty rates?",31
14,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,REGULATIONS,The member for Lyons knows better.,31
15,Mr BARRESI,REGULATIONS,"The regulations are claimed to be extraordinarily complex. That, too, is a fraudulent argument. Those on the other side know that the great bulk of the Work Choices legislation and the regulations are very much transition arrangements which need to take place over the next three to five years. The regulations are largely machinery or transitional in nature and are necessary for the effective operation of the Workplace Relations Act. Disallowing these regulations will do nothing to assist employers and employees, and it is absolutely irresponsible those on the other side to move this motion. The regulations subject to the disallowance motion fall broadly into two categories. They are machinery regulations made under the Workplace Relations Act-and the Labor Party knows that-and are necessary for the effective ongoing operation of the act. They are also transitional regulations. Despite hysterical ranting of the Labor Party and the union movement, there is nothing new or earth-shattering in these regulations. I will go through some of the content of the regulations. They prescribe the relationship between state and territory laws and the Workplace Relations Act. They provide detail on when a workplace agreement provides a more favourable outcome for an employee than the Australian fair pay conditions and when a preserved award term relating to annual, personal or parental leave is more generous than the standard. They clarify the cumstances in which medical certificates are valid. They set out prohibited content for purposes of workplace agreements. They provide for a trade union membership deduction from an employee's wages, something which those on the other side should be in agreement with. They confer a right or remedy in relation to unfair dismissal, and they set out procedures for secret ballots on protected industrial action, which has actually been in force since a few days ago. They provide for retention and inspection of employee records and establish a system on infringement notices. They deal with the handling of matters which were part heard in state and federal jurisdictions and with matters before state tribunals. These are some the things that the regulations cover. And these are the regulations that the ALP are moving to disallow through this motion and, of course, they will fail. The Labor Party and union campaign is a of ridiculous campaign. We have heard from Labor and the unions, and particularly from the Leader of the Opposition, that these measures allow the minister to interfere in every aspect of people's lives. That is wrong. Currently, under section 43 and 44 of the old Workplace Relations Act, the minister can intervene in proceedings before the Industrial the Relations Commission. That responsibility and that right is there now. So there is nothing new there. This power of intervention is replicated in sections 102 and 103 of the act. But those opposite have not looked at the act; they have not looked at these sections. They are simply mouthing the rhetoric that Combet, Burrow and other members of the union movement have asked them to utter. They can go back to their offices today; they can send an email back to Sussex Street and Lygon Street and say, ‘Hey, we moved a motion today. It got defeated but, listen, we've cirdone our bit-so lay off.' Of course, their language will continue to become more exthe treme and more xenophobic as the days go on. It is a shame to see the Leader of the Opposition resorting to those sorts of tactics. The other thing about the union and Labor campaign is that the requirement for the Industrial Relations Commission to provide detailed information to the minister on a range of matters is not new. It broadly reflects section 48A of the previous act and schedule 12 of the previous regulations, which set out detailed reporting requirements for the Industrial Relations Commission. The new regulations provide that the commission and the Office of the Employment Advocate can provide certain information to the minisof ter that is essential, and those elements are replicated from the old system into the new system. The campaign by the union movement and the ALP has been characterised by untruths, misleading claims and scare tactics. The opponents of the government changes have slandered and maligned employers, labelling them as reactionary scrooges. This selfindulgent rhetoric of the union movement and the Labor Party ignores the reality of the modern workplace, where employers and employees are not pitted against each other in a battle of supremacy but simply want to ensure that individual skills are fully and fairly utilised. They do not like it, but they are proposing to take us back to pre-Keating days, and they say they will rip up the legislation and the regulations. If they take us back to pre-Keating days, let me remind those on the other side of what Mr Keating said in 1993: Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals. … … … Over time the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards, with fewer clauses. … … … We need to find a way of extending the coverage of agreements from being add-ons to awards to being full substitutes for awards. That is what Paul Keating, the then Prime Minister, said. And what the members on the other side are trying to do now is to take us to before even those days. The statement by Keating that ‘we need to find a way of extending the coverage of agreements from being add-ons to awards to being full substitutes' is precisely where we are today with this third stage of reforms. We are simply freeing up the marketplace. We are providing the opportunity for individuals and their employers to have greater flexibility and to come to arrangements which suit and fit the needs of both parties. The Labor Party supported the old system because it gave power to the unions, and the unions, of course, are the ones that provide financial support to the Labor Party. We heard from the minister about the $50 million contribution since 1996. That is a lot of money. Mr Adams-Talk about productivity.",31
16,Mr BARRESI,REGULATIONS,"Talk about productivity? Sure, talk about productivity, member for Lyons, because what we have at the moment in this country is productivity improvements, and these industrial relations changes we are introducing will further extend the productivity gains we have made over the last 10 years. We will have economic prosperity for this nation. We have seen real wages growth of 16 per cent and employment growth of over 1½ million people, and that will continue. We have a shortage of workers out there in the marketplace, and the union movement and the Labor Party simply want to get in the way of those productivity gains and the economic prosperity that we have already seen. This parliament has already given significant consideration to the Work Choices reform. It has passed this important legislation. It gives Australia a workplace relations system designed for the 21st century, a system which looks to the future, not to the past. The legislation was debated in this House, and over 23 hours of debate took place. The other place debated Work Choices for more than 32 hours, and now we have this stunt. Contrary to what the critics suggest, Work Choices will not usher in a system that exposes employees to exploitation. Rather, Work Choices puts in place a clear set of minimum wages and conditions and a less confusing and bureaucratic process for agreement making at the workplace. The government has enshrined in law minimum conditions of employment and has ensured that pre-reform award wages and basic working conditions, including the right to be represented by a union, are protected by law. Under Work Choices there are comprehensive transitional arrangements to assist employers and employees in the move to the new system, and these regulations set out a lot of those transitional arrangements. The government wants to give more Australians the chance at a job and to drive down our unemployment rate even further. Mr Ripoll-And drive down the wages.",33
17,Mr BARRESI,REGULATIONS,We are determined to put economic reality back at the centre of workplace regulations-it is where we should have been all along-to give more Australians the opportunity to participate in the Australian workplace. Those on the other side say that we will be driving down wages. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has shown that workers on AWAs in fact earn 13 per cent more than workers on certified agreements and 100 per cent more than workers on awards. Ms George interjecting,34
18,Mr BARRESI,REGULATIONS,"The intervention from the other side is laughable, when we have people on AWAs earning 30 per cent more than those on certified agreements. This motion is a sham. Put simply, it is a reaction to pressure from the union movement. We have had a $50-million tail wagging the dog. As we know, whenever our little pet dog strays from home, it must be brought back, disciplined and reminded of where home and the food bowl are. We need to make sure that our dog is trained not to stray from home again. We have here a $50-million tail wagging the dog. That is the only reason we have this motion before us today-and it should be rejected.",34

21,Mr LLOYD,RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT,"Robertson-Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads) (10.25 am)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Australia has a proud heritage in health and medical research, which I am sure we all on both sides of the House support. Australian health professionals, scientists and academics have helped to improve the quality of life of millions of people in Australia and throughout the world. Since September 1936, the National Health and Medical Research Council (otherwise known as the NHMRC) has played a pivotal role in funding and supporting health and medical research in Australia. The NHMRC's role, responsibilities and functions were eventually enacted through legislation in 1992. In 1999, the government undertook to increase annual funding for health and medical research through the NHMRC from $165 million in 1998-99 to more than $350 million in 2004-05. Further, the Minister for Health and Ageing announced on 21 March 2006 that the Australian government will provide a further $9.8 million for health research into chronic diseases, Indigenous health and the recovery process of older Australians who have been hospitalised. This brings the federal government's investment in health and medical research through the NHMRC to more than $490 million this year, more than double the 1999 figure. The council has provided high quality advice on medical research, health ethics and health. A number of recent reviews have, however, identified governance concerns. These are: - the Governance of the National Health and Medical Research Council report published by the Australian National Audit Office in February 2004; and - the Sustaining the virtuous cycle for a healthy, competitive Australia: investment review of health and medical research-final report published by the Investment Review of Health and Medical Research Committee in December 2004. In response, this bill improves the NHMRC's corporate governance, including reporting and accountability frameworks, congruent with the principles of good governance as adopted by the Australian government in 2003 following the review of corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders by Mr John Uhrig AC. It is proposed that, from 1 July 2006, the NHMRC be established as a statutory agency for the purposes of the Public Service Act 1999 and as a prescribed agency under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. The new agency will remain within the Health and Ageing portfolio, with reporting and accountability frameworks that clearly separate the NHMRC roles and functions from those of the Department of Health and Ageing. The bill's provisions strengthen the NHMRC's independence, promote clear lines of responsibility for governance and financial accountability and allow the council to focus on issues relating to medical and biological research and advice. Previously, the NHMRC's chief executive officer has had a cumbersome accountability framework with three concurrent lines of reporting, including: - the Minister for Health and Ageing - the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing and - the council itself. Under this bill, the chief executive officer will report directly to the Minister for Health and Ageing, while keeping the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing informed on a ‘no surprises' basis. These changes will provide the NHMRC with clearer delineation of responsibility and accountability in management, advice and strategic development. The NHMRC will retain its name and will include the CEO, staff, council, principal committees and working committees. Whilst the accountability and reporting structure has been streamlined, the roles and functions of the council, the principal committees and working committees have not been altered. The council will continue to provide independent expert advice and inquire into medical research and health related issues, including issuing guidelines and advising the government and community on matters relating to: - the improvement of health; - the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease; - the provision of health care; - public health research and medical research; and - ethical issues relating to health. The proposed legislation prescribes that membership of the council consist of 19 members, with provision for additional expert members as required from time to time. Whilst this represents a reduction from the current 29 council members, requirements for appointments, including qualifications and experience, remain largely unaltered. This will enable the council to be more effective whilst retaining its high level of expertise. The administrative requirements for appointment processes have also been streamlined. Whereas previously it has taken up to eight months to complete some appointments, more effective consultation and administrative processes will help to ensure appointments can be made in an efficient and timely manner. The term for council membership will continue to be three years. The new agency will be financially autonomous, with direct appropriations, and the CEO will be responsible and accountable for the financial and day-today operations of the agency. As the biotechnology, health and medical industries in Australia continue to strengthen and grow, the provisions included in this bill will enable the NHMRC to: - be more responsive to emerging health priorities and issues; - explore innovative collaborations and industry joint ventures; and - provide greater transparency and accountability in its operations. The research committee will continue to recommend funding for research proposals and monitor the use of research funding. The research committee, as with all principal committees of the agency, will report to the CEO on operational and financial matters, but will report to council on technical matters concerning health and medical research. The bill will not affect the level of funding the government has allocated for health and medical research, but provides for a more effective, efficient, accountable and responsive agency. These changes will see the NHMRC better placed to operate as a leader in Australia's internationally recognised health and medical research sector. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Leave granted for second reading debate to continue immediately.",36
22,Ms GILLARD,RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT,"Can I thank the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads for standing in for the Minister for Health and Ageing. Whilst it is not like me to be generous to the minister for health, I think perhaps the House could note that he is in attendance at the National Palliater tive Care Week function, particularly the launch of Parents in Care, which is an important event and one that I had intended to be at myself but for the unfortunate clash that the National Health and Medical Research Council Amendment Bill 2006 is before the House now. So I think we can forgive the minister for health his lack of attendance to his duties in the House for this hour. His lack of attendance for the remaining hours in the week still requires explanation, but at least we have an explanation for this hour.",38
23,Mr LLOYD,RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT,I thank the shadow minister for her comments.,38
24,Ms GILLARD,RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT,"Thank you. As the minister has outlined, the purpose of this bill is to amend the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 to introduce new governance arrangements and to clarify accountability and reporting functions for the National Health and Medical Research Council. These new arrangements will establish the NHMRC as a statutory agency. The chief executive officer will be responsible for the primary functions of the agency and will report to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Previously the council of the NHMRC was responsible for both governance matters and expert scientific advice. The new division of responsibility will allow the council to focus on expert scientific advice whilst the chief executive officer will have day-today responsibility for the operation of the agency. As the minister has outlined, the proposed changes also streamline the reporting lines of the chief executive officer and the council. The previous arrangement with the NHMRC having three concurrent lines of reporting obviously added complexity to the arrangements. Those three lines of reporting were to the minister, to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing and to the council itself. This bill provides for the chief executive officer to report directly to the miniswhile keeping the secretary informed. Those streamlined arrangements have much to recommend them. The amendments enacted in this bill address the governance issues identified in four major reviews: Sustaining the virtuous cycle for a healthy, competitive Australia: investment review of health and medical research, better known as the Wills report, which was published in December 2004; Governance of the National Health and Medical Research Council, which was an audit report from the Australian National Audit Office in February 2004; Review of corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders, better known as the Uhrig report, which was published in June 2003; and Investment review of health and medical research, better known as the Grant review, which was published in December 2004. These changes which are incorporated in this bill were outlined in a media release from the Minister for Health and Ageing on 7 September 2005. It is interesting to note that, given all of these reports have been around for some time-the most recent of them being in December 2004, which, as we would all know, is some time ago-clearly the minister has been no hurry to make the changes. These changes are claimed by the government toand this statement was made in the second reading speech: ... strengthen the NHMRC's independence, promote clear lines of responsibility for governance and financial accountability and allow the council to focus on issues relating to medical and biologiissues cal research and advice. Given this is the claim made for the bill and these matters are important, it seems that it would have been better if the government, and in particular the minister for health, had brought forward this legislative change far more quickly than leaving it to this stage of 2006. Indeed, both the second reading speech and the minister's media release from September last year highlight the need for the NHMRC to build better links with business to improve investment in research and to explore industry joint ventures. So, beyond the governance arrangements, the statements made in support of the bill have included statements about the need for the NHMRC to build better links with business. Labor is very supportive of the need for more industry support for research and development. We are very supportive of the building of better links with business. We certainly need to see better translational research, but we would be concerned if this is a foundation stone for the government at some point in the future-and I acknowledge it would be some point in the future-seeking to withdraw levels of government support which otherwise would have flowed on the basis that private funds have gone into meet that gap. We obviously want to see the government keeping up effort in this area and private sector involvement being on top of that. I will come to the specific issue of the recent budget and the allocations to health and medical research a little bit later, but I make that comment in the context of the longer term. At the same time that the bill was introduced, the government also introduced the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2006, which takes a very heavy-handed approach to the Australian Research Council, abolishing the board and the council's ability to conduct inquiries into national research and make decisions about the effective use of research funds. There is a concern that this will lead to even more examples than those that are already known of and on the public record, where the Minister for Education, Science and Training has objected to funding for specific projects. So we are very concerned about what is happening to the Australian Research Council and the possibility of even further party political style ministerial intervention into research projects. We are very strongly supportive of the Australian Research Council's independence and, given that this bill was introduced at the same time as the bill dealing with the Australian Research Council, we think it is very important to make the point at this stage that Labor would be very deeply concerned about any similar attempt with respect to the National Health and Medical Research Council. We do not contend that this bill about the National Health and Medical Research Council is such an attempt to enable political interference by the minister in the work of the National Health and Medical Research Council but, given the way in which the government is going with the Australian Research Council, we think it is important to indicate our concerns about that direction of government policy at this stage. Labor will be supporting this bill, but we do have some concerns about it and about the willingness of the Howard government to invest in the incredibly important research efforts that are funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council. Our concerns go to the following areas. First, we have concerns about the membership of the council. We oppose the removal of the requirement that membership of the council must include ‘an eminent scientist who has knowledge of public health research and medical research issues, a person with expertise in the trade union movement, a person with expertise in the needs of users of social welfare services and a person with expertise in environmental issues'. We recommend that the requirement for these various areas of expertise remain and that the legislation make it clear that multiple categories of pertise may be found in individuals on the council. Put simply, we do not think that there has been sufficient explanation as to why the removal of these particular categories of pointment to the council is warranted. We think these categories are worthwhile ones to make sure that the council has available to that broad depth of expertise. We note, of course, that given the Howard government's hatred of the trade union movement and its policy bent of making sure the trade union movement is destroyed in this countrynotwithstanding that free trade unions are fundamental to any democracy-we are not surprised to see the removal of the category of a person with expertise in the trade union movement, but all of these categories have been removed. They ought not to have been removed and we would certainly be recommending to the government that they be reincluded. Whilst we support the inclusion of expertise in ethics, particularly in medical research, we seek clarification from the government as to whether the chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee is a member of the new council, as is the case at present. The legislation deals with having a person with specific expertise in ethics relating to research involving human beings. We want to know whether the satisfaction of that requirement will be that the chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee will be a member of the council. So we have concerns about the membership of the council. Secondly, we have concerns with and are opposed to the removal of the need for the federal health minister to consult with state and territory health ministers before appointing the chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee. The bill now requires ‘consulting appropriately'-that is a quote from the bill itself-but it does not contain a definiex- tion of what this might mean, nor any means of certifying that the consultation has been done. So there is a reference to consulting appropriately but no content as to with whom you need to consult or how you need to eviap- dence that that consultation has been done. In our view, this undermines the principle that the NHMRC should be at arm's length it from government and a body that has broad acceptability and responds to national interests rather than those of the particular federal health minister in question. Appointments should always be made on the basis of merit and there should be a formal process in place to ensure that this occurs. This is of course a point that would endure without depending on the political complexion of the government at the time. I think Australians have a right to be assured that appointments to bodies like the NHMRC are not being made on a party political basis. One of the ways of ensuring that is to make sure that there is consultation between the federal government and state and territory governments so that a variety of views are put and that you are getting people on the NHMRC who are respected across the board-respected nationally and respected across the levels of government. Our third concern is in the area of disclosure of interests. We note that the minister is not required to be advised if a member of the council has disclosed an interest. We consider it the responsibility of the minister to know if a member or members disclose an interest. We regard this as a basic accountability issue, not an administrative task as noted in the schedule prepared by the department for the bill. Of course, accountability has not been a strong suit of the Howard government. We certainly do not want to see any repeats of the Robert Gerard appointment, where a responsible minister-in this case the Treasurer-can stand up in this House and say, on a matter that would cause concern about accountability, that he did not believe it was his job to check, which is what he said in this House. He simply did not believe it was his job to check. He does not believe that encompassed in his duties as Treasurer is the need to check on the veracity of qualifications and any issues that might arise when you are making an appointment like the Robert Gerard appointment. We are worried that this bill institutionalises a ter not knowing, not checking and not caring, and that is not good enough on accountability matters. On the question of accountability, we further believe-and we note in this regard the advice of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee-that the altered reporting arrangements raise some accountability issues. We agree with the AVCC recommendation that the bill should be amended to enable expert advice to be provided directly to the minister. So that is a further accountability issue. We would also raise-particularly I suppose this week, of all weeks, though the issue is of ongoing and deep concern to us each and every day-the question of Indigenous health and, consequently, Indigenous health research. We acknowledge the inappropriateness of defining particular research priorities for the NHMRC, but we indicate that we would be concerned if the proposed restructure has the result of diminishing the capacity of the NHMRC to strategically respond to the serious problems of Indigenous health. As we know, Indigenous Australians in this country still have an average life expectancy of 20 years less than the rest of Australia. That continues to be a source of national tragedy and something that we all need to be focused on. We would be concerned if there was a withdrawal of effort in the area of Indigenous health research. We note that significant progress has been made in the area of Indigenous health research in recent times through the involvement of members with Indigenous expertise working across the current committee structure. We certainly would not want to see that good work come to an end as a result of restructured arrangements. That is our list of concerns about these new arrangements. They are not sufficient to minisstop Labor supporting the bill, but we do think that there is considerable food for thought there for the government. Some of them are matters about which the minister could offer a reassurance in dealing with this bill. Some matters require further legislative change. But we believe they should be seriously considered by the Howard government. We are all aware of the value of biomedical research to this country. The NHMRC is Australia's primary funder of biomedical research and development. In 2005-06 the NHMRC provided $447 million for health and medical research. A recent Access Economics report clearly found that support for biomedical research is one of the best investments our nation can make in the well-being of our people. The report states: ... the ... returns from health R&D are so extraorAustralia dinarily high that the pay off from any strategic portfolio of investments is enormous. And: Health R&D must be seen as an investment in wellness with exceptional returns. Historically, Australian health research and development give an annual average return of $5 for every $1 spent on research and development. This can be as high as $8 for cardiovascular research and development and $6 for respiratory research and development. The Access Economics report found that, despite the additional funding flowing as a consequence of the 1999 Wills review, continued boosts to investment in health research and development relative to GDP are warranted, given Australia's poor ranking relative to other OECD countries. As this nation ages and the dependency ratio increases and health spending rises, breakthroughs in research and development are seen as the best way to address the challenge inherent in the cost and impact of chronic disease. The investment review of health and medical research, the Grant review, recommended that the government continue to invest and build on the Wills funding by increasing federal government investment in health and medical research to $1.8 billion by 2008-09, bringing Australia up to the OECD average level of investment of 0.2 per cent of GDP. A key finding of the Grant report was that the government investment through the Wills funding package had already started to deliver results and that further increases in funding for health and medical research will yield similarly considerable health benefits and economic dividends. We do know that Australian researchers are finding life increasingly difficult. A December 2005 paper in the Medical Journal of highlighted the extent of researcher dissatisfaction with funding and the inadequacy of infrastructure support. It is not surprising, but indeed very disturbing, that so many of our best scientists are attracted overseas and stay there. We are concerned in this context that, while there is additional investment in medical research, the budget actually represents a lost opportunity. We believe that the Howard government has no real future strategy for health and medical research. Whilst the Treasurer talks about the need to cut health spending to address the ageing population, he does not seem to appreciate the wise words of the Grant report. Indeed, we have seen in the post-budget period the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Health and Ageing bignoting themselves, in this place and outside, about the funding for the National Health and Medical Research Council that is in the budget. But when you actually work your way through the budget papers you can see that, in contrast to this big-noting, there is a huge opportunity missed here to make a real difference. The government has announced $905 million in research funding in the budget. But let us look at where this funding comes from and when it will be spent. If you do that, the package is considerably smaller than the $905 million that is being boasted about by this arrogant government. Only $590.7 million in funding is provided in the four years from 2006-07 to 2009-10, the four years normally in the budget papers-$215 million is provided in 2005-06 and $99.3 million is provided for the five years beyond July 2010. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be familiar with the fact that, when governments want to pump numbers, they engage in these kinds of devices. Of the total funding package of $900 million, $670 million is provided due to the decision to sell Medibank Private. Labor simply do not agree that $670 million of funding for health and medical research should be made contingent on the sale of Medibank Private. We are opposed to the sale of Medibank Private. The arguments that have been put in support of the sale are completely rious, particularly the argument that the sale of Medibank Private will increase competition in the private health insurance industry. This does not pass the laugh test. If the government sells Medibank Private as a going concern, at the end of the sale we will have exactly the same number of private health insurers. If the government breaks Medibank Private up into parts, and allows existing private health insurers to buy those parts, then we will have fewer private health insurers available in the market. Either way, there is no way one can assert that competition will be increased by the sale of Medibank Private. We are opposed to the sale of Medibank Private and we are most certainly opposed to anything as important as health and medical research funding being made contingent on the sale of Medibank Private. While the government is yet to explain where the $215 million to be provided in 2005-06 comes from, we are afraid that this apparent largesse comes at the expense of current health programs that were not delivered. We know across the Health and Ageing portfolio that there are programs that are tered with underspends due to incompetence in delivery by the current government. We do not think that you can claim it as a great vance to collect up that underspent money and rebadge it as money for health and medical research. In any event, the spend in the budget, which is described as being a response to the Grant review, is dramatically less than that recommended by the review. The review recommended that the NHMRC budget rise to $1.8 billion by 2008-09. We are certainly not going to achieve that. Indeed, the funding in the budget package will mean that by 2009-10 NHMRC research funding will be $664 million-that is, only one-third of what spu- has been recommended by the Grant review. We are also concerned, as I indicated earlier, that the government may in the long term be seeking to substitute, for government effort, effort from the private sector. We believe in partnering with the private sector but certainly not in private sector money being used to substitute for what ought to properly be government effort in the area. Generally, the failure to invest in our research capabilities is yet another example of the Howard government squandering our national resources and failing to build our skills base. The Australian community supports increased health and medical research efforts. Research Australia's annual health and medical research public opinion polls in 2003-04 showed that most Australians wanted to see increased government and industry investment and are prepared to contribute to that investment themselves. In fact, 47 per cent of Australians said they would rather see surplus government funds invested in health and medical research rather than in tax cuts-a rather selfless approach. Securing a strong, enduring, sustainable liteconomic future for Australia requires a long-term view for building on the valuable investment to date. This will only be ad- achieved by a continued focus and leadership by government in partnership with researchers, industry and the community. Government commitment to the recommendations of the Grant review would be a good first step towards showing this leadership. If the additional needed investments in biomedical research come only as a consequence of the sale of Medibank Private, then that simply is not good enough and it demonstrates only too clearly the cynicism of the Howard government, its lack of commitment to biomedical research and its failure to make real investments in Australia's future. The second reading amendment standing in my name raises a number of these areas of concern about the content of the bill. I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, House condemns the Government for: (1) failing to make the substantial long-term investments in biomedical research needed to keep Australia at the forefront internationally and to keep Australian researchers in this country; (2) linking the increases in biomedical research in the Budget to the sale of Medibank Private; (3) failing to understand that Australians want to see more of the Budget surplus spent on research to improve health outcomes; and (4) failing to address the concerns raised in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee report on the bill that go to: (a) the expertise represented in the membership of the Council; (b) the requirement for full consultation on the appointment of the Chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee; (c) the need for the Minister to be advised if a member of the Council has disclosed an interest; (d) the ability of the Council to provide expert advice directly to the Minister; (e) the need to ensure that the Council has a continuing capacity to strategically respond to the problems of Indigenous health; and (f) the importance of role of the CEO and the need to ensure that this position is filled by an independent expert''.",38
25,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Ripoll-I second the amendment.,44
26,Mr SOMLYAY,RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT,"Fairfax) (10.59 am)Like the member for Lalor, I wanted to be at that launch by Tony Abbott, the Minister for Health and Ageing, a very important event. I hope the minister will be in the chamber before I end my comments on the National Health and Medical Research Council Amendment Bill 2006 so that he may rethe spond to some of the concerns the opposition expressed in the amendment moved by the member for Lalor. The member for Lalor talked about the value of medical research. I do not think there is much debate between members of this parliament on the value of medical research with respect to the benefits not only to individuals' well-being but also economically. Similarly, medical workforce issues are affected by medical research. A nation like Australia should not be in a position where we have to import doctors and medical professionals. Representatives from the six states and the two territories are travelling around different countries of the world, competing against each other, to get foreign trained doctors into this country. The opposite should be the case. We should be in a position to export doctors to the rest of the world. I think we should use quite a substantial portion of our aid budget to train doctors for countries that desperately need medical practitioners. The purpose of this bill is to amend the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 for the purpose of introducing better governance arrangements and clarifying the accountability and reporting functions of the National Health and Medical Research Council, or the NHMRC, under that act. These amendments are not ad hoc changes. They are considered and thoughtful. They address governance issues identified by three major reviews in the past few years, but they go further than fixing the perceived problems. The amendments also aim to implement opportunities identified in those reviews, opportunities for improving health and medical research outcomes through a more accountable and independent council. This bill is aimed at strengthening the independence and accountability of the NHMRC. It clarifies the reporting lines of the CEO the council and replaces the previously cumbersome accountability framework, which had three concurrent lines of reporting. I am pleased to see the minister has entered the chamber to answer the concerns raised in the member for Lalor's amendment, which I am sure he will do at the conclusion of my comments. Currently, financial responsibility and operational accountability are divided. This clearly aligns accountability and responsibility. It makes the CEO fully responsible for the overall daily operation and administrative governance of the agency and has him or her reporting directly to the Minister for Health and Ageing while still keeping the secretary to the department informed. This enables the council to focus its full energy on providing expert medical and biological research and advice. While the accountability and reporting structure has been streamlined, the roles and functions of the council, the principal committees and the working committees have not been altered in any way. The new agency will remain within the Health and Ageing portfolio but with reporting and accountability frameworks that clearly separate the NHMRC roles and functions from those of the department. It will be financially mous and the bill in no way affects the level of funding allocated for health and medical research, as was proven by the recent budget. This bill does reduce the size of the council from 29 to 19 members. However, this in no way reduces the breadth and depth of the council's expertise. In fact, council members themselves have acknowledged problems with the current council size and no member has put forward any concerns regarding the proposed changes. Established in 1936, the NHMRC is Australia's leading expert body responsible for and raising the standard of individual and public health. It does this by fostering health, medical research and training and by monitoring ethical issues relating to health throughout Australia. The NHMRC has an internationally recognised reputation for medical research, and these amendments are designed to keep Australian medical and health research among the world's best. Australians should be proud of what the bill government and the NHMRC have achieved in the past and aim to achieve in the future. Australian health professionals, scientists and academics have helped to improve the quality of life of millions of people not just in Australia but throughout the world. The council looks at not just ways of curing disease or controlling symptoms but prevention and minimising the long-term impact of disease for the person and for society. This is particularly important when we have an ageing population with increasing longevity. While we are living longer, many of us do so with chronic problems such as arthritis, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. While the research undertaken through the NHMRC may not cure those problems, it can help people to control and manage them, enabling us to continue to lead active and productive lives instead of becoming invalids and possiautono- bly needing high care. The government recognises that the work of the council is important to our personal and national well-being. This was evidenced in March this year, when the Minister for Health and Ageing announced a $9.8 million boost for health research into chronic diseases, Indigenous health and the recovery process of older Australians who have been hospitalised. These are all important to the long-term health and wealth of our communities. As the minister said when he announced this funding boost: The Federal Government's investment in health and medical research through the NHMRC is more than $490 million this year, more than double the 1999 figure. Australia is a world leader health and medical research-on a per capita basis, our research output is twice the OECD average. There is more. This government is doing even better. In the recent budget, the Treasurer announced an additional $905 million for Australian health and medical research as a major investment in our future health. On top of the $200 million extra over seven years announced in the last budget, this year's budget committed an additional $500 million over four years for research grants provided through the NHMRC. On top of that extra $500 million to the NHMRC, the budget also provided $170 million over nine years to establish a new health and medical research fellowship scheme, which will allow Australia to attract and retain world-class researchers, which, of course, is also important to our scientific and economic well-being. The budget also provided a further $235 million in grants for a number of medical research facilities, to expand research in areas such as cancer and neuroscience. As you can see, this government is very serious about health and medical research being done in Australia. It is not surprising that industry has also benefited from our strong position in medical research. Since 1992 it is estimated that the commercialisation of health and medical research has created over 350 companies and 3,000 to 4,000 new knowledge based jobs. As Senator Kemp said in his speech on the bill in another place: The NHMRC has performed a pivotal role in supporting such research and fostering talented researchers in these fields. What this means for Australia is that, in supporting the work of the NHMRC, we are benefiting not only from the health and research outcomes but also from the development and retention of scientific expertise in in Australia and from the subsequent development of facilities and industries supporting both the research and its end product. Because this research is important to Australia, it is important that it be managed well. That is what this bill is about-good governance which still allows the council to have scientific independence and flexibility. I commend the bill to the House.",44
27,Mr ABBOTT,RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT,"I rise to conclude, I hope, the debate on the National Health and Medical Research Council Amendment Bill 2006 and to thank both the member for Lalor and the member for Fairfax for their contributions. I particularly thank the member for Fairfax for putting on the record in this place some of the achievements of the government in the field of health and medical research. This is actually quite a simple bill. It implements the administrative recommendations of the Grant and Wills review of health research funding programs. The essence of that review was that the National Health and Medical Research Council needed to be made more clearly independent of government and, while the CEO of the NHMRC will certainly be reporting to the minister, and while the government will certainly be funding this organisation, some of the lack of clarity in who was reporting to whom will be dealt with by this bill. Of course, the other half of the Grant and Wills review recommendations was a very large increase in National Health and Medical Research Council funding. I am pleased to say that, as a result of the budget, that has now been substantially delivered. I think we can say that, while it has taken some time for the recommendations of the Grant and Wills review to be fully implemented, they have now been substantially implemented. I know that both of those two gentlemen are very happy not only with the NHMRC governance changes which this bill implements but with the very large increases in research funding which the government announced in the budget. I should just briefly respond to the second reading amendment that has been moved by the Manager of Opposition Business. I accept that, had this amendment been moved prebudget, there may well have been some justification for it, but I think that it is wholly pass. unjustified subsequent to the budget announcements. There is a suggestion in the member for Lalor's amendment that there may be some problem with future appointments to chair the Australian Health Ethics Committee. I am not in a position, at this time, to announce the new chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, but I can certainly assure the member for Lalor and the House that the new appointment will be someone of impeccable credentials and long and distinguished service in this area. I can also assure the House and the member for Lalor that the incoming Chief Executive Officer of the National Health and Medical Research Council, Professor Warwick Anderson, is an absolutely outstanding scientist and an absolutely outstanding administrator. He was in fact offered an equivalent position in a country which is normally regarded as rather larger and more important than Australia, but he declined that offer to take up the position of Chief Executive Officer of Australia's NHMRC. I think that we have long been extremely well served by our health and medical researchers. I think that not only Australia but the wider world has been immeasurably improved by the work of Australian medical researchers, stretching back 100 years or so. It is impossible to fully estimate just how many tens if not hundreds of millions of people worldwide have been saved because of the work stemming from the research of Howard Florey. And while he is, justly, the most famous Australian medical researcher of all time-the Bradman, if you like, of medical research-there have been many others in the past and there are many today who are carrying on that fine tradition, and I hope they are somewhat assisted by the measure that I trust the House will shortly",46
28,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,RESEARCH COUNCIL AMENDMENT,The original question was that the bill be now read a second time. To this the honourable member for Lalor has moved as an amendment that all words after ‘That' be omitted with a view to substituting other words.

NA AMENDMENT (REFORM OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SCHEME-INITIAL MEASURES) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 May, on motion by Mr John Cobb: That the bill be now read a second time.",47
30,Ms PLIBERSEK,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Sydney) (11.15 am)The Child Support Scheme was set up in 1988 by the Hawke Labor government and has become an international model and the basis of a similar scheme established in the United Kingdom. However there are genuine concerns about the scheme, including the fairness of the scheme, the assessment formula and, in particular, compliance. Let me begin my speech on the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme-Initial Measures) Bill 2006 by saying that Labor acknowledge the need for reform. We believe that the interests and well-being of children must always come first and that, as far as possible, child support policies should serve to support the child in security and in economically acceptable conditions. When it comes to child support, the reform process has been lengthy. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report Every picture tells a story dealt with child support and other family separation issues and made 29 bipartisan recommendations. Among its recommendations was the establishment of a ministerial task force to evaluate the Child Support Scheme, including establishing the costs of children's upbringing after parental separation, recognising different income levels of households and reflecting the costs for both parents of maintaining meaningful contact with their children. The May 2005 report of the Ministerial Taskforce on Child Support, the Parkinson report, was the first systematic evaluation of the child support arrangements. It recommended a new formula for child support assessment, based on evidence of the actual costs of raising children, shared parental responsibility for those costs and recognition of each parent's level of care. The proposed changes also included increased compliance activity, more use of courts to recover debts, a new approach to parents understating income to avoid liability, and access to administrative review through the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The 2006-07 budget measures show an allocation of $165.1 million over five years for transitional and ongoing compliance and $146.6 million to improve service standards and carry out organisational change in the Child Support Agency. We note that income minimisation investigations over the last six months have seen an increase in child support of more than $2.3 million. Of course, that is welcome. The report examined the scheme using sound principles and was generally well received. Labor believes that the report provides a constructive basis for moving forward. The principal concern raised about the recommendations-the heart of Labor concern-is the effect the new assessment formula will have on low-income resident parents with children under the age of 12. The government supported the report and has picked up most of the recommendations, which it now seeks to implement. Labor wish to take a constructive approach to the reforms. This is not an issue we want to politicise. We seek to support positive improvements to the scheme. We have endeavoured to work with the government on this to achieve a better system, and there has been some constructive engagement between Labor and Minister Brough's office. The changes the government is seeking to implement cover various areas. The government plans to introduce them with three sets of legislation coming into effect between July this year and July 2008. We recognise that the package has been carefully crafted by the Parkinson task force in an attempt to provide a balanced approach based on the research of the task force. In coming to a new payments formula, the task force has based its calculation on research into the actual costs of raising children. It found that the costs of care for older children are greater than those for younger children. It noted that regular contact between children and non-resident parents increases the costs of care considerably due to the duplication of infrastructure and that the costs of children change according to parent income levels. The formula attempts to divide these costs fairly between both parents in a way which recognises the level of care that each provides. This contrasts with the current formula, which is not based on research into the actual costs of raising children and therefore lacks some of the intellectual rigour of the new formula. The resulting package presents a trade-off in costs between resident and non-resident parents. The Parkinson report stated that the new arrangements do not alter the amount of resources available for raising children in total; rather, alter the allocation between households. The task force states that the new formula is grounded in evidence about the costs of raising children and the most defensible principles for allocating those costs. It notes the presence of anomalies in the current system and that the correction of these means that obligations ‘must go up or down'. It also says that its recommendations ‘can best be assessed by reference not to a comparison between the outcomes of the current and proposed formulae, but by reference to the principles and evidence upon which these recommendations are based'. The task force package is the result of expert examination and analysis and seeks to balance competing factors in an intellectually sound manner. This is reflected in the package of measures. The new formula is balanced by increased compliance measures and attempts to make it harder for parties to hide their incomes and so reduce their child support liabilities. The House of Representatives standing committee noted that the CSS-the Child Support Scheme-‘has a number of complex interrelated components' and that changing one aspect impacts on other aspects of the scheme. I believe that this is also the case with the reform package. After some consideration, the government has picked up the package largely in its entirety. Labor feels that to unpick the package by amending certain measures would undermine the integrity of the package and could lead to further inequities. Labor will support this bill to implement the first stage of the package, although we are concerned about the effect on some families of the reduction of the income cap, a subject. I will return to later. However, Labor has made clear that its support for the entire child support reform package is conditional they upon being satisfied that the government has put in place satisfactory protections against income reductions for low-income families. To that end, I would like to indicate that I will be moving a second reading amendment to this bill on behalf of the opposition. Labor has serious concerns about the impact the new formula will have on lowincome single parents of children up to the age of 12. In general, these households are headed by women. The House of Representatives report noted that 91 per cent of child support payees were female and only nine per cent were male. Many single parent families are among the poorest in the country and among the most likely to fall into poverty. Labor accepts that the new formula is based on a fair estimation and division of costs, but, in implementing it, the parliament cannot be blind to the practical consequences. The aim behind the reforms is to share the costs fairly between parents, recognising the level of care they provide. The reforms impose very little financial cost on the Commonwealth, but the Commonwealth does bear a responsibility and should bear a broader responsibility in ensuring that there is some protection against loss of income for low-income resident parents. The reforms attempt to encourage contact with the nonresident parent by reducing their support liability in line with their level of care. Currently, the liability for the nonresipoorest dent parent is the same whether they have no contact or care for 29 per cent of nights. does not take into account the costs of care for that parent. The task force report recommends that, where the nonresident parent has care of a child for between 14 and 34 per cent of nights of the year, their liability should be reduced by 24 per cent. This attempts to recognise the cost of providing domestic infrastructure such as a second bedroom. Clearly, the rent on a two-bedroom unit as opposed to a one-bedroom unit does not change depending on how many nights the parent has care of the child. This attempt to recognise costs for nonresident parents and therefore encourage contact is sound and should be supported. We have to note, however, the possibility that a nonresident parent might have their liability reduced by saying that they will for their children for a higher number of nights per year and then not carrying through with that commitment. We also have to recognise that resident parents face fixed infrastructure costs, such as rent, which do not decrease at a rate commensurate with the other parent's level of care, yet under the proposed changes she or he faces a 24 per cent cut in their child support payments. Fairness has to work both ways. It is fine to be fair to the nonresident parent and recognise the fixed costs they face, but we must apply that same fairness to resident parents. This is the area where real concern exists. This is the measure which most starkly calls into question the fairness of this package. We should also acknowledge that many who face cuts in their child support payments will also be hit at the same time by the government's Welfare to Work changes. I do not want to make this a debate about the Welfare to Work changes, because Labor's opposition to those changes is well known. However, we have to acknowledge that some of the families in the country face the prospect of increased work obligations, reduced This welfare payments, more punitive taper rates and a reduction in child support payments all hitting at the same time. If we put the interests of children first and respect the original intent of the Child Support Scheme-to reduce child poverty-then we cannot ignore the impact of these changes on families and, in particular, the cumulative effect that these changes will have by hitting at the same time. Thus, while Labor are signalling our broad support for the government's package, we are also indicating that we have serious reservations about the impact on low-income families that will need to be addressed before the final legislation is agreed to. Labor argues that there is a clear responsibility for government in ameliorating the care negative effects the changes may have on children in some of the poorest families in the country. We call on the government to examine ways of ensuring that carer families are not penalised and how greater protection can be provided for them if they are disadvantaged by the application of the new formula. This first set of reforms included in the legislation before us today, however, does not include the detail of the new formula. It refers to changing capacity to earn provisions, increasing the minimum payment and its indexation to the consumer price index, increasing the amount of the child support payment that the nonresident parent can direct to specific purposes and reducing the cap on the income of nonresident parents which is assessable for child support purposes from just under $140,000 to just under $105,000. This final measure is also of concern. It means a reduction in payments by nonresident parents on incomes of over $104,702 of up to $180 a week and, of course, the commensurate loss of that income for the resident parent. This is a substantial income decrease and will take effect from 1 July this year. Of course concerns have been raised by the people affected, and this is certainly bor's main concern with the measures in the first tranche of the legislation before us day. Given that the first stage reforms are minimal, Labor encourages the government to consider phasing in this measure to ease this sudden substantial decrease in income faced by residential parents. In summary, Labor will support the legislation before us today. We have serious concerns about the effect of the new assessment formula on low-income resident families, and we see a responsibility for government in ameliorating any disadvantage resulting from the new formula. But, as I said, the formula is not before us today. We also encourage the government to consider a phasein of the new income cap for high-income earners. Consequently, I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government to provide protection against income reductions for low income households raising children”.",48
31,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,Is the amendment seconded? Mr MCClelland-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,51
32,Mr CADMAN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Mitchell) (11.29 am)This is a long process that is coming to fruition. The original proposals were made, I suspect, by the parliamentary inquiry into child custody arrangements in the event of family separation, which was undertaken in 2003 by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. That committee received 1,700 submissions and heard from over 200 witnesses. I was a member of that committee, and the committee's report, Every picture tells a story, was a comprehensive study of the pain and trauma that can often occur with family breakdown and separation. Above all things, Laas a group from the House of Representatives, we were conscious that the people who tosuffered the consequences of family breakdown more than any others, even more than the separating partners, were the children of any union, marriage or arrangement. So it was on the future of the children that the committee tended to focus. Initial responses to our inquiry were generally favourable, although there is continuing concern in men's groupsunderstandably-about the recommendations in that they did not go far enough, particularly in the area of fifty-fifty shared care. We as a committee felt that the first thing that separating parents should apply their minds to was the future of the children, so we focused not on shared care so much as on equal parental responsibility. That is not the case the moment. At the moment, the person who has custody of the children seems to have more say than others about their future. We considered that both parents should have equal responsibility in deciding the future of the children, no matter who was the custodial parent. We also felt that grandparents should play a part in this process, as well, so grandparents receive attention in the report. There was general community support for the committee's report and general support from community groups for the concept of shared responsibility. We have requested the courts-and I am pleased to find that the Attorney-General is giving instructions to the Family Court-that, as a starting point, fiftyfifty shared care should not be rejected but should be considered. The way it will work-and the implementation stages are already moving ahead-is that, firstly, there will be shared parental responsibility and then, flowing from that, the prospect of shared care. The proposals also included more services to assist parents in reaching workable post-separation arrangements and more child-focused programs. On 29 July 2004, in response to the committee's report, the government announced a process to look at the arrangements for child support, and a ministerial task force on child support was established following the reforms to the family law system. An improvement in the outcomes for children was the goal of the task force. The task force recommended consultation processes prior to the establishment of the 65 family relationship centres around Australia, a 30 per cent increase in funding for services funded under the Family Relationships Services Program, a further expansion of the Family Relationships Services Program and establishment of a further task force. Public consultation followed and the announcement was made in August 2004 that a task force would be at chaired by Professor Patrick Parkinson of the Faculty of Law at the University of Sydney. Professor Parkinson is also the Chairperson of the Family Law Council. The focus of the task force was to be on policy considerations, not on the administration of the scheme. The task force included a range of members with expertise in one or more of the following areas: research on separating families, the cost of raising children, social and economic policy and family law. The task force presented a report to the government entitled In the best interests of children: reforming the Child Support Scheme, and it is a very interesting and well prepared report. The Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme-Initial Measures) Bill 2006 before the House today is the first part of a three-part response to that task force report and to the committee's effort. In the area of child support, the committee made a number of observations. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs particularly remarked on the complexity of the formula used to decide the amount of financial support children should receive in the case of separation. The formula applies fairly rigidly unless there are some very definite indications that it cannot be complied with. We found as a committee that the weapons used by separating parents revolve around the children, and they are generally these: the weapon of the custodial parent is to deny access to the children; the weapon of the non-custodial parent is not to pay for the support of the children. So that is where the battleground is, and it is a vicious and hateful battleground. It is a tragic battleground on which the children alone are the ones who really suffer. I remember one lady in Gunnedah who gave evidence to the committee that she had spent $260,000 on legal costs, the entire proceeds of the settlement she had received from her former husband, in order to spear him and make him comply with her wishes. She said: I've spent the money and he's still the same, at least he's seeing kids now and that's all I wanted. I wanted proper acknowledgment from him. I failed to get him to pay, which is part what I wanted, but above everything I wanted him to continue to be a good dad. She had wasted the family's entire savings because of viciousness between her and her former husband. That story is not unusualthe hatred and viciousness of, on the one side, women, who are generally the custodial parent; and, on the other, men, who can resort to violence and become unemployed purely to get back at their former partner. However, the kids suffer from the lack of support given for their accommodation, from changes in the provision of their shelter and from disruptions to their schooling. There is a whole range of factors that work against the interests of children, simply because men will not support women in such a situation. The formula caught the attention of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, of which I was a member. The Child Support Consultative Group, which gave evidence, pointed out that separating the discrete costs of children from the total family costs is a problem confronting all studies where an examination is made of the cost of raising children. Regarding the development of the formula, the Child Support Consultative Group said that, as the number of children in a family increases, the per-child cost declines. I think we all know that; that is common sense. More money is spent on children as they grow older. On average about 20 per cent of a family's income is devoted to the first child. When the Australian data was separated from the international data, a lower figure of about 16 per cent was arrived at, so we were delving into difficult areas in trying to establish such facts. The Child Support Consultative Group said that the shares of income devoted to the second and third child were each about half but of that devoted to the first child; and shares devoted to subsequent children were about half of that devoted to the second and third of children-their cost reduces to about 25 per cent of the cost of the first child. It costs less to maintain an intact family at a given standard of living than it does to maintain the same family with separated parents. That is not obvious to many parents who are in the process of separating. They think they can carry on their former lifestyle without penalty. That is not possible. The share of income devoted to a child in a one-parent family is higher than in a two-parent family. The recommendations of the House of Representatives committee were taken up by Professor Parkinson. The first recommendation in his report to the government, entitled In the best interests of children, dealt with the difficult issue of the formula. In recommendation No. 1, he said: The existing formula for the assessment of child support should be replaced by a new formula based upon the principle of shared parental responsibility for the costs of children. One would think that is self-evident and would have always been the case-but that is not so. The government, taking these steps in the legislation as the first part of a three-part program, has made a number of changes. One change is to increase the minimum payment. The current payment is $5, which is nothing. But if a parent-and generally it is the male-is unemployed and has little likelihood of gaining employment, $5 is the cost and many do not pay it; in fact, 40 per cent do not pay it. As there needs to be greater acceptance of responsibility for children, this legislation contains a provision for an increase in the minimum payment. This legislation lowers the cap on income considered for child support purposes, thereby reducing the maximum rates of child support. Let me give the House an example. One of the major criticisms we came across was that, for high-income earners, the formula currently applying produces an impossibly high level of funding capable of being expended on children. The figure of $34,000 a year currently being received by a parent for two children will be lowered to $24,000. I do not know how anybody could possibly spend $17,000 a year on a child under the age of five. It is just not possible, so the mula has been changed. If, in the view of a court when considering separation and Family Court matters, there is a need to maintain a certain lifestyle, that should be considered as a separate issue and not as a maintenance of children issue. That was the goal of the committee, which was universally agreed by members of the committee, picked up by Professor Parkinson in his report and now endorsed in legislation by the governmenta sensible change. The legislation provides for fairer decisions in relation to whether a parent has extra earning capacity. This is the overtime factor. The non-custodial parent is required to pay according to a formula, and I need to give the House some understanding of what that might be. For one child, it is 18 per cent of gross income; for two children, it is 27 per cent; for three children, it is 32 per cent; for four children, it is 34 per cent; and for five or more children, it is 36 per cent. That formula, which was locked in place, is now in the process of being changed-but not by this legislation; that comes next. So the process of change is down the track. This legislation makes provisions for circumstances where a person is locked into the current formula and it is impossible for them to maintain themselves. We had evidence from many people in dire circumstances endeavouring to live up to their responsibilities, maintain rented accommodation, provide for their children when they have custody as part of a shared arrangement and endeavouring to provide for the odd needs such as clothes or other items that the children need when they are in that casual accommodation arrangement from week to week, maybe every second weekend and half the school holidays. To have all of their overtime efforts counted as part of the child support process was something we considered to be unfair. The formula is changing in regard to a person formaking extra effort and providing extra capacity. There is also an increase in the legislation on the amount a parent can have spent directly on the essential needs of their child, from 25 to 30 per cent-that is not a recommendation of the committee; the committee thought it should be higher than that. I will give an example. Somebody may be married to a person who is quite wealthy and is able to provide well for additional children. The non-custodial parent may demand that the children have essential needs-such as for school fees, clothing, school excursions, perhaps medical services-but only 25 per cent of their contribution can be directed towards payment for those things. There is a weird proposal that a doctor has to say that a child is in need of medical services before these payments can be allocated to medical care. I would have thought a doctor's bill is sufficient to say that a child is in need of medical care, rather than having to first of all get a letter from a doctor to decide whether these payments can be allocated to the medical care of children. It seems to be absolute bureaucratic overkill to say that doctors need to advise the CSA that this care is needed. Nobody is going to take a kid to a doctor just for the sake of it. There are some real problems with the whole way in which this was bedded down in the first place, but the changes we are making now are fairer, and they are really going to help couples focus on the children. Australia has one of the most interventionist family courts in the world. Most courts worldwide force parents to consider for themselves what is best for the children. We do not do that. We let the court get involved in these relationships from day one. This legislation is going to change that slightly. is going to force parents-recognising they are probably never going to like each other very much-to think of their children first. That must be a goal that this House maintains for any future changes. Another provision in this legislation ensures that the child support arrangements for exnuptial children in Western Australia are constitutionally valid, which is a change that one would expect in order to recognise the role of the Family Court in Western Australia. So the prescribed non-agency payment is rising to 30 per cent, which allows the noncustodial parent, where necessary, to direct more funds specifically towards the care of the children. Many paying parents would like this percentage to be higher, because they consider their children may not be well looked after, but the government settled for 30 per cent. I commend the minister, Mal Brough. He has been working on this issue ever since he came into the parliament, trying to get a better deal for both parents. He saw the pain of dads and he saw the problems in families, and he is trying to rectify them.",51
33,Ms CORCORAN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Isaacs) (11.49 am)The bill we have before us today, the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme-Initial Measures) Bill 2006, has taken quite a few years to get here, and the issues it addresses are very difficult ones. The beginnings of the bill are found in the community's dismay and frustrations with how decisions are made about parenting and child support when a family breaks up. In June 2003 the Prime Minister established an inquiry into child custody and child support. This was undertaken by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. In December 2003 this inquiry delivered its report, It Every picture tells a story. In instigating this inquiry, the Prime Minister talked about three things in particular: he talked about the idea of rebuttable shared time with each parent, that equal time would be the default situation; he talked about the need for people other than parents, mainly grandparents, to be considered; and he talked about the need for the child support formula to be revamped. It is impossible to bring in legislation that is going to meet the demands or expectations of everyone involved in family separations. By its very nature, the issue is emotional and every aspect is often overlaid with other issues or frustrations. Every member of parliament has experience in trying to help people immersed in the family law and/or the child support systems. We see the frustrations of men and women trying to work through the process. Many of us have personal experience of the system or of our family members dealing with family breakdowns. There is no easy answer, and there never will be. It is interesting to note the language that is often used in this area and to think for a minute about how language influences attitudes. We talk about failed marriages, failed relationships, family breakdowns. This language presupposes that a marriage or a relationship ending is a bad or undesirable thing. I would like to float the idea that some marriages or relationships, which might be good for a time, come to a point where they should end. I would like to get to a point where a relationship can end without those involved being told or being made to feel that they have failed. I would love to see us accepting in a non-judgmental way that some people decide to end their relationships for their own reasons. I am not in any way trying to suggest that we want a world full of relationships endlessly coming and going. We do need to find ways of helping those relationships that will continue to grow and be satisfying if a bit of help or support is available at a critical We also need to understand that some relationships do have a finite life. We should accept that only those in the relationship itself are the ones who know whether it should end. When the Prime Minster established the inquiry into child custody and child support some three years ago, he talked about looking for a recommendation from the inquiry supporting the presumption of shared custody or equal time with each parent. This was mischievous, misleading and even cruel. We all have a number of constituents, usually men, who do not see their children as often as they would like and who see the system as being unfair and biased towards mothers. Many of these men were, understandably, delighted with the thought that once the inquiry was over legislation would be introduced and they would have, automatically, equal time with their kids. I cannot dismiss the thought that this was a deliberate ploy by the Prime Minister to quieten down a group in the electorate and offer them false promises in the lead-up to an election year. The inquiry did not recommend that equal time be the standard or the starting point. It did recommend shared parenting, meaning sharing the responsibility for major decisions affecting a child. Unhappily, once again misunderstanding crept in. Many parents misunderstood the term ‘shared parenting' and thought it meant equal time. Many parents are only now starting to understand what the term means. What all this means is that a group of already unhappy parents who feel that the world, or at least the family law system, is against them have been tricked into thinking the system would dramatically change and are now feeling abandoned again. Some of this unhappiness was inevitable as some expectations are and were unreasonably high, time. but some of it has evolved from, at best, loose language and the leading statement from the Prime Minister, anticipating the result of the inquiry and getting it wrong. The committee's report Every picture tells a story, which was tabled in December 2003, made 29 recommendations that covered the family law process, the Child Support Scheme and parenting arrangements. In August 2004 the government announced the establishment of a ministerial task force and reference group to examine the Child Support Scheme, partly in response to the report. The report of the task force was released by the chair of the task force, Professor Patrick Parkinson, on 14 June 2005 and made a number of recommendations to overhaul the Child Support Scheme. In February 2006, the government released its response to the task force report and indicated the intention to adopt most of the recommendations for change of the ministerial task force. The government proposes that these changes will take place in three stages, the first from 1 July 2006, the second coming in in January 2007 and the third from July 2008. The main changes that are being introduced are, firstly, the introduction of a new formula for determining a parent's child support obligations. It will move to base the obligation on the actual cost of raising children, it will more equitably share the cost between parents based on their respective incomes and it will better balance the needs of first and second families. The bulk of these changes are planned to start from July 2008. The next change is increased enforcement and compliance powers for the Child Support Agency that should enable the agency to take more effective action against parents who fail to support their children. These changes are part of the bill being debated today and are to come into effect from July 2006. Another change will introduce the ability to have Child Support Agency decisions reviewed by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. At the moment the review processes are by the CSA itself or the courts. These changes are planned to start in January 2007. The purpose of the bill here today is to troduce the first set of changes. It will increase and index the minimum rate of child support payments. The minimum will move from $5 per week to $6 per week and will be indexed to keep pace with the CPI. The increase from $5 to $6 is to restore the value the minimum payment to what it was when it was introduced in 1999. The bill will reduce the maximum income cap from about $139,000 to about $105,000 per year, which will reduce the amount of child support payable by high-income nonresident parents. This change is likely to be an interim step to tide the system over until the more substantial changes are made to how the support payments are calculated. If the legislation to come follows the Parkinson recommendations and the direction the government is suggesting it will follow, the maximum cap will become irrelevant. This is because the new formula is likely to be based on the cost of raising a child rather than the income of the paying parents. The bill will alter the way the earning capacity of parents is assessed. At the moment parents are deemed to have a greater capacity to earn even if their income has dropped for good reason-for instance, because they need to work less in order to provide care for their children or because they have lost their job. The new arrangements will move closer to the recommendation that parents should be deemed to be earning more than they actually are only if it is likely or apparent that the motivation for reduced earnings is to reduce the level of child support payments. The bill will enable nonresident parents to offset 30 per cent of their payment against any credited amount spent directly on the children. This is an increase from 25 per cent. The bill has technical changes relating to arrangements in Western Australia. The Parkinson report-that is, the report that responded to the financial recommendaintions of the Every picture tells a story report-made good and broadly sensible recommendations. It is good to see these recommendations starting to be acted upon. I look forward to the remainder of the changes being introduced, although I am intrigued of about the delay in bringing them forward. As I understand it, the following changes are still to come. From January 2007 the government will introduce independent review of all CSA decisions by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, broaden the powers of the courts to ensure child support obligations are met, strengthen the relationship between the courts and the CSA to make the process easier and more responsive to parents' needs and give separating parents more time to work out their parenting arrangements before the family tax benefit is affected. From July 2008 the government will introduce a new child support formula; change the way income from second jobs and overtime is treated, noting that often this income is sought to help with re-establishment costs after separation; change the treatment of parents with dependent stepchildren when calculating child support payments; simplify the change of assessment rules; and deal with a number of other matters. I note that the government has said it will do all these things and I hope that it does. If the matters due to be changed from January 2007 take place sensibly and effectively, this will take some of the frustration out of the system. Changes to the child support formula are needed too, but I am concerned about how this will be done as there are many low-income families who are dependent on child support and, if these changes happen, may be vulnerable to increased financial stress. Mr Deputy Speaker, one of the most common issues raised with me in my electorate office, and no doubt with you in yours, relates to child support or custody. There is almost universal frustration with the way the Child Support Agency works. I hasten to make the point that, by definition, I do not see those parents who are happy with how their arrangements are working out. Like everyone else in this place, the constituents who approach me are usually the ones who are having difficulties. Their complaints usually fall into one of two or three categories. One source of frustration is about the perceived rigidity in the way payments are assessed and the slow and complex process of varying the payments. Some payers feel that their ex-partner is using the money and some feel that they are being taken advantage of by their ex-partner. Another category is the parents in receipt of payments. Some of these parents are unhappy because they feel that their ex-partner is deliberately hiding their income to reduce the amount they pay in child support. Some are unhappy because their ex just is not paying at all. Both payers and payees will come to see me because they are unhappy with decisions that the CSA has made. To date these decisions are reviewed by another CSA officer, with the only other recourse being to the courts. This in itself is another source frustration and leads some people to question the transparency of the system. Not long ago a small business operator in Isaacs contacted me about the CSA. His issue is that the paperwork required by the CSA is becoming onerous. I spent some time with Tim in his factory and I can understand just what he means. Tim's business is typical of many small businesses. The admin function is handled by one person. This person looks after the accounts receivable, accounts payable, purchasing and payroll and is usually the receptionist. Very often a large amount of the corporate memory rests in this person. This very busy person, often a woman, does not have the time to seek out and understand every nuance of the child support system. Tim's attitude is that he is happy to do the things he needs to do in deducting child support payments from his employees' wages, but he is not prepared to spend hours completing forms, particularly when the information sought is already available. He has even indicated that he is getting to the point where he will be avoiding employing people who are clients of the CSA for this reason. I wrote to the minister with Tim's concerns and the reply I received was less than encouraging. mis- Essentially the minister advised Tim to do the CSA work online. This advice makes assumptions about internet skills and internet availability that do not always hold. The response is an indication that the minister is out of touch with how very small businesses operate. It is clear to me and to my constituents that the child support system needs a drastic overhaul. I want to be clear that, whilst I am firmly convinced that the child support system needs an overhaul, this reflects the legislation that has existed to date; it is not a reflection in any way on the staff of CSA. My of experience with CSA staff is that they work very hard to provide the best service they within the constraints of the legislation and the resources made available to them. The CSA people we deal with through my office are always very efficient in responding to our questions and dealing with the matters we raise on behalf of our constituents. I put on record the efforts the CSA has gone to in my area in conducting what we call child support forums. We have held three in the last 15 months in Isaacs, the most cent being last week. These forums are a collection of agencies who offer services to separating families. At last week's forum we had people from the Child Support Agency, Family Court, Victorian Legal Aid, Council of Single Mothers and their Children, Dads in Distress, Mensline, Centrelink, Australia family support service, Lifeworks Australia and Relationships Australia. I put on record my thanks to all these agencies and their resentatives for taking part in the forum. These representatives gave up their Thursday evening to present their material and to be available to people to have one-on-one discussions about their particular problems or seek information. The Child Support Agency arranged one-on-one interviews throughout the day for those clients who asked for one and then spent the evening discussing child support issues in general with those who attended. Over the three forums we have managed to give information to something like 200 people. Most of the work in arranging these forums was done by officers from the CSA, each of the forums was well attended and the feedback from those attending was very positive. I encourage my colleagues to sponsor similar forums for their constituents, because they are well worth doing. I want to congratulate the CSA for taking the initiative in arranging these forums. The Parkinson report, the report that responded to the financial recommendations of Every picture tells a story, made good and can broadly sensible recommendations. It is good to see these recommendations starting to be acted upon. I look forward to the remainder of the changes being introduced, although I am, as I said before, a little intrigued about the delay in bringing them forward. Before I finish I would like to make a point that is probably obvious but needs to be made, and that is that many couples who separate do so, if not amicably, at least in a re- cooperative manner and manage to sort out their child custody and child support issues themselves. Sometimes these arrangements come unstuck later, but very often they do not and there is no need to get involved with the CSA. Other couples, of course, do not separate in a friendly manner and need outside help to sort out their arrangements. These are the families that are affected by the legislation and the changes that are being repdiscussed today. In summary, I support this bill and look forward to the rest of the changes being introduced.",55
34,Mr LINDSAY,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I am disappointed to see the second reading to amendment to the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme-Initial Measures) Bill 2006 by the opposition. The amendment calls on the government to provide protection against income reductions for low-income households raising children. This is a populist comment. It says that the taxpayer should pick up the cost because a particular family separated. I do not think the world works like that. I would have much preferred to have seen from the Australian Labor Party an amendment which said that the opposition congratulates the government on doing the hard work that was necessary to bring forward this legislationthe first tranche of legislation that will see very significant reforms in the child support arrangements. We all know as members of parliament that this area is a minefield-that for every winner there is a loser-but the government has bitten the bullet, made hard decisions and brought forward some very sensible legislation indeed. In fact, I think on balance most parents who are subject to this legislation agree with what the government is proposing. For once I would have thought perhaps the Labor Party could have said, as the member for Isaacs just said in this place, ‘Yes, it is legislation.' For once the Labor Party might have considered not tacking on a populist bit, which is not going to succeed-and I do not think any parent or taxpayer would want it to succeed. Professor Parkinson is highly regarded in the work that he has done in the ministerial task force. He has considered all of these issues and reported to the government, and the results of that report appear in the legislation before the parliament this afternoon. There is bipartisan support for this legislashould tion and I am pleased to see that. I recognise that and I thank the opposition for their support. Over the years many Labor members have done a lot of work on this, and so have many government members. All of us have struggled to know what we can do, but we have had this tremendous guidance, first from Kay Hull's committee, the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, which produced the Every picture tells a story report, and then from Professor Parkinson's report. It is good to see that bipartisan support. I was intrigued with the history of all of this and I went to have a look at what has been said previously. Back on 24 March 1987 the then Minister for Social Security and member for Batman, Brian Howe, indicated to this parliament that in that year we would see the start of a system to ensure a new deal for children of separated and divorced parents. In that year-I think it was 1988 when it became the law-there was a child support process to address the areas of community concern in relation to child support and the inadequate support provided by non-custodial parents to children living in Australia's sole parent families. A lot has changed since then and a lot has remained the same. There is a need for child support. The overwhelming majority of cases good that we see are a result of marriage breakdown or a split in de facto relationships. Most of the children in these families come from homes where two parents once shared the responsibility for expenses and care. A situation has developed where too many parents no longer share a house with their children and they now fail to share their income with these children. That situation remains. What has changed, of course, is the government's determination to make sure that children know both their parents. Children be able to be cared for by both of their parents. That is a good thing, and that has been recognised and incorporated in the government's philosophy. So the philosophy now is not only that parents should share the cost of supporting their children according to their capacity to pay but that adequate support should be available for the children from both parents and that access should be available to both parents. The government is agreed on that. We are now making some very major changes. This bill represents the first tranche of legislation-the first phase of implementation. The legislation has some notable changes, including changes that incorporate the need to reward nonresident parents on income support who have contact with their children. There will be more dollars available there. The current provision will be broadened to parents who have care of their children for at least one night per week, and that is really going to increase the number of parents who will benefit from that particular measure. There will be a fairer assessment of the capacity of parents to earn income. We have all heard some horrendous stories where the CSA, operating under the current law, have just deemed a parent to be able to earn a certain amount of income, whether or not they can do it in practice. This sort of thing is happening in my area, and I will give the House an example. A person may be working in the mining industry on a fly-in fly-out basis: a person who may live in Townsville will fly to Cannington, for example, to the silver-zinc mine. They are on extraordinarily high wages compared to the rest of the community because they stay away for an extended period and then fly back home again. The wages are paid in recognition of them being away for such a long time, but sometimes people get sick of this sort of lifestyle. It is kind of like being liamentarian, flying down to work and being away for a long time from your home and family and so on. These people may choose to say: ‘I'm not going to do this anymore. I'm going to seek a job on the coast and stay at home.' The CSA was looking at their income from the mine and basically saying, ‘You've got to pay child support because you are capable of working in a mine; therefore, you've got to pay a high rate.' But that is condemning a worker to not having choice over where they work. They have not in the past wilfully decided not to work at a mine because they want to reduce their child support payments; they have done it because of lifestyle issues. The point I come to is that there is this fairer assessment of the capacity of parents to earn income. But the key thing in the legislation is the ability now to go to an appeal process if the payer thinks that he has been unfairly assessed. Previously you were not able to do that. It is a credit to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Mal Brough, for introducing this in the legislation so that people now will be able to ensure that they are treated fairly. That is what happens in other areas of payments, where you can go to an appeal tribunal. You will now be able to do it in this case. Legislation will be introduced later to reduce the maximum payments and do more to ensure that child support is paid in full and on time. In the couple of minutes left to me before we hear from the member for Canberra, I want to observe a very important change in the government's philosophy, which is encapsulated in a few words: improved service delivery by the Child Support Agency. We have all heard the horror stories. We have all heard the accusations that the Child Support Agency hates men. I have never believed that. I have always found the Child Support a parAgency people to be really decent people. Of course, we have to remember on the other side of the ledger that, almost on a daily basis, they have to deal with very aggressive customers who bring their marital problems into the Child Support Agency office. It is not CSA's fault that a marriage breaks down. CSA staff quite properly just enforce or deal with the legislation that currently exists. But as a government we are now pouring a whole lot more resources into helping our Child Support Agency staff to know and understand the psychology of their customers, to know and understand how best to deal with them, so that people who do come in in a very aggressive manner can be professionally assisted and their aggression dealt with. That is a really big change in what we are doing. I thank the government for that. I know that the CSA will now go on to be a better organisation to help the mums and dads who have unfortunately separated. I support the bill and I commend it to the House.",59
35,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I rise today to speak on the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme-Initial Measures) Bill 2006. The purpose of this bill is to implement the first stage of the government's child support reforms in response to the report of the ministerial task force on child support, the Parkinson report. The government's reforms will be introduced in stages from July 2006 to July 2008. The Parkinson report provides a strong and constructive basis for moving forward. Labor acknowledges the need for reform of the Child Support Scheme. We support this bill. We also recognise that the package as a whole is the result of careful consideration by an expert committee and that it has used sound principles to develop a balance of measures. To unpick the package by amending certain measures would undermine some of the integrity of the package and could lead to further inequities. Therefore we support the package, albeit with the amendment that has been moved by the member for Sydney. As I said earlier, the bill that we are ing today introduces the first stage of reforms and includes a range of measures. This bill will increase the minimum payment and index the minimum to ensure that child support payments keep pace with inflation. The current $5 a week minimum payment is not indexed. I wholeheartedly agree with this measure. If the cost of caring for a child increases, then it is only fair that child support payments keep up with those costs. This bill will also provide more detailed and workable arrangements for determining a liable parent's capacity to earn. Under the Child Support Scheme, parents can be required to pay additional child support, or parents may be entitled to receive less support, if the Child Support Agency determines they have a higher capacity to earn. Under the current scheme, the provisions are too broad, and this can lead to payments which do not take into consideration changed circumstances. For example, a child support payer may need to work less because of new caring responsibilities or they may have lost their job; however, they may still be required to pay child support based on their previous income. This bill will enable nonresident parents to offset 30 per cent, up from 25 per cent, of their payment against any credited amount spent directly on the children-for example, school fees and medical costs. Currently, nonresident parents can spend up to 25 per cent of their child support liability directly on the children. The Parkinson report recommended that the limit be increased to 30 per cent because it allows the paying parent to be confident that the children are benefiting from the child support and it gives them some sense of control over how the child support is used. Whilst we can legislate as best we possibly can, it is impossible to legislate against debathuman nature-something that we often would like to try to do. When we talk about additional costs being paid-and I have just referred to the direct costs incurred in caring for the child-that immediately brings to mind a constituent's case some little while ago now where the nonresident parent was so intent on being difficult that the resident parent and the child concerned at one stage owned something like 40 school jumpers. I am not making it up. So, whilst I can fully support the changes that I have just referred to, we have to be aware that some people, regardless of our best intent across this chamber, will remain hell-bent on being difficult to their ex-partner or ex-family. That was the starkest example I ever saw, when the nonresident parent walked in carrying two large black plastic garbage bags in which resided something like 40 school jumpers, all of them in pretty good nick. We must remember that people who are no longer in a relationship but share responsibilities for children can be in a very stressed state, so I support any measures that help parents do what is best for their children. Another measure of this bill will reduce the maximum income cap from $139,347 to $104,702, which will reduce the amount of child support payable by high-income nonresident parents. This will see a substantial reduction in the child support paid by some higher income earners as of 1 July this year. This may cause some hardship for some resident families; therefore Labor is calling on the government to consider phasing in this change so as to provide a period of adjustment for those resident families. It is portant to note that this measure will become redundant if a new formula for the assessment of child support is introduced. The Parkinson report recommended a new formula for the assessment of child support, which would be based on evidence of the actual costs of raising children, the principle of shared parental responsibility for those costs and a recognition of each parent's level of care. The new formula is planned for introduction in the third stage of the legislation. Labor's principal concern is the effect of the new formula on low-income families with children under 12. While we support a new formula that is based on the actual costs of raising children in separated families, and which attempts to fairly divide those costs and recognise the level of care provided, we cannot ignore the effects that the new formula will have on low-income resident families. While Labor supports the fairness of recognising the costs of care incurred by the nonresident parent, we also recognise that the consequent decrease in child support liabilities paid to the resident parent may not correspond to any decrease in that parent's costs. Labor believes that there is a responsiarticle bility for government in limiting the negative effects of these changes on low-income resident families. These families are already under significant financial pressure and, in implementing these reforms, we must consider their effects to ensure that children in these families are not disadvantaged. It is here that I strongly support the amendment moved by the member for Sydney. One of the most challenging aspects of my job as a local member in this parliament is seeing the difficulties that can follow family breakdown. I would dare to say that there is not a member in this House who would not share that view. I see resident parents who imare struggling to make ends meet and support their children who believe their children's other parent is not contributing according to their capacity. On the other hand, I also see nonresident parents who miss their children and believe they are providing support beyond their means. The other aspect that I and many others have seen is the very sad aspect where, in some cases, a nonresident parent believes that they should have access purely on the amount of money they pay in child support, regardless of the circumstances within the family that may exist. We have also seen resident parents who, for one reason or another, decide to make it difficult for the nonresident parent in accessing their children when there is a legitimate case for that access to occur. There is such a mix of human emotions and human circumstances. I think we have probably seen every mix there could be. It is an extremely traumatic situation for everyone involved, and my aim in assisting any of these constituents is to ensure that whatever influence I can bring will mean that they do what is best for their children. At the end of the day, the needs of the child simply must come first. I would like to quote part of 3 from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: 1. In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests child shall be a primary consideration. 2. States Parties undertake to ensure the child such protection and care as is necessary for his or her well-being, taking into account the rights and duties of his or her parents, legal guardians, or other individuals legally responsible for him or her, and, to this end, shall take all appropriate legislative and administrative measures. In conclusion, I want to very briefly mention and commend the work done by all of the committees in this House, basically since the CSA came into being. There has been the Parkinson committee, which was a task force set up by government. Before that there was the committee chaired by Kay Hull and deputy chaired by the member for Fowler. Before that I understand there were committees under the chairmanship of the current opposition whip and many others, all of whom have put an enormous amount of effort into trying to untangle the emotions of this issue as much as possible. We have now got to the point where we have this piece of legislation, the majority of which we very strongly support. I commend all of that back work, because that is the basis upon which we stand this legislation today.",61
36,Mr TICEHURST,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Dobell) (12.27 pm)I have been fighting for changes to our child support and family law systems since I first became a member of this parliament, particularly after learning of local men who had committed suicide because of the unfairness of the system. Tony Miller, from Dads in Distress, contacted me in about August 2002 and let me know that there were probably 2,500 men a year committing suicide because they could not access their children. My attention was then drawn to the plight of other fathers out there-and mothers and grandparents-who all suffered needlessly because of the insufficiencies of our system. I formed an informal backbench committee with some colleagues in 2002 to pressure the Prime Minister and cabinet for a formal govof the ernment committee to address the need for family law reform and an overhaul of our child support system. Five years on, we are introducing legislation in response to the recent recommendations of the child support task force regarding changes in the way child support is calculated: the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme-Initial Measures) Bill 2006. I cannot emphasise how pleased I am that we have got this far. These changes, once fully implemented, will bring about some equity in the system, possibly making it one of the fairest systems in the world. The proposed child support system is no longer about favouring one parent over another. It also recognises that there is no such thing as a standard family breakdown, nor is there a standard child to raise after the separation. The costs of children vary depending on what type of household you are talking about and the spending patterns of that household. These changes are significant and implementation of the new scheme requires extensive legislative and other changes. We cannot rush it and take the risk of getting it wrong. The new formula will therefore be introduced in July 2008. This bill introduces some measures in the interim to address some of the major pressure points in the system. Firstly, the bill increases the minimum child support payment to $6.13 a week, or $320 a year, and indexes the payment according to rises in CPI. The minimum is currently not indexed, so it is losing value due to inflation. The minimum payment recognises that all parents with the capacity to do so should contribute to their child's welfare. The minimum is mostly paid by parents on income support benefits and pensions, which are linked to CPI and other indices, so this minimum payment will remain affordable for all paying parents. One major criticism of the current child support scheme is that the cap on assessed income is far too high. In 2006 it is $139,347. This leads to very high child support payments that significantly exceed the costs of caring for children in the majority cases. This measure will reduce the cap by linking it to the average weekly earnings of all employees, rather than to the earnings of full-time workers only. The new cap will be $104,702, which is still quite a substantial sum. This gives a fairer and more realistic maximum amount of child support payable. It is an interim measure until the revised formula is implemented. This is particularly important where both parents are professionals and the custodial parent may even be in small business and in fact does not submit proper tax returns. Where parents will receive less child support as a result, they still receive a substantial amount. For example, a parent currently receiving about $34,000 a year for two children will still receive more than $24,000 a year. For the first time, the costs of children will be distributed between the parents according to their capacity to pay. Currently, parents who change their working patterns and earn less income can be assessed to pay the same amount of child support as before the change, on the basis that their former income indicates a higher capacity to earn. This is to protect against parents deliberately reducing their income to avoid child support, which is not fair to their children. However, the rules are sometimes applied to parents who have a good reason for earning lessfor example, caring for a new child may mean they cannot do shift work anymore. This is unfair and a major source of concern about the scheme. I have been contacted by non-custodial parents who have been adversely affected by this ruling in the course of my push for a fairer system. Particularly on the Central Coast, where we have a high number of commuters, people who are made redundant from a job in Sydney have no opportunity to gain the same employment on the Central Coast as they previous held. This measure strikes a fair balance for of parents and children. It means that parents who can demonstrate that they have a good reason to reduce their income will not be subject to child support assessments based on their capacity to earn. It also means that parents will not be expected to work overtime, by restricting earning capacity to standard full-time hours for a person's industry and occupation. One complaint that paying parents have against the current scheme is that they have no say in how their child support is spent. Measures in this bill mean that nonresident parents will be able to spend a greater perwill centage of their payments directly on their children. If the parent receiving child support does not agree, a paying parent can still satisfy up to 25 per cent of their child support liability by paying directly for certain essential items, such as school fees and health care, when they pay the rest of the liability in cash. Many paying parents would like this limit to be much higher, but because the parent receiving child support does not have to agree to these payments it is important to find the balance between letting paying parents spend money on their children directly and ensuring that resident parents can meet their day-today costs. This measure adjusts this balance by raising the limit on prescribed non-agency payments to 30 per cent of liabilities. This bill also seeks to reward nonresident parents who have contact with their children. Currently, parents who have the care of their children for at least 30 per cent of the time receive a higher ‘with child' rate of Newstart and related payments. This is an additional $16.50 a week. To encourage contact between low-income parents and their children, this provision will be broadened to parents who have care of their children for at least one night per week. This bill will also aim to address issues with some non-custodial parents shirking their responsibilities when it comes to payments. While some parents pay too much child support, others do not pay enough for the support of their children, and this is something we need to fix. The Child Support Agency will increase its existing activities that target serious avoiders and debtors. The Child Support Agency will increase its use of court action to recover outstanding amounts. As well, the number of parents investigated for deliberately understating their income will be increased and action will be taken to ensure that parents lodge proper tax returns. At the heart of the government's family law reforms are the new family relationship centres, which aim to help separating families make custody and other arrangements without going to court. These centres will better integrate the Child Support Scheme with the family law system, by helping parents to reach agreement on parenting and child support arrangements. There will also be improvements in the way in which the Child Support Agency does business. A more customer focused approach will include improved training, increased staffing and more intensive case management for difficult cases. The bill also addresses a constitutional issue with the application of the Child Support Scheme to exnuptial children in Western Australia. More specifically, the amendments confirm the validity of the long standing practice of administering two parallel schemes during periods that fall between amendments to the Commonwealth legislation being enacted and Western Australia adopting those amendments for its exnuptial children. Everyone knows the child support system needs fixing. This is the first stage in the implementation of the government's Child Support Scheme, which will promote fairness that has never before existed in our child support system. The current system defies real world experience, and this bill and subsequent bills will overcome that limitation. The new scheme is more focused on the costs and the needs of children, including where care is shared. This is expected to reduce conflict between parents about parenting arrangements, encourage shared parental responsibility and help to ensure that child support is paid in full and on time. It is difficult enough going through the ugly process of divorce, especially for children, without being then subjected to the relentless child support and family law processes. I know these reforms will result in a better outcome for the most important and vulnerable people in our society-that is, our children. I look forward to the full support and implementation of the Child Support Scheme.",64
37,Ms GEORGE,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme-Initial Measures) Bill 2006. I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs which produced the report Every picture tells a story, which led to some fundamental changes to the family law system and the creation of family relationship centres. As part of that reform process, the committee made numerous recommendations about adjustments and changes to the existing child support formula, which are being given effect by the further detailed consideration undertaken under the chairmanship of Professor Parkinson. That comes to us today in the child support legislation amendment bill which, regrettably, though, only addresses some of the many important issues that need to be considered in the revision of the child support system. By way of introduction, I want to quote a paragraph from the Parliamentary Library Bills Digest that accompanies this bill, because I do think we need to see this issue in context: The Child Support Scheme has been in place since 1988. The introduction of the Scheme was a major, controversial reform. It was expected that it would take many years to refine and become accepted. The CSS represented the government intervening in one of the most sensitive and matic points in the family life cycle. Given the acrimony and emotions associated with family breakdown, the proposal for a government administered maintenance collection process could not avoid being the focus for dissatisfaction and grief and anger for individuals caught up in the turmoil of loss of family life and children. It has been quite a vexed, difficult and emotional issue-an issue that all of us as representatives of our local communities deal with on a very regular basis. You have constituents who come to you with claims that their partners' taxable incomes have been deliberately minimised to avoid their obligations and, on the other hand, you have noncustodial parents arguing that the system is all geared to maintaining the lifestyles of their former partners-you know the kinds of arguments that go on. One of the things I have always found difficult in trying to come to a reasoned and rational position about the formula is that I could never understand the rationale for the setting of the formula in the percentage terms that have applied. Part of the difficulty was always the inability to give a reasoned argument for the way the system was structured in the first place. I am sure that, at the was introduced, people had all the arguments. But it has been difficult, as the committee found, to get to the basis of those arguments. We thought it would be fairer if we could reach some independent and objective analysis of the actual costs of raising children which would take some of the heat out of these vexed arguments. The child support system was an important government intervention. It was important because it aimed to strike a fair balance between public and private forms of support for children, and to alleviate the poverty of sole parent families. We all know that sole parent families raising children are likely to be very much at the bottom end of the scale trauin terms of well-being and standard of living. We have always believed that any policy must put the interests of children first, reduce child poverty and operate in such a way that also both parents contribute to their children's well-being. It must also encourage both parents to maintain ongoing roles in their children's lives. I welcome many of the long overdue changes that will come with the introduction of the staged changes to the formula. But, as the member for Sydney indicated, our support for the package as a whole is conditional on improved protection against income reductions for low-income households raising children. I will come back to that argument later. The bill before us today seeks to implement only the first stages of change, and other speakers have gone into the detail of those changes. I think it is really regrettable that we are not in a position to debate the changes as a total package because, had we had that, it would have been much easier to assess the winners and the losers, and the equity considerations, of justice and fairness for all, that have to be part of the outcomes. You cannot argue against the fact that the time it existing formula has been the cause of a great deal of angst in the community. The research undertaken recently by the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that more than 60 per cent of nonresident fathers and 45 per cent of resident mothers thought the system was not working well. This was confirmed in the evidence that came before us in the inquiry that led to the report Every picture tells a story. As we know, many constituents who have come to see their politicians have raised concerns about the application of the formula and what they perceive to be the many anomalies contained within it. The formula as it now stands is, I think, based on the notion that somehow the living standards that applied in the intact family would continue to apply postseparationwhat is referred to as the ‘continuity of expenditure' principle. I find the rationale for the continuity of expenditure principle a little bit hard to fathom, because family breakdown does cause a different outcome in living standards before and after separation. But, also, I have always been concerned that I could not explain to my constituents the reason why the percentages were struck as they were, at 18 per cent for one child and 27 per cent for two, increasing depending on the number of children. I could not explain the rationale for those percentages being struck and applied in that manner. On top of that, we had arguments about the adjustments to recognise a range of different circumstances. Coming with that were the argument about what was perceived by many to be the unfair treatment of children in second families; the issue of contact above the threshold of 110 nights, which reduces the payer's liability; and the fact that the formula applied the same percentage of income regardless of the age of children. There was also the issue that it did not properly take into account the income of the custodial parent if that income was under average weekly earnings. In other words, the formula had not really kept pace with workplace changes, the greater participation of women at work and the issue of why their income was not part of that equation if it was under AWE. In addition to concerns about the rationale and basis for the current child support formula, constituents continue to air grievances about what they see as inconsistencies and anomalies in the application of the formula. It is not uncommon for constituents to argue a case as to why the formula, in their view arbitrarily set, is on taxable income rather than on disposable income. There is the argument that the level of exempt income is too low for non-custodial parents. As we know, it is now struck at about 110 per cent of the single rate of the pension, around $13,500 a year. Constituents tell me-and it is the evidence produced to the inquiry-that the application of that level of exempt income leaves many non-custodial parents in a situation where they have little disposable income to sustain a decent lifestyle, let alone make arrangements for repartnering or for children in second marriages or their new relationships. From the grievances that have come before me, there is no doubt that the selfemployed are able to manipulate their taxable income and that others are able to minimise their income. As we all know from published data, the lack of enforcement provisions has seen a huge increase in debt recovery problems for the agency. As at the end of June 2003, the CSA had not collected $844 million due in liabilities. Another vexed issue was the belief by many that in second families a child from the second relationship was treated with less consideration than a biological child from the first relationship. As we know, payers with new biological children are given a dollar figure increase in their exempt income before the relevant percentage is applied. Many nonresident parents who have repartnered and have further children in their new relationships constantly complain about the impact of overtime and second jobs on their liability for the children of their first marriage. To put it simply, let me quote from one of the submissions to the inquiry: As it now stands, any person paying child support has little or no incentive to work any longer they have to, knowing that any extra money earned is going to increase their child support payments ... that is, it will increase payments to the children in their first relationship. So there has been a widespread raft of concerns about the basis for the formula, in the first place, and about the many anomalies that people on both sides of the equation-both payer and payee-see in terms of its application. It was a vexed issue. I am delighted that the government followed the recommendations of our inquiry and set up the ministerial task force chaired by Professor Parkinson to undertake a detailed analysis and try to come up with a child support formula and system that addressed many of the issues that were causing concern in the community. As we know, the task force has recommended fundamental changes. Those changes will see parents share in the cost of supporting their children according to their capacity. The new proposals move away from the notion of continuity of expenditure-somehow trying to artificially maintain the intact family standard of living post separation-towards what the task force refers to as an ‘income share approach'. I think that better reflects the notion of shared parental responsibility and changes in workforce participation by women. It is proposed that in future the costs of raising children are worked out based upon the parents' combined income, with the costs distributed between the mother and the father-or the resident and nonresident parent, with the mother usually being the resident parent-in accordance with their respective shares of that combined income and their level of contact with their children. Both parents will now have a component for their self-support deducted from their income. Very importantly, in moving away from than the arbitrary percentages applied to taxable income, we now have, for the first time, courtesy of the University of Canberra's National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, a much more objective and realistic assessment of what the actual costs of raising children might be. As NATSEM themselves say, the calculations cannot be perfect but they are as close as researchers believe it is possible to come. For example, they estimated that for a single child of up to four the average cost was $91 per week in a twoparent family and $115 in a single-parent family. For a fiveto 12-year-old, the costs rose to $95 in a two-income family and $119 in a single-parent family. I give those as examples, because it makes it much easier to address complaints and concerns when you can say to people who come to see you that, at least for the first time, we have the best calculations possible as to the actual costs of raising children. As I said earlier, calculating the costs of raising children is based on the parents' combined income and is done in two age bands. I think one of the problems with the arbitrary formula applied previously was that the age of the children made no difference. As the NATSEM modelling shows, the costs of raising children increase as the children become older. The new proposal recommends that the support be calculated in two age bands-for children aged nought to 12 and for children aged 13 to 17-and that the costs are capped at a combined income of 2½ times the average weekly earnings, which means that at $104,702 the cap would apply. Some people will argue that high-income earners are going to be advantaged by this change and will ask whether that is fair. I guess that is a judgment people will come to with regard to their individual assessments, but I would note that a nonresident parent supporting two children under the age of 12 would still be making payments of $472 per week under this lower cap, and that those payments are higher than the objective data that NATSEM has produced on the cost of raising children. The task force recommended an increase in the self-support amount, that it should be the same for both parents and that children from first and second families ought to be treated as equally as possible. They also believe that regular face-to-face contact should be recognised in the formula. I have some concern about the withdrawal rate for child support liability. They suggest that regular contact-that is, contact of at least five nights per fortnight-should entitle the nonresident parent to a 24 per cent reduction in their child support liability. I would urge the government to review that, because I think that rate of reduction is too high and, in fact, has the unintended consequence of leaving too many sole parents-resident mums, normally-in a much more vulnerable position than they are today. I think if we could revisit that 24 per cent reduction for the nonresident parent who has the children for at least five nights a fortnight, we might get to a better and fairer outcome. I can see some of the advisers looking perplexed. ‘Regular contact' is defined as contact occurring between 14 and 34 per cent of the time, which averages to at least five nights per fortnight. If the nonresident parent provides that level of contact, under the Parkinson formula their liability for child support would reduce by 24 per cent. I am arguing that that 24 per cent is too high and is one of the reasons why there is concern that low-income resident families will be left in a very precarious position. Finally, as legislators we have an obligation to ensure that all parents meet their obligations to their children. As a member of the inquiry, I was appalled to learn that, based on figures that I think went back to 2003, more than 40 per cent of all payers in our scheme today are paying $5 per week or less for child support, 56 per cent pay $40 per week or less and the average child support paid in July 2003 was $57. They are appalling statistics and well below the actual costs of raising children. That is why the amendment moved by the member for Sydney expresses Labor's concern that, whilst we do not decline to give the bill a second reading, we call on the government to provide protection against income reductions for low-income households raising children. We believe there is strong evidence to show that many people in the system are understating their taxable income, which does not properly reflect their capacity to pay a reasonable amount towards the support of their children. Only about half of the people paying $5 per week for their children are on minimum entitlements such as Newstart, DSP or other income support. So, in my judgment, there are a lot of people who are minimising their financial responsibilities to avoid providing for their children. We will have ongoing debate about the impact that all these changes will have on resident parents raising children in sole parent households. I think it is incumbent upon the government to ensure that the overall package and its relationship to welfare policies will ensure in future that low-income households raising children are not left in a worse position than they are now where rising child poverty becomes an unintended consequence of the child support changes recommended by the task force. (Time expired)",66
38,Mr FAWCETT,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I rise to speak in support of the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme-Initial Measures) Bill 2006. As other members have rightly highlighted, this legislation has come out of the government's response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs Every picture tells a story report, which captured no uncertain terms the high degree of hurt and cost, both financial and emotional, that wrought upon families, particularly children, in Australia when their parents decide to separate for whatever reason. It highlighted a number of areas of concern regarding the impact on families and, in particular, the fectiveness of the systems we have in place to assist those families and their children. The government's response was to set up a task force which was chaired by Professor Patrick Parkinson. A wide range of people were involved to try to make sure that all stakeholders in the process, both groups representing children and those representing the primary carers-often the mums, but also the dads-had their interests represented in coming up with a solution that is reasonable and practical for government to implement but that also has just and equitable outcomes to the greatest extent possible for each of the parties involved. I make that statement ‘to the greatest extent possible' because no piece of legislation will be able to account for every individual circumstance. I recognise there will still be some people who will feel they have been treated unjustly by these changes, but I am satisfied that, on the basis of the task force set up by the government, these changes do represent a good and solid compromise from a range of positions to get the best possible outcome for the greatest number of people. This is part of a package of reforms announced by the government in response to the task force's findings, and they constitute a major overhaul of the scheme. Probably one of the most important aspects is the new child support formula, which for the first time tries to put some quantifiable data around the concept of how much it actually costs to raise a child, as opposed to the fairly arbitrary application of a system that really does not take into account many of the variin ables that individual relationships face. The package recognises the fact that our is demographics are changing and that there are more women in the workforce. There are also more men who have realised that the importance of work and family balance means that they need to perhaps reassess ef- how much of themselves, their time and effort they choose to put into purely career and how much they choose to invest in their families. I will digress briefly and say that my hope is that the realisation that has occurred to many post separation will start to dawn on people prior to separation and that they will choose proactively to invest in their relationships so that there is that quality of relationship built, such that separations are certainly reduced if not eliminated altogether. This reform is being implemented in three stages, and there will be a number of extensive and complex elements coming down the path. The reason for the phased introduction is that there is such a high degree of interaction between the new formula and the various software packages and other pieces of legislation that will impact on each of the stakeholder groups that, despite the fact that people have waited an awfully long time to see this change, we are far better served to take the time to get it right the first time to the greatest extent possible before implementation, rather than to rush it and end up confusing the situation and having failures in the system that will make the situation of many families, and of children in particular, even less fortunate than they are at the moment. Whilst I recognise and appreciate the concern and angst of some people who have spoken to me about the fact that there will be yet another delay before complete implementation, I do support the fact that we are ing this measured approach and putting in the resources to make sure that, when it is rolled out completely, to the greatest extent possible each of those interrelationships with other agencies will have been thought through so that we do not have unintended consequences and we do not have families, particularly children, who are disadvantaged financially through a rushing of the process. However, in order to try to mitigate that delay, I think the government have wisely decided to bring forward whatever steps they can in the reform package to benefit families, and this bill addresses a number of those measures. I do not intend to address all of them but they include the increase in the minimum child support payment and the cap, which is one measure that I would like to speak about. Specifically I will also address the ‘capacity to earn' decisions as well as increase in the proportion of a child support liability that can go towards prescribed nonagency payments. Lastly, for the sandgropers, it is good to see an element dealing with the Western Australian legislation, which I must confess was news to me when I read it because I had not realised that situation stood with Western Australia. I will now turn to the key areas that I would to discuss-that is, the cap, the capacity to earn and the percentage for non-agency payments. The schedule amends the figure that sets the cap on a liable parent's adjusted income. Having spoken to a number of payers, predominantly men but I have also spoken to women in this situation, this change will be very welcome because it is in line with the underlying philosophy of evaluating the true costs of raising a child and for each biological parent to play a just and equitable role in supporting that child in accordance with those costs, as opposed to a system in which somebody who works hard, who shows innovation or who runs an effective tak- business is almost penalised-which is certainly the way it is perceived-by increasing the take from those people. I think one of the outcomes of that process has been to see a number of people disengage from the system. I have spoken to professionals who had tremendous things to offer the community, whether in the medical field or in other fields, who have walked away from that field of endeavour purely because of aspects like this ever-encroaching take by the Child Support Agency for maintenance payments. I believe that it is not only in line with the principle of looking at the true costs; I certainly hope that it will again increase that participation. As pointed out by members opposite, even with the reduction in the cap, by looking at the all employees average weekly total earnings we will still see payments under the new system that are the substantially higher for children than those that currently exist. If we can particularly get that increased participation in the scheme, I believe we will see a far broader range of children who will benefit from that support from biological parents that has not existed previously. The next area I would like to talk about is the one that is probably the most important and which looks at a new way of assessing a parent's capacity to earn. These changes provide for a great more detail under the legislation to look at how that decision is made as to whether the parent has that greater earning capacity. The scheme at the moment has a number of flaws, and the outcomes are quite devastating for the people involved. The scheme at the moment means that if you have been working huge amounts of overtime, perhaps as a truck driver, as a shift worker or even as a professional to earn a given level of income, that is taken as the benchmark that you are capable of earning, with no consideration given to whether those hours that you were working were in fact reasonable or safe, and very little considerafor tion given obviously to whether it was one of the primary reasons that the relationship tually broke down in the first place. The lack of a clear statutory definition capacity to earn has really worked against the payers in many situations. The new method is intended to be flexible enough to allow parents whose earning capacity has been assessed to pursue a different career path or to reduce their working hours. To my mind, that is just and equitable because it provides for them the same opportunities that people who are not in a payer situation have. There is nothing that says to somebody who is in an intact family or is single that they cannot change their job. There is nothing that says they cannot reduce their hours of work if that is a reasonable thing to do from their perspective. So I think some of the outcomes that we will see through this change will go to the heart of some of the great concerns about the current system. I will look at safety. We have heard for a number of years concerns in the road transport industry about people driving incredibly long hours and we have put in a number of measures to try to reduce the hours that ers drive. Likewise, workplace safety requires that we manage people's fatigue. Even in the professions, such as the medical profession, we have seen a growing concern about people working excessive hours. So whilst these really positive steps have been taken in one area, we have this arm of government requiring people to work hours which are plainly unsafe. I think this change will have a terrific outcome in terms of recognising that just because they may have worked that at some point previously in their life there is no moral justification for requiring them to continue that work. In fact, the legislation looks specifically at setting additional guidelines so that the assessment is based on the level of normal full-time work the occupation or industry in which the payer is involved. That is a terrifically imac- portant change. Also importantly, it addresses the issue of equity. As I touched on of before, payers are now free to make the same choices that any other Australian can make. If they wish to go from full-time work to part-time work and training or, in fact, to full-time study to further their qualifications and opportunities, they are not prevented from doing that or sent into poverty through choosing to do that. This provides a very welcome relief valve for the purposes of people being able to change the work imbalance in their life. There are some good safeguards in this bill in that the courts making that decision can see what the primary motivation is and there is ample opportunity to make sure that the parent can demonstrate that the change is not purely for the reason of reducing their maintenance payments and that there is a justifiable reason, which is now spelt out in some of the guidelines, for making the change. I think the most important outcome, though, will be in terms of relationships. So many relationships come under stress and drivbreak down because of the imbalance between work and family time. As people are working to try to build what are often material assets and are perhaps working in two jobs or are working excessive overtime to pay off the family home, the stresses that are put on the relationship are often a direct cause of the relationship's breakdown. To then require those people to continue working those hours has two quite negative effects. It dramatically affects their availability to participate in a meaningful way in the ongoing lives of their children. For many of them that was difficult enough when they were working in partnership with the mother or father of the child but when they are living in a separated situation it becomes almost impossible for many people to have that meaningful input. So the ability to reduce working hours to something that is around the industry standard will play a large role in increasing the quality of ongoing contact. A number of studies highlight the very negative impacts of fatherlessness in our society. As the vast majority of non-resident parents are fathers, I believe this measure, which will allow fathers to adjust their work so that they can have more meaningful time with their children, will have longer term positive effects that we have yet to even start to factor into measures such as this. Importantly, in terms of quality relationships, it will also enable subsequent relationships of people who have separated to have some chance of success. If somebody is moving on to a new relationship and is establishing and maintaining that relationship but is still being required to work the excessive hours that they worked previously while trying to maintain the difficult juggling act of involvement in their children's lives, we are almost condemning them to failure. I think that is reflected in a significantly higher centage of separations and divorce for subsequent marriages than for first marriages. So given this reason of reducing the damage to future relationships, I think the specific outcomes of this measure will be very beneficial to our community. Proposed subsection 117(7B) looks at what a court needs to do to be satisfied that the parent's earning capacity is greater than is reflected in his or her income. It talks about the safeguard that they should be able to come back, almost by default, to the industry standard full-time hours or working pattern without any question about their motivation. The other factor that I think is quite important concerns the amendment to subsection 125(5) of the act that talks about the decision that is made being just and equitable. As I come to proposed subsection 117(7B)(b), I see it talks about ‘caring responsibilities'. I wish to highlight the fact that I think this is an important clause because it comes to the outcomes of future relationships and the ability to make quality future relationships. But I believe there may be a need to actually provide even some more clarity as to ‘caring responsibilities' and the definition of those. While it talks about those including responsibilities to people other than children in relation to whom support is paid, such as parents or a new partner, alternative caring arrangements can be perceived as being things that are for someone who is in need of care, such as disability care, child care or elder care. One of the positive outcomes is going to be in the area of being able to invest in relationships to keep those together and strong, which will benefit the children that may come from that relationship, while also allowing meaningful involvement with previous children. So I believe that there needs to be clarity in that area such that if somebody wishes to reduce their working hours so that they can invest in pertheir relationship with a new partner that needs to be very clearly a reasonable motivation for that action. The last point I wish to specifically address is the increase to 30 per cent of the child support liability that can be credited in relation to prescribed non-agency payments. I am hoping that that this will, again, play some part in reducing some of the frustration that payers feel when they have questions about where their maintenance payments are going. In conjunction with the parenting plans that people will now be encouraged to reach with their previous partner, the other parent of the children, I am hoping that we will see more benefit for the child because there will be an agreement by both parents as to the significant milestones and directions in the child's life and there will be agreement about where some of that money should go and the opportunity for the payer to direct where some of that money should go as part of this new provision-in fact, it will be a larger amount, up from 25 per cent to 30 per cent. I am hoping that the combination of this measure and the parenting plans that people will be encouraged to work through at the family relationships centres will, again, see a less adversarial and more beneficial outcome for the children who are so sadly affected by separation. In summary, I would like to highlight that I support the bill. I support the fact that it being phased in so that we get the complex parts of it right the first time around. I support the cap and I particularly support the changes to how capacity to earn is decided. I note that the outcomes of that have the potential to have very long-term benefits for relationships and communities which, at the core, define our society and how functional our society is, so I greatly welcome that. Not only are things like the parenting plans going to help facilitate this but some of the other outcomes of things like the family relationships centres will be focused on relationship education which I hope will manifestly change the culture of relationships in our country, so that people invest in them so that many of the measures that we are talking about today will become less and less required as relationships are stronger and last longer.",71
39,Mrs IRWIN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Of all the issues that stir the emotions of people living in the electorate of Fowler-whom I have the pleasure and honour of representing in this House, and I am sure the same could be said by every member of this House-the issue of child support payments or, you could add, their non-payment ranks No. 1. It is not hard to understand why. On the one hand, nonresident parents, mostly men, pay, in many cases, a large proportion of their income to their former partner as a child support payment. This leads to disputes over the amount paid in child support and very often over the use to which the payment is put. On the other hand, resident parents face the full cost of caring for children in circumstances where, generally, the costs remain the same but the level of household income is lower. The issue of child support in the context of child custody arrangements was examined by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, of which I was deputy chair. It was is reported under the title, Every picture tells a story, in December 2003. The issue of child support was an area of the inquiry which deserved close attention and the committee should have spent more time on the issue of child support. I think all members of the committee would agree that, while its findings in general terms have in many ways been incorporated in this Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme-Initial Measures) Bill 2006, the fine detail work as seen in the Parkinson report provides a sounder base for the detail of this legislation. Professor Parkinson did give evidence to the committee and later briefed committee members on his report. In fairness to Professor Parkinson, I should point out that this legislation owes more to his detailed study than to the report of the committee. The terms of reference for the family and community affairs committee required an inquiry into whether the existing child support formula worked fairly for both parents in relation to their care of and contact with the children after separation. The committee's conclusion was: ... it is imperative that independent modelling of the cost of children in separated families should be undertaken and published to establish what the impact would be if child support payments were based upon those results. In any event, the of the study should be used to determine the basis of future child support payments. In effect, the Parkinson review provided that independent modelling and other principles on which this legislation is based. It has to be said, however, that this legislation is just one small step. There is still a great deal of work to be done before we even get close to a fair system of child support arrangements. The minister acknowledged this in his second reading speech when he stated that the reform package would be introduced in three stages, with the more extensive complex elements included in the formula being the third stage. I can accept that there may be some wisdom in leaving the hard bits of the package until later but we need to keep in mind that the reforms will bring greater fairness to 1.4 million parents and they should not be delayed indefinitely. In looking at the measures contained in this bill, it is clear that it really only scratches the surface of this problem. The increase in the minimum child support payment from $5 per week set in 1999 to the indexed figure of $6.15 week is hardly an earth-shattering reform. The issue of the $5 minimum payment was of great interest to the family and community affairs committee. When the original child support formula was introduced, the Child Support Consultative Group believed that such a payment would force some nonresident parents into poverty, that the amount would be so low as to be of little help to the child, that it may lead to further demands on the social security system to avoid poverty by the nonresident parent and that it would not be cost-effective to collect. Welfare groups and nonresident parents opposed the minimum at the time of the introduction of child support payments. The 1994 Joint Select Committee on Cerresults tain Family Law Issues recommended a $5 per week minimum, and this was introduced in the 1999 legislation. The principle that there is an obligation on a parent to share income with their child, however low that income may be, can be seen as the overriding justification for imposing a minimum payment. When you look at the number of nonresident parents paying the minimum $5 a week, you can see why some members of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs were alarmed. According to the June 2003 figures from the Department of Family and Community Services, 39.7 per cent of child support payers paid only the minimum $5 per week. To put it another way, that represents 268,000 out of a total of 684,000 child support payers who are paying just $5 a week. I know that many people in this country are doing it very tough, but I just cannot accept that all of those 268,000 nonresident parents are doing it so tough that they can barely afford to pay $5 a week to support their children. By comparison, in overseas countries minimum payment figures were $NZ677 in New Zealand and £260 in the UK. I will not convert those figures because you also need to take into account cost-of-living figures for those countries, but it should be obvious that at least a doubling of the Australian minimum payment from $5 to $10 would be appropriate. That was the recommendation of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. It is indeed a very small amount but, as the committee saw it, that extra $5 a week would make a difference to the 217,000 children who would benefit from such an increase. The increase in this legislation from $5 to $6.15 is laughable. It would not even buy a loaf of bread. Although the indexation is commendable, because it is starting from such a low base it will never really be worthwhile. You might think I am mean-spirited asking nonresident parents to pay a reasonable minimum. I do not think that even $10 is reasonable in some cases. When you look at the proportion of Child Support Agency payers, you see that 43 per cent pay more than $40 a week and 21.5 per cent pay more than $100 a week. Of course, there are thousands of cases where the amount is several hundred dollars a week. If you consider the fairness of the child support payment system, it is reasonable to ask how those nonresident parents who pay their full share of child support feel about those who pay just $5 a week or, from July this year, will pay the grand sum of $6.15 a week. Finally, on the issue of minimum payment, I would repeat the stand of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, which expressed its strong support for section 3 of the Child Support (Assessment) Act, which states that a parent's responsibility to support his or her child or children takes priority over all other financial obligations other than that necessary to support themselves and any other legally dependent children and that this obligation is not affected by any other person's responsibility for the child. This legislation also deals with the level of maximum payment. Changing the basis for assessing the cap from 2.5 times the yearly value of full-time average weekly earnings to 2.5 times all employees' average weekly earnings has the effect of reducing the maximum income cap from $139,347 to $104,702. This represents a 25 per cent reduction in the cap and has the potential to save high-income non-residential parents up to $180 per week. This of course will be at the expense of resident parents. The Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs looked at the income cap and reducing the cap by changing it to either two times full-time average weekly earnings or, as is proposed in the legislation, 2.5 times average weekly total earnings for all employees. The change proposed does give a slightly lower cap than the alternative 2.5 times full-time average weekly earnings, which will benefit some nonresident parents. However, time will tell which of the two figures is more volatile over the years. Given we are dealing with a maximum payment and not a minimum payment, I would have thought that the full-time average would be more appropriate. Given that the figure is $104,000 a year, I do not think many people working part time get anything like that amount. It seems to me that, since we are talking about incomes of over $100,000, we are really talking about full-time employees and it would be fairer in the long run to use full-time earnings as the base rather than total earnings for all employees. The bill also makes changes which will limit the circumstances under which a parent's income for child support assessment purposes can be increased, and additional guidance will also be provided for decision makers to improve consistency and clarity of decisions. These determinations have generated a large number of grievances when nonresident parents have been assessed on their capacity to earn rather than on their actual earnings. These changes will give some immediate relief in this area but will be seen to greater effect when changes are made to the child support formula. The bill also increases the percentage that a nonresident parent can offset against payments, from 25 per cent to 30 per cent. These offsets can be used to pay for items such as school fees and medical expenses. As I said at the beginning of this speech, for many nonresident parents, how the child support payment is spent is often as contentious as the amount of the payment. But I do have some reservations about the discretion that this gives nonresident parents over what will become 30 per cent of child support payments. Going back to the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report Every picture tells a story, its main recommendation, which has since been included in the legislation, involved the concept of shared parental responsibility. The concept requires that both resident and nonresident parents share in the major decisions which affect the care of their children. I am concerned, however, that having discretion over 30 per cent of child support payments may impact on some low-income resident parents. I know just how much private school fees and treatments such as orthodontistry can cost and I am concerned that, by increasing this discretionary amount to 30 per cent, it may begin to eat into the everyday costs of caring for the child. There is also the matter of second families. While we look at child support in terms of the responsibilities of the child's parents, we should acknowledge that many resident and nonresident parents are part of second families, with dependent children of the second relationship. With the changes to the nonresident parent offset, I will be closely following the experience of families and problems which may arise from the change. Another matter which needs consideration, and which the family and community affairs committee found to be a barrier to shared parental responsibility and to the desirable outcome of shared parenting was the issue of the 109 nights-the number of nights that a child may stay with a nonresident parent before the amount of child support is reduced. There are two sides to this issue: the nonresident parent receives no concession if their child stays with them for fewer than 109 nights and the resident parent can have their child support payment reduced if the child stays with the nonresident parent for more than 109 nights per year. The Family Court, in full knowledge of this, shows a clear preference for contact arrangements of below 110 nights. This was identified by the committee as a major barrier to shared parenting; however, changing this figure would have consequences for resident parents. This will need to be closely considered in the next phase, when the payments system is reviewed. I raise this matter at this time because it is a barrier to expanding shared parenting and should be looked at with greater urgency. Another matter which we will need to follow closely is the issue of the use of taxable income or after-tax income as the basis for calculating child support payments. This is a long standing complaint, with reviews dating back to the Child Support Evaluation Group in 1991, the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues in 1994 and, more recently, the Every picture tells a story report, which concluded that after-tax income gives a more accurate indication of the income available to non-resident parents to pay child support. It is recognised that such a change would also require a change to the formula for calculating child support. It would also require a further change to the income cap, which has been changed in this legislation. As with all these issues, because they affect people day by day, any further delay in carrying out reform extends the unfairness and disadvantage that result from the faults in the present system. I know that the task in coming up with a formula that will be fair to the greatest number of parents of separated families is definitely not an easy one. The data from the Parkinson report can provide the starting point for reform. What we need now is the political will-we definitely need the political will-to frame and fund the complete reform of Australia's child support system.  important Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme-Initial Measures) Bill 2006 follows the tradition since the introduction of the initial legislation where both sides of parliament support the legislation. I do acknowledge the presence of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources in the chamber. Mr Baldwin-I was waving to the children!  privilege to follow the honourable member for Fowler, who is the Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Family and Human Services. I have recorded in the Hansard on a number of occasions my praise for the tremendous job and for the bipartisan way that its predecessor, the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, developed Every picture tells a story, because that is where the genesis of these changes lie. I would like to say two things about the honourable member for Fowler: firstly, she was so conscientious that she insisted on reading every one of those 6,000 submissions. How she did it, I will never know. On every issue that she takes up, she is always a champion of that cause and I thank her for it, as I do other colleagues who served on that bipartisan committee. I have had a bit of a history in this area, and I particularly welcome this first tranche of changes. It has been difficult to get effective reviews in the areas of family law and child support-and counselling, for that matter. I need to repeat at the outset one of the most important principles that we all subscribe to: that parents must have the children as their first priority, and they would be ours. We need to develop systems, and family relationship centres are one of the outcomes, that will encourage parents to have a productive and constructive dialogue about their children if they cannot have a constructive and productive dialogue in any other area after the dissolution of their relationship or marriage. It is important for people to see these things moving forward step by step. We cannot solve the problems just by changes to family law and we cannot solve the problems just by changes to child support. There was tremendous time pressure put on that committee, and the area that I thought we did least well in was child support-not because of any lack of motivation or intent. I therefore acknowledge the good work of Professor Parkinson in his report and also the ministerial task force. I want to repeat that the Australian Labor Party supports the changes in this bill and wants a constructive dialogue with the government about further changes that to be implemented. The honourable member for Fowler referred to non-agency payments. It has been possible for a non-resident parent to pay up to 25 per cent of their child support by way of worthwhile expenditure in favour of their children. This is an extension of five per cent. If you believe that the changes being put in place by this bill and other measures will increase the likelihood of constructive dialogue between separating parents about the needs of their children, this is a very good measure. It first came from a report I was associated with in the mid-1990s. We always had the view that, by agreement, additional amounts of money could be spent directly by the non-residential parent. It is not a means of attacking the authority or undermining the expenditure of the residential parent; it is about reflecting good dialogue and the mutual responsibility that two parents have to their children. One of the most common requests any committee or member of parliament receives is for some super accounting mechanism that fully accounts for and audits every dollar of expenditure received in child support. Such a system is completely impossible. But I hope that those who are not directly involved in divorce can understand that it is frustrating for a parent to be paying significant amounts of money towards the well-being of their children and having absolutely no say in how that money may be spent. I fully support the increase in the non-agency payments to 30 per cent. I also support the lower cap on child support. In the explanatory memorandum, there is a justification for the change from average weekly earnings to all employees' average weekly total earnings. This actually results a lower figure. My disappointment is that, when the cap was originally set at 2.5 per cent of average weekly earnings, there was no capacity for anyone to appeal a decision on the amount of child support, so you then had to take the appeal directly to the Family Court-a superior court more costly for litigants. That is why that original figure was derived. Here I again place on the record my admiration for the former member for Bowman, Con Sciacca, who got that internal review mechanism going in the child support scheme. As flawed as it is, I welcomed it. It was a big change and made a big difference to a lot of people but, once that happened, there was no adjustment to that cap. There is a fair amount of argument and some evidence to suggest that, with very high income earners, not all the child support money goes to the best interests of children. I repeat again something that I am on record as saying: one of the flaws underpinning the initial scheme, and even the scheme today, is the belief that somehow when parents separate they can maintain the same standard of living that the children had. That is just a mathematical nonsense. It can never happen. I support lowering the cap. There is another measure in this bill that I have long sought regarding the review process that currently exists in the Child Support Agency. As I said, I welcomed it and it was a welcome change. The only thing I disagreed very strongly with was the review not being a proper external review. It has never been a proper external review; it has always been an internal review process. We have lacked a proper external review. If we think that giving citizens the right without the means to challenge these things in the Family Court is a privilege, we are mistaken. That is no right or privilege whatsoever. This legislation sets up the opportunity for matters to be referred to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. I in strongly endorse that. I strongly endorse mechanisms that do not involve parents in outlaying hundreds and thousands of dollars in exercising their appeal rights, and I believe that agencies benefit from proper external review. By the way, I think citizens should have a right to have decisions by those who work diligently in the bureaucracy subject to proper external review. For me, this is a long sought, very welcome change. I hope in the future we will see that it works very efficiently. Another matter I wish to raise concerns the indexation of the $5 a week in child support that is required of all parents. This originally arose from what I think is a very sound principle-that no parent, no matter what their circumstances, should be free of the obligation to pay child support. Clearly, that presents some problems for those receiving welfare payments, but it is a very important principle which, again, was first articulated back in 1994. There is a lot of criticism of it on the not unreasonable ground that it probably costs more to be collected than the amount of child support received. I am not sure about that-certainly the cost-benefit ratio in such a small amount of child support would not be great, but the principle is worth hanging on to. To those non-resident parents who have opted to leave work and go onto social welfare as a means of evading their child support obligations, you may feel that you have good grounds for doing that. There may be difficult relations between you and your former spouse or partner, but I, for one, cannot accept, nor do I support, such action. That the amount is being indexed is all to the good, and again I say it should be supported. I suppose I could say more, but let me just say that the most difficult task that we face in developing formulas for child support is applying it uniformly to everyone. A formula will not suit every case, so we do need some greater flexibility. If we do not have greater flexibility, then as legislators-as members of parliament and as an executive government-we should be prepared from time to time to go out there to voter land, where resident and non-resident parents are, and test how the formula is working. What are its impacts? Are we achieving what we actually set out to achieve or are we creating unintended consequences or hardship? We can all agree about principles, but at the end of the day we have an obligation to ensure that what we have intended is actually happening or, alternatively, we must be prepared from time to time to amend and change. If there is one thing that has been absent-particularly in the area of child support but also, I suspect, in family law-it is a willingness of legislators, members of parliament, to not so much accept that change is needed but to demonstrate the willpower and determination to undertake that change. Labor will support much of the government's package in all of this particular legislation, and we will approach the proposed changes in a constructive manner-and I think we have seen that in the debate today. We certainly support encouraging shared parenting and a fair balance in meeting the costs of children's care and upbringing. As I understand it, there are two more packages that have yet to be presented to the parliament. I look forward to those, but in the end I do hope that lots of people who for a long time have given up hope of any changes will be heartened by this initial package of change. As I say, it is a twin approach. We have to get the family relationship centres up and running-as yet they are not-and there is a whole host of issues around their development, not in a negative sense but in the sense of dealing with problems, gaining accreditation et cetera. Last but not least, I said that we are taking a bipartisan approach. It came out of a bipartisan committee. But I must say in question time yesterday, when asked a legitimate question about a relationship centre, the Acting Prime Minister could not help but escape from bipartisanship on this issue and give a very partisan response. I hope that members opposite will observe the tradition of a bipartisan approach to this difficult issue that affects so many parents but, even more importantly, so many children.",75
40,Mr ANDREN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Calare) (1.51 pm)Before beginning, I must acknowledge the statements of the member for Chifley and his long standing contribution to and constructive role in the area of child support over many years in this place. The Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme-Initial Measures) Bill 2006 represents the first of a raft of changes to the child support system that will be implemented from July this year, January next year and July 2008. Those contained in this bill could fairly be described as the least contentious. The bill increases and indexes the minimum child support payment from $260 to $320 a year or $6.15 per week. Such a payment is more of an indication of the obligation of all parents to contribute to the needs of children than of any substantial assistance with the care of children. The bill recognises and rewards non-resident parents on income support who have contact with their children. Surely the aim of any child-support process should be not only financial support but also that essential physical and emotional support that an otherwise absent father or mother should be offering, and should have the opportunity to offer, to their children. Under these provisions, parents who have care of their children for at least one night week will receive higher income support. As well, the legislation introduces a fairer assessment of parents' capacity to earn income. This has been an area of concern for many constituents whose child-support payment is based on an earlier set of circumstances than applies at present-for example, they might have lost their job. The change will limit the circumstances under which a parent's child support assessable income can be increased. I hope the provisions for a clearer determination in this vexed area will indeed provide the clarity and consistency that the government's fact sheet claims. The new legislation is aimed at ensuring that parents share the cost of raising children by assessing the combined income of both parents, which is further assessed to cover actual contact costs. The total income of a sole mother-including government payments to sole parents, which have increased significantly in recent times-is now assessed in the figure. While new support payment formulas that reflect the costs of raising children and create new teenage categories will come into effect from July 2008, from July 2006 there will be a reduction in the income threshold from $139,347 to $104,702. This is designed to eliminate the so-called subsidisation of the lifestyle of the former-now custodial-partner. This still requires a payment of around $24,600-at that capped income scale-by a parent who has little or no contact with his or her children. No doubt, this will cause some consternation. But I am more concerned, quite frankly, to see that middleand low-income families-which, after all, are the vast majority of child-support families-receive a fair payment to ensure the costs of raising the child are properly met. The increase from 25 per cent to 30 per cent in the amount a nonresident parent can direct to be paid for esa sential items for their children is very welcome. It will enable non-resident parents to have more say in how child-support payments are spent. But with many childsupport clients engaged in ongoing personal issues-and many of us see that on a weekly, if not daily, basis-this needs to be carefully monitored. In almost all cases, it is the primary carer who is the most able to determine the child's daily needs. But I accept that there is frustration among many non-resident parents who feel their child-support payments have not been used to best effect. Hopefully, this five per cent increase in prescribed non-agency payments will achieve part of the desired effect. The bill also amends the provisions that deal with a parent's capacity to earn. The current method can require a parent to continue to work extensive overtime if that had been their working pattern before the relationship broke down. Under this bill, a parent's maximum capacity to earn is based on the level of normal full-time work for the occupation or industry in which he or she is involved. This will allow paying parents to reduce their working hours due to other responsibilities, due to no longer having to meet mortgage requirements or perhaps for health reasons. It allows payer parents to make decisions about their work and life, such as pursuing a different career. This all seems fair enough when one considers the greater enforcement and investigative powers that will be introduced to identify those who abuse the system. Studies show that about 40 per cent of parents misrepresent their capacity to earn. However, this also recognises the situation in which an overworked payer parent has to support a very disinterested former partner who has not contributed to the household's income despite a clear ability and opportunity to do so. Above all, there are checks and balances in this process and an ability to appeal any decisions, notwithstanding the protracted and often frustrating appeals process. So, overall, these reforms are very welcome and should ameliorate some of the concerns that bring so many parents to the offices of MPs. Child-support cases still represent about 10 per cent to 15 per cent of inquiries at my office, but that is a halving the number I had when I first met the rush of disgruntled, disillusioned and mostly noncustodial fathers who came to see me from 1996 onwards. In fact, I was absolutely gobsmacked by the amount of work that had to be done in this area. There is no doubt that things have gradually improved over those 10 years, and these provisions will certainly assist in that process. The move from the tax office chasing the unpaid child support to a more humane Centrelink and Child Support Agency process, and the outreaching of staff to conduct seminars in members' electorates, has gradually helped to create an environment of far more trust and confidence in child-support clients and, I would suggest, has been welcomed by all members of this House. The provision of family advisory services such as the family relationship centres must be welcomed if they achieve their aims. Many have doubts. The adversarial nature of much of the child-support process suggests that many partners will not accept counselling and will demand their day in court. Still, the lengthy delays in accessing the courts suggest that something must be done to provide some level of conciliation and counselling at the earliest possible stage. This bill is the first in a three-stage series of legislative responses to the report from Professor Patrick Parkinson. The future bills, especially those to be introduced from July 2008, are likely to create far more debate than this one. While there are concerns about a proposal that non-custodial parents who see their child one night a week be relieved of 24 per cent of their child-support obligations, there is recognition of the need for differential payments for younger children aged up to 12 and teenagers aged 13 to 17. Many will welcome the recognition of first and second families in determining the child of support payable. Also, in future legislation, some cuts in child support for residential parents will be balanced by the elimination of the requirement to split family tax benefits with former partners unless care is shared almost equally. I will reserve further comments until a future debate.",81
41,The SPEAKER,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Order! It being 2.00 pm, the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 97. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. NA East Timor",83
42,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister. Can the Acting Prime Minister inform the parliament of the outcomes of any discussions he has had with the East Timorese President Xanana Gusmao or Prime Minister Alkatiri about the offer of Australian assistance to East Timor, including the provision of Australian military personnel and police?",83
43,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Contact between Australia and East Timor has been between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the foreign minister of East Timor, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will no doubt update the House and the nation on that later on. What I can advise is that the situation in East Timor remains dangerous, that there was continued fighting overnight and that the situation could change quickly and without notice. The travel advisory has been updated and, as a consequence, we are now warning Australians that if they are already in East Timor they should consider departing. I can also indicate that those Commonwealth government people who are non-essential are doing that, and arrangements are being put in place for Australians to protect their safety. Can I indicate as well that Australia stands ready, if requested by the constitutional authorities in East Timor, to provide security to assist in stabilising the situation. I make it clear that this would be done in relation to a request-and it would have to be a constitutional request. Australia has an interest in having a stable region. We would respond to a request not only because it is in the interests of the East Timorese people but also because it is in the interests of Australia that the area be stabilised. Australia has already contributed both policing and troops to East Timor, and we stand ready to assist our neighbours if they should request assistance again. Relevant elements of the Australian Defence Force have been placed on a footing where they would be able to respond on very short notice indeed. Our objective, of course, would be not only to secure the situation in East Timor but, in addition to that, to defend the personal safety of Australians. This matter has been extensively discussed with the heads of security and Australian defence forces. The National Security Committee had a long discussion in relation to it yesterday, and it will continue to monitor developments and deal with them as they arise. East Timor",84
44,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister update the House on his dealings with the East Timorese government on recent developments in East Timor?,84
45,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. Let me just say, as the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer has just said, that the current security situation in East Timor is one we would describe as dangerous. I have received reports from our embassy in Dili this morning of further outbreaks of fighting between government forces and an opposition group near a place called Tasi Tolu, which is on the outskirts of Dili and very close to the headquarters of the East Timorese military forces. As the Acting Prime Minister has said, we have reissued our travel advice as well. Of course, I have been in constant contact with my counterpart Jose Ramos Horta over the last few weeks in relation to this matter. I spoke to him just before question time and I also spoke to him last night. The point I have always made in my conversations with him is that we urge all parties to show restraint and respect for the rule of law and the constitution of East Timor in resolving the current crisis. We have had some discussions in the last 24 hours about the question of whether the international community, including Australia, would provide any kind of assistance, be it police assistance or military assistance, to East Timor, and there will be some further discussions during the course of this afternoon, including with our ambassador, with President Xanana Gusmao. I have made the point, and the government have made the point, that we are ready to assist East Timor but that that would require a formal request from the government of East Timor-and by a formal request I mean a letter signed by the President, the Prime Minister and, preferably, the Speaker of the parliament, but, most importantly, by both the President and the Prime Minister. In the event of a request of that formal nature being received, I have told Mr Ramos Horta that Australia could consider several options for assistance. We do have troops pre-positioned, as the Acting Prime Minister has said, and they are ready to be deployed quickly, either to assist in evacuation or, possibly, to help stabilise the situation in Dili. We also have some police whom we can deploy quite quickly if required. We could indeed, as I have told the foreign minister, send a combination of the two. We would await further contact from the East Timorese government during the course of this afternoon. We have not at this stage received a formal request, but we have had some discussions about this issue and about the terms under which assistance could be provided. We have also had some discussions about what other countries could do to assist, because it is likely that if East Timor does send out a formal request to Australia it will send formal requests to a small number of other countries as well. It is also important that the United Nations be notified and kept informed of all this. There is a special representative for the Secretary-General, Mr Hasegawa, who is based in Dili, who is being kept informed by officials, by the East Timorese and by New York. It is important that the secretariat of the UN is kept informed, along with the permanent members of the Security Council. I made the point to Jose Ramos Horta that, in particular, the five permanent members of the Security Council need to be kept in touch in relation to the evolution of East Timorese thinking. Indigenous Communities",84
46,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Acting Prime Minister.

48,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is what I thought you wanted. In the light of this bipartisanship to on such an important issue, will the Acting Prime Minister ensure that all agreements made at COAG's next meeting will have benchmarks, targets and review mechanisms so that progress can be regularly assessed?",85
49,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We would certainly welcome bipartisan agreement from the Australian Labor Party on the measures that are necessary to deal with violence in Aboriginal communities. The measures which are necessary include additional policing; they include bringing offenders before courts; they include ensuring that there are proper penalties; and they include a very clear and very direct message to all Australians, including Indigenous Australians, that there is no justification-no cultural justification and no other justification-for offences against persons. We would certainly welcome the assistance of the Northern Territory Labor government in ensuring that adequate police resources are made available in relation to those communities. Mr Beazley interjecting",85
50,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is where we would welcome bipartisan support, which I do not hear from the interjections now coming from the Leader of the Opposition. Whatever he says, it is clear that the people behind him do not agree with that position and are not supporting the government in those efforts. I would make it clear that this government called a summit to put those matters back on the agenda.",85

54,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"A national summit, the call for which was made by the minister for Indigenous affairs, will be held next month-I have written to all premiers and chief ministers-and it is to get agreement on these points: to make sure that we are strong, tough and clear about stopping violence in Aboriginal communities. It will be reporting back to COAG and COAG will be involved in the procedure. Let there be no mistake about this: this government believes very strongly in protecting innocent children and women in Aboriginal communities and we will not let political correctness get in way of that. Indigenous Communities",86
55,Mr WAKELIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Has the Acting Prime Minister seen calls for customary law to be taken into account to reduce punishment for serious and violent offences? What is the government's view of these calls?,86
56,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question and I can tell him that there are calls for customary law to be taken into account to reduce punishment for serious and violent offences. Even the Law Council of Australia came out yesterday calling for Aboriginal customary law to be given consideration by courts and saying that proposals to exclude that were ‘misconceived, dangerous and promoted the issue ahead of more demanding social problems'. We do not agree with that. We believe that there can be no more demanding social problem than the protection of innocence, particularly of children in Aboriginal communities or, for that matter, in the white community. I noticed in the paper today that the Chief Justice of the Northern Territory, Brian Martin, said that he had made a mistake in sentencing an Aboriginal elder to just one month's jail for having anal sex with a 14year-old girl. I welcome that from the Northern Territory Chief Justice. It would not have been easy for him to do, but it was absolutely right of him to acknowledge that. That matter was overturned in the Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal, which imposed a sentence of three years in relation to that crime. Many Australians would believe that a sentence of three years for having anal sex with a 14-year-old girl and bashing her with a boomerang was still a very lenient senthe tence. Many Australians would think that. Many Australians would think that even that sentence by the Court of Criminal Appeal was not much of a deterrent. I would make this clear: if we are to send an unequivocal sentence to the Aboriginal community-and the white community, for that matter-that these are violent offences that will not be tolerated, we need strong support from the judiciary with strong sentences. A suggestion that cultural matters should be taken into account to lighten sentences on what are violent and serious offences will not find the support of the Australian people. We believe that there should be an unequivocal message. In raising this issue, an issue which has now been acknowledged by the Chief Justice of the Northern Territory himself, the minister for Indigenous affairs has behaved quite courageously and properly. I notice that the Attorney-General in Western Australia has accused Mr Brough of bigotry over his statement. Nothing could be further from the truth. In a courageous way, he has raised this issue; he has determined to do something about it. He is now finding support from the Chief Justice of the Northern Territory himself. He will find the support of Australians of goodwill. We can never justify, under customary law or on any other basis, heinous and serious and violent offences. Those who do them must be brought to justice, and this government believes that they should be. Nuclear Energy",86
57,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister. As part of the government's intention to consider nuclear power in Australia, will it nominate the proposed sites of its nuclear reactors and their associated high-level nuclear waste dumps?",87
58,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On this side of the House, we welcome a debate about the nuclear industry. On this side of the House, we have no hang-up at all about exploiting Australia's resources to gain export income for this country.

Minister, I refer to your proposals to restore law and order to Indigenous communities as a means of improving their overall economic and social well-being. What support has been given to these proposals?",88
74,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Herbert for his question. He no doubt would have seen the report in the paper the other day from the Labor Lord Mayor of Townsville, who has asked not to be forgotten with regard to policing issues in dealing with the Indigenous community of Townsville. I am only too aware of the work that the member for Herbert is doing with the people of Palm Island, a troubled community and one that wants to do far better and understands the importance of real policing. I have been heartened by the fact that so many people from around the country are recognising the absolute necessity of ensuring that Aboriginal communities have the same rights as the rest of us-that is, to live in a free society that is free of violence-and that they have security in their own homes. Today Magistrate Sue Gordon, who is Chairman of the National Indigenous Council, had this to say: First and foremost, we have children who are being abused and the first priority ... is protection of children. Maxine Schute, from the Alice Springs women's shelter, a woman that comes in contact every day with the consequences of a breakdown in law and order, was reported to have said: We have to look at a system where the perpetrators of these crimes are removed and not left in the community to spread fear, to intimidate those who have been strong enough to speak out. Tom Calma, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, says: This type of behaviour has no place in Aboriginal culture and customary law ... And we agree with him. He says it: ... is no excuse to condone such behaviour. If an Indigenous person commits these types of offences they should be dealt with by the judicial system just as any other person would be. The reality is that these communities have no faith in the judicial system because the perpetrators often, whilst on remand, get returned to these communities and that is where the fear and standover tactics come into play. It puts the fear of God into these people that if they stand up in a court of law and say what they know to put these perpetrators behind bars they will have payback. This is what has failed these people; this is what we are determined, once and for all, to deal with. Today I have spoken with a number of Indigenous people right around Australia, outlining the way I see this moving forward. I want to highlight comments from two different individuals. The co-principle of the Daly River School, which is not far from Wadeye, is very concerned that the violence that has been occurring in Wadeye and with the dry season now coming will spill back out of Wadeye and into these other communities. He wants us to be aware of that. She says that there has been a lid on this for too long, that the people have had no voice and now they have hope. She says that people are hurting and they hope that they get the support they need. The support they need, first and foremost, are police on the ground so that crime can be reported and crime can be dealt with. It beggars belief that members opposite shake their heads saying that that is not the answer. Live in a community where your child cannot be safe because there are no police. I ask you to consider such consequences. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I refer you to standing order 90, which deals with improper reflections on members, a standing order you construed quite strictly last night. On a number of occasions now, and it seems the minister is about to do the same, there has been an implication from the government that somehow members of the opposition condone violence or child sexual abuse. There is no worse allegation that could be made in this place. It is grossly unparliamentary and you should prevent that improper motive being ascribed to members of the opposition.",88
75,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business raises an important point. I remind all members of the points that were raised.,89

77,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It responds to some of the interjections that came across earlier to deal with housing. This woman has been in the field for 12 years working with family violence in remote communities. She said to me: ‘I want Australia to understand that this is not an issue about housing.

78,Mr BROUGH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am listening to people who are actually on the ground, who actually understand domestic violence. Let me tell you what a woman that deals with the consequences every single day says-not what the ALP says. She says that most of the abuse happens privately behind closed doors. She says, ‘It is especially a problem in remote homeland communities where overcrowding is not a problem.' This government does not for one minute suggest that housing is adequate. We say that it is not an excuse to rape a child. We will continue to say that and we will continue to support these communities. Thankfully, Labor state governments today are willing to work with us.

87,Mrs ELLIOT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister. Will the government rule out south-east Queensland and the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales as potential sites for a new nuclear power plant and nuclear waste repository?,90
88,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said earlier, the government believes that it is an important debate for Australia to have as to the nuclear industry. This government already has a policy which allows Australian uranium to be mined and exported. The Australian Labor Party supports that in three places. It would be a funny kind of a policy if Australia was prepared to mine uranium and to sell it to other countries but was so opposed to the nuclear industry that it would not allow it in Australia. What the Prime Minister has said is that this is a debate that Australia should have. It is a debate which will be an important debate for the future. I would urge all members to engage themselves in this debate. Those on this side of the House, who believe in Australia and its economic future, will certainly be engaging in a positive debate over the months to come. Nuclear Energy",90
89,Dr SOUTHCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister inform the House of attitudes of countries in our part of the world to nuclear energy? Are there any alternative views?,90
90,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First, can I thank the honourable member for Boothby. I appreciate his interest in participating in a debate about these issues, which I would hope in this country we could conduct in a sensible way. In answer to the honourable member's question, there are a lot of countries around the world, including countries which export uranium, countries which have nuclear technology and countries that have nuclear power stations, that have been able to conduct a debate and a discussion about these things in a very sensible and mature way. In relation to countries in our own region, Japan has 55 nuclear reactors providing 30 per cent of its electricity, three under construction and 12 planned. China has 10 with plans for 40 by 2020. There are six in Taiwan, and the Republic of Korea-South Korea-has 20. Indonesia has plans for four reactors to be built in the period 2017 to 2025, and Vietnam and Thailand are studying the possibilities of nuclear power as well. So I just make the point that there are a lot of countries that think that nuclear power is a real option for generating electricity, at least as a component of their energy mix, and they have been able to have a reasonably mature discussion about this and the value of it. Talking of alternative views, I noticed in a press release that the Leader of the Opposition put out on 23 May, yesterday, in relation to his opposition to anything the government even chooses to talk about-he just opposes everything, which is I think taking opposition to an absurd extreme-in this case, opposing discussions about nuclear energy, he said: ... there are important national security issues be considered. I wondered, I must say, reading that, what it meant. This morning in a doorstop the Leader of the Opposition said: Nations tend to regard those developing nuclear power for the purposes of power generation as retaining options for weaponising it. Apparently, according to the Leader of the Opposition, countries like Japan, Vietnam and Thailand should be considered countries which are planning to weaponise nuclear power to build a nuclear weapons capability. The Leader of the Opposition pretends to be-and has sold this message quite hard up there in the press gallery-an expert on national security, foreign policy and defence issues. I call him a charlatan. He is a charlatan on these issues. He is unfamiliar with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and he knows nothing about the International Atomic Energy Agency's safeguards regime and nothing about the important role a country like Australia can play not in endangering the world but in securing nuclear power generation through our nuclear safeguards agreements. I would have thought the Leader of the Opposition ought to brush up on his so-called expertise in international relations. Workplace Relations",90
91,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister. I refer him to an AWA offered by Spotlight, a company with nearly 100 stores and 6,000 staff, to a prospective new employee in New South Wales which provides an hourly rate of 2c above the award rate of pay but which has no provision for any penalty rates and no provision for any overtime. Does the Acting Prime Minister believe it is appropriate that the government's legislation enables penalty rates and overtime to be sold down the river for the princely sum of 2c an hour?",91
92,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Needless to say, long to experience in this place has led me to believe I will never take an assertion from the Leader of the Opposition in relation to this or anything. But can I say that the government's Work Choices legislation enables employees to come to agreements with employers which suit both of them, with terms that are protected by the Australian fair pay and conditions standard. Those standards protect important matters and ensure that there is a floor under wage negotiations. They do not stand in the wayMr Albanese interjecting",91

94,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,of people ensuring that they come to mutually bona fide agreements which are in the interests of both employers and employees. One of the things that this country has needed for years is the opportunity to have a more flexible labour market. Under a more flexible labour market Australia will have more jobs and they will be higher paid. The proof of the pudding the eating. We need only look at the outcomes. Since this government was elected in 1996 there have been 1.7 million new jobs created in Australia. Since this government was elected in 1996 real wages have increased 16.7 per cent. Under 13 years of Labor government real wages increased 0.3 per cent. One of the proudest boasts of the Labor Party was how they depressed real wages. I can remember Mr Keating standing at this box boasting over and over again that Labor had suppressed real wages. Ms Owens interjecting,92
95,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Parramatta is warned!,92
96,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The coalition boast is that under a coalition government real wages have gone up and under a better industrial relations system people will get better job outcomes. Avian Influenza,92
97,Mr CAUSLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister advise the House of the outcomes of Exercise Eleusis, which tested Australia's capacity to manage an outbreak of bird flu? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?",92
98,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Page for his question. In October last year the government coordinated Exercise Eleusis, which simulated an outbreak of avian influenza. It brought together industry, a hospital and state governments to assist our preparedness in the event of an actual outbreak. I am delighted to be able to release the government's final report on Exercise Eleusis, which evaluates the exercise and makes recommendations on how we can do even better in the future. I commend it to all members of the House as a new and original document. Just bear in is in mind those words, ‘new and original'. I am asked about alternative policies. A keen and enthusiastic member of my department told me the other day that there was an impressive and creditable paper issued on avian influenza from the opposition sidenamely, by the member for Griffith, who, as we know, has many interests. I did not know pathogenic disease was one of them, but he prides himself above all else on being an original thinker. So I accessed his document, which is published by the Labor Party on Labor eHerald, which is the ALP's national online magazine.",92

100,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is on avian influenza and I am asked about alternative policies. So I start reading it and at first glance it does look incredibly scientific and creditable, but somehow the words begin to sound familiar. The more I read it, the more I realise that these are phrases that have been brought to my attention previously. These marked paragraphs will be of great interest to the House. So what I find is that, of a 600word policy, 400 words are plagiarised.",92

106,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the minister.,93
107,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So the words had a familiar ring, and I find when I research the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States that there are several sentences and paragraphs contained in the honourable member's paper. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: you have ruled on a number of occasions in the past when members of the opposition have held up documents that that is disorderly-and indeed you have threatened members with suspension from the House before. You ought now to warn the minister and suspend him from the House if he does it again.",93
108,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Manager of Opposition Business will resume her seat. The minister is reading from papers. He will not wave them around.,93
109,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first influence on the Labor Party's policy was an American centre for disease control. The next one was the World Health Organisation. The next one is the Parliamentary Library. The next one is WWF Hong Kong and-wait for it-they have plagiarised the minister for health's own website. Just to add insult to injury, they and Ageing? plagiarised Tony Abbott! Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, you just warned the minister not to keep waving documents around. He did. He ought to be warned if you want to keep your own standards",93
110,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Manager of Opposition Business will resume her seat. The Manager of Opposition Business will not reflect on the chair. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I am certainly not reflecting on the chair; I am just seeking some consistency in rulings.",93
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He was reading from a document, and he held it up to read it, so I call the minister.",93
112,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So in the Labor Party document there are no footnotes, there is no attribution and there is no notation. The original thinker, the member for Griffith, is parading other people's work as his own. Bill Shorten would not do it. No, Bill would not do that. And, worse still, this is quite deliberate, because different sentences are cut and pasted with other sentences, and paragraphs from the five different sources are mixed up. There is a deliberate deception in the drafting of this document. This is no accident. This is not taking information from one source and making it a whole slab; it is all cut and pasted by this supposedly original thinker. So it is deliberate plagiarism. The only thing worse than having no Labor policy is having a plagiarised Labor policy, and I table all of the documents for members to reach their own judgments. Avian Influenza",93

133,Mrs HULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Would the minister update the House on initiatives the government is taking to deliver vital funding for the New South Wales road and rail transport network and also around the area of the Riverina?",95
134,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. It was a pleasure to be in her electorate last week to look at some of the projects that are under way as a result of the Australian government's investment through AusLink in important rail and road infrastructure upgrades. In particular, I was able to witness the signing of a new $16 million contract to provide a new rail bridge over the river at Wagga Wagga, replacing the old 1881 steel structure with a modern concrete facility that will enable the speed limit of 20 kilometres per hour to be lifted as the trains cross the river and inevitably slow down the movement of freight between our capital cities. We were also able to visit the Hume Highway and look at some of the projects in line for the $800 million investment by this government announced in AusLink for the Hume Highway, bringing to $1.4 billion the AusLink commitment to upgrade the Hume Highway to four lanes. When I was there, there was obviously a great deal of enthusiasm for this expenditure, but there was also a degree of frustration because the money that the Australian government has been providing to New South Wales for the Hume Highway in the past simply is not being spent. Particularly the people around the Coolac bypass project are especially angry that a long time-years, in fact-after the Australian government made the commitment to fund this important 12-kilometre bypass the work has not started. In fact, the tenders for that project closed on 11 May 2005-a year and two weeks ago-and New South Wales to this day still have not decided on the successful tenderer. In fact, the whole process is caught up in New South Wales heritage legislation-red, green and black tape! They say to us that it will be at least the end of the year before they will be able to consider the issuing of a contract for this project. How many more people have to die on this road before the New South Wales government will get on with the job of spending the money that the Australian government has already provided them? There is an absolute degree of incompetence in the management of New South Wales that is delaying projects that could be delivering an improved road system to Australians, and it is time they got on with the job. Workplace Relations",95
135,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister. It follows on from his earlier answer to the Leader of the Opposition. I again refer to the Spotlight AWA, which satisfies the government's minimum legislative requirements, and in particular to clause 20 of this AWA, which provides: … this … expressly excludes the operation of protected award … conditions in relation to, incidental to and/or … with respect to: rest breaks; incentive-based payments and bonuses; annual leave loading; public holidays; loadings for working overtime or shift work; and penalty rates, including for work on public holidays … Does the Acting Prime Minister believe that it is appropriate that the government's legislation enables these conditions to be sold down the river at the stroke of a princely sum of 2c?",95
136,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Australian government's Work Choices legislation is based on enabling employers and employees to come to agreements which are in their mutual interests and which are above and beyond the Australian fair pay and conditions standard. What that means is that there is a floor under terms and conditions and, above that floor, employers and employees can negotiate for the advantage of both. Can I point this out: employees are in a stronger position today than they have been in for at least 30 years, because unemployment is lower today than it has been for the last 30 years. The proof is in the government's performance. This is a government under which there has been massive job creation. This is a government under which there have been real wage increases. The worse thing that could ever happen for Australian employees is the return of a Labor government.",96
137,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Perth has asked his question. Is there a point of order? Mr Stephen Smith-I have another question, Mr Speaker. I assumed you were going to even up.",96

141,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I asked the member for Perth whether he had a point of order. Mr Stephen Smith-I said I had another question. I thought you were evening up.,96
142,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have called the honpen for the ourable member for Bowman. Mr Stephen Smith-In which case, I seek leave to table the princely sum of 2c. Leave not granted. Public Hospitals",96
143,Mr LAMING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Ageing. Would the minister inform the House what the government is doing to support our public hospitals? Minister, is the government confident that our Australian public hospitals are being well managed? Are there any alternative policies?",96
144,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bowman for his question. I know how concerned he is to ensure that public hospitals in Queensland at least are being well managed. I can assure him that the federal government is certainly providing ample funding to state public hospitals. Under the current health care agreements we are providing some $42 billion for state run public hospitals. That is a $10 billion increase on the previous five-year period. While we are providing half the money for state public hospitals, we do not play any role in their administration. To the extent that there are problems in our public hospital system, it has very little to do with money and much more to do with consistently poor management. I can inform the House that the Commonwealth is giving some $14 billion to New South Wales public hospitals, yet in New South Wales public hospitals operations are being cancelled because of leaky roofs. Local charities are being forced to pay for their own thermometers, linen and baby scales. Surgeons at the Royal North Shore hospital in Sydney have been ordered by management to recycle old drills. Waiting lists for elective surgery are 3,000 people longer now than they were 10 years ago. According to today's Daily Telegraph, the New South Wales health minister is incapable of placing a timely order for a new wheelchair for a terminally ill child. We are giving some $10 billion to Victoria under the health care agreement. Despite that, some 600 heart operations have been cancelled in the last 12 months in Victorian public hospitals. We are giving $8 billion to Queensland, yet in the last two years no fewer than 1,600 doctors have resigned from Queensland public hospitals because they cannot stand these places as places of work. They are only keeping the emergency department at Caboolture Hospital open by privatising it. There are a great many problems with the administration of public hospitals in the eral states. But, as if running these public hospitals was not hard enough, I can inform the House that administrators in Victoria and Queensland have just discovered a new priority: banning bibles. In Victoria and Queensland, Gideons have now been banned from placing bibles at every hospital bedside, though this practice has been going on for some five decades. A Royal Melbourne Hospital spokesman was quoted the other day as saying: ‘We don't have bibles in each room anymore. It is an infection control measure.' Presumably, the Royal Melbourne Hospital thinks that we should be sworn in in this place in surgical masks and gowns because of the risk of infected bibles. This is not an infection control measure-it is a thought control measure; it is political correctness gone crazy. I say to public hospital trators in this state: stop worrying about offending people and start running public hospitals properly and give people bibles at a time when they probably most want to see them. Workplace Relations",96
145,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister. I again refer to the Spotlight AWA, which satisfies the government's minimum legislative standards. I refer to a full-time adult employee, who under the Spotlight AWA will work a roster including Thursday night finishing at 9 pm and a seven-hour shift on a Saturday and Sunday. Isn't it the case that this employee will be paid around $90 less than a fellow employee on the award?",97
146,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I do not accept for a moment the proposition that is put forward by the honourable member. As I said earlier, under the government's industrial relations reforms we have the Australian Fair Pay Commission standard and we have the sevopportunity for employers and employees to come to agreements. It will be a system which is in the interests of employers and employees. This government stands for 1.7 million jobs, unlike the Labor Party. This government stands for real wages and real wage increases, unlike the Labor Party. We even know that the member for Perth has been instructed by the trade union movement to lift his game. We know that he is under threat of being moved",97

149,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Leader of the Opadminis- position has made his point. Solomon Islands,97
150,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. Would the minister update the House on the status of the Australian Defence Force deployment to the Solomon Islands?,97
151,Dr NELSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question and for his nine years of loyal service to the Royal Australian Air Force. We were all aware of the outbreak of violence in the Solomon Islands on 18 April and then across to 19 April. I think, like all Australians, we were particularly pressed with the very rapid response of the Australian Defence Force, which deployed within 24 hours 110 fully equipped and armed soldiers to Honiara to-along with other countries-bring stability to the Solomon Islands. Over the past month, we have had deployed from the Australian Defence Force as many as 400 Australian Defence Force personnel, which has included two companies of infantry, headquarters support, two Iroquois helicopters and two patrol boats, along with the airfield defence guards. The national security committee considered Australia's ongoing commitment to the Solomon Islands in terms of defence and peacekeeping in support of RAMSI late yesterday, and I can inform the House that we will commence very shortly a withdrawal of a number of our Defence Force elements and continue over the next two weeks. We will continue to have deployed in the Solomon Islands a company of around 140, and they will be supported by elements from the New Zealand Defence Force and Pacific island nations-which is currently Fiji. We will continue to closely monitor the peaceful nature of the Solomon Islands and will review that on a week-to-week, month-to-month basis. All Australians should and can be very proud of the work that is being done by the Australian Defence Force under the leadership of Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston in this deployment. The 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment will be remaining there for the foreseeable future and the Australian Defence Force will also be contributing to the guarding of the Rove prison, which is very important to the continuing security of the Solomon Islands. Workplace Relations",97
152,Mr SAWFORD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister. I again refer to the Spotlight AWA, which impays a rate of 2c an hour above the current award rate of pay but which provides that Saturday work is paid at the ordinary rate of pay, not time and a quarter as under the award; Sunday work is paid at the ordinary rate of pay, not time and a half as under the award; and there is no public holiday pay rate or loading. Does the Acting Prime Minister believe it is appropriate that the government's legislation enables these conditions to be sold down the river for a princely sum of 2c an hour?",98
153,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before calling the Acting Prime Minister I will say that that question went very close to asking for an opinion, but I see that the Acting Prime Minister is willing to answer it so I will give him the option.",98
154,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Long experience in this place has told me not to rely on an assertion or an allegation from a member of the Labor Party, and I do not accept whatever proposition or allegation that he puts forward. If he legitimately believes that an agreement has been entered into which undercuts the Australian fair pay and conditions standards, he could report that. But, of course, he does not decide to do that. Employees in Australia at the moment are in the strongest position they have been in for 30 years because we have had 1.7 million new jobs. They have the highest wages that we have ever had in Australian history, because under this government wages have gone up by 16 per cent. The only thing that could represent a threat to either your job or a wage increase in Australia would be the re-election of the Labor Party. The Labor Party loved the unemployed so much that it created hundreds of thousands of new ones! I say to people: in a growing economy with a better industrial relations system, their opportunities will be much greater. Budget 2006-07",98
155,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. Would the minister advise the House how the government has improved the operation of superannuation funds of Australian workers to help them save for their retirement?,99
156,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I say to her and to other members of the House who have applauded the government's announcement in the recent budget that superannuation now has much greater appeal to younger people in particular in this country. It is a much more understandable system. And we say to people who are over the age of 60 that, from 1 July next year, they have no tax to pay on a pension or on money which is drawn down in a lump sum. It provides an opportunity for us to say to young people who are in their 30s and 40s to consider superannuation in a way they have not been able to in the past. Superease annuation is now a less complex system that provides greater opportunity and savings incentives and will provide very well in the future for generations who will be experiencing the ageing of the population. Mr Bevis-Explain it to us, Pete. You'd understand it.",99
157,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the benefit of the member for Brisbane, who interrupts and who, like the members opposite, does not support the way in which we have said that we will reform superannuation, I will explain to him that it will provide tremendous supportMr Bevis interjecting",99
158,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Brisbane does not need to encourage it.,99
159,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"from 1 July next year to people over the age of 60. It will reduce complexity. We say to them that we will support them in retirement as we never have before. But there is one important point to make out of all of this, and that is that the Labor Party still have not committed themselves to this change. Despite having had two weeks since this announcement, we still have not heard from the Leader of the Opposition as to whether or not he agrees with or supports this change. This is another opportunity for the Australian people to see how the Leader of the Opposition is weak and undecided on these issues. Bats",99
160,Mr KATTER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in his capacity, as we are informed, as the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Is the minister aware that in Science magazine 28 October 2005 Professor Dobson asserts that: ‘Bats are recognised globally as being a natural reservoir host for new emergent dispathogens. Bats are host for the rabies virus'-bat lissavirus as it is known in Australia. ‘Three species,' he states, ‘have been officially recorded as hosts of the virus that caused the SARS outbreak in humans in 2002.' In light of this-and of a Queensland Health publication of 1 October warning that North Queensland flying foxes carry Lyssavirus, which is probably always fatal, and to which 9.4 per cent tested positive; Hendra Virus, of which two of four reported cases were fatal; Leptospirosis, which is sometimes fatal; and Salmonella, which is also sometimes fatal-could the minister assure the people of North Queensland that they have the right to protect themselves and fellow citizens from such imminent dangers by culling? If not, would the minister not agree that the state and federal ministers refusing such permission would be responsible for any consequent deaths or diseases that result from such refusals?",99
161,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The answer to the first question is no, I cannot say that I have read the report by Professor Dobson or whoever it is that makes all of those claims. The answer to the last question is also no, because ministers who make responsible decisions and take into account all of the issues that need be properly weighted cannot be held responsible for the sorts of outcomes that the honourable member referred to. If there is some further information that the minister for the environment would like to provide, I will give him that opportunity. Snowy Hydro",100
162,Ms PANOPOULOS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister advise the House of what steps the government is taking to protect irrigators who rely on water from the Snowy Hydro Scheme?",100
163,Mr MCGAURAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. The first thing that needs to be said to those who are understandably concerned about the privatisation of the Snowy is that it was inevitable from the moment New South Wales put its 58 per cent share up for sale. However, the Australian government is confident that the change in ownership of Snowy Hydro Ltd will not impact on the security of entitlements for irrigators. The Snowy water licence, issued by New South Wales but negotiated by three governments, has guarantees of continuing releases at current levels for irrigators. That responsibility is not altered in any way through a change of ownership. Some irrigators have expressed concern that New South Wales might seekunderstandably, given its track record-some changes to the terms of the licence at some point in the future. The Commonwealth took that on board. We considered it and, as a result, the governments have built in a massive disincentive for that to happen. The Murray-Darling Basin Agreement has been amended so that, if New South Wales were to seek to reduce allocations to irrigators, the cut would come out of its own allocation of water from the scheme in the future. No government, to now or in the future, could afford to do that economically, let alone politically. Another step the Commonwealth has taken to protect entitlements is to limit any individual shareholding to 10 per cent. In addition, two-thirds of Snowy Hydro directors must be Australian citizens and any proposals for foreign investment will be subject to foreign investment guidelines. Whatever the ownership, with the 10 per cent limit the terms of the Snowy water licence and the Murray-Darling Basin Agreement provide a bedrock of security. The government believes the process of approving the sale undertaken by the parliament through a motion of both chambers is the right one. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA Share Trading",100
164,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I have a question for you, Mr Speaker. Last night I was speaking to the House on the appropriation debate about AWB and the member for Gwydir's AWB share sale. The Deputy Speaker intervened to say I was in breach of standing order 90-reflecting on another member-and refused to allow me to speak further on the subject. Mr Speaker, subsequently, I raised the same issue in the adjournment debate and you ruled that I was in breach of standing order 90 and refused to allow me to speak concerning the member for Gwydir's AWB share sale. Given that standing order 90 was used last night to protect the member for Gwydir, why was it not used on 30 November last year to protect the member for Lilley when the Treasurer accused him of being the subject of a royal commission-that is, the Shepherdson inquiry? Why did the Deputy Speaker not invoke standing order 90 on that occasion to protect the member for Lilley, especially given that the member for Lilley protested at the time?",100
165,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Wills for his question. I do not propose to revisit the issues from last night, nor do I propose to revisit debates from earlier in the Hansard. Share Trading",101
166,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"3.14 pm)Mr Speaker, I do not accept that answer. I want to know why government members are allowed to say anything they like about us but they are untouchable and off limits if we want to say something about them.",101
167,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I will repeat what I have said. There are forms open to the member for Wills if he wishes to challenge the ruling of the chair, but they would normally be exercised at the time, and he did not choose to exercise that choice at the time. Procedure",101
168,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"My question is also to you, Mr Speaker. It also relates to procedure. It relates to the procedure concerning the recent-and excellent-debate concerning the late Rick Farley. I hasten to say that I was not upset with the outcome; I think the debate was well managed and well conducted. I was concerned about the process in which you, as I understand it, created a situation in which all of us spoke on indulgence rather than as of right. As I say, I have no concern about the outcome on this occasion: the debate was very well conducted on all sides, including by the Deputy Speaker and other deputy speakers who were in the chair in the Main Committee. Everybody handled it very well. But I am concerned that we have created a precedent whereby, in circumstances of legitimate debate, the right of members to speak is a matter of indulgence rather than of right. I would appreciate it if you would perhaps distribute to members the basis of the decision on which we proceeded on the basis of indulgence rather than on the basis of a motion to take note or some similar motion as would normally have been the case. That would have meant that people had a right to speak under the standing orders rather than needing to seek indulgence from the chair.",101
169,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the member for Fraser. I think he would be aware that those who spoke in the chamber yesterday on the condolence motion for Mr Farley were speaking on indulgence. The indulgence was today extended to those who wished to speak in the Main Committee. I do not believe there is any precedent. If the member for Fraser were to look to the House of Representatives Practice, he would see that there is quite a big section on condolence motions. I do not think that we have done anything that has not been past practice. Procedure",101
170,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I have spoken, unfortunately, on several such motions, including, recently, for a former Senate colleague, and my recollection is not that that was the process. I have no recollection of ever having sought indulgence to speak on such a matter before. As I say, I have no question about the manner in which the matter was conducted by you in here, Mr Speaker, or by the Deputy Speaker or other deputy speakers-in my case the Deputy Speaker was the member for Herbert-all of whom conducted the debate excellently. But I am concerned that there might have been a precedent. I ask you to review the process. If I am wrong and this has been the norm, I would appreciate some advice to that effect. If it has not been, I would appreciate you advising members generally of the basis on which the decision was made.",101
171,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Fraser and I appreciate the sincerity of his question, but can I make the point that, in speaking to the condolence motion for a former member of parliament, the guidelines and the House of Representatives Practice are quite clear. The guidelines cover the procedures for former members of parliament. In this particular case, it was by dulgence, as it has been on a number of other occasions for people who were not former members of the parliament.

174,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Brand proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The threat to the living standards and employment security of working Australians posed by the Government's extreme industrial relations changes. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",102
175,Mr BEAZLEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This is a government that thinks the entitlements of our young workers are worth 2c. It is a government that wants you to trade away your holiindays, rest breaks and penalty rates for 2c. This is a government that wants companies slashing hard won rights and conditions and tossing workers 2c in return. What an absolute disgrace. Our young workers deserve better than 2c and they deserve better than this government's extreme industrial relations laws. In question time today, the member for Perth, the member for Port Adelaide and I asked questions about an agreement, an AWA, that has been placed upon the website of a substantial firm in this country. Spotlight is not a small business around the corner. Spotlight is not an enterprise that is distant from metropolitan centres in a location where there is no scrutiny as to their activities. Spotlight is not a company that operates in circumstances where there is a lack of fluidity in the labour market because there are very few job opportunities available. Spotlight operates in the heart of this nation. It operates with 100 stores. It operates with 6,000 employees. When people have concerns about the security of their workplace, and when they have concerns about the stability of their ability to access penalty rates, holiday pay and fair treatment when it comes to issues of dismissals from jobs, they think about threats to that ability as lying at the heart of fly-bybe night operations-rogue employers. They do not think about threats to that in heartland employment. AWAs like this will affect the heartland workplace of the Australian nation-the sorts of workplaces in which the heads of families work, the sorts of workplaces in which people anticipate an opportunity for a substantial career over time and promotion, the sorts of workplaces in which people anticipate a dignified relationship with each other, with their supervisors and with their employers. In other words, they will affect heartland middle Australia. What we can clearly see going on in heartland middle Australia now is a direct threat to the livelihood, to the happiness and to the economic security of ordinary Australian families. What we can see in this AWA is a direct threat to young employees starting out in the workplace, for many of whom this may be their first experience of employment. Their first experience of employment will be of deepest possible unfairness-the elimination of all incentives and the elimination of a desirable outcome if they choose to put in that little bit extra. Of course, what the rent workforce can anticipate from this is a very direct threat to those employees who now come under awards or have other collective agreements with their employers. They know whom they are now competing with and what is coming at them. Let me go through the details of this AWA offered by Spotlight to a new employee in New South Wales. It offers 2c an hour above the current award rate, but with no penalty rates, no overtime payments, no rest breaks, no break between shifts, no cap on the number of days worked in a row, no rostered days off, no annual leave loading, no incentive based payments or bonuses and no public holidays. All penalties and loadings will sold off for the princely sum of 2c an hour. Employees on contracts will be expected to work late at night and all day Saturday to earn $91 less than their fellow workers still on the award. Saturday work will be paid at the ordinary rate, not at time and a quarter, as under the award. Sunday work will be paid at the ordinary rate, not at time and a half, as under the award. Under the terms of that contract, these conditions cannot be raised and dealt with for a period of five years. This is not just a five-year contract; this is a coercive, harsh five-year sentence-five years locked in harsh, punishing work conditions with no prospect of a wage rise unless the company offers one. The door is now wide open for these reduced conditions to be imposed on 6,000 workers across the country. It is written in black and white in the company brochure. The brochure says: With the new Workchoices legislation well underway, Stage one for Spotlight is as well. ... all new staff will be employed on Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs). We have it there in black and white what the company intends for its workers. This is cur- stage 1. Stage 2 will be when they work through the opportunities provided to themand they are many in this government's industrial relations legislation-to manipulate the provisions in the legislation that are there for employers to manipulate so that they can start to move all their employees onto what is now being offered to all their new workers. The thing about this is that it is completely legal. We have taken a very careful look at this, and there is no element of the government's legislation which has been traduced by Spotlight, not a single jot. Absolutely every protection that the government has incorporated in its legislation has been recognised and adopted by Spotlight scrupulously. Every element of protection that exists with regard to an employee's right to approach their employer has been scrupulously protected by Spotlight. The trouble is that at the end of the day there is basically nothing that protects an ordinary worker from this sort of treatment-no legal outs, no fall-back to the award conditions when there is silence on award matters. Those who prepared this contract for new employees of Spotlight were very careful: they made absolutely certain to rule out any provisions in the AWA that offended against any proposition that, if there was silence in the AWA, the award would operate by default. This is the future of this nation at the hands of this government. It is true that, buoyant labour market-and there certainly is a buoyant labour market in my home state of Western Australia and in Queensland; they are not as buoyant elsewhere, not in New South Wales-there will be a small number of employees who sack their bosses rather than the other way around. You might find them on the odd mine site in Western Australia, where they have to beg and plead to get people to work for them. But the vast bulk of people who inhabit our cities are not mobile. These are the people who are building their houses, creating their lives, wishing to come home of an evening to see their families and wanting to make certain that there is time available for decent contact with them and the rest of the community over the weekends, and people who may have two or three kids or mortgage commitments. They are not in a position to up stakes and disappear to north of Western Australia when they are confronted with a situation like this. They have-and this goes for 90 per cent of the workforce-always relied on fairness in the workplace. They have always relied on decent treatment via awards as an underpinning backstop. They have relied on the fact that they can contact and communicate with people who will give them help and then, when they present themselves to an independent umpire, have their claims to receive a decent return protected. That has been absolutely destroyed by this government. There is no doubt that in the not too distant future, Spotlight will be moving on all their employees. You will not have a situation in a workplace where somebody is paid $90 less for doing the same work. These things do not survive in workplaces. That is not how the country operates. How workplaces operate invariably is movement to the lowest common denominator. That is how workplaces in the real world operate. So, if a substantial section of the workforce and the in a incoming workforce are being paid on a different basis from others who are there, it is only a matter of time before they are all hit. This is reality. This is the real world which is inhabited by everybody but members of this government. This is the real experience of Australians. The worker who is confronting this proposition by Spotlight is confronting is a future in which, if her income contributes to a family mortgage, she is in trouble; if her income sustains the private school fees of students, she is in trouble; if her income sustains the private health insurance premiums that the family pays, she is in trouble; and if her income sustains the current level of petrol prices we are paying in our service stations now, she is in trouble. If she were to rely on the tax cut offered her by the government to make up for a $90 a week cut in what she could have anticipated against the the award, she would regard it as merely derisory. There is $10 in that tax cut against a $90 cut in her pay. When we mention that figure of $90, understand this: we are talking about what is normally expected of a worker in Spotlight. We are not talking about a worker who is volunteering for unusual hours or working on a holiday on which they do not normally work; we are talking about the ordinary week of the average Spotlight worker. So it is $90 against the ordinary week. It is not against some cobbled-up situation on penalty rates where somebody is desperately trying to work a bit of overtime. This is a very serious situation. I said this morning that, when I first started talking about these industrial relations issues, I talked about this law as an infestation of termites. Actually, the problems are hitting the Australian workforce much faster and much more comprehensively than I expected them to. We are going to have an accounting in 18 months from now, and that accounting will bring home to the table of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations every piece of injustice that is now being committed in the workforce around the country. He will be held accountable for it and he will be defeated. (Time expired) Mr Wilkie interjecting",102
176,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Swan has been warned! He wants to be very careful.,105
177,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Menzies-Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (3.34 pm)-We hear a lot about fairness from the Leader of the Opposition. What the Leader of the Opposition will not face is that basic fairness starts with the chance of a job. This is the man who presided over double-digit unemployment in Australia, left this country with a $10 billion black hole and a $96 billion Commonwealth debt and whose economic responsibility can be summed up in those three pieces of data alone. Through his comments today he says implicitly to the people of Australia that five per cent unemployment is good enough. That is what the Leader of the Opposition is effectively saying to the people of Australia today. We do not believe that, because five per cent unemployment means that, today, there are still hundreds of thousands of our fellow Australians who do not have a job, and we believe that, as far as those Australians are concerned, basic fairness is the opportunity to get a job. For somebody who is young and does not have a job, to be able to get a job that contains minimum standards and conditions-a job that contains as part of the guarantee under the Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard a 38-hour week and the classification wages that are set in the award classifications, which are adjusted up by the Australian Fair Pay Commission in the future, a job that contains a guarantee of four weeks annual leave, in addition to sick leave, personal leave and carers leaveMr Brendan O'Connor interjecting",105
178,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member opposite objects that two weeks can be traded off, something over which the Western Australia Labor government presides; it is the very same system in Western Australia. If it is good enough for colleagues in Western Australia in the Carpenter Labor government, then why isn't it good enough for the rest of Australia? No, the reality is that with these guarantees we say unashamedly to the people of AustraliaMr Swan-You're proud of it.",105
179,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Lilley is warned!,105
180,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We say unashamedly to the people of Australia that we think it is good if an unemployed person can get a job that gives them a normal 38-hour working week and a payment based on the safety net decision made by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission last year-and, incidentally, the Fair Pay Commission can raise that pay rate in the future. The Leader of the Opposition was quite wrong when he said there was ‘no prospect of a pay rise for five years'. When the Fair Pay Commission adjusts pay rates in the spring of this year, if those pay rates are adjusted upwards-as one would expect in the current economic environment-that will prove that that aspect of what the Leader of the Opposition said is wrong. But let us look at the reality of this. The Leader of the Opposition was a senior minister in a Labor government that presided over a fall in real wages in Australia. In the 1980s, what were the prospects for Australians as far as their economic future was concerned? Their real wages went down under the accord implemented in conjunction with the then Labor government, of which the Leader of the Opposition was a senior cabinet member. At the end of the 1980s, this country had the most prescriptive industrial relations tem it had ever had. At the end of the 1980s, how many of the one million people in this country who were out of work were saved by that prescriptive industrial relations system? Mr Hatton interjecting",105
181,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"At least the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, the predecessor of the member who is interjecting now, realised in the early 1990s that that prescriptive industrial relations system did not save one million Australians from being thrown into unemployment. In the 10 years since then, we have seen a total reversal, a total turnabout in the prospects of Australian workers and their families-something that the Leader of the Opposition, when he had his hands on this country's gear levers of policy, was incapable of changing. Over the last decade, we have seen an increase of something like 1.7 million extra jobs for Australians. We have also seen a 16 per cent increase in real wages for Australians, compared to about a one per cent increase over the total 13 years of the previous Labor government. We have seen low interest rates-a far cry from the home mortgage rates of 17 and 18 per cent, let alone the 21 and 22 per cent interest rates that smalland mediumsized businesses in Australia were paying back in the 1980s and the early 1990s. We have seen inflation rates in the band regarded as acceptable by the Reserve Bank. Whatever piece of economic data you like to take, it will match the experiences of ordinary Australians-that is, there has been relative prosperity over the last 10 years, particularly in comparison with the regime and the economic circumstances of Australia when we were living under the previous Labor government. The other thing about the rhetoric from the Leader of the Opposition today is that there is absolutely nothing new about it. This sys- is what we heard back in 1996. Let me quote the Leader of the Opposition from the Hansard of 19 June 1996, almost a decade ago. He was talking about the then Workplace Relations Act, which was being attacked by the Labor Party with the same degree of overblown rhetoric we are getting today with the Work Choices legislation. He said that the Workplace Relations Act would lead to: ... the kind of low wage, low productivity industrial wasteland we see in the United States and New Zealand where jobs can be bought at bargain basement rates ... He said that Australia would go: ... straight down the American road on ... wages justice ... that produces social dislocation more than anything else ... He also said: At the end of the day, guns are a symptom of that process. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said on 19 June 1996. The member for Perth was saying similar things. He said: The Howard model is quite simple. It is all about lower wages; it is about worse conditions; it is about a massive rise in industrial disputation; is about the abolition of safety nets; and it is about pushing down or abolishing minimum standards. No doubt we will hear something very similar from the member for Perth if he contributes to this debate today. The rhetoric from the opposition in relation to industrial relations has not changed one whit in almost 10 years. But let us deal with some of the facts in relation to what the Leader of the Opposition has said. I note that, in question time, he talked about an AWA that had been offeredand we will look into that. First of all, we will check out whether what he says about it is correct, because past experience over a long period of time indicates we should not take on face value things that are said in this place by the opposition. The opposition leader kept talking about an AWA that had been offered. Presumably, on the words that he carefully and advisedly used, this was not an AWA that had been taken up. We will check that out, but let me deal with some facts about AWAs. First of all, if you are an existing employee, you cannot be forced onto an AWA. If you are employed under some other form of industrial arrangement, such as an award or a collective agreement, you cannot be forced onto an AWA. If you are offered a job and the employer says, ‘These are the conditions,' you can choose whether to take that job or not. As an employee, you have a choice of whether you take that job or not. Unlike the Labor Party, we will not stand by and allow 1.1 million Australians to be thrown onto the unemployment heap-the great economic record of the previous government. Existing employees cannot be forced onto AWAs. The Workplace Relations Act makes it unlawful for employers to terminate an employee for refusing to agree to an AWA. It makes it unlawful for employers it to use duress in relation to AWA agreement making. If employees have concerns about their rights and entitlements, they can contact the Office of Workplace Services. In the last few weeks, we have seen the Office of Workplace Services take action where rights and entitlements have not been met under industrial legislation. In addition, all employees in Australia have the right to appoint a bargaining agent to negotiate an AWA. They can have the union shop steward come in and negotiate their AWA for them. If they want to, they can choose someone else to come in and negotiate their AWA for them. Once that bargaining agent has been appointed, that appointment has to be respected by the employer in those circumstances. The employer cannot simply say, ‘I will not deal with the bargaining agent concerned.' Employers must deal with that validly appointed bargaining agent. There are protections not mentioned by the Labor Party in relation to this. But what are the policy alternatives of the Labor Party? Let us look at a few things in their policies outlining what they would do, and see how that is going to lead to job creation in Australia. For example, we have the ALP policy to impose a new payroll tax on business in Australia. They want to fund unpaid employee entitlements through a payroll tax on all employers of 0.1 per cent of the payroll. How long do you think it will stay at 0.1 per cent of the payroll? Firstly, their policy is to tax employment even beyond what it is being taxed at the present time. Secondly, they say, ‘We want to abolish AWAs,' despite the fact that people on AWAs earn more, on average, than people who are employed under collective agreements and earn a lot more than people who are employed under awards. For the nearly one million people who have entered into AWAs in Australia, the Australian Labor Party's policy is to say, ‘As for those better conditions, that better salary you've got'-almost one million AWAs now-‘we're going to rip them away from you.' They are going to rip them away from what is getting close to one in 10 people employed in Australia at the present time. Beyond that, they want to reimpose the abused unfair dismissal system in Australia. This is the system that led to the ridiculous situation where employers would sooner pay $5,000 or $10,000 or $15,000 to get rid of a problem rather than to reinstate someone. Mrs Draper-Go away money.",106
182,Mr ANDREWS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"As the member for Makin says, go away money was being paid out regularly by small and medium sized businesses in Australia rather than having to reinstate someone. And look at some of the cases where tribunals have ordered reinstatement. Somebody was caught red-handed thieving from the employer, and a tribunal ordered reinstatement. Somebody was involved in gross sexual harassment of a female colleague, and a tribunal ordered reinstatement. And there are other cases that I will not describe here in the parliament this afternoon, where tribunals have ordered reinstatement. This is the system that the Australian Labor Party wants to put back in place, rather than taking a realistic look at these propositions. I have had small business operators come up to me in different states of Australia over the last few weeks saying, ‘I've taken on another one or two workers because you've got rid of the unfair dismissal system.' Why did they put on another one or two workers? Because they are no longer afraid that, if they put somebody on and it does not work out, the worker will bring an unmeritorious claim against them and they will end up paying $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000 and in some cases thousands of dollars more than that. Yet this remains the Australian Labor Party's policy, repeated over and over again. What will that do for creating jobs for Australians? What will that do to create the fairness for employers and employees that we have this wild rhetoric about from the Leader of the Opposition? On top of that, we have good faith bargaining. What does this mean? It means any business owner, including a small business without even one trade union member, will be forced by law, under the ALP's policy, to meet and negotiate higher above-award wages and employment conditions with any union official who makes those demands. This would occur even if the workplace has no trade union members. Again, this is the Australian Labor Party's policy for employment law in Australia in the future, if they were elected-union bargaining agent fees, compulsory contributions to union training funds and compulsory time off for union activities. I gave an example of that in question time a couple of days ago-the sorts of things which are part and parcel of the Australian Labor Party's policy when it comes to industrial relations. There would be no limit on the matters that could be included in awards. Labor would abolish the current limit of 20 allowable matters under awards. Unions would have automatic right of entry into workplaces where they have current members, or even prospective members. So even if there is no union member in a workplace, you will have the thugs from the union rolling in on building sites-as we had until we got the Australian Building and Construction Industry Commission in place-right around Australia. They would abolish prohibitions on secondary boycotts and sympathy strikes currently contained in the Trade Practices Act; they would get rid of the Australian Building and Construction Industry Commission. The greatest danger to the men and women who work in Australia-the greatest danger to them and their families and their well-being, their standard of living and their future prosperity-is not anything that is contained in the Work Choices legislation, which will bring about better outcomes. The greatest danger to the men and women of Australia is the election, at some stage in the future, of a Labor government.",108
183,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Normally I would start by saying we have just heard the minister give us his two bobs worth, but now we know it is his two cents worth. The Treasurer and Acting Prime Minister has left the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to speak on the MPI after taking all the questions at question time on this issue, and there was the minister-like a rabbit in the spotlight. This morning we had a disallowance motion asking the House to knock off the regulations promulgated under the Work Choices legislation-that is Labor's commitment; to knock off these regulations, knock off this legislation-and the minister stood up and said, ‘All is rosy for the future.' Let us put a spotlight on the future under the government's extreme industrial relations legislation. What do we know about Spotlight? If you go to Spotlight's website, you will find out: Spotlight is Australia's largest Fabric, Craft Home Decorating Superstore, with the revenue exceeding $600 million ... Spotlight operates over 86 stores, occupying over 3 million square feet of retail space, and employs over 6,000 staff. That is Spotlight. It is a major organisation. Spotlight's internal management magazine for May 2006 has, ‘Hot Topics this Month: Work Choices' and ‘Monthly Workplace Relations Update'. It says: With the new Workchoices legislation well underway, Stage one for Spotlight is … all new staff will be employed on Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs). So we know where Spotlight is coming from. But if you have a look at Spotlight's website, you will see that Spotlight understands all too clearly what the current law of the land is. On the Spotlight website, you can get an application and apply to become an employee of Spotlight. And what does the website quite responsibly contain, because it is part of the existing law? It contains an information statement for employees about Australian workplace agreements, which expressly makes available to prospective employees of Spotlight the Australian government's Office of the Employment Advocate's advice to employees on AWAsincluding drawing express attention to the government's so-called minimum standards: four weeks paid annual leave, 10 days paid personal leave, up to 52 weeks unpaid parental leave and maximum ordinary hours of work limited to 38 hours per week. Guess what, Mr Deputy Speaker: the AWA promulgated by Spotlight is entirely consistent with the government's minimum standards. What is the point? The point is not its being consistent with the government's minimum standards, which has been the government's defence, but rather that the government has been entirely sprung by the things that are knocked off from existing employee conditions. The contrast that needs and to be made is the contrast between what is available under this AWA consistent with the government's law and what is currently available to existing employees. That is why, on more than one occasion during question time, I was at pains to make the point that the AWA from Spotlight is consistent with the government's so-called legislated minimum standards. I have it here: Spotlight Pty Ltd Australian Workplace Agreement. When you go through it you find that, on any reading, it is entirely consistent with the government's legislated minimum standards. What was suggested by the government to a prospective new employee? Take that AWA and your pay rate will increase from $14.28 an hour, which is the New South Wales award basis, up to $14.30 an hour-an increase of the princely sum of 2c an hour. When you look at the government's so-called minimum standards and the Spotlight AWA, you find that clause 8 of the AWA satisfies the hours of work provision, clause 10 satisfies the annual leave provision, clause 13 satisfies the parental leave provision, clauses 11 and 12 satisfy the personal leave and carers provisions, and the $14.30 offered is greater than the minimum wage, which is $12.75 an hour. So that is fine. But then we discover the differences between the AWA proposed to new employees and the current standards. The base rate of pay for the current standard is $14.28 an hour; the Spotlight rate of pay is $14.30. If you work under the current award, for Saturday you get a penalty rate of time and a quarter at $17.85 per hour; under the AWA it is $14.30. If you currently work on Sunday you get a penalty rate of time and a half at $21.42 per hour; under the Spotlight AWA it is $14.30 per hour. If you work on a public holiday under current conditions you get double time and a half, or $35.70 per hour; under Spotlight's AWA you get $14.30. Currently for overtime you get time and a half for the first two hours, which is $21.42 per hour; with Spotlight there is no overtime and you get $14.30 per hour. Currently for all other hours of overtime over the first two hours you get double time at $28.56 per hour; under the Spotlight AWA it is $14.30 per hour. Under the award and current conditions, you get a paid 10-minute rest break; under Spotlight's AWA you get no paid rest break. Under the award, 7 am to 6 pm Monday to Wednesday, 7 am to 9 pm Thursday to Friday, 7 am to 6 pm on Saturday and 8 am to 5 pm on Sunday are ordinary hours. Under the AWA all hours worked are ordinary hours. How many Spotlight stores do we know that are closed on a Thursday night or a Saturday? Under the current conditions annual leave loading is 17.5 per cent; under the Spotlight AWA there is no leave loading. On roster protections, under the award there are guaranteed RDOs, no more than five days work per week or six in one week and four in the next and at least 10 hours break between shifts. Under the Spotlight AWA, which satisfies the government's minimum standards to the great satisfaction of the Acting Prime Minister and the minister, there are no rostered days off, no restriction on the number of consecutive days worked without a break and no minimum break between shifts. And there are some things here which other people might regard as minor but which are significant: the current standards contain a first aid allowance of $1.54 per day while there is no allowance under the Spotlight AWA. There is a meal allowance under the award of $10.80 per meal but no allowance under the AWA. There is a uniform allowance of $8.80 per week under the award; no allowance under the AWA. Part-time employees must work a maximum of 30 hours per week under the award but under the Spotlight AWA can be required to work over 38 hours per week. What does that loss of conditions add up to? To the princely sum of the minister's 2c an hour. He is caught like a rabbit in the spotlight. He cannot even give us his two bob's worth; he just gives us his two cents worth. If you are a full-time employee as an adult and you work on a Thursday nightand how many Spotlight stores have we seen closed on Thursday night?-and on Saturday and Sunday, guess what the difference is between what a new employee under the AWA will receive and what a current employee under the award gets: it is $91.35 less a week. As there is no public holiday loading under the AWA, guess what the difference is: if you include a value in lieu of working on a public holiday, the difference for a full-time employee whose roster includes a public holiday is $53.96 for that day. New South Wales has 10 or 11 public holidays each year, which makes 500 bucks a year. Thanks very much, Two Cents Minister. Where was the focus of questions in question time today to the Acting Prime Minister and Treasurer? He said, firstly, ‘We don't believe any of the assertions that you make.' The documentation is there for all to see. He said, secondly, ‘These are terrific agreements made between employer and employee to their mutual benefit and they satisfy the ernment's minimum standards.' Yes, the Spotlight AWA satisfies the government's minimum standards, but let us see what is cut away from the current conditions and entitlements. These reflect the questions put to the Acting Prime Minister today. Under the AWA there is no provision for any penalty rates and no provision for any overtime. The AWA expressly excludes in a one-paragraph clause any award condition or entitlement in respect of rest breaks, incentive based payments and bonuses, annual leave loading, public holidays, loadings for working overtime or shift work, and penalty rates, includliamentary ing for work on public holidays. So, at the stroke of a pen, all those have been sold down the river for the princely sum of 2c an hour. Further, under the AWA, Saturday work is paid at the ordinary rate of pay, not time and a quarter as currently is the case under the award. Sunday work is paid at the ordinary rate of pay, not time and a half as under the award. There is no public holiday pay rate or loading. There are no paid rest breaks between shifts, there is no guarantee of a break between shifts, there is no cap on the number of consecutive days worked and there are no rostered days off. Let us put a spotlight onto the future: under Howard's extreme industrial relations legislation, endorsed today by the Acting Prime Minister and the two cents minister, all of that has been sold down the river at the stroke of a pen for the princely sum of 2c an hour. That will return to haunt all those members opposite at the next election. When we are elected we will tear up your legislation, we will tear up your regulations and we will tear up your bad hearts.",109
184,Dr SOUTHCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The federal parliament has been debating industrial relations since the Conciliation govand Arbitration Act 1904, and one of the things that always characterises these debates is that the level of rhetoric from the Australian Labor Party is always completely out of whack with the legislation that we are discussing. While to a casual observer it might seem very difficult to explain this disconnect between the realities of the legislation and the Labor Party rhetoric, it is very simply explained by understanding the old rule that the Australian Labor Party is the parliamentary wing of the trade union movement. What school kids learn in Australian history is that the Australian Labor Party is the parwing of the trade union movement. We have heard this before. The previous speaker, the member for Perth, the ‘Nostradamus kid' of the Australian Labor Party, in October 1995 said: The Howard model is quite simple. It is all about lower wages ... Wrong. ... it is about worse conditions ... Wrong. ... it is about a massive rise in industrial tion ... Wrong. ... it is about the abolition of safety nets ... Wrong. ... and it is about pushing down or abolishing minimum standards. Wrong. Let us take each of those claims, because we have now had the benefit of 10½ years since he made them. What have we seen? Firstly, real wages have risen by 16.8 per cent over the last 10 years. They have risen during the period that we have had the Workplace Relations Act 1996. We have seen conditions improved. We have seen unemployment fall from 8.2 per cent in March 1996 to five per cent now, the lowest level in almost 30 years. At the same time we have seen more than 100,000 Australians come off the numbers of the long-term unemployed. We have seen the creation of 1.7 million jobs-800,000 part-time jobs and 900,000 full-time jobs. Mr Danby- Mr Deputy Speaker, I draw your attention to the state of the House.

189,Mrs MOYLAN,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works I present the eighth report for 2006 of the committee, relating to the proposed fit-out of the new leased premises for Centrelink at Greenway, ACT. Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.",112
190,Mrs MOYLAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-This report examines the proposed fit-out of new leased premises for Centrelink's National Support Office at a complex currently under construction near the ACT's Tuggeranong Town Centre. The estimated cost of the proposed fit-out works is $42.79 million. Centrelink's 3,200 National Support Office employees are currently accommodated in 11 buildings throughout the ACT. Several of these premises are 15 to 20 years old and 4.16 pm cannot economically be adapted to meet Centrelink's current needs. Over time, the department has expanded to occupy some 46,000 square metres of leasehold accommodation in Canberra, with 12 of its 15 leased premises being located in Woden. The new National Support Office will consist of two buildings sharing a common basement, roof and enclosed central zone. The northern building will have four levels and the southern building will have five levels, including covered car parking at ground level. In reviewing the proposal, the committee questioned Centrelink about other shortlisted sites and why these had been rejected. Centrelink explained that it had given careful consideration to a property located in the Tuggeranong Town Centre and another situated in Woden. Both of these were rejected, however, as neither was large enough to accommodate 30,000 square metres. The committee was particularly impressed by the range of access equity measures proposed for inclusion in the new premises. Centrelink reported that the building would be designed in such a way as to allow persons with mobility concerns unimpeded access to all areas and would incorporate such features as: - roll-resistant floor coverings; - hearing loops in meeting rooms; - tactile indicators; - full braille signage; - equal-access toilets and showers on each floor; and - large-winged or sensor taps. The committee investigated a number of other building features such as car-parking arrangements, access to child-care facilities, fire protection provisions and the configuration of office space to ensure that the new premises would provide an appropriate level of safety and amenity for the occupants. Centrelink satisfied the committee that it considered these factors in its project design and that it would continue to consult with staff and the Community and Public Sector Union. Having received a submission from the Australian Greenhouse Office, the committee also wished to ensure that the building and fit-out would meet the highest possible standards in energy consumption and environmentally sustainable design. Centrelink responded that it intends to use separate digital metering of electricity, water, gas and diesel consumption to enable close monitoring of energy use. Under Centrelink's new lease, the landlord will bear a financial penalty if agreed indoor temperature levels are not maintained. Centrelink was confident that this arrangement would ensure the preservation of indoor air quality and the sustainable use of temperature control and ventilation services. Having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the committee recommends that the proposed fit-out of the new leased premises for Centrelink proceed at the estimated cost of $42.79 million. In closing, I wish to thank all of those who assisted the committee with its inspection and the public hearing and of course, as always, my committee colleagues and the staff of the secretariat. I commend the report to the House. NA AMENDMENT (REFORM OF THE CHILD SUPPORT SCHEME-INITIAL MEASURES) BILL 2006 Second Reading Debate resumed.",112
191,Mr ANDREN,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"I only have a few concluding remarks to make on the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Schemehad Initial Measures) Bill 2006. As I was saying prior to question time, the two words that I can recall and have seen over the last decade in relation to child support matters would be anger and frustration-on both sides of the equation, from what we once called the custodial and the non-custodial parents almost equally. That anger and frustration was around the issue of the formula that has been used to determine the payments. In the eyes of the non-residential parents, it is about the proper use of that money. Anger and frustration from residential parents comes from the non-payment ruses that many partners get up to, and indeed the use of devices such as apprehended violence orders to deny access to parents, legitimate access in many cases that I have seen. Over that period we have seen some welcome reforms. We are seeing more in the bill today and we will see others in the coming months. Amongst that future legislation are some cuts in child support for resident parents. But those will be balanced by the elimination of things like the requirement to split family tax benefits with former partners, unless the care is shared almost equally. In addition, under the proposed legislation that we are yet to consider, for those nonor minimal-paying parents who arrange their financial affairs so they can ostentatiously drive their Mercedes around town or have a holiday home but who do not pay themselves a wage-I have seen and heard of plenty of circumstances like that-a wage will be deemed and that person will be regarded as having earned income. Finally, while I must commend the Child Support Agency staff with whom my office deals, with whom I have contact, I welcome the improved training and increased staffing promised in these changes, along with the more intensive case management for difficult cases. Communication between the Child Support Agency and clients at so stressful a time is absolutely essential once the communication between parents has often irretrievably broken down. With those words I commend this bill to the House.",113
192,Mr BROUGH,CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION,"Longman-Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Indigenous Affairs) (4.25 pm)-I am very pleased with many of the comments that we have received. I thank all honourable members who have participated in this debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment (Reform of the Child Support Scheme-Initial Measures) Bill 2006. This is one of the most challenging issues we have dealt with in government. I think all members of parliament and senators would agree that, when you are dealing with breakdown in relationships-I think it was the opposition whip who used to say this to me-you are dealing with such high emotions that it does not get any more challenging for the people directly involved, their wider families and members of parliament. As a new MP in 1996 the overwhelming majority of people whom I was seeing in my electorate office at that time were people who were suffering. I see the member for Calare nodding; we all came in together. With a change of government-and it is not a reflection on the change of government at all-people thought, ‘Here's another chance. I'm going to have my case heard; I've been wronged all these years.' They would pour in. Time after time we got this overwhelming, heartfelt pain that people were feeling. In those 10 years, far from the government doing nothing, there has been a lot done. I think the opposition has come a long way with us on that. There was a time when there were a number of people in the opposition who resisted change. I really welcome the current members of parliament and senators who have worked constructively as part of various committees in formulating positions that today are being widely supported both in this place and outside in the wider community. I should point out to the House and to the Australian public that the report by Professor Parkinson does not make everyone a winner. It actually looks at the cost of raising children. It looks at the principles that underpin families-that is, trying to have shared relationships and building relationships-when the fundamental relationships have broken down, so that children are not hurt. This is not about picking winners. It about saying a dad is better than a mum, or a parent who stays with the children has some rights more than a parent who is no longer the custodial or resident parent. It is about asking: how can we make the system, which is challenging, difficult and heartfelt, more equitable for everyone, but particularly the children? These measures, which have been outlined more than adequately by members of both sides of the House today, are the first tranche of a three-stage process that the Howard government has undertaken to fundamentally change this system to recognise that children are first and foremost our priority, underpinning that by acknowledging the real cost of raising children. One of the measures here today, which will reduce the amount of money that some resident parents will receive because the nonresident parent has a very high income, is actually not going to disadvantage the child, because, in knowing what the costs of raising children are, we are still ensuring that those children will receive more per child than the actual cost of raising them. It is good to see people recognising that someone who is a non-residential spouse has and feels that they have lost so much when they lose contact with the children on a dayto-day basis. It is very hard for them. But they very much resent it when they see the money they are providing for the welfare of their biological children being spent by their former partners on things that they do not believe add value to those children's lives and when they are actually aiding and abetting the lifestyle of the former partner as opposed to the welfare of the child. There are a number of schedules to the bill, and I will not go through them all again. I simply say that many people have contributed to this legislation. I single out the Chief is not Opposition Whip as one person who has campaigned on this issue since before my time in parliament. The member for Calare, as an Independent, certainly has been vocal on this issue in his 10 years in parliament. The members for Gilmore, Herbert and Hinkler have all been passionate advocates for change in this area, as was Larry Anthony, no longer in this place, who headed up committees inquiring into this issue. The member for Grey and I sat on one of the first informal committees of the Howard government inquiring into this issue. We see this legislation as bringing far greater equity to people. It recognises that the past formula has not worked and that the imbalances it created were causing great difficulty for people. I thank very much all of the supporting family groups-in particular, the Lone Fathers Association, the lone mothers and the women's groups-who have participated in so much of the work that has got us to this point. I also appreciate the support of the opposition. More importantly, I hope that parents and children will thank us into the future for the decisions that we have taken here today to implement this legislation and that they will enjoy better lives as a result of it.",114

Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. NA NA BILL 2006 Debate resumed from 10 May. Second Reading",116
195,Mr LLOYD,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"Robertson-Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads) (4.32 pm)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006 amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, the ABC Act, to abolish the staff elected director and deputy staff elected director positions. The position of a staff elected director is uncommon amongst Australian government agency boards. The position at the ABC was introduced in 1975. It was abolished in 1978, reintroduced in 1983 and given legislative backing in 1985. The position of a staff elected director is not consistent with modern principles of corporate governance and a tension relating to the position on the ABC board has existed for many years. This tension is manifested in the potential conflict that exists between the duties of the staff elected director under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 to act in good faith in the best interests of the ABC and the appointment of that director as a representative of ABC staff and elected by them. The election method creates a risk that a staff elected director will be expected by the constituents who elect him or her to place the interests of staff ahead of the interests of the ABC where they are in conflict. This matter was recognised in the June 2003 Review of the Corporate Governance of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders, otherwise known as the Uhrig review, at pages 98 and 99. That review concluded: The Review does not support representational appointments to governing boards as representational appointments can fail to produce independent and objective views. There is the potential for these appointments to be primarily concerned with the interests of those they represent, rather than the success of the entity they are responsible for governing. It has been suggested by some that the Uhrig review was not applicable to the ABC. This is incorrect. The Uhrig review was given a broad brief and its findings are relevant across government. The terms of reference of the review included ‘to develop a broad template of governance principles that, subject to consideration by government, might be extended to all statutory authorities and office holders'. The review was asked to consider the governance structures of a number of specific statutory authorities and best practice of corporate governance structures in both the public and private sectors. The Uhrig review principles are considered generally applicable and all statutory authorities are being considered in relation to them. There is a clear legal requirement on the staff elected director that means he or she the same rights and duties as the other directors, which includes acting in the interests the ABC as a whole. The government is of the view that there should be no question about the constituency to which ABC directors are accountable. Evidence presented by a former staff elected director to the recent Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee hearings on this bill confirmed that staff elected directors are, at times, placed under pressure by staff to act in ways which are not consistent with their roles as directors. The bill resolves these tensions by abolishing the staff elected director positions. This change will contribute to the efficient functioning of the ABC board, is in line with modern corporate governance principles and will provide greater consistency in governance arrangements for Australian government agencies. The bill is intended to give effect to the abolition of the staff elected director positions as close as possible to the expiry of the term of the current staff elected director. Despite the abolition of the staff elected director position on the ABC board, the government expects the ABC board and management to continue to take the interests of staff into account in its deliberations. I commend the bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.",116
196,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"The Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006 is the latest instalment in the Howard government's ideological crusade against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Armed with its Senate majority, the government is determined to remake the has ABC-and, dare I say, maybe in its own image-and stamp out any semblance of indeof pendence. This legislation is bad news for Australians-Australians who care about a strong and independent ABC. This bill has significant implications for the governance of the ABC. It implements an announcement in March by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, that the government would restructure the ABC board. The proposed restructure consists of just one measure: the abolition of the position on the board that is held by a director elected by the ABC staff and, knowing the size of the ABC and the number of staff, it would obviously be an important position and one that is representative and serves its role well. This position has been in place under Labor and coalition governments for the last 23 years. The board of the ABC is a body charged with significant responsibilities. ABC directors are required to be the guardians and protectors of a national asset that has been built up by generations of Australians over more than 70 years. The board is charged with responsibility for ensuring that the ABC fulfils the charter given to it by this parliament and it is a special role in Australian culture. The board must also maintain the independence and integrity of the ABC and ensure that the gathering and presentation of news and information is accurate and impartial. Labor believes that the parliament should maximise the likelihood of those appointed as directors of the ABC being capable of fulfilling these duties. Regrettably, that is not what this legislation does or is about. There is no evidence to support the proposition that the removal of the staff elected director will in any way enhance the operation of the ABC board. In fact, the overwhelming evidence is that the removal of the staff elected director will reduce the level of broadcasting expertise on the board. In moving this bill, the government has concocted an argument that the staff elected director is subject to a potential conflict of interest because of who that person is. The government contends that staff elected directors may feel obliged to represent the interests of the people who elect them rather than to act in the best interests of the ABC which, if you really think about it, implies a whole range of things about their responsibilities and duties as a board director. We have not heard any government members actually challenge any staff elected directors on any specifics or charge them with any specifics for dereliction of duty, if that were to be case. Mr Randall-It will come!",117
197,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"The proposition that the staff elected directors suffer from a conflict of interest is completely without foundation. Section 8 of the ABC Act is quite clear: the obligations of all directors, regardless of they are elected, are the same, regardless of whether they are elected by the staff or appointed by the government. I heard an interjection, ‘There's more coming,' or ‘You'll see.' If the directors' responsibilities are the same, regardless of whether they are elected by the staff or appointed by the government, you would use the same arguments. If there is some conflict of interest in the view that perhaps a board director elected by the staff would feel obliged to maybe represent the staff, could you not use that exact same principle, in theory, to say, ‘A board director appointed by the government may feel obliged as some sort of duty to represent the government'? The government cannot have it both ways. If their argument is that a staff elected board director may feel obliged to represent the people who elected them to that position, I would say, ‘Perhaps the people who the government appoint feel obliged in the same manner, as human beings, to have some sort of allegiance to the government.' I would be very careful if I were a government minister proposing that as the reason this position must be abolished. It is a very interesting theory from the government. During the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee inquiry into this bill, the government completely failed to produce any evidence that staff elected directors had themselves failed to comply with their duties to the ABC. They simply complied with all their responsibilities and duties the to the ABC. There are a range of provisions under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act and the ABC Act that are available to discipline directors who breach their duties. There have been rumours and unsubstantiated innuendo about leaking and there alhow ways will be. Governments, particularly this one, are always very panicky that somebody out there might actually find out what they are doing. Everything has to be watertight. They do not want anyone to know what they are doing. It all has to be watertight. You cannot have somebody reporting what is going on. That is what they are really concerned about: the possibility that someone has leaked something. This is a bill that is driven by one thing and one thing aloneextreme ideology in a desire to control the ABC. Mr Randall-Ha, ha!",118
198,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"Again, I hear an interjection, ‘Ha, ha,' but there is not much else in this bill. This bill does one thing: it gets rid of the one person who is on the board of the ABC, who may have some founded understanding of the ABC because they actually come from the ABC. They are not some party hack the government has put up in the last five minutes. They are somebody who has worked there, who has a commitment to the ABC and the Australian people. Again, the government cannot have it both ways. This bill is driven by ideology, as are most of the bills-I will not list all of them because I do not have enough time, but I think people do understand where I am coming from-instead of a genuine concern about the ABC itself, corporate governance or anything to do with fulfilling the responsibilities of board directors. The Senate committee heard from the current staff elected director and the three previous ones. All showed a clear understanding that it is not the role of the staff elected director to represent ABC staff on the board. I cannot imagine why anyone would even think that. They are not elected to represent staff on a board; they are elected to carry out the responsibilities that come with the position. I do not think there is any confusion in the mind of any board director about what they are, but this is where it gets tricky. The perceived activities or the perceived work of board directors can be seen in many different lights, particularly if you are a one-eyed government. If you do not get everything going 100 per cent your way then of course there is some sort of a conspiracy going on or something is happening behind the scenes-perhaps somebody is talking, somebody is leaking, maybe somebody has found something out. As Quentin Dempster stated, ‘The staff director is not the shop steward for the unions.' He is right; that is not their role. Staff-elected directors have a proud record of defending the interests of the ABC, even if governments do not like it-whether it be your government, our government or any government. They have a good track record of that. In 2002 Kirsten Garret opposed a lucrative exclusive deal between the ABC and Telstra because it would have allowed Telstra to influence ABC production decisions, so it was a good decision. In the mid-1990s Quentin Dempster opposed backdoor sponsorship arrangements that contravened the ABC Act. In both cases the staff elected directors resisted proposals benefiting ABC staff because they came at the cost of undermining the independence of the ABC. In making its case, the government has also relied on the Uhrig Review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders. In that report Mr Uhrig cautioned against representational appointments to government boards, as we heard from the minister in his introduction, but Mr Uhrig's report provides thin support for the removal of the ABC staff elected director. Contrary to what the government has claimed, Mr Uhrig did not examine governance arrangements at the ABC. He did not interview the chairman of the ABC, nor did he interview any other past or present ABC directors. It would seem that a few people might have been missing from that review. In fact, the terms of reference of the review required Mr Uhrig to focus on government agencies with ‘critical business relationships'. The Australian Taxation Office, the ACCC, APRA, ASIC, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Health Insurance Commission and Centrelink were specifically named in the terms of reference-so that was the focus and that is what the Uhrig review and report were about; they were not necessarily about the ABC and its staff elected director. By the way, these entities are very different from the ABC. I think people would acknowledge that you cannot really make a comparison between the Australian Taxation Office and the ABC. ",118
199,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"That's absolutely for sure. The Australian Taxation Office does a wonderful job, and I will just leave it there.  doesn't?",120
200,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I will take the interjection from the minister. I thought he was denigrating the Australian Taxation Office so I was defending the Australian Taxation Office. I know you are denigrating the ABC, so I will defend the ABC as well. I believe in defending all of our Australian institutions-unlike this government. The ABC is one of Australia's most important national institutions. Labor believes it has a vital role to play in developing and reflecting our culture and national identity-very important. It has been doing that for more than 70 years, something this government-and these government members present-has been opposed to for a very long time. Labor believes that it is inappropriate to apply a template developed for agencies like Centrelink, for example, and then take that template and try to squeeze it over the top of the ABC. There is a strong case for retaining the staff elected director position on the ABC board. This position has always been occupied by experienced public broadcasters. In the election to appoint a new staff elected director earlier this month, the ABC staff elected Quentin Dempster. Mr Dempster has given many of my colleagues-for example, members of the Iemma New South Wales government-a tough time on the New South Wales Stateline program. It is not as if any of us are exempt from raising the hackles of the ABC staff, but that in itself is no excuse to defund them, try to shut them down, do something like getting rid of the staff elected director or apply some pain to them, as seems to be this federal government's course of action. Mr Dempster is a journalist with tremendous broadcasting experience. He has worked as a journalist at the ABC for more than 20 years. During this time he served as the staff elected director in the mid-1990s-and I referred to that earlier. This sort of expertise in public broadcasting has been in short supply on the ABC board over the last decade, the 10 years since this government came to power.",120
201,Unknown,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,Government members interjecting,120
202,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"Again I hear snickers and some interjections. Obviously this government thinks there is only one type of person that you could possibly have on the ABC board. Maybe when government members get a turn to speak on this, they can describe to us the type of person, the type of character, that they are looking for-people with special attributes like perhaps having a Liberal Party membership card and ‘board experience'. Mr Randall-How about David Hill-a candidate for the Labor Party!",120
203,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I am not arguing anything in particular; I am just making points of fact about what this government is doing in legislation, in black and white right here in front of us. This government should now explain to Mr Dempster why it thinks that he is not a suitable person. I think most people would think he is a very suitable person. So what changes for the ABC is this government trying to pursue? What things does it fear from the staff elected director? What things does this government fear the staff elected director would oppose or otherwise support or actually do that another director may or may not do in carrying out their responsibilities under the law? Directors actually have some very special responsibilities under the law. The minister is on record as saying that the board could consider whether it wanted to, for example, allow advertising. There is nothing in the ABC Act that would stop the ABC placing as on its website. Perhaps this is what the minister had in mind when he was putting together this legislation. The ABC's digital content creators must be free to produce material without worrying about offending the sponsors of the ABC website. The parliament should not lightly silence the voice of a strong defender of ABC independence or anybody who defends the ABC. In a recent Bulletin article the minister stated: ... it won't be the same ABC it is today in a year's time; we are in for some very exciting changes ... You do not have to be Einstein to work out the code. In fact, you do not have to work for the ADF to work out the code in ‘some very exciting changes'. It will be very exciting when there is a board party and everyone of the same ilk can turn up. Given this government's track record on the ABC, Australians who value it will be concerned to hear about these changes. This bill is all about control. It is about more control by this government over independent organisations, more control over what people read, over what people see, over what people hear and over what content is delivered to people-that is the intent of this bill. Five years ago, the Senate communications committee examined the methods of appointment to the board. Back then government senators stated: There has been no suggestion that the position of staff elected director will be abolished. But now the government's Senate majority has gone to its head, as with a whole range of other areas, and that position is in doubt. The staff elected position is just one position of a possible nine on the ABC board, so personally I cannot see how just getting rid of that one position should have some huge impact on any possible decision of the board itself. But I think that the real waste, the real tragedy, is that by getting rid of this position the government actually removes a voice of experience, a voice from the ABC itself. If you take a business approach to this and look at boards around the country, it is often the case that the best boards are those with directors with 20 or 30 years of industry experience, those that have actually worked through the business or understand the business closely and actually do the best jobs. I think it is no different to the ABC's having a staff elected director position on the board. What irritates the Prime Minister about the staff elected director is that it is a position that is beyond the capacity of the Prime Minister to influence or control as he does in so many other areas. Since 1996, the government has regularly filled board vacancies with its own conservative mates; people like Janet Albrechtsen, Ron Brunton and Michael Kroger have been dispatched to the ABC with instructions to attack what the senior Liberals see as a left-wing bias. They are really worried about this left-wing bias. God forbid that the ABC might go out there and do some reports or programming or say something that just does not sit comfortably with this government. If it does not sit comfortably with this government then what does the government do? It changes the board. It gets the board active and makes sure that the government has a huge hand and a role in what happens. The role that certain people obviously play is to guide and steer the ABC, not down the impartial middle of the road and certainly not to the left but to guide and steer it slightly to the right, ever inching further and further to the right. ",120
204,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer interjects, ‘We wish.' You do not have to wish. You are doing it through legislation. This is the whole point. I do not even have to argue this case. I will just let the government argue it for me. They are actually giving me the ammunition and material. ‘We wish.' Hopefully Hansard has actually got this on the record, it was loud enough for everybody to hear, ‘We wish.' Of course you wish because that is what you want. You would want to control every single director, not just one, two, three or four. Get rid of the staff. ",121
205,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"Too late now, you have said it. It is not rubbish now, you are on the record-you have let it out of the bag.",122
206,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,Order! The member for Oxley will convey his remarks through the chair.,122
207,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"The parliamentary secretary has let it out of the bag. It is just unbelievable. Last year, research conducted by Newspoll found that 82 per cent of people actually believe-and I think they have good reason to-that the ABC is balanced and even-handed in its reporting of news and current affairs. Not all Liberals share the government's hatred of the ABC howeveramazing as that is. In March, the former leader of the Liberal Party John Hewson wrote in the Australian Financial Review: ... the Government's recent decision to stop staff electing a director of the ABC board is a churlish pyrrhic victory for some of the ideologicallybased antagonists in the Liberal Party and some of their sympathetic business mates. John Hewson has it right. He has been freed from the shackles. He has got the ball and chain off, he can say whatever he likes now and he is telling it how it is. It is a churlish victory for the government to get rid of somebody on a board, just because it thinks they may do or say something that is not in the thought processes that this government is on about. John Hewson went on: It is clearly against the best interest of the tion and the listening and viewing public. I assume many Liberals in this House agree with their former leader, but will any of them have the courage to stand up and say so? Will any of them have the courage to stand up for ordinary people; will they stand up for workers? I do not think so, because we saw that today and we have seen it in legislation. They will not stand up for anyone except themselves and their big business mates. That is it. Labor believes that the abolition of the staff elected director's position will have a significant detrimental impact on the effectiveness of the ABC board and undermine public perceptions of its independence. The government is slowly chipping away at the block, slowly making sure there is no independence left. Everybody there will have some sort of a relationship. There are not too many spots unfilled that contain staff who are not related to somebody specifically in the Liberal Party or who have had some sort of staffer role or something like that. The staff elected director, as I said before, has a unique insight into the ABC operations. They can play a key role in assisting the board to hold ABC management to account. The truth is that this bill is not about improving the ABC's corporate governance; it is about fulfilling the wishes of the government. That is what this bill is about. It is just a further attempt by the government to undermine the independence of the ABC. ",122
208,Mr RIPOLL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"This legislation is so unpalatable, you are right, I cannot get it out. This legislation is simply the latest instalment in the government's decade-long ideological crusade against the ABC. This government has a track record of defunding, shutting down, removing power from and abolishing any organisation that does not fit instituthe white picket fence ideological bent that this government has as to what organisations should think, say and do. For a decade the ABC has been starved of the funds it needs to be the world-class broadcaster that Australians expect, deserve and need. In the first Costello budget in 1996, the ABC funding was cut by $66 million. This funding has never been adequately restored. In real terms, the ABC has less money today to make programs than in 1996. I do not have time to get into it fully but also we see that gradual loss of Australian content from the ABC because of a lack of funding. Before the last election, the government promised an independent review of the adequacy of the ABC's funding. This review was conducted by KPMG at the massive cost to taxpayers of half a million dollars but the government have refused to release that half a million-dollar report to the public. Why would you have a report on the ABC and the effectiveness of funding and then refuse to release it publicly? You would think that they have something to hide. But luckily there were some leaks; somebody did leak the KPMG report and it suggested a number of things. In March, it was reported that KPMG found that the ABC needed an extra $125 million over the next three years just to maintain existing services. Despite all the claims by the minister of a great outcome for the ABC in the budget, the fact is that the ABC is still chronically underpoliticised. funded. The ideologically motivated funding squeeze continues. While the opposition opposes this bill, we do believe in some reform to the ABC board. There is public concern about the ABC's corporate governance but it does not relate to the role of the staff elected director. There is a clear conservative bias on the current ABC board. If the government were to go by no other measure than by the background of some of the directors, you would have some idea of what they are actually doing. Reforms are needed to strengthen public confidence in the independence of the ABC. There was a time when the Prime Minister claimed to understand the importance of the independence of the ABC. Back in 1995, he railed against appointments made by the Keating government. So there you go: when they were in opposition, they did one thing and now they are in government, they are doing another. Back then, he lectured all of us. He said, ‘You not only must have a board that is completely politically neutral but it must be seen to be neutral.' That is right. That is what John Howard said-‘it must be seen to be politically neutral'. I do not know that the current board actually fits the bill in being seen to be politically neutral. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, who is at the table, and other people who are speaking on this bill can enlighten us on this theory of being seen to be neutral. It would be interesting to hear how the Prime Minister thinks his appointments of prominent conservatives like Michael Kroger, Mr Brunton and Ms Albrechtsen measure up against that criterion. John Howard was right back in 1995, but in this area as in so many others he has failed to live up to the principles he espoused when in opposition. The current appointments process lacks transparency and is too Under current arrangements, the names of candidates are taken to cabinet by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, but that is about all the public ever know about the whole process. These are the real questions that need to be asked. How do people apply to fill a board position? What criteria are used to assess candidates? Do you have to be a member of the right club? Which club? What sort of card do you have to carry to get a job in that place? Does it help if you have donated money? That is a good question. It certainly seems to help if you have been a conservative cultural warrior over the years. Labor believes that there needs to be real reform of the appointments process to guarantee the independence of the ABC board and the expertise of its members. Since 2003 Labor has supported an independent merits based appointments process for ABC and SBS board vacancies. The process is based on the so-called Nolan rules that were developed in the UK and govern appointments to the BBC. Appointments to the ABC board must be open and transparent. I do not think anyone could argue against that. We must have confidence in the people we have in those positions. Vacancies should be publicly advertised. There should be clear, merit based selection criteria. Labor's policy provides for an independent selection panel to undertake a proper shortlist selection process. This is in stark contrast to current arrangements. The selection of the short list would be independent of the minister. Under Labor's model the minister would be free to nominate someone not on the list, but there would be a political price to pay. Obviously, if the minister did that, they would have to account for that to the people of Australia. I think that would be a good thing. The minister would be required to table in parliament a formal statement of the reasons for selecting a candidate who was not on the short list. The publicity surroundThere ing such a move would make it more unlikely that the government would pursue such an option. Labor's policy would not exclude people previously involved in politics from serving on the ABC board. We do not actually have something against it. We think there needs to be a balance. To get the balance right, you cannot get rid of just one board position-that is, the staff elected one-and then have it completely weighted the other way. There needs to be a balance. It would ensure, however, that they had the skills to do the job and they would be seen as independent by the public because they were not short-listed by the minister. If the government were serious about improving the governance of the ABC, it would withdraw this bill and begin work on reforms reflecting the Nolan principles. This bill represents a blatant attempt by the Howard government to undermine the independence of Australia's national broadcaster, the ABC. The ABC is facing a number of challenges over the next few years. Like broadcasters around the world, the ABC will have to adapt to the rise of digital technology and the way it is transforming the media. In the months ahead, the ABC board will choose a new managing director to guide it through this uncharted territory. The ABC needs directors who understand the changing media landscape and the unique nature of public broadcasting. A staff elected director will be well placed to help the board to deal with these tasks. In conclusion, the parliament should not allow the government to replace experienced public broadcasters with yet more political stooges.",122
209,Mr RANDALL,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I have to say at the outset how delighted I am to speak on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. I love the ABC. I love the ABC as the Australian broadcaster, but I do not love all of the ABC. are elements of the ABC that I do not love. But when I was a schoolteacher I loved having BTN on in the classroom because that was something that the kids really got a lot out of and something that, as a schoolteacher, I saw as fundamentally valuable. That is what the ABC's function is: to provide great information as a national broadcaster. I will shortly refer to the elements of the ABC that I do not love, and I will explain them in detail. This bill, as we know, is to amend the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 to remove the position of the staff elected director from the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, or the ABC. As a bit of background, the first staff elected position on the governing body of the ABC was introduced by the Whitlam government without legislation in 1975 and subsequently abolished by the Fraser government. The current position was created by the ABC Act in 1986. The make-up of the board, until this legislation is passed, must include a managing director, a staff elected director and no fewer than five and no more than seven directors. The membership of the ABC board, as at 1 April 2006, is as follows: Mr Donald MCDonald AO, the managing director; Mr John Gallagher QC, the deputy; Ms Ramona Koval, who I will come to in much detail later; Dr Ron Brunton; Ms Janet Albrechtsen; Mr Steven Skala; and Mr Murray Green. That makes a total of seven. I will return to those people later. The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts announced on 24 March this year that the staff elected director's position on the ABC board would be abolished. There are a number of issues that the Uhrig report goes into. Basically, staff elected director's position has become a conflict of interest. For example, the modern corporate principles of governance do not provide arrangements for staff elected members on corporations and boards generally throughout the rest of the corporate world. By way of example, another public broadcaster in Australia, the SBS, does not have a staff elected representative. So let us not get too excited about this position being removed. The SBS functions quite well, thank you very much, without a staff elected director. The Uhrig report was released on 12 August 2004 and it made a number of recommendations and observations. The review concluded that there was ‘no universally agreed definition of corporate governance' and suggested the following definition: Corporate governance encompasses the arrangements by which the power of those in control of the strategy and direction of an entity is both delegated and limited to enhance prospects for the entity's long-term success, taking into account risk and the environment in which it is operating. It said a lot more, and time does not permit me to go through all the detail; you can read the Uhrig report. But it did not support representational appointments as per the member opposite; the Uhrig report made that quite clear. It does set out quite a number of obligations of elected board members. It says, for example: Whether staff representatives make a practice of prosecuting the interests of staff is moot but it is clear that the legal duty of such board members is not to their constituents but to the organisation more generally. Yet, as we will find out, Ms Ramona Koval considered that the staff that elected her to the board were her constituents. So we already have a conflict of interest. The duties the of directors include duties of care and diligence and that they must act in good faith. They have a duty not to misuse their position and a duty not to misuse information, which I will come to in some detail. We know that the Senate committees have examined this issue, and the fact is that Ramona Koval was asked to sign certain ABC protocols and she would not do it. Let me say at the outset that the ABC board is generally like most other boards of governance, and it is a government appointed board. Let us be fair-there have been appointments from both sides of government. For instance, we know that right back at the beginning Senator Neville Bonner was one of the first appointed members of the ABC board. I do not hear any complaints about Senator Neville Bonner. He obviously carried out his duties. Yet he was a Liberal senaterest, tor. Right throughout the history of the appointments to the ABC board there have been appointments by governments of people in whom they have a great deal of faith-for example, on our side of government, we have had Michael Kroger, a well-known member of the Liberal Party, and Ross MCLean, the former member for Perth. But, on the other side of the equation, we have to look no further than Mr John Bannon, the former Labor Premier of South Australiawe are talking about political appointments-and Wendy Silver, who I knew well in Perth and who was a good friend of the Burke government. The Reserve Bank and other government instrumentalities have appointments by the government of the day. And when another government comes, of course they appoint alternative people. I suppose we really could call this the Ramona Koval amendment to the ABC bill, because she has precipitated this. I feel sorry for the other staff members-Tom Molomby, John Cleary, Quentin Dempster, Kirsten Garrett and Ian Henschke-because none of them has really had to be so obviously dragged into the spotlight because of their misuse of their position on the board as has Ramona Koval. And, yes, I do agree with the member opposite: Quentin Dempster is a highly regarded member of the ABC. He is an excellent, quality reporter, and I do not think his independence is questioned. He is in the position of being elected, before this bill comes into place. And he can thank Ramona Koval for the gross leaking and her lack of loyalty to her corporate governance duties, which resulted in this position being abolished. Other members of the ABC staff might also want to thank Ramona Koval for bringing this position into disrepute and having it examined in terms of a conflict of inbecause she is largely the one who has brought it into conflict. We know that this was brought to a head when Maurice Newman, a board member, abruptly resigned, citing a gross breach of boardroom confidentiality. Mr Maurice Newman is a very credible man-he was also the chair of the Australian Stock Exchange-and he blamed the decision directly on the ABC staff elected director, Ramona Koval. He said that he could not continue as the serious lapse of boardroom confidentiality had the potential to destabilise the corporation and that he had no faith that the accepted governance standards would be observed by the board while they allowed Ramona Koval to continue in that position. Ms Koval justified the leaking. It was reported in the Australian that she had said that it was her duty to send emails to staff on the deliberations and the decisions taken by the ABC board. She may think that leaking board information for the benefit of sectional interests within the ABC rather than for the benefit of the corporation as a whole was the right thing to do. Who did she leak this information to? Interestingly-and I will move to some of these other people in a moment-none other than that great left-winger David Marr, who was the ABC's Media Watch representative for some time. In fact, if there was still an active communist party in this country, I imagine David Marr would be the president, secretary and general manager of the whole shooting match; he is so left wing he is out of kilter. Interestingly, he is still a great friend of the cultural echelons of the ABCyou see him on Insiders regularly. But I will return to Mr Marr shortly. The question the board may wish to ask Koval is why she thinks she is entitled to send memos to staff about boardroom machinations. Koval admitted to the Australian that since her election to the board she has sent out eight memos. We are not talking about somebody who has been misinterpreted or who has got it wrong. In an article on 26 May 2004, she admitted to the Australian that since her election to the board she has sent out eight memos to the staff, reporting on boardroom meetings. Revealingly, those memos included a preamble that said that her report to staff contained a summary of the representations she had made on behalf of staff and decisions taken by the board. Koval needs to understand whether she is there in the interests of the board or in the interests of her constituents, as she calls them. Obviously reform of the ABC board is needed when you have this situation. Returning to the culture of the ABC, let me say again that I have always been a great supporter of the ABC. I generally like its news coverage, its educational coverage and its National Geographic type coverage with David Attenborough and all these sorts of things that are fantastic for young people and educators. But the ABC has absolutely left the rails in the current affairs area. We have to look no further than the political links of the broadcasters who are on the ABC today and who have been previously with the ABC. We do not have to go any further than Kerry O'Brien, who has been the ABC's 7.30 Report reporter for 10 years. In the electorate, people come to me and say, ‘Why can't you blokes do something about that Kerry O'Brien? He is just so biased towards the conservative side of government.' I have seen him interviewed on this, and he said, ‘I don't care. I'm here. I'm so powerful that nobody is going to address me. I'll do what I like. If they don't like it, so what? I'll go.' That is fine. He is obviously a man of intelligence and somebody who is quite good at an analytical report. But it is where he slips off into his left wing rhetoric that it people. When he interviews the Prime Minister or a minister or member of the coalition, his body language is turbid and angry. Yet when Mr Beazley or someone from the other side is before him, it is almost, ‘Oh, buddy, old pal, how are you? How are we going?' His history is that he worked as a press secretary for the Labor leader Gough Whitlam and then for the deputy Labor leader Lionel Bowen. He has a bit of a CV on the other side. He is a Labor staffer. How can you say that he is not unbiased? Kerry O'Brien has probably been responsible for the ABC disappointing many people in the public and, I know, our party. We are sick and tired of the way that he continually drives home his ideological hatred for the conservative side of government. Kerry O'Brien basically does a good job, as I said, but he has to get himself out of this left wing bent. Another strong ABC current reporterand he seems to be a nice bloke-is Barrie Cassidy. He does the Insiders. I like watching the Insiders. But again he is a former Labor Party staffer. He worked for Bob Hawke as specialist media adviser from 1987 until about August 1991. You cannot get away from your past. You are what you are because of what you have been. These guys are very strong supporters of the other side. There is a left wing culture in the ABC. They bring their families through the same cultural incantations and inductions to become members of the ABC staff or in broadcasting. This is where we have a bit of a problem with current affairs. They are not balanced. We know that when Richard Alston did an inquiry into this, he found 68 occasions just during the Iraq war where the reporting was quite biased. I suppose I should mention Maxine MCKew. Maxine MCKew-even though I am gets not going to deliberately say that she has been involved in the Australian Labor Party-is married to a former national secretary of the Labor Party, Bob Hogg. In the Latham Diaries-that name that should not be mentioned here-what did Mark Latham say about Maxine MCKew? He said that they were going to try to fit her up for the seat of Fowler. I do not know what the current member for Fowler thinks about that. They were going to put her in the seat of Fowler because they wanted to anoint one of their hereditary peers. But Maxine MCKew did not want to go and live there. She could not stand the people. She lives in the leafy suburbs by the shore. She did not want to go and live with those grommets over in Fowler. They were not her kind of people. So she declined. There is a fair bit of history. The funny thing about it is this. At the national level, the ABC carries on with this sort of behaviour. The further away from Canberra you get, the less shrill it is. In Perth, for example, there is no greater political reporter than Peter Kennedy. Peter Kennedy is balanced. He is a gentleman and he does a fantastic job in the ABC. He is very unbiased. As late as today we had the ABC's Fran Kelly on the Radio National Breakfast program, absolutely getting stuck into the government and this side of politics about customary Aboriginal law and banging on about political correctness. This is the problem that we have with the ABC. I had the Friends of the ABC in Perth write to me about Iran and Iraq, the hard right lobby groups and the Howard ministers and their other cronies-complaining about Alston's 68 complaints on the ABC et cetera. I have to tell the Friends of the ABC in Western Australia that I have never seen anybody so embittered as them. They do not represent mainstream opinion in this country. The member opposite said that the ABC had been denuded of funds. The previous director, Mr Russell Balding, was very pleased with the previous budget because the ABC had received $88.2 million for new initiatives. That is a huge top-up of money. It did not expect anything close to that amount. Can I say that the ABC really needs to focus itself on local talent, on local productions and on local drama. Previously, the ABC was where young actors, drama writers et cetera in this country cut their teeth. The ABC gave them an opportunity to do short dramas, particularly Australian based dramas. To make sure that that does not get overlooked in the current affairs shenanigans that the ABC likes to run, $30 million of this is for local TV content-in other words, local dramas. That has been dedicated, as it should be, to the local talent in this country. It will be great to see how the ABC uses this in its new directions because, ultimately, this is where the future of this country is. The ABC has a role to play in this country as the national broadcaster, but the fact is that if you cannot run a board because somebody cannot abide by the corporate governance rules then you cannot have them on the board. At the end of the day, Ramona Koval is somebody who has gone outside the boundaries. She would not sign any compact on this. Basically, she said that she is going to do what she can to spill the information on a large corporation like this. As a result, we had to look at reforming the board. In conclusion, a general proposition of modern Anglo-American governance theory tends not to support the appointment of staff elected representatives to major boards of large corporations. In this case, I strongly support this bill for the direction in which it is going to take the ABC. (Time expired)",124
210,Mr GARRETT,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"Labor opposes the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006, which reduces the maximum number of directors on the ABC board from nine to eight by abolishing the position of staff elected director. Upon reflecting on the recent comments by the member for Canning, I draw to his attention the fact that the Chairman of the ABC is a friend of the Prime Minister, that the newly appointed Managing Director of the ABC has past connections with the Liberal Party and that it is the purpose of the ABC to provide us with a diversity of opinions, not only opinions or views that the member or his colleagues agree with. This staff elected position has been a feature of the ABC board for a number of years. It is a position that has been held in the past by people with wide broadcasting and media experience. It is a position that allows for indepth knowledge and an organisational perspective of the ABC distinct or different from that of externally appointed board members. The government claims this bill is a reform measure. It is nothing of the sort: it is a revenge measure. The government has had what it perceived to be the bias of the ABC in its sights ever since it was first elected. Its first action upon election was to freeze the funding of the ABC. No clearer message or signal could be sent to the corporation about the government's faith or views about the ABC than that first primary action from whence all other actions have flowed. The government have a lack of faith in the ABC that is more a reflection of their bias and values than it is of any quantitative or qualitative assessment of the corporation. I merely make the point, which will have been made at other times in the House, that KPMG conducted a funding adequacy review and found that the ABC is a world leader, that it is efficient, that it is innovative and that it needs significant funding. Notwithstanding that, the government has a lack of faith in the ABC and an enmity towards the ABC that has been expressed on numerous occasions. It has become an article of faith for this government, and we have heard yet another display of it from the previous speaker. So any measure, however insignificant or petty, which reinforces this sentiment is seen to be a good thing. It is a political goal that has been kicked. What a pitiable state we are witnessing when a government uses its control of the parliament in this way. I invite the House to consider the past decade of intense media reflection and examination of the government's actions in relation to refugees, AWB, the falsifying and manipulation of reasons to go to war in Iraq-any number of contentious issues of the past decade-where this government has been exposed by the ABC. I ask the House to reflect on that fact. I also ask the House to reflect on the fact that the same thing would have happened and should have happened if it had been a Labor government. The primary purpose of the ABC is not to report on the government in the way in which it sees as being favourable or unfavourable to its performance but to report in a way which it sees and exercises to its best ability as being fair but befitting serious scrutiny. The ABC, as befits its role as a national broadcaster, has inquired and reported. The government has taken some heat and it did not like it. That happens to governments of all persuasions, and when they are responsible for funding the organisation they need to resist the temptation to interfere in the way in which this government is doing with this board appointment. Unfortunately, the government cannot resist, so this bill represents a little bit of revenge, a little bit of payback. It has nothing to do with good governance, and it should be seen for what it represents. We oppose it for that reason. The plain fact is that, if this government were serious about addressing and improving the corporate governance of the ABC in relation to board appointments, it would simply stop stacking the board with appointees whose ideological obsessions match theirs or, in the case of board member Michael Kroger, have a long standing political association with the government. The government has asserted that the bill is about removing the possibility for potential conflict of interest between the duties of a director appointed under the Commonwealth authorities act and their election to the position of board member by the staff of the ABC. This is a nonsense, when all the remaining positions are directly appointed by the government and where in the past and certainly today some of those appointments are political in nature. Conflict of interest can hardly be sustained as a charge against having a staff elected position in this case. The government also claims that, as distinct from other board appointments, the very fact of staff election to a board creates a higher likelihood of a conflict of interest, the elected board member's independence is compromised and, as a consequence, they would be less able to fulfil their statutory duties as a board member. If that is the case, the government should take the appropriate action instead of bringing legislation into the House. If a board member has shown a conflict of interest or compromised their position, there is legislation to deal with it. But this argument does not have substance, because it ignores the fact that board members' responsibilities and duties are already described under existing legislation. For example, in the case of the ABC, all board members, including the staff elected representative, are bound by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act and by the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 which-with the exception of subsection 17(1)(a), which provides for nondisclosure of interests by a board member in the case of discussions concerning terms and conditions of employment-provide that the legal duty of staff elected board members is as it is for each and every board membernamely, to the organisation itself. That is as it should be. That is good governance. Legislation is in place and board members are bound by it. The fact is that these legislative provisions-including the ABC Act and the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act that I have just referred to-make clear, in the case of the ABC Act, the obligations of board members and, in the case of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act, the penalties that apply in the event that directors breach their duties. Of course, this duty would apply to other similar staff elected positions which are present in organisations such as the ANU or the Australian Film and Television School. The fact of election is not the source of a as conflict of interest, as it is the means by which a board member comes to the board. It is the fact of the proper exercise of board members' duties that they must fulfil which goes to the heart of the debate about conflict of interest. If they are in breach of their duties, the minister can act. Is she acting here? No. Why not? The reason is a simple one: there are no grounds to act. This is merely a case of there being a staff elected representative, a position that the government wants only to abolish. Additionally, the government claims that the removal of a staff elected representative is consistent with the recommendations of the Uhrig review. As is often the case in the House, arguments are put to cut the suit of the prejudice of those making the claims. But the Uhrig review was concerned with examining ‘critical business relationships' in relation to organisations including the Reserve Bank, the Australian Taxation Office and the Health Insurance Commission. It was not concerned with the governance arrangements of the ABC. Subsequent commentary by, amongst others, Professor Stephen Bartos, Director of the National Institute of Governance, whom the government also relies upon to buttress its arguments for this bill, provides some context for the argument. When Professor Bartos made his submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill he said, ‘Notwithstanding that the Uhrig report did not support the representational appointment to governing boards, it was not specifically concerned with staff elected positions.' He said that, further, it not make any formal recommendations on this matter and that the comments about representational appointments, which are common enough in the Public Service, were concerned in the main with government department representations. In other words, Professor Bartos's comments draw a distinction between the kind of organisation that the ABC is and the kinds of organisations that were the remit of the review and the report done by Mr Uhrig. In any case, Professor Bartos goes on to remark that there are advantages and disadvantages to elected board positions and that it depends on how one views the organisation. Fair enough. The import of his remarks is that it is reasonable to view the ABC as having a character distinct, say, from commercial radio and television stations. Professor Bartos said: In governance terms, the choice of model to be adopted for a public sector body should not be static or formulaic, but be driven by the objectives of the organisation concerned. The government has neatly inverted Professor Bartos's comments as it sought to change the composition of the ABC board to suit its own political objectives. It has done no more or no less than that. The case here is that the government does not appoint directors to the board of Channel 10 or the Austereo Network, as these organisations are commercial entities with responsibilities to their shareholders. On the other hand, the ABC has a specific charter. It is a national institution. Its shareholders are the Australian people, and nowhere have they claimed that the staff elected position is an affront to their shareholding or that it should be removed. In fact, the general prevailing sentiment, notwithstanding what I have said above regarding the ABC, remains positive. The Mansfield report, amongst other reports on the ABC, has revealed that both staff and did the public view the ABC as a special organisation. It is widely supported in the community, and it is not unreasonable to argue that its primary purpose as a public broadcaster to serve the public as opposed to the shareholder interest allows a measure like a staff elected representative. But this measure has nothing to do with reason and everything to do with revenge. The government wants a tamer ABC. The Prime Minister admitted as much when he lamented the absence of a right-wing Phillip Adams, and subsequently he got his wishthe Counterpoint program was initiated. This bill represents heavy-handed punitive measures by the government, a kind of final, sort of vindictive but unnecessary, burst of antipathy towards the national broadcaster that is still enjoying the confidence of the majority of Australians despite these attacks and despite the government's own board appointments-and it is held in higher esteem as an organisation than the government that is so often hostile to it. There have been some extraordinary outbursts by government members, both in this House and in the Senate. Senator FierravantiWells referred to the ‘pernicious left-wing influence that permeates far too much of the ABC's biased and unbalanced coverage'. Memo to Senator Fierravanti-Wells and her co-conspirators: over 80 per cent of the Australian public believe that the ABC is reasonably balanced. But in other circles, such as psychological circles, what is happening here is called projection. We may as well identify it for what it is. ‘Projection' is when thing. I project onto another person-or, in this case, an organisation of people-through the prism of my views, what I think their views are; hence the senator's description ‘pernicious left-wing views'. It is really only those of extreme right-wing views who see in a broadcaster, when it critically reports and investigates events championed by the right, extreme left-wing views. But, regretfully, it seems that the government has been infected with this alarm. The government has produced a bill that offers no credible reasons for its support. It really looks like the final scene of Witch Hunt. After Senator Alston instituted his series of investigations into bias concerning the reporting of the Iraq war and failed-with the exception of a small number of countsto prove anything approaching a permeating bias, the die was cast. That ‘small number' was two out of 68, I would remind the House, regarding the first investigation; it was no more than that. But what to do next? Of course, he went on to the Independent Complaints Review Panel and, I think, ultimately across to the Australian Broadcasting Authority. But the public was not clamouring for heads to roll. To all intents, the current chair has managed to serve the interests of the ABC diligently, although sometimes earning rebuke from others in this House for his work. But, clearly, the position of staff elected representative had to go. Given that the government appoints all other board members, the bill is about gestures and really has nothing to do with governance and independence. I call on the government to follow up this bill with similar legislation ensuring that ministers do not directly appoint CEOs of stand-alone government entities like the Australian Film Commission. If it were serious about governance, it would consider these things-but, of course, the government will do no such This bill, regretfully, comes after 10 years of sniping, complaining, undermining and underresourcing by this government of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It is a campaign that has signally failed to dent the confidence of the public in the ABC, but which has significantly impaired the ABC's capacity and witnessed the decline in drama productions, which we became aware of last year, and the freezing of funding levels for the ABC in the past. I acknowledge that this year's budget contains some much-needed resources for an independent commissioning arm to produce urgently required local documentary and drama, for regional radio and for infrastructure repairs. But this amount does not compensate for past neglect. It is well short of the amount sought by the corporation and well short of the figure identified by the KPMG funding adequacy review, which said that the ABC needed a $126 million increase above inflation over the next the years to maintain services. The ABC is still underfunded. Whilst underfunded, thankfully the ABC is still respected. Although many observers have raised concerns about recent board appointments, it is watched and listened to as much as ever, if not more so. The political class that inhabit this place are avid ABC consumers. Member from rural and remote electorates often have the ABC as the only consistent source of timely news and information. Most members. I observe draw regularly on the ABC, especially when we dine in the parliamentary dining room. I would say to the House that the ABC continues to play a critical role in ensuring that our democracy is healthy; that, as it is expressed through governments-here and in the states, in the territories and locally-the ABC's provision of accurate and comprehensive reporting about what governments do is absolutely essential to our democracy. It is the oxygen of democracy-no more and no less than that. Notwithstanding the rage of commercial broadcasters afoot, the ABC is also the only national media organisation that consistently addresses politics and issues of the day across the country and in the international sphere through news, current affairs reporting, specialist programs, television and radio, podcasting and online. Is the position of a staff elected representative the burning issue for the corporation, given its real achievements and its challenges? Hardly. Labor has long supported the establishment of an independent process for selecting candidates to fill vacancies on the ABC board. The position of staff elected representative was created in 1975, removed by the Fraser government but five years later restored by the Hawke government. We believe that it is essential to establish pendent process for selecting candidates that is both open and transparent. Vacancies should be advertised. There should be clear merit based selection criteria. That is how it happens in the corporate world and that is how it should happen here. An independent panel should conduct a selection processand it may well turn up people with a background in politics, and there is nothing wrong with that. But, critically, the selection of the shortlist should be independent of the minister. It should no longer be a selection choice by a minister of any government. Under Labor, the ABC would boast a truly independent board, thus ensuring the removal of perceptions of bias or taints of bias that inevitably accompany appointments that are not truly independent but which are a feature of the current appointment processes as practised by this government. I conclude by reminding the House that, in 1995, the Prime Minister himself said: You not only must have a board that is completely politically neutral, but it must be seen to be neutral. In that respect, the legislation that we oppose today and the comments of the Prime Minister stand in complete opposition to one another. We condemn the bill.",128
211,Mr MELHAM,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"Banks) (5.44 pm)Labor will be opposing the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. It is bad public policy and bad corporate governance. It is bad public policy because the broadcasting expertise provided by the staff appointed ABC board member has consistently assisted the board in its decision making. It is bad corporate governance because the staff appointed board member, as with all board members, is legally required to fulfil their obligations as a board member with due care and diligence. There is no evidence that due diligence has not been followed by the staff appointed board members a truly indeover the years. You cannot just turn around and assert something without producing evidence. There have been many opportunities in the past few months for the government to provide hard evidence. The government has tabled the bill in the Senate, and subsequently senators have spoken on the bill. There have already been several speakers in the House on the bill prior to me, and there was an extensive inquiry by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee. The opposite has occurred: evidence of the value of the staff appointed member has consistently emerged. Indeed, in the Senate inquiry, several examples of the ability of the staff elected representative to put the needs of the corporation before anything else were cited. One of those instances is particularly indicative. In the period 1996 to 2000, Telstra had approached the ABC for a deal which would allow Telstra to hand-pick from ABC programming, be involved in co-productions and have some influence on internal productions. Not surprisingly, the proposal was heavily weighted in favour of Telstra. The staff elected board member fought the proposal from its outset and from the shop floor, as it were. The staff elected board member, Ms Garrett, was able to demonstrate to her fellow board members that such a deal would impact negatively on the people in the front line and on the public broadcaster generally. The deal was eventually overturned. A second case in point clearly demonstrates there is a crystal clear distinction between ‘staff elected' and ‘staff representative'. In the 1990s a matter arose over backdoor sponsorship whereby external parties could influence the content of programs. The ABC was short of cash and there were arguments that the financial injection would potentially save jobs. The staff elected representative argued that external funding was compromising the guidelines of the ABC. Mr Quentin Dempster, a former staff elected ABC board member who has recently been elected again, commented in relation to this issue in his submission to the Senate committee: Rather than act in the narrow self-interest of the ABC's staff, the staff elected Director's role in the exposure was an agonising episode requiring the ABC's interests and reputation to be placed above those of its employees. All the staff elected representatives who made submissions or appeared before the Senate committee stated strongly that their role was as a member of the board, not of representing ABC staff. They also noted that, in almost every instance, the staff understood and supported that role. These people clearly understood their responsibilities in terms of corporate governance. I particularly considered the evidence given to the committee by the unions representing ABC staff. The unions took the line that they would have resented the staff elected board member usurping the position of unions. Mr Graeme Thomson from the Community and Public Sector Union stated to the committee: To the extent that the staff elected director would seek to usurp the proper role of the trade unions, it would suggest-at least, in our minds-that we would not be able to support the staff elected director. The truth is that the staff elected director is not a staff representative-that is the role of the elected trade unions and the organisation. We believe that quite distinct and complementary roles are performed. Therefore, the argument proposed by the government that this person would put the interests of staff over their obligations of corporate governance is a fallacy. In its submission to the Senate committee, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance mentioned a previous Senate committee. In 2001 the method of appointments to the ABC board was considered in an inquiry conducted by the committee that considered this matter. A report called Above board? Methods of appointment to the ABC Board resulted from this inquiry. Nothing has changed between 2001 and 2006 in relation to appointments to the ABC board. In that report, however, the report by the government senators supported the maintenance of the status quo of the appointment of board members. The chair recommended the retention of the staff appointed director. What has changed? The government senators at that time were in the majority, as they are now. What has changed is that the government holds the majority in both houses of this parliament. The MEAA continued its submission to the most recent inquiry by arguing: The Alliance rejects the implicit assertion that staff elected directors cannot and have not been aware of their roles and responsibilities as board directors. They have all been fully aware of their fiduciary and legal responsibilities as board directors ... they are elected for the contribution they can make to the Board, to the good governance of the organization ... There are very clear legal parameters for the operation of board members enshrined in the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. The ABC is a Commonwealth authority for purposes of this act. It imposes duties on officers, including directorsgeneral. These include duties of care and diligence, the duty to act in good faith, the duty not to misuse the officers' position and the duty not to misuse information. To my knowledge, at no time have any of the holders of the position of staff elected director betrayed those principles. To do so would mean they were in breach of their duties under the legislation as it currently stands. One could argue that the premise may as well hold true for those directors appointed by the government through the Governor General. This bill is a continuation of the government's ongoing attack on the ABC. In the second reading speech the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads gave a number of reasons for doing away with a staff elected director. There was talk of the tension in relation to the position on the ABC board over many years. There was also the corporate governance argument. Tension of itself is not a basis upon which to abolish a staff elected director's position. Tension can occur on any board of directors, and it can revolve around particular personalities. I serve as a director of Revesby Workers Club. We have discussions in our board meetings, different sides are taken, the result is accepted and we go forward. With different personalities, there might be more tensionthere might be leaking or a whole range of things happening-but that of itself is not a basis for getting rid of a staff elected director. I think the government should be a bit more honest. I think this is just a policy decision based on the government's political ideology. Just be up front. Forget about these false arguments. If it is the position of the Liberal Party that there should not be a staff elected director, then just say so. There is no doubt that, when one hears the contributions by members opposite and in the Senate, you can see the paranoia with the ABC and the hatred of the left-wing bias, so-called, of the ABC and particular commentators who were formerly members of the Australian Labor Party or who worked for the ALP. The same could be argued on our side for those with a Liberal bent. My view is that, because you have had a political view in your life, it does not disqualify you from appointment to bodies, whatever they are, and that you look at people on their merits and the contributions they make. The history of the staff elected position is that it was first introduced by the Whitlam government without legislation in 1975. It was subsequently abolished by the Fraser government. The current position was created by an amendment to the ABC Act in 1986. Because the government now has a majority in the Senate, it is bringing forward its abolition, but I do not believe that it has made out a proper case in relation to corporate governance or tension. Tension can occur between directors who are not elected but who are appointed by a government wanting to take an organisation in a different direction. No-one can tell me that corporate governance sometimes has not been breached by government appointments. This position is being attacked because it is a staff elected position. The ABC has been served well by staff elected directors and they have made a contribution over the years. Quentin Dempster and Tom Molomby have added to and enriched the ABC and the deliberations of the board. This nebulous argument that there is some tension-and, as such, a particular person thought that the time should come to an end-is a nonsense. I think the government should provide more substance or be more honest about its ideological perspective not supporting such positions. And I think that is a sad thing. In the past, the ABC has not failed to attract criticism from the Labor Party. When Labor was in government, the ABC rightly scrutinised the government. In many respects, it can be seen as the official opposition by the way it runs a number of programs that delve deeply into which direction a government is heading. But staff elected directors have, in my considered view, added to the ABC. If a rogue director comes along, then deal with the rogue. Do not deal with the principle of the position. Alternatively, be honest and come forth and say: ‘It's our policy position that no such positions should exist. That is not the way we see the organisation running into the future.' The corporate governance argument is a nonsense argument. It could apply equally to other directors of the ABC. Where there has been a consistent, continued pattern, you have to demonstrate that a staff elected director has put the ABC's interests second and the staff's interests first. The government has not been able to do that. If there were tension between the staff elected director and other members of the board, that of itself is not sufficient to abolish the position. It might something about the staff elected director. I am not here to vouch for each and every one of them or their characters, because there are some I do not know or I have not met and I have not paid them particular attention. That is a matter that they would have to deal with in subsequent elections. I note that Quentin Dempster was elected to the position recently. In relation to the ongoing attacks by the government, the Treasurer made much of the injection of $1.6 billion into the ABC over the next three years. The government appointed chairman, Donald MCDonald, lauded the government's generosity in providing $30 million for Australian drama and documentaries, an extra $80 million for specific initiatives, $45 million to upgrade equipment, $13 million for regional local programming and an additional $600 million over the next 10 years for the ABC's move to digital broadcasting. What both the Treasurer and the ABC chairman failed to mention is that over the past 10 years the ABC has been chronically underfunded and denuded of funds. The operating budget has fallen across that period. The funding this year falls far short of consultant recommendations. In a leaked report, we are advised that KPMG was commissioned to investigate ABC funding and efficiency. It is understood that the report recommends the government fund the ABC to the tune of an extra $125 million over the next three years. That funding would allow the ABC to continue at its current depleted level of operation-not ensure that the national broadcaster is a strong participant in the emerging digital media environment. Not surprisingly, Minister Coonan has still failed to release the KPMG report. That of itself is a disgrace. With my colleagues I welcome the additional funding for the ABC. However, only say half the amount requested by the ABC was forthcoming. I am advised that the new money will allow the ABC to produce around 28 hours a year of new content. Recent figures show a staggering decline in locally produced drama on the ABC from 100 hours in 2001 to just 20 hours in 2005. Clearly this indicates why the ABC requested a further $38.4 million. Of this, $20 million would have been used to fund an extra 58 hours per year of home-grown drama, documentaries and children's and arts programming. Under its charter, the ABC has a responsibility ‘to encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts in Australia'. This is quite simply impossible for the national broadcaster without adequate funding. I note the comments made by Judith Rodriguez from the Friends of the ABC in response to this year's budget. Ms Rodriguez made her comments in the Australian Financial Review on 15 May, where she said: The government has used the budget to increase its control over the ABC operations: The broadcast triennial base funding has been frozen to the level at which it was cut after the government was elected in 1996. Program funding above the base is tied, targeted to Australian TV drama and documentaries, and regional programming. Targeted funding overrides the ABC board responsibility of ensuring all areas of the broadcaster charter responsibilities are met. Ms Rodriguez argues that this starving of the ABC creative base is ‘privatisation by stealth'-a truly terrifying vision, a quite real potential for what is effectively privatisation of the ABC. Imagine government determining programming for the ABC rather than the national broadcaster itself. I do mean ‘government'-not just this government but any government. The ABC remains a stronghold of independent national broadcasting for this country, yet its very future is threatened. In May 2005 the ABC published, as it does every year, a Newspoll survey on community attitudes. One of the findings was: ... nine in 10 Australians continue to believe the ABC provides a valuable service to the community, and half believe it provides a very valuable service. The commercial media would kill for such a ringing endorsement. A few years ago, Readers' Digest asked its readers in Australia to name the brands and institutions they most trusted. The ABC came in as the sixth most trusted government service between public schools and public hospitals and came in ahead of such bodies as the CSIRO and universities. ABC news beat all other television news services. Yet this government continues its politicisation and privatisation of the ABC. The undermining of public trust in such a national institution is appalling. It is worth reiterating the duty of the ABC board as set out in the act: It is the duty of the board to (a) ensure that the functions of the Corporation are performed efficiently and with the maximum benefit to the people of Australia; (b) to maintain the independence and integrity of the Corporation; (c) to ensure that the gathering and presentation by the Corporation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognized standards of objective journalism ... The proposed abolition of the staff elected director position on the ABC board will not improve the governance of the ABC, it will not ensure the efficient functioning of the ABC and it most certainly will not maintain the independence and integrity of the ABC. I doubt that it will make the news impartial and accurate according to the standards of ethical journalism. In spirit and in law, the ABC is meant to be independent. This bill continues the attack on the ABC the government has conducted since 1996. (Time expired)",133
212,Mr LINDSAY,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"The member for Banks has made some good points in his contribution to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. He has indicated that the ABC provides good quality programming and that in the main it attempts to discharge its responsibilities under its charter. Certainly I have no difficulty with the programming on the ABC. I do have some difficulty with some segments, particularly in relation to news, and I will articulate that later in his contribuIt tion. The Australian Labor Party is skating on pretty thin ice in its argument opposing this bill. The Australian Labor Party would do best and gain more credibility in the electorate by stopping being politically correct on this issue and starting to talk about things like good governance, integrity, conflict of interest and how you run a board in a proper way. Rather than appealing to the left-wing, politically correct people in the ABC, it should basically think of the national interest-indeed, the ABC's interest-and support this bill. There is no conspiracy here. The government is not into that. That is not why this bill is before the parliament. But there is a conflict of interest having a staff director on the board of this fine Australian organisation. There is a conflict of interest-nobody can deny that-and that conflict of interest has been amply demonstrated. The best evidence of that is the fact that the ASX chief, Maurie Newman, found himself having to resign from the board, blaming a gross breach of boardroom confidentiality. Mr Newman said that he could no longer be assured that accepted corporate governance standards would be observed on the board. He noted the refusal of the staff elected director to agree to the board's corporate governance protocols. That clearly points out the conflict of interest that a staff elected director has on the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. That cannot be denied. I do not see why the Labor Party should stand in the parliament and deny that because it is just the fact of the matter. There is a conflict of interest and that cannot be allowed to continue. You would not have a conflict of interest on the boards of Australia's major corporations-the BHPs or Woodsides of this world. would not be allowed. It would not be tolerated. Nor should we tolerate a conflict of interest on the board of the ABC, and that is why the government is moving to fix this problem. There is no difference between the boardrooms of Australia and the boardroom of the ABC. There has to be good governance, there has to be integrity and there has to be no conflict of interest. It is very hard to find another Australian government agency where there is a staff elected director on the board. For example, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, in my area, has no staff elected person-and it does not need one. The board should operate as boards do in the corporate world. The other point is that there will be no impact on the independence of the ABC by taking the staff elected director off the board-none whatsoever. The ABC remains absolutely independent, as per its charter. Taking a staff elected director off does not change that. A strong board, an impartial board and a board that does not have a conflict of interest is needed to make sure that the ABC meets its charter. Currently there is an area where the ABC does not meet its charter, and I put it to the parliament that that area is in the reporting of news. Let me be the first person to say that I deal with the ABC virtually every day. I deal with ABC North Queensland, in Townsville. Even though I am aware of the political affiliations of some of the journalists over the years, to a person they have been scrupulously impartial. I am very pleased and proud to be able to say that my ABC reports the news as it is, with no editorial bias. And that is a good thing. The 630 ABC North Queensland newsroom can be proud that they are true professionals. But you cannot say that about ABC newsrooms in Sydney, Canberra or Melbourne because there is ample evidence of misreporting and bias, and what makes me especially angry is the editorialising, particularly out of Canberra, that occurs in the nightly seven o'clock news service. A news bulletin is to report the news, not to editorialise. I do not mind how much the ABC editorialises in programs like The 7.30 Report, Media Watch, Insiders or whatever. Go for it, because viewers know that that is the kind program it is, but it is despicable, disgraceful and unprofessional that the ABC editorialises in the 7 pm news service. That has to stopand a strong board has to stop that. I call on the ABC board to do what they need to do to cut out this bias that exists in the Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra newsrooms. Let me give you an example of this that happened to me last week. I was asked about some comments attributed to Piers Akerman on the Prime Minister's tenure in the job. I made a very clear comment and, to their credit, ABC radio's AM program, who were the first to report my comments, reported them accurately-as they should. When I was asked about the Prime Minister I said: ‘The Prime Minister is there for as long as he wants to be. None of us want him to go. He's a great Prime Minister. But one day he will go-as we all will go-and when Peter Costello takes his place he will do a great job, and he could even do a better job than the Prime Minister.' I made those comments because we all know that in many corporations you get key people and everybody says, ‘Gee, we don't want to lose that person; how would you fill that person's shoes?' and, when you do lose them, often you get a better person in their shoes, not realising that that can happen. So I was making that point. But how did ABC television report that? They were very clever: they cut out the first bit and just reported the second bit. What they reported is what I said, but they-don't shake you head, Member for Richmond",138
213,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,Adelaide. Ms Kate Ellis-It's Adelaide.,139
214,Mr LINDSAY,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I apologise, Kate. Don't shake your head, because this is true. I can show you the tapes. What they did was to dump the first bit and play the second bit and make it look like I was pushing Peter Costello to be the leader straight away. That is devious and disgusting. It is not reporting the facts. If the ABC think they have got me as a friend when they do that to me-I am standing here supporting the bill tonight-I will support the ABC board making strong decisions to ensure that the news is reported as the news and as the facts, not as some cleverly edited piece which makes it looks like I said something that I did not say. I am very pleased to support the bill tonight. I want to see the ABC remain a strong, independent organisation. The government wants to see the ABC remain a strong organisation, and it is only through a board that has integrity, a board that practises the functions of good governance and a board that has no conflict of interest that we will be able to achieve that. I support this bill.",139
215,Ms ANNETTE ELLIS,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I rise this evening to speak on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. The aim of this bill is to remove the position of the staff elected director from the board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the ABC. Labor oppose this bill because this change is just another example of how we see the Howard government is crushing the independence of the ABC. This battle between the coalition, to destroy the ABC as we know it, and the Labor Party, to strengthen the ABC, has been going on for many years. The Whitlam government introduced the first staff elected position on the governing board of the ABC back in 1975. The Fraser government subsequently abolished the position. The Hawke government created the current position in 1986. Therefore it comes as no surprise that the Howard government is now trying to remove that position. Unfortunately, with a majority in the Senate, the Prime Minister is simply using his power once again and will end up giving what we believe is another blow to the ABC. And what excuse is the government giving for this appalling attack on the ABC? The explanatory memorandum for the amendment states: The Bill addresses an ongoing tension relating to the position of staff elected Director. A potential conflict exists between the duties of the staff elected Director under paragraph 23(1)(a) of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 to act in good faith in the best interests of the ABC, and the appointment of that Director via election by ABC staff. The election method creates a risk that a staff elected Director will be expected by the constituents who elect him or her to place the interests of staff ahead of the interests of the ABC as a whole where they are in conflict. I ask: is there any evidence to show that this conflict-some special form of conflictactually exists? I believe not. Firstly, the ABC is not the only Commonwealth authority with a staff elected board member, unbeknownst to the previous speaker. Other Commonwealth statutory organisations with staff elected positions on their governing bodies include the Australian National University, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School. Secondly, the legal duty of these board members is to the organisation, not to the people whom they represent, and they are fully aware of this. To defend this appalling amendment the government has used the Uhrig report, which examined the governance practices of statutory authorities in 2003. The report stated that representational appointments are not consistent with modern principles of corporate governance. But this argument is a sham. The Uhrig review did not specifically examine staff elected appointments, nor did it give any attention to the ABC. The focus of the review was on agencies with critical business relationships, such as the ATO, the ACCC, APRA, ASIC and the RBA. This bill was referred to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee, which went on to report in May 2006. The Labor, Greens and Democrats senators submitted a dissenting report opposing the bill, and this does not happen lightly. The inquiry examined the unwillingness of the current staff elected director, Ms Ramona Koval, to sign certain ABC protocols. During the inquiry, however, no evidence was produced that any staff elected director had breached their obligations to act in the best interests of the ABC. The report states: 1.18 The staff elected director defended her action in not signing the protocol: It was about independence. It was about having my decisions and opinions subsumed to the opinions of the rest of the board-so that went to independence, which is an absolute core issue as far as a director of a corporation is concerned. I did not want to be in breach of the law, frankly. In fact, the Senate committee heard a number of examples where the staff elected director opposed proposals that would have benefited staff, because they would have undermined the independence of the ABC-quite contrary to the argument being put. There are already remedies available under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act for a breach of director's duties. In addition, the Governor General can dismiss a director for misbehaviour. The evidence received by the Senate committee demonstrated that staff elected directors have brought considerable experience in broadcasting to the deliberations of the board. Clearly, this bill is the latest instalment what we see as the Howard government's decade-long attempt to undermine the very independence of the ABC. For 10 years, the government has worked to stack the ABC board with its political mates to try and control the ABC. The staff elected director makes an important contribution to the ABC's corporate governance. The staff elected director is able to give the board an important insight into ABC operations. Particularly with the current board, the staff elected director is sometimes the only person with the expertise to question the advice coming from the ABC's executive. If the government were really serious about improving the ABC's corporate governance, it would end the practice of stacking the board with political friends. Since 2003, Labor has argued that there should be an open and transparent process for making appointments to the ABC board. Vacancies should be advertised and there should be clear merit based selection criteria. An independent selection panel should conduct the short-list selection process. The selection of the short list would be independent of the minister. If the minister does not appoint a short-listed candidate, he or she should have to table in parliament a formal statement of the reasons for departing from the short list. Labor's policy would enhance our democracy by strengthening the very independence of the ABC, the base for the discussion in this legislation. Another way in which the Howard government has undermined the ABC has been through funding. While the budget contained some increases in funding, the appropriation fell well short of the amount requested by the ABC and identified by KPMG as necessary to maintain existing services. According to media reports, the KPMG funding adequacy review found that the ABC needs an extra in $125 million above inflation over the next three years just to sustain the current range of services. In my view, it is a disgrace that the minister continues to try and hide the extent of ABC underfunding and refuses to release that KPMG report so that Australians around the country can assess the government's performance for themselves. The government's failure to restore adequate funding means that the ABC will be forced to cut services or-and it is a big ‘or'-look to alternative sources of revenue, such as advertising on its websites. That is a very alarming path down which to travel, and one that we should all be very concerned about even seeing in consideration. Labor is seeking further information from the ABC on the likely impact of the funding shortfall during the current Senate estimates process. We welcome the additional funding for the production of Australian content. The problem is that the government granted only half the amount requested by the ABC. The new money will allow the ABC to produce around 28 hours a year of new content. As a result, Australian drama production is likely to remain at less than half the level it was five years ago. I do not know how any government can be proud of that sort of record when we think about our public broadcaster. Regrettably, the government has passed up the opportunity to use the ABC as a vehicle to promote the creation of exciting new digital content. The ABC's proposal to stimulate interest in digital television and broadband through an extra 200 hours of digital only content was completely rejected. The Howard government's chronic underfunding of the ABC is depriving Australians of the world class news, information and entertainment services that they expect and deserve. I am extremely disappointed with the way in which the Howard government has treated the ABC over the past 10 long years, and many of my constituents in the electorate of Canberra have written to me with similar views. We also in the ACT have a very active Friends of the ABC organisation, one that I hold up as a great defender of public broadcasting not only in this city but in this try. The people of Canberra are strong supporters of the ABC and they will be very saddened-pretty appalled, I think-at this bill, which is driven by the Howard government's extreme ideology and its desire to control the ABC. I cannot conclude my remarks without responding to the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Herbert, about his disappointment at the methodology in one of the cases he referred to involving the ABC's Canberra news service. I find it ironic in the extreme that the member for Herbert, with the greatest of respect, was a little bit miffed that part of a quote from him was used and part of the quote was not. We have that happen in this House every day by the government towards us. Every time we make a personal explanation to correct it, it comes back and it is done to us again. Maybe he needs to talk to his backbench about misrepresentation rather than just thinking about the ABC. How many times do members in this House have to stand up and make personal explanations because of the way the media generally, not just the ABC-in fact, I do not think I have ever heard the ABC mentioned; but I have heard media mentioned: print media, the lot-misrepresent, misquote or quote by selection certain comments made by any one of a range of members in this very place. I thought that was a little bit precious. To be quite frank, that is not the sort of argument upon which you base legislation through which you are removing a democratically elected member of the ABC board. It is a pretty weak argument to put up, and I could not let it go without making some remarks on it. In my view, and in the view of the Labor Party, the ABC is a significant and valuable Australian institution. It plays a vital role in our culture. It allows us to see ourselves in coun- our own culture. Millions of Australians watch the ABC to be entertained. But many also rely on the ABC for the very diversity it provides. Many of us do not want to watch Big Brother and a lot of that other reality TV hogwash that appears through commercial channels. Thank God for the ABC-all power to it. At least it is given the right, with the proper funding and the proper governance, to produce the sort of drama that builds our industry in this country and does not destroy it. We rely on it so much for highquality children's programs, learning programs, great Australian drama and comedy, current affairs, world news and independent journalism. It is not at all unusual that a journalist from somewhere might have a view different to one put by somebody in this place. That does not mean bias; it means another opinion.",139
216,Ms KATE ELLIS,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today to oppose the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. On 11 October 2004 the Prime Minister gave a radio interview during which he promised to use his Senate majority sensibly. He stated: We're not going to allow this to go to our head. We're not going to start proposing things that disruptive. We have seen time and time again this arrogant government break this promise and allow this power to go to its head. Sadly, for the electorate, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006 will do precisely this. This government is not acting sensibly at all. Ideological changes that seriously erode the independence of the ABC are callous and spiteful-anything but sensible. This is a cultural war against the ABC that has raged on for more than a decade. A 2001 committee recommendation unanimously endorsed the advice to retain the position of the staff elected director on the ABC board. The only conceivable difference now is the government's Senate majority. The ABC is a pillar of Australia's system of accountable and responsible government. It has provided us with decades of independent and critical reporting that has helped keep governments honest and the public aware and informed. It has also played an important role in nurturing Australian culture and epitomising the Australian identity. The ABC keeps Australians informed and entertained. Australians value its independence, which helps produce the wide array of quality programming demanded of our national broadcasting corporation. This is why I am so alarmed that the government is planning to abolish the position of the staff elected director, the only independent director on the board of the ABC. The government is clearly aiming to abolish the position before current director Ms Ramona Koval's term expires on 15 June 2006. It is bad enough that since 1996 the government has starved this institution of the funding it deserves. Now it is taking a swipe at the independence upheld as essential by so many Australians. I would firstly like to discuss the value of the staff elected director. The staff elected directors at the ABC have always brought are considerable experience in broadcasting to the deliberations of the board. At a time when the government is intent on cramming the board full of government cronies, it is essential that this contribution is maintained. Often, this director is the only individual on the board with the expertise to question the advice coming from the ABC's executive. In the 74 years the ABC has existed, the government has appointed only one person with broadcasting experience. That one person was Mr Robert Raymond, a former producer for both the ABC and Channel 9. Mr Raymond served only one term. The position of the staff appointed director has always brought a fresh perspective to the board that can only come from the staff elected position. For the past 23 years it has ensured that at least one member of the board has an extensive understanding of broadcasting, especially public broadcasting. I agree with the suggestion of the Friends of the ABC in my state of South Australia that this position provides an ‘important safeguard'. There is no evidence of abuse of this position. David Salter, a former executive producer of the ABC's Media Watch, is right to suggest that to abolish this position would be to ‘amputate a perfectly useful limb'. Senator Coonan has wrongfully suggested that this position is an anomaly amongst Australian government agency boards. The minister needs to be clear on the term ‘anomaly' or to stop exaggerating. The boards of the Australian National University and the Australian Film, Television and Radio School, just to name a few, all have a staff elected board position. Why abolish this position? The answer is clearly to fulfil an ideological agenda. The excuses provided by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts are almost laughable. The government has continued to argue that the staff elected director is subject to potential conflict because they may feel obliged to represent the interests of the people who elected them rather than to act in the best interests of the ABC. But no evidence has been produced demonstrating that any staff elected director has failed to carry out their duties. The Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee received submissions from several former staff elected directors of the ABC and from one of the current directors, Ms Koval. There was no evidence in any of these submissions that suggested any staff elected director had breached their obligation to act in the best interests of the ABC. To claim that because this position is staff elected the director is representative only of staff is simply ludicrous. The minority report of the committee made the obvious point: In the case of the ABC, the staff elected director is not a representative of the staff just as directors appointed by the Government should not be representatives of the Government on the Board. The same logic of Senator Coonan's implication that the staff elected director would act in the interest of staff could be applied, as the South Australian Friends of the ABC suggest with more concrete evidence, to the other directors. They stated: ... the politicians who appointed the other directors might expect those directors to place the interests of their political party ahead of those of the ABC. This government clearly has no aversion at all to a biased ABC board, as long as the bias is in its favour. In fact, the Senate committee heard a number of examples of where staff elected directors opposed proposals that would have benefited staff because they would have undermined the independence of the ABC. For instance, the proposed partnership between Telstra and the ABC was opposed by the staff elected director. This could have allowed Telstra to influence production decisions and thus undermine independence. What is more is that, even if the staff elected director does breach their duties-and we certainly have not seen that they have-they could be dismissed for misbehaviour under the current legislative arrangements. The government has relied on the Uhrig report to condone this decision. I am afraid this is misplaced. Mr Uhrig did not specifically examine government arrangements at the ABC but rather focused upon agencies with critical business relationships, such as the ATO, the ACCC and ASIC. Mr Uhrig did not examine the governance arrangements at the ABC nor did he make inquiries of any current or previous member of the ABC board. The government has further cited evidence submitted to the committee by Professor Stephen Bartos, who is Director at the National Institute for Governance. However, Professor Bartos did not endorse the abolition of the staff elected director but rather stated it was a matter for political judgment. The fact that the government cannot even back up its own amendments with hard and fast advice is appalling. What more evidence do the Australian people need that this government is not acting sensibly at all but is again embarking on an ideological rampage? This time the ABC is in the firing line. This is just another example of the government's blatant attempts to diminish the independence of the ABC. The Prime Minister has consistently attempted to undermine the independence of the board since 1996. The only reason the Prime Minister seeks to abolish this position is that it is a position he cannot control. This has absolutely zero to do with corporate governance. If the government were really serious about corporate governance, it would instead install an independent process to appoint directors to the board. There must be an open and transparent process for making appointments to the ABC board. As my colleagues have mentioned, a Labor government would advertise all board vacancies and install clear, merit based selection criteria. An independent selection panel would conduct the short-list selection process, and this process would be independent of the minister. If the minister then chose not to appoint a short-listed candidate, he or she should have to table in parliament a formal statement of the reasons for departing from the short list. This would enhance Australia's democracy by strengthening the independence of the ABC. We need to look at every possible chance to strengthen Australia's democracy. I would also like to state on the record my opposition to the government's personal attacks on Ms Koval. Government members of the Senate committee questioned her integrity and in paragraphs 1.17 and 1.19 of the majority report criticised her for her failure to sign the ABC board protocol, claiming that this demonstrated a lack of independence. In Ms Koval's defence, she had received legal advice that the protocol jeopardised her legal obligation to act and this advice was not challenged before the committee. I think this must be publicly acknowledged. It is absolutely disgraceful that the government would single out Ms Koval and tarnish her reputation in pursuit of their own ideological agenda, but I suppose this is not surprising in light of the government's history. The government have been stuffing the board full of their political buddies in effort to undermine the independence of the ABC. I have previously spoken in this parliament about my strong views on the ABC and my belief that a strong, independent ABC needs adequate funding. I would like to take this opportunity to comment further on the Howard government's insistence on steadily stripping the ABC of its funding. The 2006 budget contained some modest increases in funding, but this figure is well below both what the ABC requested and, importantly, is below the KPMG recommendation of what is necessary to sustain its current range of services. The ABC is expected to put 20 hours of Australian drama on television this year, significantly down from 102 hours five years ago. The new money will allow the ABC to produce only 28 hours of new content a year. This government has led the ABC into a state of chronic underfunding, which must, and must only, be delivered by the federal government. I will again use this opportunity to call on the government to adequately fund our ABC. I would also like to read an excerpt from an email which was sent to me by one of my constituents. She wrote when she heard of these proposals: I have just read that John Howard has decided to axe the elected member of the ABC staff from the Board of the ABC. I fear this is the beginning of some very bad news. Please do everything you independently, can to stop this! This view is not uncommon amongst the ordinary constituents in my electorate. I assure this constituent-and, indeed, all others-that I will do everything I can to stop this, including voting against this proposal today. We have seen on so many occasions the manner in which this government is prepared an to misuse its Senate power in the pursuit of attacking its so-called opponents. This legislation is an extension of this pattern. This was perhaps most obviously highlighted by the pitiful contribution of the member for Canning, where he stooped to attack one respected journalist in an effort to argue the case for this proposal. ‘What was this journalist's crime?' you might ask. The crime, as the member for Canning said, was that she criticised the government. In Howard's Australia, it seems, we cannot have any of that anymore, can we? The nerve of some people-to dare to criticise this government! The government is no stranger to using its power to attack perceived opponents or dissenting voices. We have seen it time and time again. We have seen it continually attack Australia's trade unions and the role that they play. We have seen it attack and attempt to silence university students with its voluntary student unionism legislation, seeking to silence the student voices who quite rightly dare to speak out about the government's continued attacks on the higher education sector. We have seen this government foster a culture of fear amongst community organisations which are reliant upon federal funding, threatening to strip them of their grants if they dare speak in opposition to Howard government policies. And, just last week, we saw one of the government's most recent attacks on our very democracy when this chamber passed legislation to disenfranchise thousands of Australians, presumably on the basis that they may dare to oppose the government in the polls. So whilst this government is perfecting its art form of attacking any perceived opponents, it must stop and recognise that the ABC are not enemies of the government. By doing their job-acting as a strong and independent voice reporting on current events, and educating, informing and entertaining the Australian public-they are playing a tremendous role, which must be recognised and respected by this government as it is by the Australian people. I think it is important to fight for the because I want our children to enjoy the same quality, independent news and entertainment that everyone in this chamber has experienced. The government will obliterate the independence of the ABC if it goes ahead unchecked and that will be a very sad day for Australian democracy and for the Australian people. I oppose these measures, and I urge all members to do likewise and vote down this callous and ideologically driven drivel for what it is.",142
217,Ms HOARE,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I rise tonight to speak against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. This is a short bill which reduces the maximum number of directors on the ABC board from nine to eight by abolishing the position of the staff elected director. The government has argued that the staff elected director is subject to a potential conflict, because they may feel obliged to represent the interests of the people who elected them rather than to act in the best interests of the ABC. Labor opposes this bill. Absolutely no evidence has been produced to demonstrate that any staff elected director has failed to comply with their duties. This legislation is simply a further attempt by the government to undermine the independence of the ABC. In March 2006, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Coonan, announced that the government would ‘restructure' the ABC board, and that is what we see before us today. It is just one small change, but it is a very significant change and one which will significantly impact on the independence of our ABC. That change is to abolish the only non-Howard-government appointed director of the ABC board-the staff elected director. I will give a bit of history that shows the commitment of Labor governments to the ABC and to the independence of the ABC. In ABC, 1975, Gough Whitlam's Labor government created the position of the staff elected director. In 1978, that position was abolished by the Liberal government under Malcolm Fraser. In 1983, the Labor government under Bob Hawke reinstated the position. In 1986, the Hawke government, under section 13A of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act, formalised the staff elected position. Past staff elected directors have been Quentin Dempster, from June 1992 to June 1996; Kirsten Garrett, from 1996 to 2000; and Ian Henschke, from 2000 to 2002. Our current staff elected director is Ramona Koval and her term, I think, expires on 15 June, when she should have been replaced by Quentin Dempster. The explanatory memorandum and the minister's speech emphasise that the basis of this legislation is the Uhrig review. Indeed, the explanatory memorandum refers to pages 98 and 99 of the Uhrig review. The report of the Uhrig review was a document of 133 pages; only two of those pages alluded to representational appointments to governing boards. The Friends of the ABC's submission to the Senate inquiry said: The Bill appears to rely heavily on findings tained within the Uhrig Review of June, 2003. The Friends of the ABC submitted that the Uhrig review focused on taxation, regulation and provision of services. In all of its 133 pages, the Uhrig review made no reference to the ABC or any of the other organisations that had representational appointments to their boards. It is a fairly damning indictment of the government and the minister that they have based this legislative change to the board of the ABC on a review which does not mention the ABC once. The Uhrig review was established by the Prime Minister in 2002. The terms of reference were to review governance practices of statutory authorities and office holders, particularly those agencies which impact on the business community. I do not know about you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I do not see the ABC as a statutory authority or an agency having as much impact on the business community as many other government boards or authorities. The Uhrig report dealt briefly with representational appointments, as I mentioned before. According to the Bills Digest: The review did not consider staff elected representation specifically except a brief consideration of departmental public servants sitting on boards of other government agencies. Apparently the ABC is not the only Commonwealth authority or company that has a staff elected board member. Other organisations include the Australian National University, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Film Television and Radio School. We have not seen the government move to eliminate or abolish the staff elected representatives on those boards, but I suppose that will come. There has been debate today about a supposed conflict of interest-whether or not a staff elected representative on the board conwould put the interests of the ABC and the independence of the ABC before the interests of the staff who elected that particular director. In my mind, those interests coincide and would not conflict at all. I understand that there is a section of the act which deals with the elected director's participation or nonparticipation in any discussion which relates to the conditions and pay of ABC staff. On 24 March 2006, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Helen Coonan, said that there is a clear legal requirement of the staff elected director that means that he or she has the same rights, duties and obligations as other directors, including to act in the interests of the ABC as a whole. That is covered in section 8 of the act. If a staff elected director of the ABC was in breach of this part of the legislation, that director would be removed from the ABC board. That has not happened over the past decades when we have had a staff elected representative. If it did happen, there is a clear legal avenue for the government or the rest of the board to rectify that situation. But it has not happened and I would not anticipate that it would happen. As I said, staff representatives have a legal duty statement: the same as that of other board members. It is not to their constituents but to the organia sation more generally. These are set out in section 8 of the ABC Act, as I said. The Bills Digest also said that it is worth noting that if there is a concern that staff elected board members might prosecute particular interests, that must equally apply to other board members who are appointed by the government. And, of course, they are in the majority. There is only one staff elected board member, as opposed to up to seven or eight appointed by the government. Of course, they would have their personal interests at heart as well. There is also a moral duty. The staff elected director at the ABC board brings with him or her a wide range of experience in journalism and broadcasting. That is not necessarily the case with the government appointed directors. The staff appointed director is able to advise the board on a professional basis in the areas of journalism and broadcasting. They bring that whole depth of experience with them. That is the reason they are nominated and selected by the staff of the ABC. We have heard that the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee had an inquiry into this. The inquiry was held in a period when there were five nonsitting weeks, and the government deemed that the inquiry would last for one day. It was ABC. a very short inquiry. There ended up being a minority report by Labor and the minority parties who did not believe that the evidence that was provided to them warranted a change of this significance. I want to talk about the submission by the current staff elected director, Ramona Koval. Her submission to the inquiry included the Generally, there is an expectation that members of Board of Directors will act collectively ... However, this is subject to the overriding duty of each individual member of the Board to act in good faith in the Corporation's best interests. That was when she had been criticised for some actions or decisions that she had taken as a director of the board, but she had done them on the basis of sound principles, values and good governance. Ms Koval talked about the criticism of her when she would not sign a particular document. She said: One version of the document required that I not participate in “public (including media) discussions, interviews or articles relating to ABC Board matters”. This could imply that as a Director I cannot comment in public on any matter to do with the ABC at all, as a Board matter is really anything to do with an organisation. Here is a document that is going to gag members of the ABC board, who are directed with running and governing the ABC, so they cannot discuss publicly anything about the ABC. It is quite extraordinary. I agree that she was quite within her rights to refuse to sign that particular document, and of course, as we have seen, she has been criticised widely for it. Another staff representative on the ABC board from 1996 to 2000, Kirsten Garrett, said in relation to this legislation: This is just red raw politics with an extraordinary disregard for the Australian people. If it succeeds, the Government will have complete control of the We have heard many discussions since July last year of Howard's extravagance since he has gained control of the Senate, and this is just another ideological push on his part of his personal responsibility, as he sees it, to destroy our independent broadcaster. Now that he has control of the Senate, he will have control of the ABC. Our ABC is not only under attack in this legislation; it is also under attack in this year's budget. In the 2006-07 budget just brought down this month, the ABC received $88.2 million over three years for drama and documentary making, regional and local programming and capital renewal. This is not enough to sustain programming needs, and it is substantially less than the ABC's budget submission log of claims. Speaking on the budget, the Friends of the ABC spokesperson-and I need to declare a vested interest here: I am a member of the Friends of the ABC-Margaret O'Connor described the ABC's funding situation as ‘grim' and ‘dire' and forecast that the ABC is facing significant programming cuts. In their last annual report, the board of directors said that ‘a critical point has been reached' and that unless ‘adequate funding is secured for the coming triennium, the Board will be faced with a range of fundamental questions about the extent and quality of ABC programming and services'. Further, the government commissioned KPMG to investigate the ABC's funding. The government will not release this report and has been withholding it from the parliament and from the public. This is something that taxpayers have paid for. It is a review into the funding of our ABC-the ABC that belongs to each and every Australian-and now the government is hiding it. There must be something in this KPMG report that the government does not like, and it will not release it to the general public. I would also like to quote from a letter to the Australian Financial Review of 15 May by Judith Rodriguez, who is a Friend of the ABC in Melbourne. She writes: While funding to the ABC was increased, the broadcaster received less than it needs to maintain its existing level of service. The additional funds come with strings attached that undermine the ABC's independence. The ABC budget appropriation is $37.6 million short of the amount that leaked from a government-commissioned report revealing ABC needs for the next three years. She concludes: The community values the ABC because it knows the public broadcaster is not compromised by government or commercial influence. Undermine the ABC's independence, and there will be no reason for the ABC to exist. It looks like this is precisely what the government is seeking to do. The community will need to be vigilant if the ABC is to survive in more than name. Well done Judith Rodriguez, and there are so many more people like her who are Friends of the ABC and who will continue to stand up for the independence of the ABC. In conclusion, I would like to quote from a recent newsletter from the Friends of the ABC in New South Wales. We have a very active branch in Newcastle of which I am very proud to be a member. A boxed article at the bottom of page 3 entitled ‘DID YOU KNOW?' says: Friends of the ABC (NSW) celebrates the 30th anniversary of its founding in April. It was formed in protest at funding cuts (familiar?) imposed by the Fraser Government. Here we are thirty years later with many of the same issues existing in 1976 and some additional ones to challenge us.",146
218,Ms BIRD,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"Cunningham) (6.58 pm)Tonight I rise to speak in opposition to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. Like my colleague, I wish to be up-front in acknowledging that I am also a member of the New South Wales, and specifically the Illawarra branch, Friends of the ABC and that approximately 80 per cent of my scarce viewing and listening time is spent enjoying the excellent programs offered by ABC television and radio. I joined the Friends of the ABC a number of years ago as I grew concerned by the concerted and, indeed, borderline paranoid attacks on the independence of the ABC by the former Minister Alston. I note that this legacy has been taken up in the other place with gusto, particularly by the newly elected Senator Fierravanti-Wells. Like the majority of Australians, I believe the ABC in its various broadcast forms provides the most informative and unbiased reporting in Australia on current and world affairs. I also appreciate the range and breadth of the journalistic opinion which is on offer. Unlike some on the other side of the House, I do understand that opinion, when offered, should not misrepresent itself as news. In my experience, the ABC is far more rigorous in making this distinction clear in its programs than is often the case in the commercial media. I acknowledge that the ABC, like some of the individual journalists and reporters in the commercial field, can give governmentsand, indeed, oppositions-a torrid time in pushing and questioning their actions and explanations. They certainly did when Labor was in federal government. We copped it most times. Sometimes we argued with the ABC about it, but we did not undervalue the democratic importance of its role and did not seek to starve or bully it into submission, as has been occurring under this government over the last 10 years. The minister claims that this legislation is necessary because the ABC staff elected director position is an anomaly in corporate governance. To the contrary, such positions are not at all unusual on many boards that govern other types of organisations such as tertiary and cultural institutions-for example, the University of Wollongong in my own electorate-and health systems. Indeed, some more progressive private enterprises and businesses that value the corporate knowledge and shop floor experience of their own staff also make provision for a staff elected director position. Even multinationals, I understand, such as Mercedes Benz do this. There are certainly extensive examples of boards that are too insular to have protected the organisation they oversight, and there are many cases where this has led to corporate collapses or public scandals. Surely it is only good governance to seek a broader gene pool of talent to draw from, rather than to minimise it and fall into the trap of cloning existing board members. Indeed, the current scandal with AWB shows that boards can only benefit from wider gene pools, particularly one that delivers some independent and critical thinking. Former staff elected director Quentin Dempster has outlined circumstances in which past staff elected directors have been critical players in identifying problems with board considerations that have resulted in avoiding significant loss or embarrassment. In interview, Mr Dempster referred to the role of the staff elected board director in the creation of the board ordered inquiry into the breaches of the ABC Act and the ABC board editorial policies through ‘backdoor sponsorship' of television infotainment programs by vested interests. He further outlined the role of staff elected directors acting to protect the ABC's independence in policy and operational terms in opposing the failed proposals for commercial partnerships with John Fairfax Holdings Pty Ltd and Cox Communications of the United States in subscription or pay television and with Telstra in broadband content with access to all ABC content. The government argues that a staff elected director carries an inherent conflict of interest between their directorial responsibilities and some form of constituency responsibilities arising from being elected. The government does not provide-and I believe has not successfully provided-an argument about why a director who is elected is more bound to their electors than a director who is appointed is bound to their appointee. All directors are bound by the ABC Act's clauses covering duties of directors, pecuniary interests and removal, regardless of the method of their elevation to the board. Mr Dempster outlined the case that in the backdoor sponsorship issue the staff elected director's actions were contrary to any narrow sectional interests of journalists, producers and support staff, as it resulted in infotainment taken off air and, again in the pay TV case, 100 jobs being lost. In trying to make the argument for this amendment based on the Uhrig report of 2003, the government is ignoring the fact, as has been identified by other speakers on this side, that the report deals with the types of boards and circumstances that are not identical to the staff elected director of the ABC board nor to the functions of the board. The report by and large referred to taxation regulation and provision of services and failed to make any reference in its 133 pages to the ABC board, its membership or circumstances. In reality, most government members have risen in this House and in the other place to claim that they really value the ABC and that this amendment is about good corporate governance, not about attacking the ABC. Strangely and almost without exception, they then proceed to attack various presenters, journalists or shows. As an example, I particularly refer to the speech delivered on this bill by Wollongong based Senator Fierravanti-Wells, who listed a string of complaints against the broadcaster in her newly appointed Alston successor role. The senator seems to feel that the ABC should censor the range of views and opinions that can be presented on their news and current affairs coverage and that, if the range of people she identified as inappropriate are allowed to appear, the ABC should act as an alternative voice and debate the issue. This is a profound misunderstanding of the role of effective journalism. Certainly a good journalist should push for an interviewee to be accountable for their views and actions, but this is far from being an alternative voice. The senator then goes on to tell the ABC what question it should have asked the former ALP leader Mark Latham. Personally I think the media did a good job with a pretty being willing participant to dump buckets on the ALP, but this was not enough for the senator. She launched an attack on the ABC journalist for not asking one question which she feels was crucial. If this is giving her so much angst, perhaps she should have considered a career change to journalism rather than to the Senate. But this is a distinction that government members seem incapable of comprehending in this debate. Those on the other side of the House have no problem with the commercial media running many of the same stories as the ABC, reporting many of the same events, providing air time and columns to the same characters, asking or failing to ask the same questions or using or failing to use particular terms and references-so why the special criticism of the ABC? The answer to this question lies at the heart of this bill. Government members believe the government should own the ABC body and soul. They should be director, editor, producer and reporter. They should be judge and jury of every story. The senator concludes her contribution by claiming that the ABC is actually under threat by ‘the pernicious left-wing influence that permeates far too much of the ABC's biased and unbalanced coverage'. This bill is certainly about the independence of the ABC. This bill is about the real problems this government has with the very independence that the ABC maintains, despite attempts over the last 10 years to starve it into submission.",149
219,Mr MURPHY,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"Lowe) (7.07 pm)Following the announcement in March 2006 by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts concerning her plans to restructure the board of the ABC, many held hopes of legitimate reform. It would not be naive to assume that many supporters of the ABC believed the minister's statement to imply that the government was making a belated yet genuine attempt to ensure that the ABC's corporate governance arrangements reflected community demands for a vibrant and independent national broadcaster. Such a restructure ought to have provided greater scrutiny of board appointments while restraining the practice of the government to stack the board with its political mates. Tragically, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006 achieves neither of these laudable objectives. Before voicing my stern opposition to this bill, it would be instructive to analyse what does not do. The bill has failed to implement an open and transparent process for making government appointments to the ABC board. Given the minister's apparent intention that the bill ensure that all board members act in the best interests of the ABC rather than in the interests of those who have put them on the board, it is inconceivable that she could have any objection to a process that would advertise all board vacancies and ensure that any selection is based on merit rather than on the basis of political patronage. It is no stretch of the imagination to suggest that this government has been unjustifiably sensitive to the ABC's overt independence and has responded in kind by catapulting onto the board people with whom it has networked or who are close to it. One only need look to recent appointments, including Michael Kroger and Ron Brunton, to realise that the government is doing all it can to reel in what it considers to be an unruly child. It is clear that the government would prefer the ABC to be biased-but biased in favour of its ideology and philosophy. If the government were serious about resolving the so-called tension between the obligation of directors to act in the best interests of the public broadcaster and their obligation to serve the interests of those who elected them to their positions, it would have provided a framework for board appointments to be made objectively. For years, Labor has been calling for a truly independent selection panel to undertake a short-list selection process for board appointments. This short list would be independent of any minister and would limit the circumstances in which political stooges could be appointed to the board. That there should be clear merit based selection criteria is something that all ABC supporters can agree on. That such a proposal has not been adopted by the govit ernment demonstrates that the intent of this bill is not, as the minister suggests, ‘to improve the ABC's corporate governance'. The question must then be asked: what exactly does this bill restructure? The minister's restructure consists of just one measure: a proposal to abolish the position of staff elected representative on the ABC board. It is no coincidence that the staff elected position has been targeted for termination. It is the one appointment to the board of the ABC that the government cannot control. Despite the protestations of the minister, this bill has nothing to do with improving corporate governance whatsoever but is just the latest instalment in this government's epic battle to undermine the independence of the ABC. Naturally, the minister denies this and refers to section 78(6) of the ABC Act, which states: ... the Corporation is not subject to direction on behalf of the Government of the Commonwealth. This is a disingenuous attempt to employ shallow words to give soothing assurances that the ABC has and always will be independent while underhandedly destroying the few structures in place that give effect to such words. Recent events demonstrate that words are insufficient to protect the ABC's independence. In spite of section 78(6) of the ABC Act, I note a report by Louise Dobson in the Sydney Morning Herald of 9 May this year. That report suggests that the ABC board had short-listed an individual to take over the role of managing director and run it past the government only to be told to try again. Indeed, in recent days, as we now know, Mark Scott-a former chief political adviser to the Liberal state education minister, Terry Metherell-has been announced as the ABC's new managing director. Is it a coincidence that, according to reports in the Sydney Morning Herald of 22 May this year, Mr Scott is said to be on good terms with the minister for communications? With the abolition of the staff elected position, one wonders whether this will be the only way to be elected to the ABC board of directors-that is, by being on good terms with the minister. So much for the section 78(6) requirement of being ‘not subject to direction by or on behalf of the government'. The few structures in place that promote independence, including the staff elected representative position, are needed now more than ever. Our national broadcaster is at the crossroads. The government has made a decision on the ABC's funding, which is not enough to sustain basic programming needs and is substantially less than that recommended by an independent report by KPMG. The board has just announced its new managing director who will be instrumental in by or determining the ABC's long-term direction, including whether advertising will be permitted on our national broadcaster. That should be of grave concern to all of us. I draw the minister's attention to my letter published in today's Financial Review on that very topic. There exists now more than ever a need for a director who better understands and is entirely committed to the ABC's charter to inform, educate, entertain and enhance a sense of national identity. Moves to commercially exploit the ABC, which have not been ruled out by Mr Scott, will be much harder to resist without a staff elected director to act as a charter safeguard. There exists now more than ever a need for a director who better understands the unique nature of the ABC. Most private companies would envy the passion and loyalty that characterise the relationship of staff elected directors with the ABC; the government begrudges it. Perhaps the government understands only too well the inexorable nexus between the interests of the ABC and the passion and loyalty held by many members of its staff. In light of the government's devastating funding arrangements and mooted desire to permit advertising on the public broadcaster, it makes sense for the government to eradicate the largest stumbling block to alleviating the pain in its hip pocket. Indeed, the minister has expressed an interest in allowing the ABC to become a rating-chasing, revenueraising body at the expense of diversity in children's, religious, science, health, music, drama, documentary, comedy, news and current affairs programming. There can be no doubt that the staff elected director, who is the only board member with the expertise to cross-examine advice coming from the ABC executive, is a monumental thorn in the side of the Howard government. Professor Ken Inglis, a leading authority on the organisation, has stated that the: ... staff elected director has exercised more influence ... than any other single director, apart from the chairman and deputy chair. In light of the government's plans for the ABC, is it any wonder that it seeks to destroy this position? Putting aside the government's clandestine intention, Senator Coonan, the communications minister, has also failed to bring forward evidence that supports the public position taken by the government in respect of this bill. The minister's explanatory memorandum to the bill quotes a report of June 2003 by John Uhrig, entitled Review of the corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders. Relevantly, the minister's explanatory memorandum quotes the Uhrig report's conclusion: The Review does not support representational appointments to governing boards as representational appointments can fail to produce independent and objective views. There is the potential for these appointments to be primarily concerned with the interests of those they represent, rather than the success of the entity they are responsible for governing. At face value, this statement provides compelling evidence in favour of the abolition of the staff elected director position. The minister has spoken publicly of a concern that staff elected directors could feel obliged to represent the interests of the staff who elected them rather than to act in the best interests of the ABC. An inquiry into the bill by the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee proves this to be anything but the case. Indeed, the Senate committee has heard numerous examples of where a staff elected director has opposed measures that may have benefited staff but which have jeopardised the independence of the ABC. This is perhaps best seen with a staff elected director's exposure of backdoor sponsorship infotainment programs on ABC TV in the 1990s in breach of the ABC Act. It is hypocritical in the extreme for the government to be casting aspersions on staff elected directors when it has failed to accept or even acknowledge that members of the board appointed by the government have a far greater potential for conflict of interest than has been shown to exist for any director that staff have elected to the position. It clearly does not suit the government to acknowledge the passion and loyalty that characterises the relationship of staff elected directors with the ABC. Doing so would bring into question the passion, loyalty and bona fides held by those appointed by the government itself. Nevertheless, assuming Uhrig's conclusions, referred to in the explanatory memorandum, are true, it is interesting to note that his findings on this matter only made up one page of a 133-page report. Furthermore, Mr Uhrig made no reference to the ABC anywhere in his report. It is also interesting that Mr Uhrig's comment that ‘there are no universally accepted structures and practices that constitute good governance' did not find its way into the minister's explanatory memorandum. I ask why. It would be pertinent to note the comments of another expert in governance at this point. Professor Stephen Bartos, Director of the National Institute for Governance, has stated that the choice of governance model to be adopted for a public sector body should not be formulaic but should be driven by the objectives of the organisation concerned. Clearly, should the Howard government see the ABC as operating in a similar manner to other commercial television and radio stations, a governance structure espoused by Uhrig may be justified. However, if we are to continue to conceive of the ABC as being a different sort of body-a community based body which is not interested in rising ratings and raising revenue-having representative directors onboard is entirely appropriate. If the government is serious about fostering the independent spirit which resides within the ABC, it must maintain the only position over which it has no control: the staff elected director. The staff elected director is the one voice which has exposed past board attempts to tie the ABC to commercial arrangements which would corrupt its public purpose. It is the one voice that has done most to protect the integrity of the ABC charter. It is the one voice that can exercise genuine independence in all board decisions. And it has done that with distinction when we were in government. Given the absence of merit based selection criteria for board appointments made by the government, the staff elected director also brings much needed practical broadcasting experience and insight into the boardroom discussion of policy and operational procedures. Given the board selection process, such experience and insight may otherwise have been missing from boardroom discussions. There has long been a concern that the government has made no effort to select board members with an appropriate mix of skills for running a national broadcaster. Indeed, similar concerns were raised by a highly unlikely source: former Senator Richard Alston, as Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on ABC Management and Operations. He said, inter alia: The current ABC is required to make decisions with long-term implications in a time of overwhelmingly rapid transformation of broadcasting technology. The board's task may have been made more difficult by the fact that many of its members have little specialist knowledge of either the broadcasting industry or the new technologies. The committee believes that the board as a whole lacks the range of depth of skills and experience which would be necessary to provide adequate leadership for the ABC. The staff elected director has this specialist knowledge of the ABC and the broadcasting industry. The staff elected director has the range of skills and experience which is necessary to provide leadership of the ABC. What the staff elected director does not have is the capacity to succumb to this government's extreme and destructive plans for the ABC. The staff elected director position has served the ABC well. Far from deserving to be abolished, the position ought to be retained in the ABC's governance structure. I congratulate Mr Quentin Dempster on his election again to the board because he, more than anyone, has been an ornament to the public broadcaster. I do not think anyone in this House would quarrel with the integrity of Mr Quentin Dempster. A vote for this bill is almost certainly a vote for the commercial exploitation and political manipulation of the ABC, given the ease with which it can occur without the watchful eye of a staff elected director. As taxpayers and viewers, we deserve to see our public broadcaster better protected against such manipulation and coercion. To make this bill into law would fail Australia's most important national institution as well as the millions of Australians who rely on the ABC for news, information, entertainment and education. For as long as I remain a member of this parliament, you can be sure that I will continue to fight against this government's vitriolic and unjustified attacks on our public broadcaster. I encourage any true supporters of the ABC who are sitting on the other side of this chamber to do the same. I reject this nonsense that is always thrown at the ABC about its so-called bias. I well remember Neville Wran, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating complaining about the ABC. Of course, any government will complain when the public broadcaster runs an editorial contrary to a policy position of the government of the day, whether it be federal or state. So the politicitralia. sation of the ABC continues. The government are prepared to allow the ABC to raise its revenue to supplement its budget. We all know that, apart from the concerns that we all have with regard to compromising the independence of the ABC, once the government rely on revenue being drawn from the corporate sector, the government will take that amount of money out of their budget for the ABC. So it will be a neutral position; the ABC will not gain anything. Moreover, I think this is quite a serious matter at a time when the government are about to change our media ownership laws and hand over our democracy to Mr Packer and Mr Murdoch. That should be of great concern to all of us. I call on all members of this House, in particular the members of the government, to come to their senses, support the independence of the ABC and support Mr Quentin Dempster in his campaign. I reject this bill. (Time expired)",152
220,Mr KATTER,CORPORATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Amendment Bill 2006. I personally have suffered greatly at the hands of the ABC. In finding what was called the ‘crooked creek cattle company' in North Queensland, some 18 people gave evidence about it. Of those 18, six were dead within two or three years and the remaining 12 were put up on trumped up charges of one type or another. The Queensland Commissioner of Police and I were included in the 18 and, at that stage, I was a senior minister in the government. It was the very courageous actions of Steve Austin, an ABC journalist who has covered the Drive show in recent years, who exposed the situation. For reasons that I do not entirely understand, it has been the tradition and culture of the ABC to show great courage at times and to do things that are very important for AusFor those who have read the story of Kokoda, Chester Wilmot exposed what was going on at Kokoda and received terrible treatment by the Australian government and the Army. The militia battalions saved Australia on the Kokoda trail. Chester Wilmot had all of his reporting confiscated by the Army and the government of the day. But it was not the fault of Chester Wilmot or the ABC. They made strenuous efforts to try to protect Australia. One of the reasons given by the government is that this sort of thing is normal in a corporation. But the government is not running a corporation; it is running a country. It is assessing the values of such a system to the country if the country requires a free and unfettered media. In one article I read recently, two corporations-Woolworths and Coles-are responsible for 27c of every Australian dollar spent. If we eliminated the ABC, we could save the trouble of having an election. We could just ring up Coles and Woolworths and let them decide who they want to appoint as Prime Minister of Australia, because their powers would be so great and excessive. Debate interrupted. NA",156
221,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Clean Start: Fair Deal for Cleaners Campaign",156
222,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to speak about an important international issue. It relates to the campaign launched this month to protect those most vulnerable workers amongst us: those who clean up after us-the people who clean our toilets, mop our floors and hoover our offices. This is a good reminder to all members here, who have the privilege of working in one of the most spotless buildings in the country. I extend my sincere appreciation to those workers, many of whom are migrant women who have handled a variety of jobs around Canberra. I note there is an international push at the moment to improve the conditions for cleaners, which was also launched recently in cities across Australia and New Zealand. This campaign to improve the lot of cleaners is also being run in the Netherlands, the US and the UK. Earlier this month cleaners for Deutsche Bank in London were among thousands of workers that gathered at Westminster Cathedral to hear the leader of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Cormac MurphyO'Connor. Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor called for corporations to give these workers a fair go and give them back their dignity through the provision of a living wagesomething which is part of the debate in Australia at this point. The Deutsche Bank cleaners are seeking a minute percentage of the bank's record profit of $2.9 billion. A similar campaign in the US, Justice for Janitors, was also backed by religious leaders. The Australian launch of the campaign across our capital cities, appropriately called Clean Start, also included the support of church leaders, who joined Labor and union representatives at various rallies around tralia. The campaign in Australia is particularly timely given the impact of the government's harsh industrial relations laws on cleaners. The situation is so bad for these workers that many of them have to turn to charities just to survive. This is one of the reasons churches are so concerned, because looking after these people actually falls to charities and churches all too frequently. Let us stop for a moment to think why that is so, remembering what these workers do and the conditions they work under. Many of them rise before dawn or work late into the night after all the office workers have switched off their lights and have gone home at a reasonable hour. They have impossibly tight schedules, which makes it very difficult for them to complete the job properly. Their work is physically demanding. They vacuum, scrub, mop and clean up after people, such as all of us members of parliament. They have to bend down to clean dirty corners or reach up high to clean windows and ceilings. They have short-term contracts, which means they often work two jobs, rising early and working late into the night to make ends meet. They have to deal with chemicals and poor equipment. And for this they are paid a pittance. The federal minimum wage for cleaners is $13.77 per hour and permanent part-time cleaners stand to lose at least a quarter of their wages because of proposed cuts in penalty rates for early morning and evening work. Cleaners are our invisible army. They are rarely seen and rarely heard. This campaign gives them a voice against the largest corporations amongst us. Recently, for example, workers in 10 cities across Australia protested against AMP and their Capital Investors division which manages buildings on behalf of property owners. The contrast cannot be greater: the gleaming buildings of Aus- such corporate giants, polished and maintained by workers being paid below-poverty wages. Just think about the wages paid to cleaners cleaning the facilities owned and operated by Macquarie Bank, whose chief executive earns $58,000 per week compared to about $13.50 per hour for the cleaners. At the AMP owned Santos House cleaners have to clean toilets and kitchens, vacuum floors and remove rubbish on 14 levels in-guess what?-three hours. Sweated labour and harsh working conditions exist for these people. It is time these corporations got a heart. It is time they recognised those workers work hard to make sure they have clean, comfortable and decent work environments. In conclusion, I commend all those involved in the fight on behalf of cleaners, including the churches both here and abroad. Just because we rarely see them, we should not forget them. They are human beings who also have to meet their own financial commitments, often working much harder and in more difficult conditions than members of parliament. I commend the Clean Start campaign to Australia at large and especially to the big corporations who use up and abuse these decent, hard working men and women. Mrs Doreen Washington",156
223,Mrs BRONWYN BISHOP,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to add a contribution to a celebration that took place in my electorate today, being the 108th birthday of a constituent of mine, Mrs Doreen Washington. I first met Mrs Washington several years ago when she was just turning 104 and still living in her own apartment, looking after herself with the assistance of friends. A very sprightly, delightful lady she was and remains. Today she had a lovely party back in the electorate, and I would dearly love to have been there and to have celebrated with her. I thought I would mention the fact tonight that she is celebrating her 108th birthday and acknowledge that she is still lively and that she is still entertaining company-indeed, on ANZAC Day she tossed the first penny for the two-up game at one of my local RSLs. It is her indomitable spirit. When we look back at what she has been through in 108 years of living, as one of the last surviving Gallipoli war widows and as someone who has seen so many changes and is still able to discuss them, she is an important source of oral history for us all. She does have a lovely message that she gave today. The front page of my local newspaper, the Manly Daily, today has a photo of Doreen. It says at the top: ‘She eats no fruit or vegetables and she drinks every day-and she has outlived all her doctors'. I think it says something about a person who makes a decision about what is good for her. She still does, indeed, enjoy a tipple of whisky or a glass of beer and she invites people to enjoy it with her. I think when we look back at all the warnings that we receive, when we are told if we do this or that we will lessen our life expectancy, that we have to live by rules that somebody else sets down for us, we should remember that Doreen, in being 108, has set the rules for herself. She was widowed in 1965, so she has been very much on her own, living on her own wits and her own ability to make decisions, for a long time. I think there are some lessons for us as we listen, as I said, to all the gloom and doomsayers who tell us that this is bad for us and that is bad for us and that we have to be disciplined according to somebody else's dictates. Perhaps, if we listen to what our own body or our own self is telling us, we can work it out for ourselves and we do not have to be intimidated into living a life that perhaps does not suit us. Doreen will have gathered around her about 100 people today, people she has touched just by being who she is. One particular person has been a splendid friend to her: Mr Chris Pike, who visits her regularly and who always made sure she was all right when she was still living in her own apartment. She has another close friend, Fred Leong. They are both close friends, young men who have seen that here is a woman of indomitable spirit, whom, in their terms, they love to call a friend. Perhaps there is another message for us too. As we realise that we are an ageing population, we should rejoice in that. When we say the fact that there are many older people who are giving great joy to people and being vibrant parts of our community, and when we say we are an ageing population and people are living longer, that is a call for rejoicing. We should not call it a problem but say it is an opportunity. Doreen Washington is one who has taken many opportunities. May I simply say to her: have a wonderful birthday today. Avian Influenza",158
224,Mr RUDD,ADJOURNMENT,"Avian influenza is a significant national security threat to Australia and our region. Chicken populations in South-East Asia are large by global standards. There have already been a number of deaths in South-East Asia arising from avian flu, including most recently in Indonesia. That is why the opposition since March 2005 has campaigned consistently for the Howard government to implement a regional plan to combat avian influenza. The reason we have done this is that, up until time, preparedness on the Howard government's part for an avian influenza pandemic had primarily related to onshore measuresthat is, within Australia. And the problem with the avian influenza virus is that it respecter of national boundaries, as we have seen with the spread of the virus from Asia to Europe over the course of the last 12 months. Last September the opposition released a five-point regional plan to combat avian influenza, and following its release and earlier statements from the opposition on this important matter the government has slowly started to lift its game in its funding allocaelsewhere tions for regional preparedness-although it has to be said there is still much more to be done. Today the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry decided to weigh into this debate and claim that 400 words of what he described as a 600-word policy had been taken from international and other sources without citation. The opposition's policy document is in fact an 11,200-word document, running to 29 pages. The policy recommendations section of this document alone goes to 1,200 words. The minister has chosen to base his statement to parliament on selected extracts of this policy document which were separately prepared by the Labor eHerald. Even these selected extracts ran to 1,000 words. Furthermore, the Labor eHerald extract states specifically that the full 11,200-word document could be accessed as a PDF file. The full policy document, of course, has been in the public domain since its release. The policy document cites a range of domestic and international agencies including the Australian Biosecurity Cooperative Research Centre at Curtin University of Technology, the Centre for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of that Minnesota, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Regional Director of the World Health Organisation. In the preparation of is no the document, my office inadvertently neglected to insert citations in seven paragraphs of the 11,200-word documentparagraphs of an entirely descriptive nature referring to the scientific definition of the H5N1 virus, its historical impact on humans as well as the history of earlier flu pandemics. My staff have assured me that this was an inadvertent error, given that the document extensively cites the work of a range of international and domestic agencies. This contrasts with the agriculture minister's statement that this 11,200-word document contains no attributions. Significantly, the agriculture minister is totally silent about the document's actual policy recommendations-the whole point of a policy document in the first placebecause these are the recommendations which the government has sought to respond to in the debate which Labor has generated on this important matter of Australia's foreign policy and national security policy over the last 12 months or more. I am advised that in the period since September 2005 we have had a total of $122.3 million in Australian aid allocated to this important task and, as I said before, it is an area where more work still needs to be done. Finally, the agriculture minister failed to make any reference to the following rider, which is clearly inserted on page 3 of the policy document, which reads as follows: Although at the time of publication, Labor made all reasonable efforts to verify the information cited in this document, given the resource constraints facing the Opposition, Labor is unable to provide an absolute guarantee that it is free from errors, inaccuracies or omissions. Labor expressly disclaims liability for any errors, inaccuracies or omissions or any actions taken in reliance thereon. Labor is proud of the fact that we have been a significant contributor to the preparedness debate in relation to the H5N1 virus. There are still major gaps in regional preparedness: in surveillance strategies, diagnostic facilities, public health preparedness, veterinary health preparedness, public education, farming practices, vaccine and antiviral availability, contingency planning and administrative coordination. This should be a high priority for the Howard government in making Australia and the region maximally prepared for the terrible day that the H5N1 virus changes from animal-to-human transfer to human-tohuman transfer-the day that we face a pandemic with grave consequences for our nation. (Time expired) Braddon Electorate: Polyethylene Project",159
225,Mr BAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise this evening to inform the House of a great local company in my electorate of Braddon and an exciting project which could create as many as 20 new jobs. MES (TAS) Pty Ltd was established in north-west Tasmania as a supplier of mining equipment and supplies, particularly for mines on Tasmania's mineral-rich west coast. In recent years, the company has sought to manufacture its own products rather than importing all of its stock from interstate. Recently, MES decided to manufacture polyethylene pipe, while relocating the business to a new facility near Wynyard, west of Burnie, in north-west Tasmania. This company has invested significant funds into the introduction of new, specialised equipment that will make it possible to produce polyethylene pipe customised to order. I understand the company will be the first in Tasmania to be able to produce this pipe, for which there is a growing demand in our resurgent mining industry and also interstate. I am pleased to say that the Australian government is a major player in assisting this company to develop the project. Under the Sustainable Regions Program, the Australian government is providing a grant of some $165,000, including GST. This funding has given the company the confidence to install not one polyethylene production line, as originally planned, but two. While it was expected that the project would create seven new full-time jobs, now with two production lines soon to be installed it is hoped to create as many as 20 new jobs. The introduction of the polyethylene pipe production capability within Tasmania is also expected to assist to reduce costs for the local mining industry and provide better products in response to their needs. The company has also just opened an outlet interstate, at Bendigo. Importantly, the new capability will also enable MES to expand and diversify into supplying other industries, right across the board, including agriculture. Last week, I had the privilege of visiting the company and its production line. I was very impressed with the state-of-the-art equipment. When operational, the two new production lines will have the capability to produce varying widths, lengths and sizes of pipe, depending on what is needed by the customer. The driving forces behind this company, David and Kylie Kenworthy and their staff, are displaying through this project the confidence, ingenuity and vision that is needed to thrive in a regional business. For these types of individuals and companies to invest such large sums of money just demonstrates the confidence that is out there in regional Australia now. Under their direction, this company will continue to grow and prosper. It is a fine example of an innovative and successful business located in regional Australia. Up to $12 million was originally made available under the Sustainable Regions Program to support projects within the Cradle Coast region of north-west Tasmania that will provide long-term strategic benefits to the community. I understand that well over $11 million has been committed to myriad projects, with outstanding success. These projects are now reaping success, and they are developing employment, businesses and industries that will thrive well into the future. While at times those on the other side have criticised the Sustainable Regions Program and various other programs which provide direct assistance to regional Australia, we on this side are getting on with the job and helping people like David and Kylie Kenworthy to realise their vision and deliver new job opportunities in regional Australia. I must make special mention of the work of the tireless Cradle Coast Authority in supporting the regional program in north-west Tasmania. In particular, I would single out Roger Jaensch and Karen Hampton, who have worked with north-west companies on their submissions and advised the government on the allocation of funding. This is an independent authority that provides recommendations based on what projects would be the most successful. Their efforts are most appreciated. The coalition government's Sustainable Regions Program, with their help, is an outstanding success in regional Australia, and it will continue to deliver benefits, investment opportunities and employment in regional Australia. Indigenous Communities",160
226,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"On 18 January, Senator Chris Evans, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, as the shadow minister for Indigenous affairs, made the following comments in a media release. He did this following the release of the survey on child protection released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, a report that painted a grim picture of all children in protection but particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The findings showed that Indigenous children were vastly overrepresented. In this release, Senator Evans said: ‘While Labor acknowledges the sensitivity of these issues, this should never be used ... as a reason to justify inaction. ‘The abuse and neglect of any child is completely unacceptable. ‘Unfortunately, it seems clear that particular problems exist in Indigenous communities, and Labor is committed to working to identify ways forward to improve this situation. ‘This is not an Indigenous culture problem, it is a social problem that we need to try and overcome.' He concluded: ‘The report shows that there is [an] urgent need for coordinated national action involving Indigenous leadership to address these problems in the future.' Three weeks later, on 7 February, Minister Brough was installed as the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Four months later, after visiting different communities over a period between his appointment and now, Minister Brough has discovered the issue and put it on the agenda. I do not mind things like this being put on the agenda. I mind if it is done in a sensational way and then, that being done, it is done in the context of putting up simplistic solutions. I also object when ministers in this government-and this is yet another example-place on the national agenda a very important topic but will not come into this chamber, make a ministerial statement and allow that important topic to be debated. Question time is not the vehicle for that debate to be carried on. As I have said before,",161
227,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"and I hope that you understand, as other occupants of the chair have done, that this is not a reflection on the way the chair operates here-the rules of engagement of question time mean that it is an inappropriate way of floating problems and floating solutions. What we have seen over the last week is an inability for us to sit down in a calm, cool and collected way to discuss this in a bipartisan way, which is the only way of going forward. It is just too simplistic and knee to have the Acting Prime Minister talk about the measures that are necessary to target child abuse and family violence in Indigenous communities. The measures include additional policing, bringing offenders before courts and proper penalties. We agree that there is no cultural or other justification for offences, as the Acting Prime Minister said, but surely the government must see that there must be more in the efforts than simply the policing in the way that they have described. They do not even describe it in the context of community policing, actually having the police in the communities-not just putting the perps behind bars but assisting the victims and assisting the communities to tackle the problems. I hope that somewhere in all this discussion there is a broader agenda. But bring it in here, allow us to understand it and do not abuse us because we say there has to be more. We do not decry that an aspect of this has to do with putting police into the communities and ensuring that the victims can come forward. But do we talk about the increase in legal services to allow the victims to confidently come forward and offer them some protection through the judicial system? Do we look at the other aspects, the reasons that lead to this type of violence-the poverty, the dysfunction? These things have bases in things that have gone on for generations: the lack of employment, the lack of education, the appalling health, the appalling housing. We can go forward together to achieve in a bipartisan way in this place, with the state and territory governments, and importantly with the communities and Indigenous people themselves. (Time expired) Mr Tom Quinn OAM",162
228,Mr NEVILLE,ADJOURNMENT,"Hinkler) (7.54 pm)Tonight I would like to pay tribute to a local Bundaberg man: Tom Quinn. Tom is a man for all seasons, literally. He took early rejerk tirement from his accountancy profession and Qantas in 1978 and made the move to Bundaberg from Sydney. But I think retirement was the last thing on his mind. On arriving in Bundaberg he took on an aviation consultancy role and lectured at the Bundaberg College of TAFE and Bundaberg's CQU campus. He became the first CEO of BACAS, our group apprenticeship scheme, which he ran for 14 years. He also held the positions of state and federal president of Group Training Australia at various times. Towards the end of this period Tom enrolled at the University of New England and graduated in law in 2001. After completing his professional year in Brisbane, with all the young bucks of the profession, he was admitted to the bar in November 2003 at the age of 75. Since then he has undertaken more than 400 pro bono cases for people unable to obtain legal aid. A colleague recently estimated the notional value of his contribution to the law as being in vicinity of $1.2 million. To undertake a third career in one's 70s quite exceptional, and what Tom has done for the most deprived people, who could never have had their day in court, is a generrange ous and crowning glory to an already distinguished career. He received a number of honours, but two of the most outstanding were a Masters of Business from the Central Queensland University in 1995 and the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1997. Tom has made two other exceptional contributions in his plethora of community involvements. Along with engineer Lex Rowland and I, Tom helped set up the rescue of Bert Hinkler's Southampton home from the UK in 1982. At the time the house was marked for demolition. After some intensive fundraising and a lot of hard work by the Bundaberg East Rotary Club and Bundaberg's construction sector, the house was dismantled brick by brick, transported to Australia in two 20-tonne containers and rebuilt in the Bundaberg Botanic Gardens. It was opened by Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen in 1984 on the day he was knighted. The house is now the centrepiece of Bundaberg's Botanic Gardens and has seen more than 400,000 visitors. The vision will soon be completed by the Hinkler Hall of Aviation, to which the Commonwealth government has contributed $4.5 million. The other significant event in Tom's life was the development of a community centre named in his honour. In 2000 he floated the idea of restoring a derelict waste management building and transforming it into a centre for young people with ADD. His plan blossomed well beyond that and a range of services, business houses and Work for the Dole programs have since helped restore the building to its original finery. It now houses a range of community services focusing on the deprived and disengaged youth, and others serving community service orders, and peois ple in need of training. The centre contains a furniture restoration shop, a bicycle construction business, a training kitchen and a of counselling and skills programs. It was opened in November 2002 and was named in Tom's honour. It is a beacon of hope for some of our town's most deprived. Last week business representatives, Salvation Army leaders and many of the centre's clients gathered not only to launch the Red Shield Appeal at the centre but to honour Tom, whose Archibald portrait by Ann Grocott was unveiled locally and presented to the centre. It will hang in the centre as a mark of respect for the amazing amount of work that Tom has done in our community. I met some lawyers at the function who are going to take over Tom's work. Tom is now reaching the time when he must go into his third retirement. It is only fitting, when someone has made such a huge contribution and has been so honoured by his colleagues, his peers and the Salvation Army community that he serves, that we in this parliament should acknowledge him also.

229,Ms CORCORAN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to pay tribute to Eileen Goss. Eileen was born Eileen Ryan on 5 March 1919 in East Brunswick. She died on 4 March 2006, just short of her 87th birthday. She was a longtime member of the Mentone branch of the ALP, joining early in the 1970s. She attended meetings until just a few years ago. Ellie, as she was often known, held branch meetings in her lounge room in Mentone for many years before the meetings moved to other premises. Ellie held the positions of treasurer and secretary at various stages. Ellie's daughter Sue Waltho and son-in-law Peter are also proud members of Mentone ALP and tell many stories of Ellie embarrassing them at local fundraisers. For her funeral Sue wrote a poem for her mother: I speak your name with love and pride I smile through the tears that I cannot hide A special person you have been The greatest Mum the world has seen. A special smile, a special face And in my heart a special place The gates of heaven have opened wide A lovely lady has stepped inside.",163

So for all of those reasons, this in particular, the steps that we need to take as the 2006-07 budget, it is useful to look to see whether those forecasts have come true or have a look at my own speech on the budget at NA around this time last year to see what the predictions true. At that time, I warned of a $103 billion Howard government prior to the last election, compounded after the election. I expressed concern at that time that this point where ‘the Reserve Bank will have no choice happened. The Reserve Bank judged that it had had not been for the very large increases in not so long after the previous budget, then the just before this budget-would have been a second were to count the interest rate rise in March been a third one.
